Preface

Welcome to Psychology 2e, an OpenStax resource. This textbook was written to increase student access to
high-quality learning materials, maintaining highest standards of academic rigor at little to no cost.

About OpenStax

OpenStax is a nonprofit based at Rice University, and it's our mission to improve student access to education.
Our first openly licensed college textbook was published in 2012, and our library has since scaled to over 35
books for college and AP® courses used by hundreds of thousands of students. OpenStax Tutor, our low-cost
personalized learning tool, is being piloted in college courses throughout the country. Through our
partnerships with philanthropic foundations and our alliance with other educational resource organizations,
OpenStax is breaking down the most common barriers to learning and empowering students and instructors
to succeed.

About Psychology 2e

Psychology 2e is designed to meet scope and sequence requirements for the single-semester introduction to
psychology course. The book offers a comprehensive treatment of core concepts, grounded in both classic
2 Preface

    studies and current and emerging research. The text also includes coverage of the DSM-5 in examinations of
    psychological disorders. Psychology 2e incorporates discussions that reflect the diversity within the discipline,
    as well as the diversity of cultures and communities across the globe.

    Coverage and scope

    The first edition of Psychology has been used by thousands of faculty and hundreds of thousands of students
    since its publication in 2015. OpenStax mined our adopters' extensive and helpful feedback to identify the
    most significant revision needs while maintaining the organization that many instructors had incorporated
    into their courses. Specific surveys, pre-revision reviews, and customization analysis, as well as analytical data
    from OpenStax partners and online learning environments, all aided in planning the revision.

    The result is a book that thoroughly treats psychology's foundational concepts while adding current and
    meaningful coverage in specific areas. Psychology 2e retains its manageable scope and contains ample
    features to draw learners into the discipline.

    Structurally, the textbook remains similar to the first edition, with no chapter reorganization and very targeted
    changes at the section level.

   Changes to the Second Edition

    OpenStax only undertakes second editions when significant modifications to the text are necessary. In the case
    of Psychology 2e, user feedback indicated that we needed to focus on a few key areas, which we have done in
    the following ways.

    Content revisions for clarity, accuracy, and currency

    The revision plan varied by chapter based on need. Some chapters were significantly updated for conceptual
    coverage, research-informed data, and clearer language. In other chapters, the revisions focused mostly on
    currency of examples and updates to statistics.

    Over 210 new research references have been added or updated in order to improve the scholarly
    underpinnings of the material and broaden the perspective for students. Dozens of examples and feature
    boxes have been changed or added to better explain concepts and/or increase relevance for students.

    Research replication and validity

    To engage students in stronger critical analysis and inform them about research reproducibility, substantial
    coverage has been added to the research chapter and strategically throughout the textbook whenever key

studies are discussed. This material is presented in a balanced way and provides instructors with ample
opportunity to discuss the importance of replication in a manner that best suits their course.

Diversity, representation, and inclusion

With the help of researchers and teachers who focus on diversity- and identity-related issues, OpenStax has
engaged in detailed diversity reviews to identify opportunities to improve the textbook. Reviewers were asked
to follow a framework to evaluate the book's terminology, research citations, key contributors to the field,
photos and illustrations, and related aspects, commenting on the representation and consideration of diverse
groups. Significant additions and revisions were made in this regard, and the review framework itself is
available among the OpenStax Psychology 2e instructor resources.

Art and illustrations

Under the guidance of the authors and expert scientific illustrators, especially those well versed in creating
accessible art, the OpenStax team made changes throughout the art program in Psychology 2e.

Accessibility improvements

As with all OpenStax books, the first edition of Psychology was created with a focus on accessibility. We have
emphasized and improved that approach in the second edition. Our goal is to ensure that all OpenStax
websites and the web view versions of our learning materials follow accessible web design best practices, so
that they will meet the W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 at Level AA and Section 508
of the Rehabilitation Act. The WCAG 2.0 guidelines explain ways to make web content more accessible for
people with disabilities and more user-friendly for everyone.

  · To accommodate users of specific assistive technologies, all alternative text was reviewed and revised for
      comprehensiveness and clarity.

  · All illustrations were revised to improve the color contrast, which is important for some visually impaired
      students.

  · Overall, the OpenStax platform has been continually upgraded to improve accessibility.

To learn more about our commitment and progress, please view our accessibility statement
(https://openstax.org/accessibility-statement).

A transition guide will be available on openstax.org to highlight the specific chapter-level changes to the
second edition.

Pedagogical foundation

Psychology 2e engages students through inquiry, self-reflection, and investigation. Features in the second
edition have been carefully updated to remain topical and relevant while deepening students' relationship to
the material. They include the following:

  · Everyday Connection features tie psychological topics to everyday issues and behaviors that students
      encounter in their lives and the world. Topics include the validity of scores on college entrance exams, the
      opioid crisis, the impact of social status on stress and healthcare, and cognitive mapping.

  · What Do You Think? features provide research-based information and ask students their views on
      controversial issues. Topics include "Brain Dead and on Life Support," "Violent Media and Aggression,"
      and "Capital Punishment and Criminals with Intellectual Disabilities."

  · Dig Deeper features discuss one specific aspect of a topic in greater depth so students can dig more
      deeply into the concept. Examples include discussions on the distinction between evolutionary
      psychology and behavioral genetics, recent findings on neuroplasticity, the field of forensic psychology,
      and a presentation of research on strategies for coping with prejudice and discrimination.

  · Connect the Concepts features revisit a concept learned in another chapter, expanding upon it within a
      different context. Features include "Emotional Expression and Emotional Regulation," "Tweens, Teens,
4 Preface

          and Social Norms," and "Conditioning and OCD."
    Art, interactives, and assessments that engage

    Our art program is designed to enhance students' understanding of psychological concepts through simple,
    effective graphs, diagrams, and photographs. Psychology 2e also incorporates links to relevant interactive
    exercises and animations that help bring topics to life. Selected assessment items touch directly on students'
    lives.

      · Link to Learning features direct students to online interactive exercises and animations that add a fuller
          context to core content and provide an opportunity for application.

      · Personal Application Questions engage students in topics at a personal level to encourage reflection and
          promote discussion.

   Additional Resources

    Student and Instructor Resources

    We've compiled additional resources for both students and instructors, including Getting Started Guides, an
    instructor solution guide, a test bank, and PowerPoint slides. Instructor resources require a verified instructor
    account, which you can apply for when you log in or create your account on openstax.org. Take advantage of
    these resources to supplement your OpenStax book.
    Community Hubs

    OpenStax partners with the Institute for the Study of Knowledge Management in Education (ISKME) to offer
    Community Hubs on OER Commons--a platform for instructors to share community-created resources that
    support OpenStax books, free of charge. Through our Community Hubs, instructors can upload their own
    materials or download resources to use in their own courses, including additional ancillaries, teaching
    material, multimedia, and relevant course content. We encourage instructors to join the hubs for the subjects
    most relevant to your teaching and research as an opportunity both to enrich your courses and to engage with
    other faculty.

    To reach the Community Hubs, visit www.oercommons.org/hubs/openstax.

INTRODUCTION Clive Wearing is an accomplished musician who lost his ability to form new memories when
he became sick at the age of 46. While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember
what he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is
associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend's name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John
Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would
tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended
for him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash
was diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O'Connor & Robertson,
8 1 · Introduction to Psychology

    2002). Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these
    experiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain's internal
    processes and people's external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of
    psychology has explored these questions.

   1.1 What Is Psychology?

    LEARNING OBJECTIVES
    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

      · Define psychology
      · Understand the merits of an education in psychology

    What is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology
    explores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists
    use the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question
    about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the
    phenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or
    group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over
    time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes
    observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then
    published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.

    Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because
    it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We
    must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However,
    we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus,
    psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.

    In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot
    arrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the
    mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific
    method is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on
    observation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or
    previous authorities.

    It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this
    time, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is,
    at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological
    organism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore,
    psychology is also a social science.

   WHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?

    Often, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to
    learn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course
    because it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as
    nursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare
    psychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses
    across the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology
    majors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook's creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality
    and political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About
    6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S.
    Department of Education, 2016).

An education in psychology is valuable for a number of reasons. Psychology students hone critical thinking
skills and are trained in the use of the scientific method. Critical thinking is the active application of a set of
skills to information for the understanding and evaluation of that information. The evaluation of
information--assessing its reliability and usefulness-- is an important skill in a world full of competing "facts,"
many of which are designed to be misleading. For example, critical thinking involves maintaining an attitude
of skepticism, recognizing internal biases, making use of logical thinking, asking appropriate questions, and
making observations. Psychology students also can develop better communication skills during the course of
their undergraduate coursework (American Psychological Association, 2011). Together, these factors increase
students' scientific literacy and prepare students to critically evaluate the various sources of information they
encounter.

In addition to these broad-based skills, psychology students come to understand the complex factors that
shape one's behavior. They appreciate the interaction of our biology, our environment, and our experiences in
determining who we are and how we will behave. They learn about basic principles that guide how we think
and behave, and they come to recognize the tremendous diversity that exists across individuals and across
cultural boundaries (American Psychological Association, 2011).

1.2 History of Psychology

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Understand the importance of Wundt and James in the development of psychology
  · Appreciate Freud's influence on psychology
  · Understand the basic tenets of Gestalt psychology
  · Appreciate the important role that behaviorism played in psychology's history
  · Understand basic tenets of humanism
  · Understand how the cognitive revolution shifted psychology's focus back to the mind

Psychology is a relatively young science with its experimental roots in the 19th century, compared, for
example, to human physiology, which dates much earlier. As mentioned, anyone interested in exploring issues
related to the mind generally did so in a philosophical context prior to the 19th century. Two 19th century
scholars, Wilhelm Wundt and William James, are generally credited as being the founders of psychology as a
science and academic discipline that was distinct from philosophy. This section will provide an overview of the
shifts in paradigms that have influenced psychology from Wundt and James through today.

Wundt and Structuralism

Wilhelm Wundt (1832-1920) was a German scientist who was the first person to be referred to as a
psychologist. His famous book entitled Principles of Physiological Psychology was published in 1873. Wundt
viewed psychology as a scientific study of conscious experience, and he believed that the goal of psychology
was to identify components of consciousness and how those components combined to result in our conscious
experience. Wundt used introspection (he called it "internal perception"), a process by which someone
examines their own conscious experience as objectively as possible, making the human mind like any other
aspect of nature that a scientist observed. He believed in the notion of voluntarism--that people have free will
and should know the intentions of a psychological experiment if they were participating (Danziger, 1980).
Wundt considered his version experimental introspection; he used instruments such as those that measured
reaction time. He also wrote Volkerpsychologie in 1904 in which he suggested that psychology should include
the study of culture, as it involves the study of people. Edward Titchener, one of his students, went on to
10 1 · Introduction to Psychology

      develop structuralism. Its focus was on the contents of mental processes rather than their function (Pickren &
      Rutherford, 2010). Wundt established his psychology laboratory at the University at Leipzig in 1879 (Figure
      1.2). In this laboratory, Wundt and his students conducted experiments on, for example, reaction times. A
      subject, sometimes in a room isolated from the scientist, would receive a stimulus such as a light, image, or
      sound. The subject's reaction to the stimulus would be to push a button, and an apparatus would record the
      time to reaction. Wundt could measure reaction time to one-thousandth of a second (Nicolas & Ferrand, 1999).

      FIGURE 1.2 (a) Wilhelm Wundt is credited as one of the founders of psychology. He created the first laboratory for
      psychological research. (b) This photo shows him seated and surrounded by fellow researchers and equipment in
      his laboratory in Germany.
      However, despite his efforts to train individuals in the process of introspection, this process remained highly
      subjective, and there was very little agreement between individuals.

     Functionalism

      William James, John Dewey, and Charles Sanders Peirce helped establish functional psychology (Figure 1.3).
      They accepted Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection and viewed this theory as an explanation of an
      organism's characteristics. Key to that theory is the idea that natural selection leads to organisms that are
      adapted to their environment, including their behavior. Adaptation means that a trait of an organism has a
      function for the survival and reproduction of the individual, because it has been naturally selected. As James
      saw it, psychology's purpose was to study the function of behavior in the world, and as such, his perspective
      was known as functionalism. Functionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into its
      environment. Functionalism has a second, more subtle meaning in that functionalists were more interested in
      the operation of the whole mind rather than of its individual parts, which were the focus of structuralism. Like
      Wundt, James believed that introspection could serve as one means by which someone might study mental
      activities, but James also relied on more objective measures, including the use of various recording devices,
      and examinations of concrete products of mental activities and of anatomy and physiology (Gordon, 1995).

              FIGURE 1.3 William James, shown here in a self-portrait, was the first American psychologist.

Freud and Psychoanalytic Theory

Perhaps one of the most influential and well-known figures in psychology's history was Sigmund Freud (Figure
1.4). Freud (1856-1939) was an Austrian neurologist who was fascinated by patients suffering from "hysteria"
and neurosis. Hysteria was an ancient diagnosis for disorders, primarily of women with a wide variety of
symptoms, including physical symptoms and emotional disturbances, none of which had an apparent physical
cause. Freud theorized that many of his patients' problems arose from the unconscious mind. In Freud's view,
the unconscious mind was a repository of feelings and urges of which we have no awareness. Gaining access to
the unconscious, then, was crucial to the successful resolution of the patient's problems. According to Freud,
the unconscious mind could be accessed through dream analysis, by examinations of the first words that came
to people's minds, and through seemingly innocent slips of the tongue. Psychoanalytic theory focuses on the
role of a person's unconscious, as well as early childhood experiences, and this particular perspective
dominated clinical psychology for several decades (Thorne & Henley, 2005).

FIGURE 1.4 (a) Sigmund Freud was a highly influential figure in the history of psychology. (b) One of his many
books, A General Introduction to Psychoanalysis, shared his ideas about psychoanalytical therapy; it was published
in 1922.
Freud's ideas were influential, and you will learn more about them when you study lifespan development,
personality, and therapy. For instance, many therapists believe strongly in the unconscious and the impact of
12 1 · Introduction to Psychology

      early childhood experiences on the rest of a person's life. The method of psychoanalysis, which involves the
      patient talking about their experiences and selves, while not invented by Freud, was certainly popularized by
      him and is still used today. Many of Freud's other ideas, however, are controversial. Drew Westen (1998) argues
      that many of the criticisms of Freud's ideas are misplaced, in that they attack his older ideas without taking
      into account later writings. Westen also argues that critics fail to consider the success of the broad ideas that
      Freud introduced or developed, such as the importance of childhood experiences in adult motivations, the role
      of unconscious versus conscious motivations in driving our behavior, the fact that motivations can cause
      conflicts that affect behavior, the effects of mental representations of ourselves and others in guiding our
      interactions, and the development of personality over time. Westen identifies subsequent research support for
      all of these ideas.

      More modern iterations of Freud's clinical approach have been empirically demonstrated to be effective (Knekt
      et al., 2008; Shedler, 2010). Some current practices in psychotherapy involve examining unconscious aspects
      of the self and relationships, often through the relationship between the therapist and the client. Freud's
      historical significance and contributions to clinical practice merit his inclusion in a discussion of the historical
      movements within psychology.

     Wertheimer, Koffka, Köhler, and Gestalt Psychology

      Max Wertheimer (1880-1943), Kurt Koffka (1886-1941), and Wolfgang Köhler (1887-1967) were three
      German psychologists who immigrated to the United States in the early 20th century to escape Nazi Germany.
      These scholars are credited with introducing psychologists in the United States to various Gestalt principles.
      The word Gestalt roughly translates to "whole;" a major emphasis of Gestalt psychology deals with the fact that
      although a sensory experience can be broken down into individual parts, how those parts relate to each other
      as a whole is often what the individual responds to in perception. For example, a song may be made up of
      individual notes played by different instruments, but the real nature of the song is perceived in the
      combinations of these notes as they form the melody, rhythm, and harmony. In many ways, this particular
      perspective would have directly contradicted Wundt's ideas of structuralism (Thorne & Henley, 2005).

      Unfortunately, in moving to the United States, these scientists were forced to abandon much of their work and
      were unable to continue to conduct research on a large scale. These factors along with the rise of behaviorism
      (described next) in the United States prevented principles of Gestalt psychology from being as influential in
      the United States as they had been in their native Germany (Thorne & Henley, 2005). Despite these issues,
      several Gestalt principles are still very influential today. Considering the human individual as a whole rather
      than as a sum of individually measured parts became an important foundation in humanistic theory late in the
      century. The ideas of Gestalt have continued to influence research on sensation and perception.

      Structuralism, Freud, and the Gestalt psychologists were all concerned in one way or another with describing
      and understanding inner experience. But other researchers had concerns that inner experience could be a
      legitimate subject of scientific inquiry and chose instead to exclusively study behavior, the objectively
      observable outcome of mental processes.

     Pavlov, Watson, Skinner, and Behaviorism

      Early work in the field of behavior was conducted by the Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov (1849-1936). Pavlov
      studied a form of learning behavior called a conditioned reflex, in which an animal or human produced a
      reflex (unconscious) response to a stimulus and, over time, was conditioned to produce the response to a
      different stimulus that the experimenter associated with the original stimulus. The reflex Pavlov worked with
      was salivation in response to the presence of food. The salivation reflex could be elicited using a second
      stimulus, such as a specific sound, that was presented in association with the initial food stimulus several
      times. Once the response to the second stimulus was "learned," the food stimulus could be omitted. Pavlov's
      "classical conditioning" is only one form of learning behavior studied by behaviorists.

      John B. Watson (1878-1958) was an influential American psychologist whose most famous work occurred

                                                                                                                                                       1.2 · History of Psychology 13

during the early 20th century at Johns Hopkins University (Figure 1.5). While Wundt and James were
concerned with understanding conscious experience, Watson thought that the study of consciousness was
flawed. Because he believed that objective analysis of the mind was impossible, Watson preferred to focus
directly on observable behavior and try to bring that behavior under control. Watson was a major proponent of
shifting the focus of psychology from the mind to behavior, and this approach of observing and controlling
behavior came to be known as behaviorism. A major object of study by behaviorists was learned behavior and
its interaction with inborn qualities of the organism. Behaviorism commonly used animals in experiments
under the assumption that what was learned using animal models could, to some degree, be applied to human
behavior. Indeed, Tolman (1938) stated, "I believe that everything important in psychology (except ... such
matters as involve society and words) can be investigated in essence through the continued experimental and
theoretical analysis of the determiners of rat behavior at a choice-point in a maze."

                    FIGURE 1.5 John B. Watson is known as the father of behaviorism within psychology.
Behaviorism dominated experimental psychology for several decades, and its influence can still be felt today
(Thorne & Henley, 2005). Behaviorism is largely responsible for establishing psychology as a scientific
discipline through its objective methods and especially experimentation. In addition, it is used in behavioral
and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Behavior modification is commonly used in classroom settings. Behaviorism
has also led to research on environmental influences on human behavior.
B. F. Skinner (1904-1990) was an American psychologist (Figure 1.6). Like Watson, Skinner was a behaviorist,
and he concentrated on how behavior was affected by its consequences. Therefore, Skinner spoke of
reinforcement and punishment as major factors in driving behavior. As a part of his research, Skinner
developed a chamber that allowed the careful study of the principles of modifying behavior through
reinforcement and punishment. This device, known as an operant conditioning chamber (or more familiarly, a
Skinner box), has remained a crucial resource for researchers studying behavior (Thorne & Henley, 2005).

FIGURE 1.6 (a) B. F. Skinner is famous for his research on operant conditioning. (b) Modified versions of the operant
conditioning chamber, or Skinner box, are still widely used in research settings today. (credit a: modification of work

14 1 · Introduction to Psychology

      The Skinner box is a chamber that isolates the subject from the external environment and has a behavior
      indicator such as a lever or a button. When the animal pushes the button or lever, the box is able to deliver a
      positive reinforcement of the behavior (such as food) or a punishment (such as a noise).
      Skinner's focus on positive and negative reinforcement of learned behaviors had a lasting influence in
      psychology that has waned somewhat since the growth of research in cognitive psychology. Despite this,
      conditioned learning is still used in human behavioral modification (Greengrass, 2004).

     Maslow, Rogers, and Humanism

      During the early 20th century, American psychology was dominated by behaviorism and psychoanalysis.
      However, some psychologists were uncomfortable with what they viewed as limited perspectives being so
      influential to the field. They objected to the pessimism and determinism (all actions driven by the
      unconscious) of Freud. They also disliked the reductionism, or simplifying nature, of behaviorism.
      Behaviorism is also deterministic at its core, because it sees human behavior as entirely determined by a
      combination of genetics and environment. Some psychologists began to form their own ideas that emphasized
      personal control, intentionality, and a true predisposition for "good" as important for our self-concept and our
      behavior. Thus, humanism emerged. Humanism is a perspective within psychology that emphasizes the
      potential for good that is innate to all humans. Two of the most well-known proponents of humanistic
      psychology are Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers (O'Hara, n.d.).
      Abraham Maslow (1908-1970) was an American psychologist who is best known for proposing a hierarchy of
      human needs in motivating behavior (Figure 1.7). Although this concept will be discussed in more detail in a
      later chapter, a brief overview will be provided here. Maslow asserted that so long as basic needs necessary for
      survival were met (e.g., food, water, shelter), higher-level needs (e.g., social needs) would begin to motivate
      behavior. According to Maslow, the highest-level needs relate to self-actualization, a process by which we
      achieve our full potential. Obviously, the focus on the positive aspects of human nature that are characteristic
      of the humanistic perspective is evident (Thorne & Henley, 2005). Humanistic psychologists rejected, on
      principle, the research approach based on reductionist experimentation in the tradition of the physical and
      biological sciences, because it missed the "whole" human being. Beginning with Maslow and Rogers, there was
      an insistence on a humanistic research program. This program has been largely qualitative (not
      measurement-based), but there exist a number of quantitative research strains within humanistic psychology,
      including research on happiness, self-concept, meditation, and the outcomes of humanistic psychotherapy
      (Friedman, 2008).

                                            FIGURE 1.7 Maslow's hierarchy of needs is shown.
Carl Rogers (1902-1987) was also an American psychologist who, like Maslow, emphasized the potential for
good that exists within all people (Figure 1.8). Rogers used a therapeutic technique known as client-centered
therapy in helping his clients deal with problematic issues that resulted in their seeking psychotherapy. Unlike
a psychoanalytic approach in which the therapist plays an important role in interpreting what conscious
behavior reveals about the unconscious mind, client-centered therapy involves the patient taking a lead role in
the therapy session. Rogers believed that a therapist needed to display three features to maximize the
effectiveness of this particular approach: unconditional positive regard, genuineness, and empathy.
Unconditional positive regard refers to the fact that the therapist accepts their client for who they are, no
matter what they might say. Provided these factors, Rogers believed that people were more than capable of
dealing with and working through their own issues (Thorne & Henley, 2005).

FIGURE 1.8 Carl Rogers, shown in this portrait, developed a client-centered therapy method that has been
influential in clinical settings. (credit: "Didius"/Wikimedia Commons)
Humanism has been influential to psychology as a whole. Both Maslow and Rogers are well-known names
among students of psychology (you will read more about both later in this text), and their ideas have influenced
many scholars. Furthermore, Rogers' client-centered approach to therapy is still commonly used in
psychotherapeutic settings today (O'hara, n.d.)

     The Cognitive Revolution

      Behaviorism's emphasis on objectivity and focus on external behavior had pulled psychologists' attention away
      from the mind for a prolonged period of time. The early work of the humanistic psychologists redirected
      attention to the individual human as a whole, and as a conscious and self-aware being. By the 1950s, new
      disciplinary perspectives in linguistics, neuroscience, and computer science were emerging, and these areas
      revived interest in the mind as a focus of scientific inquiry. This particular perspective has come to be known
     as the cognitive revolution (Miller, 2003). By 1967, Ulric Neisser published the first textbook entitled Cognitive
     Psychology, which served as a core text in cognitive psychology courses around the country (Thorne & Henley,
      2005).
      Although no one person is entirely responsible for starting the cognitive revolution, Noam Chomsky was very
      influential in the early days of this movement (Figure 1.9). Chomsky (1928-), an American linguist, was
      dissatisfied with the influence that behaviorism had had on psychology. He believed that psychology's focus on
      behavior was short-sighted and that the field had to re-incorporate mental functioning into its purview if it
      were to offer any meaningful contributions to understanding behavior (Miller, 2003).

      FIGURE 1.9 Noam Chomsky was very influential in beginning the cognitive revolution. In 2010, this mural honoring
      him was put up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (credit: Robert Moran)
      European psychology had never really been as influenced by behaviorism as had American psychology; and
      thus, the cognitive revolution helped reestablish lines of communication between European psychologists and
      their American counterparts. Furthermore, psychologists began to cooperate with scientists in other fields,
      like anthropology, linguistics, computer science, and neuroscience, among others. This interdisciplinary
      approach often was referred to as the cognitive sciences, and the influence and prominence of this particular
      perspective resonates in modern-day psychology (Miller, 2003).

                                                                                                                  DIG DEEPER

      Feminist Psychology

        The science of psychology has had an impact on human wellbeing, both positive and negative. The dominant
        influence of Western, White, and male academics in the early history of psychology meant that psychology
        developed with the biases inherent in those individuals, which often had negative consequences for members of
        society who were not White or male. Women, members of ethnic minorities in both the United States and other
        countries, and individuals with sexual orientations other than straight had difficulties entering the field of
        psychology and therefore influencing its development. They also suffered from the attitudes of White male
        psychologists who were not immune to the nonscientific attitudes prevalent in the society in which they

  developed and worked. Until the 1960s, the science of psychology was largely a "womanless" psychology
  (Crawford & Marecek, 1989), meaning that few women were able to practice psychology, so they had little
  influence on what was studied. In addition, the experimental subjects of psychology were mostly men, which
  resulted from underlying assumptions that gender had no influence on psychology and that women were not of
  sufficient interest to study.

  An article by Naomi Weisstein, first published in 1968 (Weisstein, 1993), stimulated a feminist revolution in
  psychology by presenting a critique of psychology as a science. She also specifically criticized male psychologists
  for constructing the psychology of women entirely out of their own cultural biases and without careful
  experimental tests to verify any of their characterizations of women. Weisstein used, as examples, statements by
  prominent psychologists in the 1960s, such as this quote by Bruno Bettleheim: "We must start with the
  realization that, as much as women want to be good scientists or engineers, they want first and foremost to be
  womanly companions of men and to be mothers." Weisstein's critique formed the foundation for the subsequent
  development of a feminist psychology that attempted to be free of the influence of male cultural biases on our
  knowledge of the psychology of women.

  Crawford & Marecek (1989) identify several feminist approaches to psychology that can be described as feminist
  psychology. These include re-evaluating and discovering the contributions of women to the history of psychology,
  studying psychological gender differences, and questioning the male bias present across the practice of the
  scientific approach to knowledge.

Multicultural And Cross-Cultural Psychology

Culture impacts individuals, groups, and society. An ongoing issue researchers are trying to correct is that
certain populations have been over-studied and the results of these studies have been applied to other
populations. For example, Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan discuss how WEIRD societies have been
overstudied and the results have been wrongly applied to non-WEIRD societies (2010). WEIRD stands for
western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic. Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan found that there are
many differences between people in the WEIRD group and people in less industrialized, less urban, and non-
Western societies. These differences occur in a variety of areas, including perception, cooperation, and moral
reasoning. That is, people vary depending on their culture and environment. Multicultural psychologists
develop theories and conduct research with diverse populations, typically within one country. Cross-cultural
psychologists compare populations across countries, such as participants from the United States compared to
participants from China.

In 1920, Francis Cecil Sumner was the first African American to receive a PhD in psychology in the United
States. Sumner established a psychology degree program at Howard University, leading to the education of a
new generation of African American psychologists (Black, Spence, and Omari, 2004). Much of the work of early
psychologists from diverse backgrounds was dedicated to challenging intelligence testing and promoting
innovative educational methods for children. George I. Sanchez contested such testing with Mexican American
children. As a psychologist of Mexican heritage, he pointed out that the language and cultural barriers in
testing were keeping children from equal opportunities (Guthrie, 1998). By 1940, he was teaching with his
doctoral degree at University of Texas at Austin and challenging segregated educational practices (Romo,
1986).

Two famous African American researchers and psychologists are Mamie Phipps Clark and her husband,
Kenneth Clark. They are best known for their studies conducted on African American children and doll
preference, research that was instrumental in the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court desegregation
case. The Clarks applied their research to social services and opened the first child guidance center in Harlem
(American Psychological Association, 2019).

      The American Psychological Association has several ethnically based organizations for professional
      psychologists that facilitate interactions among members. Since psychologists belonging to specific ethnic
      groups or cultures have the most interest in studying the psychology of their communities, these organizations
      provide an opportunity for the growth of research on the interplay between culture and psychology.

     WOMEN IN PSYCHOLOGY

      Although rarely given credit, women have been contributing to psychology since its inception as a field of
      study. In 1894, Margaret Floy Washburn was the first woman awarded the doctoral degree in psychology. She
     wrote The Animal Mind: A Textbook of Comparative Psychology, and it was the standard in the field for over 20
      years. In the mid 1890s, Mary Whiton Calkins completed all requirements toward the PhD in psychology, but
      Harvard University refused to award her that degree because she was a woman. She had been taught and
      mentored by William James, who tried and failed to convince Harvard to award her the doctoral degree. Her
      memory research studied primacy and recency (Madigan & O'Hara, 1992), and she also wrote about how
      structuralism and functionalism both explained self-psychology (Calkins, 1906).

      Another influential woman, Mary Cover Jones, conducted a study she considered to be a sequel to John B.
      Watson's study of Little Albert (you'll learn about this study in the chapter on Learning). Jones unconditioned
      fear in Little Peter, who had been afraid of rabbits (Jones, 1924).

      Ethnic minority women contributing to the field of psychology include Martha Bernal and Inez Beverly Prosser;
      their studies were related to education. Bernal, the first Latina to earn her doctoral degree in psychology
      (1962) conducted much of her research with Mexican American children. Prosser was the first African
      American woman awarded the PhD in 1933 at the University of Cincinnati (Benjamin, Henry, & McMahon,
      2005).

    1.3 Contemporary Psychology

      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Appreciate the diversity of interests and foci within psychology
        · Understand basic interests and applications in each of the described areas of psychology
        · Demonstrate familiarity with some of the major concepts or important figures in each of the described areas of

            psychology

      Contemporary psychology is a diverse field that is influenced by all of the historical perspectives described in
      the preceding section. Reflective of the discipline's diversity is the diversity seen within the American
      Psychological Association (APA). The APA is a professional organization representing psychologists in the
      United States. The APA is the largest organization of psychologists in the world, and its mission is to advance
      and disseminate psychological knowledge for the betterment of people. There are 54 divisions within the APA,
      representing a wide variety of specialties that range from Societies for the Psychology of Religion and
      Spirituality to Exercise and Sport Psychology to Behavioral Neuroscience and Comparative Psychology.
      Reflecting the diversity of the field of psychology itself, members, affiliate members, and associate members
      span the spectrum from students to doctoral-level psychologists, and come from a variety of places including
      educational settings, criminal justice, hospitals, the armed forces, and industry (American Psychological
      Association, 2014). G. Stanley Hall was the first president of the APA. Before he earned his doctoral degree, he
      was an adjunct instructor at Wilberforce University, a historically Black college/university (HBCU), while
      serving as faculty at Antioch College. Hall went on to work under William James, earning his PhD. Eventually,

he became the first president of Clark University in Massachusetts when it was founded (Pickren & Rutherford,
2010).
The Association for Psychological Science (APS) was founded in 1988 and seeks to advance the scientific
orientation of psychology. Its founding resulted from disagreements between members of the scientific and
clinical branches of psychology within the APA. The APS publishes five research journals and engages in
education and advocacy with funding agencies. A significant proportion of its members are international,
although the majority is located in the United States. Other organizations provide networking and
collaboration opportunities for professionals of several ethnic or racial groups working in psychology, such as
the National Latina/o Psychological Association (NLPA), the Asian American Psychological Association (AAPA),
the Association of Black Psychologists (ABPsi), and the Society of Indian Psychologists (SIP). Most of these
groups are also dedicated to studying psychological and social issues within their specific communities.
This section will provide an overview of the major subdivisions within psychology today in the order in which
they are introduced throughout the remainder of this textbook. This is not meant to be an exhaustive listing,
but it will provide insight into the major areas of research and practice of modern-day psychologists.

Biopsychology and Evolutionary Psychology

As the name suggests, biopsychology explores how our biology influences our behavior. While biological
psychology is a broad field, many biological psychologists want to understand how the structure and function
of the nervous system is related to behavior (Figure 1.10). As such, they often combine the research strategies
of both psychologists and physiologists to accomplish this goal (as discussed in Carlson, 2013).

FIGURE 1.10 Biological psychologists study how the structure and function of the nervous system generate
behavior.
The research interests of biological psychologists span a number of domains, including but not limited to,
20 1 · Introduction to Psychology

      sensory and motor systems, sleep, drug use and abuse, ingestive behavior, reproductive behavior,
      neurodevelopment, plasticity of the nervous system, and biological correlates of psychological disorders.
      Given the broad areas of interest falling under the purview of biological psychology, it will probably come as no
      surprise that individuals from all sorts of backgrounds are involved in this research, including biologists,
      medical professionals, physiologists, and chemists. This interdisciplinary approach is often referred to as
      neuroscience, of which biological psychology is a component (Carlson, 2013).

      While biopsychology typically focuses on the immediate causes of behavior based in the physiology of a
      human or other animal, evolutionary psychology seeks to study the ultimate biological causes of behavior. To
      the extent that a behavior is impacted by genetics, a behavior, like any anatomical characteristic of a human or
      animal, will demonstrate adaption to its surroundings. These surroundings include the physical environment
      and, since interactions between organisms can be important to survival and reproduction, the social
      environment. The study of behavior in the context of evolution has its origins with Charles Darwin, the co-
      discoverer of the theory of evolution by natural selection. Darwin was well aware that behaviors should be
     adaptive and wrote books titled, The Descent of Man (1871) and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and
     Animals (1872), to explore this field.

      Evolutionary psychology, and specifically, the evolutionary psychology of humans, has enjoyed a resurgence in
      recent decades. To be subject to evolution by natural selection, a behavior must have a significant genetic
      cause. In general, we expect all human cultures to express a behavior if it is caused genetically, since the
      genetic differences among human groups are small. The approach taken by most evolutionary psychologists is
      to predict the outcome of a behavior in a particular situation based on evolutionary theory and then to make
      observations, or conduct experiments, to determine whether the results match the theory. It is important to
      recognize that these types of studies are not strong evidence that a behavior is adaptive, since they lack
      information that the behavior is in some part genetic and not entirely cultural (Endler, 1986). Demonstrating
      that a trait, especially in humans, is naturally selected is extraordinarily difficult; perhaps for this reason,
      some evolutionary psychologists are content to assume the behaviors they study have genetic determinants
      (Confer et al., 2010).

      One other drawback of evolutionary psychology is that the traits that we possess now evolved under
      environmental and social conditions far back in human history, and we have a poor understanding of what
      these conditions were. This makes predictions about what is adaptive for a behavior difficult. Behavioral traits
      need not be adaptive under current conditions, only under the conditions of the past when they evolved, about
      which we can only hypothesize.

      There are many areas of human behavior for which evolution can make predictions. Examples include
      memory, mate choice, relationships between kin, friendship and cooperation, parenting, social organization,
      and status (Confer et al., 2010).

      Evolutionary psychologists have had success in finding experimental correspondence between observations
      and expectations. In one example, in a study of mate preference differences between men and women that
      spanned 37 cultures, Buss (1989) found that women valued earning potential factors greater than men, and
      men valued potential reproductive factors (youth and attractiveness) greater than women in their prospective
      mates. In general, the predictions were in line with the predictions of evolution, although there were deviations
      in some cultures.

     Sensation and Perception

      Scientists interested in both physiological aspects of sensory systems as well as in the psychological
      experience of sensory information work within the area of sensation and perception (Figure 1.11). As such,
      sensation and perception research is also quite interdisciplinary. Imagine walking between buildings as you
      move from one class to another. You are inundated with sights, sounds, touch sensations, and smells. You also
      experience the temperature of the air around you and maintain your balance as you make your way. These are

                                                                                                                                                1.3 · Contemporary Psychology 21

all factors of interest to someone working in the domain of sensation and perception.

FIGURE 1.11 When you look at this image, you may see a duck or a rabbit. The sensory information remains the
same, but your perception can vary dramatically.
As described in a later chapter that focuses on the results of studies in sensation and perception, our
experience of our world is not as simple as the sum total of all of the sensory information (or sensations)
together. Rather, our experience (or perception) is complex and is influenced by where we focus our attention,
our previous experiences, and even our cultural backgrounds.

Cognitive Psychology

As mentioned in the previous section, the cognitive revolution created an impetus for psychologists to focus
their attention on better understanding the mind and mental processes that underlie behavior. Thus, cognitive
psychology is the area of psychology that focuses on studying cognitions, or thoughts, and their relationship to
our experiences and our actions. Like biological psychology, cognitive psychology is broad in its scope and
often involves collaborations among people from a diverse range of disciplinary backgrounds. This has led
some to coin the term cognitive science to describe the interdisciplinary nature of this area of research (Miller,
2003).
Cognitive psychologists have research interests that span a spectrum of topics, ranging from attention to
problem solving to language to memory. The approaches used in studying these topics are equally diverse.
Given such diversity, cognitive psychology is not captured in one chapter of this text per se; rather, various
concepts related to cognitive psychology will be covered in relevant portions of the chapters in this text on
sensation and perception, thinking and intelligence, memory, lifespan development, social psychology, and
therapy.

Developmental Psychology

Developmental psychology is the scientific study of development across a lifespan. Developmental
psychologists are interested in processes related to physical maturation. However, their focus is not limited to
the physical changes associated with aging, as they also focus on changes in cognitive skills, moral reasoning,
social behavior, and other psychological attributes.
Early developmental psychologists focused primarily on changes that occurred through reaching adulthood,
providing enormous insight into the differences in physical, cognitive, and social capacities that exist between
very young children and adults. For instance, research by Jean Piaget (Figure 1.12) demonstrated that very
young children do not demonstrate object permanence. Object permanence refers to the understanding that
physical things continue to exist, even if they are hidden from us. If you were to show an adult a toy, and then
hide it behind a curtain, the adult knows that the toy still exists. However, very young infants act as if a hidden
object no longer exists. The age at which object permanence is achieved is somewhat controversial (Munakata,
McClelland, Johnson, and Siegler, 1997).
22 1 · Introduction to Psychology

      FIGURE 1.12 Jean Piaget is famous for his theories regarding changes in cognitive ability that occur as we move
      from infancy to adulthood.
      While Piaget was focused on cognitive changes during infancy and childhood as we move to adulthood, there is
      an increasing interest in extending research into the changes that occur much later in life. This may be
      reflective of changing population demographics of developed nations as a whole. As more and more people live
      longer lives, the number of people of advanced age will continue to increase. Indeed, it is estimated that there
      were just over 40 million people aged 65 or older living in the United States in 2010. However, by 2020, this
      number is expected to increase to about 55 million. By the year 2050, it is estimated that nearly 90 million
      people in this country will be 65 or older (Department of Health and Human Services, n.d.).

     Personality Psychology

      Personality psychology focuses on patterns of thoughts and behaviors that make each individual unique.
      Several individuals (e.g., Freud and Maslow) that we have already discussed in our historical overview of
      psychology, and the American psychologist Gordon Allport, contributed to early theories of personality. These
      early theorists attempted to explain how an individual's personality develops from their given perspective. For
      example, Freud proposed that personality arose as conflicts between the conscious and unconscious parts of
      the mind were carried out over the lifespan. Specifically, Freud theorized that an individual went through
      various psychosexual stages of development. According to Freud, adult personality would result from the
      resolution of various conflicts that centered on the migration of erogenous (or sexual pleasure-producing)
      zones from the oral (mouth) to the anus to the phallus to the genitals. Like many of Freud's theories, this
      particular idea was controversial and did not lend itself to experimental tests (Person, 1980).
      More recently, the study of personality has taken on a more quantitative approach. Rather than explaining how
      personality arises, research is focused on identifying personality traits, measuring these traits, and
      determining how these traits interact in a particular context to determine how a person will behave in any
      given situation. Personality traits are relatively consistent patterns of thought and behavior, and many have
      proposed that five trait dimensions are sufficient to capture the variations in personality seen across
      individuals. These five dimensions are known as the "Big Five" or the Five Factor model, and include
      dimensions of conscientiousness, agreeableness, neuroticism, openness, and extraversion (Figure 1.13). Each
      of these traits has been demonstrated to be relatively stable over the lifespan (e.g., Rantanen, Metsäpelto, Feldt,
      Pulkinnen, and Kokko, 2007; Soldz & Vaillant, 1999; McCrae & Costa, 2008) and is influenced by genetics (e.g.,
      Jang, Livesly, and Vernon, 1996).

FIGURE 1.13 Each of the dimensions of the Five Factor model is shown in this figure. The provided description
would describe someone who scored highly on that given dimension. Someone with a lower score on a given
dimension could be described in opposite terms.

Social Psychology

Social psychology focuses on how we interact with and relate to others. Social psychologists conduct research
on a wide variety of topics that include differences in how we explain our own behavior versus how we explain
the behaviors of others, prejudice, and attraction, and how we resolve interpersonal conflicts. Social
psychologists have also sought to determine how being among other people changes our own behavior and
patterns of thinking.
There are many interesting examples of social psychological research, and you will read about many of these
in a later chapter of this textbook. Until then, you will be introduced to one of the most controversial
psychological studies ever conducted. Stanley Milgram was an American social psychologist who is most
famous for research that he conducted on obedience. After the holocaust, in 1961, a Nazi war criminal, Adolf
Eichmann, who was accused of committing mass atrocities, was put on trial. Many people wondered how
German soldiers were capable of torturing prisoners in concentration camps, and they were unsatisfied with
the excuses given by soldiers that they were simply following orders. At the time, most psychologists agreed
that few people would be willing to inflict such extraordinary pain and suffering, simply because they were
obeying orders. Milgram decided to conduct research to determine whether or not this was true (Figure 1.14).
As you will read later in the text, Milgram found that nearly two-thirds of his participants were willing to
deliver what they believed to be lethal shocks to another person, simply because they were instructed to do so
by an authority figure (in this case, a man dressed in a lab coat). This was in spite of the fact that participants
24 1 · Introduction to Psychology

      received payment for simply showing up for the research study and could have chosen not to inflict pain or
      more serious consequences on another person by withdrawing from the study. No one was actually hurt or
      harmed in any way, Milgram's experiment was a clever ruse that took advantage of research confederates,
      those who pretend to be participants in a research study who are actually working for the researcher and have
      clear, specific directions on how to behave during the research study (Hock, 2009). Milgram's and others'
      studies that involved deception and potential emotional harm to study participants catalyzed the development
      of ethical guidelines for conducting psychological research that discourage the use of deception of research
      subjects, unless it can be argued not to cause harm and, in general, requiring informed consent of
      participants.

      FIGURE 1.14 Stanley Milgram's research demonstrated just how far people will go in obeying orders from an
      authority figure. This advertisement was used to recruit subjects for his research.

     Industrial-Organizational Psychology

      Industrial-Organizational psychology (I-O psychology) is a subfield of psychology that applies psychological
      theories, principles, and research findings in industrial and organizational settings. I-O psychologists are often
      involved in issues related to personnel management, organizational structure, and workplace environment.
      Businesses often seek the aid of I-O psychologists to make the best hiring decisions as well as to create an
      environment that results in high levels of employee productivity and efficiency. In addition to its applied
      nature, I-O psychology also involves conducting scientific research on behavior within I-O settings (Riggio,
      2013).

Health Psychology

Health psychology focuses on how health is affected by the interaction of biological, psychological, and
sociocultural factors. This particular approach is known as the biopsychosocial model (Figure 1.15). Health
psychologists are interested in helping individuals achieve better health through public policy, education,
intervention, and research. Health psychologists might conduct research that explores the relationship
between one's genetic makeup, patterns of behavior, relationships, psychological stress, and health. They may
research effective ways to motivate people to address patterns of behavior that contribute to poorer health
(MacDonald, 2013).

FIGURE 1.15 The biopsychosocial model suggests that health/illness is determined by an interaction of these three
factors.

Sport and Exercise Psychology

Researchers in sport and exercise psychology study the psychological aspects of sport performance,
including motivation and performance anxiety, and the effects of sport on mental and emotional wellbeing.
Research is also conducted on similar topics as they relate to physical exercise in general. The discipline also
includes topics that are broader than sport and exercise but that are related to interactions between mental
and physical performance under demanding conditions, such as fire fighting, military operations, artistic
performance, and surgery.

Clinical Psychology

Clinical psychology is the area of psychology that focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of psychological
disorders and other problematic patterns of behavior. As such, it is generally considered to be a more applied
area within psychology; however, some clinicians are also actively engaged in scientific research. Counseling
psychology is a similar discipline that focuses on emotional, social, vocational, and health-related outcomes in
individuals who are considered psychologically healthy.
As mentioned earlier, both Freud and Rogers provided perspectives that have been influential in shaping how
clinicians interact with people seeking psychotherapy. While aspects of the psychoanalytic theory are still
found among some of today's therapists who are trained from a psychodynamic perspective, Roger's ideas
about client-centered therapy have been especially influential in shaping how many clinicians operate.
Furthermore, both behaviorism and the cognitive revolution have shaped clinical practice in the forms of
behavioral therapy, cognitive therapy, and cognitive-behavioral therapy (Figure 1.16). Issues related to the
diagnosis and treatment of psychological disorders and problematic patterns of behavior will be discussed in
26 1 · Introduction to Psychology

      detail in later chapters of this textbook.

      FIGURE 1.16 Cognitive-behavioral therapists take cognitive processes and behaviors into account when providing
      psychotherapy. This is one of several strategies that may be used by practicing clinical psychologists.
      By far, this is the area of psychology that receives the most attention in popular media, and many people
      mistakenly assume that all psychology is clinical psychology.

     Forensic Psychology

      Forensic psychology is a branch of psychology that deals questions of psychology as they arise in the context
      of the justice system. For example, forensic psychologists (and forensic psychiatrists) will assess a person's
      competency to stand trial, assess the state of mind of a defendant, act as consultants on child custody cases,
      consult on sentencing and treatment recommendations, and advise on issues such as eyewitness testimony
      and children's testimony (American Board of Forensic Psychology, 2014). In these capacities, they will typically
      act as expert witnesses, called by either side in a court case to provide their research- or experience-based
      opinions. As expert witnesses, forensic psychologists must have a good understanding of the law and provide
      information in the context of the legal system rather than just within the realm of psychology. Forensic
      psychologists are also used in the jury selection process and witness preparation. They may also be involved in
      providing psychological treatment within the criminal justice system. Criminal profilers are a relatively small
      proportion of psychologists that act as consultants to law enforcement.

    1.4 Careers in Psychology

      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Understand educational requirements for careers in academic settings
        · Understand the demands of a career in an academic setting
        · Understand career options outside of academic settings
      Psychologists can work in many different places doing many different things. In general, anyone wishing to
      continue a career in psychology at a 4-year institution of higher education will have to earn a doctoral degree
      in psychology for some specialties and at least a master's degree for others. In most areas of psychology, this
      means earning a PhD in a relevant area of psychology. Literally, PhD refers to a doctor of philosophy degree,
      but here, philosophy does not refer to the field of philosophy per se. Rather, philosophy in this context refers to
      many different disciplinary perspectives that would be housed in a traditional college of liberal arts and
      sciences.
      The requirements to earn a PhD vary from country to country and even from school to school, but usually,
      individuals earning this degree must complete a dissertation. A dissertation is essentially a long research
      paper or bundled published articles describing research that was conducted as a part of the candidate's
      doctoral training. In the United States, a dissertation generally has to be defended before a committee of expert

Once someone earns a PhD, they may seek a faculty appointment at a college or university. Being on the faculty
of a college or university often involves dividing time between teaching, research, and service to the institution
and profession. The amount of time spent on each of these primary responsibilities varies dramatically from
school to school, and it is not uncommon for faculty to move from place to place in search of the best personal
fit among various academic environments. The previous section detailed some of the major areas that are
commonly represented in psychology departments around the country; thus, depending on the training
received, an individual could be anything from a biological psychologist to a clinical psychologist in an
academic setting (Figure 1.18).

Other Careers in Academic Settings

Often times, schools offer more courses in psychology than their full-time faculty can teach. In these cases, it is
not uncommon to bring in an adjunct faculty member or instructor. Adjunct faculty members and instructors
usually have an advanced degree in psychology, but they often have primary careers outside of academia and
serve in this role as a secondary job. Alternatively, they may not hold the doctoral degree required by most
28 1 · Introduction to Psychology

      4-year institutions and use these opportunities to gain experience in teaching. Furthermore, many 2-year
      colleges and schools need faculty to teach their courses in psychology. In general, many of the people who
      pursue careers at these institutions have master's degrees in psychology, although some PhDs make careers at
      these institutions as well.

      Some people earning PhDs may enjoy research in an academic setting. However, they may not be interested in
      teaching. These individuals might take on faculty positions that are exclusively devoted to conducting
      research. This type of position would be more likely an option at large, research-focused universities.

      In some areas in psychology, it is common for individuals who have recently earned their PhD to seek out
      positions in postdoctoral training programs that are available before going on to serve as faculty. In most
      cases, young scientists will complete one or two postdoctoral programs before applying for a full-time faculty
      position. Postdoctoral training programs allow young scientists to further develop their research programs
      and broaden their research skills under the supervision of other professionals in the field.

     Career Options Outside of Academic Settings

      Individuals who wish to become practicing clinical psychologists have another option for earning a doctoral
      degree, which is known as a PsyD. A PsyD is a doctor of psychology degree that is increasingly popular among
      individuals interested in pursuing careers in clinical psychology. PsyD programs generally place less emphasis
      on research-oriented skills and focus more on application of psychological principles in the clinical context
      (Norcross & Castle, 2002).

      Regardless of whether earning a PhD or PsyD, in most states, an individual wishing to practice as a licensed
      clinical or counseling psychologist may complete postdoctoral work under the supervision of a licensed
      psychologist. Within the last few years, however, several states have begun to remove this requirement, which
      would allow people to get an earlier start in their careers (Munsey, 2009). After an individual has met the state
      requirements, their credentials are evaluated to determine whether they can sit for the licensure exam. Only
      individuals that pass this exam can call themselves licensed clinical or counseling psychologists (Norcross,
      n.d.). Licensed clinical or counseling psychologists can then work in a number of settings, ranging from private
      clinical practice to hospital settings. It should be noted that clinical psychologists and psychiatrists do different
      things and receive different types of education. While both can conduct therapy and counseling, clinical
      psychologists have a PhD or a PsyD, whereas psychiatrists have a doctor of medicine degree (MD). As such,
      licensed clinical psychologists can administer and interpret psychological tests, while psychiatrists can
      prescribe medications.

      Individuals earning a PhD can work in a variety of settings, depending on their areas of specialization. For
      example, someone trained as a biopsychologist might work in a pharmaceutical company to help test the
      efficacy of a new drug. Someone with a clinical background might become a forensic psychologist and work
      within the legal system to make recommendations during criminal trials and parole hearings, or serve as an
      expert in a court case.

      While earning a doctoral degree in psychology is a lengthy process, usually taking between 5-6 years of
      graduate study (DeAngelis, 2010), there are a number of careers that can be attained with a master's degree in
      psychology. People who wish to provide psychotherapy can become licensed to serve as various types of
      professional counselors (Hoffman, 2012). Relevant master's degrees are also sufficient for individuals seeking
      careers as school psychologists (National Association of School Psychologists, n.d.), in some capacities related
      to sport psychology (American Psychological Association, 2014), or as consultants in various industrial
      settings (Landers, 2011, June 14). Undergraduate coursework in psychology may be applicable to other careers
      such as psychiatric social work or psychiatric nursing, where assessments and therapy may be a part of the
      job.

      As mentioned in the opening section of this chapter, an undergraduate education in psychology is associated
      with a knowledge base and skill set that many employers find quite attractive. It should come as no surprise,

careers, as shown in Table 1.1. Examples of a few such careers can involve serving as case managers, working

Summary

1.1 What Is Psychology?

Psychology is defined as the scientific study of mind and behavior. Students of psychology develop critical
thinking skills, become familiar with the scientific method, and recognize the complexity of behavior.

1.2 History of Psychology

Before the time of Wundt and James, questions about the mind were considered by philosophers. However,
both Wundt and James helped create psychology as a distinct scientific discipline. Wundt was a structuralist,
which meant he believed that our cognitive experience was best understood by breaking that experience into
its component parts. He thought this was best accomplished by introspection.

William James was the first American psychologist, and he was a proponent of functionalism. This particular
perspective focused on how mental activities served as adaptive responses to an organism's environment. Like
Wundt, James also relied on introspection; however, his research approach also incorporated more objective
measures as well.

Sigmund Freud believed that understanding the unconscious mind was absolutely critical to understand
conscious behavior. This was especially true for individuals that he saw who suffered from various hysterias
and neuroses. Freud relied on dream analysis, slips of the tongue, and free association as means to access the
unconscious. Psychoanalytic theory remained a dominant force in clinical psychology for several decades.

Gestalt psychology was very influential in Europe. Gestalt psychology takes a holistic view of an individual and
his experiences. As the Nazis came to power in Germany, Wertheimer, Koffka, and Köhler immigrated to the
United States. Although they left their laboratories and their research behind, they did introduce America to
Gestalt ideas. Some of the principles of Gestalt psychology are still very influential in the study of sensation
and perception.

One of the most influential schools of thought within psychology's history was behaviorism. Behaviorism
focused on making psychology an objective science by studying overt behavior and deemphasizing the
importance of unobservable mental processes. John Watson is often considered the father of behaviorism, and
B. F. Skinner's contributions to our understanding of principles of operant conditioning cannot be
underestimated.

As behaviorism and psychoanalytic theory took hold of so many aspects of psychology, some began to become
dissatisfied with psychology's picture of human nature. Thus, a humanistic movement within psychology
began to take hold. Humanism focuses on the potential of all people for good. Both Maslow and Rogers were
influential in shaping humanistic psychology.

During the 1950s, the landscape of psychology began to change. A science of behavior began to shift back to its
roots of focus on mental processes. The emergence of neuroscience and computer science aided this
transition. Ultimately, the cognitive revolution took hold, and people came to realize that cognition was crucial
to a true appreciation and understanding of behavior.

1.3 Contemporary Psychology

Psychology is a diverse discipline that is made up of several major subdivisions with unique perspectives.
Biological psychology involves the study of the biological bases of behavior. Sensation and perception refer to
the area of psychology that is focused on how information from our sensory modalities is received, and how
this information is transformed into our perceptual experiences of the world around us. Cognitive psychology
is concerned with the relationship that exists between thought and behavior, and developmental psychologists
study the physical and cognitive changes that occur throughout one's lifespan. Personality psychology focuses
on individuals' unique patterns of behavior, thought, and emotion. Industrial and organizational psychology,
health psychology, sport and exercise psychology, forensic psychology, and clinical psychology are all
considered applied areas of psychology. Industrial and organizational psychologists apply psychological
concepts to I-O settings. Health psychologists look for ways to help people live healthier lives, and clinical
psychology involves the diagnosis and treatment of psychological disorders and other problematic behavioral
patterns. Sport and exercise psychologists study the interactions between thoughts, emotions, and physical
performance in sports, exercise, and other activities. Forensic psychologists carry out activities related to
psychology in association with the justice system.

1.4 Careers in Psychology

Generally, academic careers in psychology require doctoral degrees. However, there are a number of
nonacademic career options for people who have master's degrees in psychology. While people with bachelor's
degrees in psychology have more limited psychology-related career options, the skills acquired as a function of

CHAPTER OUTLINE

2.1 Why Is Research Important?
2.2 Approaches to Research
2.3 Analyzing Findings
2.4 Ethics

INTRODUCTION Have you ever wondered whether the violence you see on television affects your behavior?
Are you more likely to behave aggressively in real life after watching people behave violently in dramatic
situations on the screen? Or, could seeing fictional violence actually get aggression out of your system, causing
you to be more peaceful? How are children influenced by the media they are exposed to? A psychologist
interested in the relationship between behavior and exposure to violent images might ask these very
questions.

Since ancient times, humans have been concerned about the effects of new technologies on our behaviors and
thinking processes. The Greek philosopher Socrates, for example, worried that writing--a new technology at
that time--would diminish people's ability to remember because they could rely on written records rather than
committing information to memory. In our world of rapidly changing technologies, questions about their
effects on our daily lives and their resulting long-term impacts continue to emerge. In addition to the impact of
screen time (on smartphones, tablets, computers, and gaming), technology is emerging in our vehicles (such
as GPS and smart cars) and residences (with devices like Alexa or Google Home and doorbell cameras). As
these technologies become integrated into our lives, we are faced with questions about their positive and
negative impacts. Many of us find ourselves with a strong opinion on these issues, only to find the person next
to us bristling with the opposite view.
36 2 · Psychological Research

      How can we go about finding answers that are supported not by mere opinion, but by evidence that we can all
      agree on? The findings of psychological research can help us navigate issues like this.

    2.1 Why Is Research Important?

      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Explain how scientific research addresses questions about behavior
        · Discuss how scientific research guides public policy
        · Appreciate how scientific research can be important in making personal decisions
      Scientific research is a critical tool for successfully navigating our complex world. Without it, we would be
      forced to rely solely on intuition, other people's authority, and blind luck. While many of us feel confident in
      our abilities to decipher and interact with the world around us, history is filled with examples of how very
      wrong we can be when we fail to recognize the need for evidence in supporting claims. At various times in
      history, we would have been certain that the sun revolved around a flat earth, that the earth's continents did
      not move, and that mental illness was caused by possession (Figure 2.2). It is through systematic scientific
      research that we divest ourselves of our preconceived notions and superstitions and gain an objective
      understanding of ourselves and our world.

      FIGURE 2.2 Some of our ancestors, across the world and over the centuries, believed that trephination--the
      practice of making a hole in the skull, as shown here--allowed evil spirits to leave the body, thus curing mental
      illness and other disorders. (credit: "taiproject"/Flickr)
      The goal of all scientists is to better understand the world around them. Psychologists focus their attention on
      understanding behavior, as well as the cognitive (mental) and physiological (body) processes that underlie
      behavior. In contrast to other methods that people use to understand the behavior of others, such as intuition
      and personal experience, the hallmark of scientific research is that there is evidence to support a claim.
      Scientific knowledge is empirical: It is grounded in objective, tangible evidence that can be observed time and
      time again, regardless of who is observing.
      While behavior is observable, the mind is not. If someone is crying, we can see behavior. However, the reason
      for the behavior is more difficult to determine. Is the person crying due to being sad, in pain, or happy?
      Sometimes we can learn the reason for someone's behavior by simply asking a question, like "Why are you
      crying?" However, there are situations in which an individual is either uncomfortable or unwilling to answer
      the question honestly, or is incapable of answering. For example, infants would not be able to explain why they
      are crying. In such circumstances, the psychologist must be creative in finding ways to better understand
      behavior. This chapter explores how scientific knowledge is generated, and how important that knowledge is in
      forming decisions in our personal lives and in the public domain.

Use of Research Information

Trying to determine which theories are and are not accepted by the scientific community can be difficult,
especially in an area of research as broad as psychology. More than ever before, we have an incredible amount
of information at our fingertips, and a simple internet search on any given research topic might result in a
number of contradictory studies. In these cases, we are witnessing the scientific community going through the
process of reaching a consensus, and it could be quite some time before a consensus emerges. For example,
the explosion in our use of technology has led researchers to question whether this ultimately helps or hinders
us. The use and implementation of technology in educational settings has become widespread over the last few
decades. Researchers are coming to different conclusions regarding the use of technology. To illustrate this
point, a study investigating a smartphone app targeting surgery residents (graduate students in surgery
training) found that the use of this app can increase student engagement and raise test scores (Shaw & Tan,
2015). Conversely, another study found that the use of technology in undergraduate student populations had
negative impacts on sleep, communication, and time management skills (Massimini & Peterson, 2009). Until
sufficient amounts of research have been conducted, there will be no clear consensus on the effects that
technology has on a student's acquisition of knowledge, study skills, and mental health.

In the meantime, we should strive to think critically about the information we encounter by exercising a degree
of healthy skepticism. When someone makes a claim, we should examine the claim from a number of different
perspectives: what is the expertise of the person making the claim, what might they gain if the claim is valid,
does the claim seem justified given the evidence, and what do other researchers think of the claim? This is
especially important when we consider how much information in advertising campaigns and on the internet
claims to be based on "scientific evidence" when in actuality it is a belief or perspective of just a few
individuals trying to sell a product or draw attention to their perspectives.

We should be informed consumers of the information made available to us because decisions based on this
information have significant consequences. One such consequence can be seen in politics and public policy.
Imagine that you have been elected as the governor of your state. One of your responsibilities is to manage the
state budget and determine how to best spend your constituents' tax dollars. As the new governor, you need to
decide whether to continue funding early intervention programs. These programs are designed to help
children who come from low-income backgrounds, have special needs, or face other disadvantages. These
programs may involve providing a wide variety of services to maximize the children's development and
position them for optimal levels of success in school and later in life (Blann, 2005). While such programs
sound appealing, you would want to be sure that they also proved effective before investing additional money
in these programs. Fortunately, psychologists and other scientists have conducted vast amounts of research on
such programs and, in general, the programs are found to be effective (Neil & Christensen, 2009; Peters-
Scheffer, Didden, Korzilius, & Sturmey, 2011). While not all programs are equally effective, and the short-term
effects of many such programs are more pronounced, there is reason to believe that many of these programs
produce long-term benefits for participants (Barnett, 2011). If you are committed to being a good steward of
taxpayer money, you would want to look at research. Which programs are most effective? What characteristics
of these programs make them effective? Which programs promote the best outcomes? After examining the
research, you would be best equipped to make decisions about which programs to fund.

how scientists evaluate effectiveness and how best to invest money into programs that are most effective.

Ultimately, it is not just politicians who can benefit from using research in guiding their decisions. We all might
look to research from time to time when making decisions in our lives. Imagine you just found out that your
sister Maria's child, Umberto, was recently diagnosed with autism. There are many treatments for autism that
help decrease the negative impact of autism on the individual. Some examples of treatments for autism are

      applied behavior analysis (ABA), social communication groups, social skills groups, occupational therapy, and
      even medication options. If Maria asked you for advice or guidance, what would you do? You would likely want
      to review the research and learn about the efficacy of each treatment so you could best advise your sister.
      In the end, research is what makes the difference between facts and opinions. Facts are observable realities,
      and opinions are personal judgments, conclusions, or attitudes that may or may not be accurate. In the
      scientific community, facts can be established only using evidence collected through empirical research.

     NOTABLE RESEARCHERS

      Psychological research has a long history involving important figures from diverse backgrounds. While the
      introductory chapter discussed several researchers who made significant contributions to the discipline, there
      are many more individuals who deserve attention in considering how psychology has advanced as a science
      through their work (Figure 2.3). For instance, Margaret Floy Washburn (1871-1939) was the first woman to
      earn a PhD in psychology. Her research focused on animal behavior and cognition (Margaret Floy Washburn,
      PhD, n.d.). Mary Whiton Calkins (1863-1930) was a preeminent first-generation American psychologist who
      opposed the behaviorist movement, conducted significant research into memory, and established one of the
      earliest experimental psychology labs in the United States (Mary Whiton Calkins, n.d.).
      Francis Sumner (1895-1954) was the first African American to receive a PhD in psychology in 1920. His
      dissertation focused on issues related to psychoanalysis. Sumner also had research interests in racial bias and
      educational justice. Sumner was one of the founders of Howard University's department of psychology, and
      because of his accomplishments, he is sometimes referred to as the "Father of Black Psychology." Thirteen
      years later, Inez Beverly Prosser (1895-1934) became the first African American woman to receive a PhD in
      psychology. Prosser's research highlighted issues related to education in segregated versus integrated schools,
     and ultimately, her work was very influential in the hallmark Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court
      ruling that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional (Ethnicity and Health in America Series:
      Featured Psychologists, n.d.).

     outcome of Brown v. Board of Education was influenced by the research of psychologist Inez Beverly Prosser, who
      was the first African American woman to earn a PhD in psychology.
      Although the establishment of psychology's scientific roots occurred first in Europe and the United States, it
      did not take much time until researchers from around the world began to establish their own laboratories and
      research programs. For example, some of the first experimental psychology laboratories in South America
      were founded by Horatio Piñero (1869-1919) at two institutions in Buenos Aires, Argentina (Godoy & Brussino,
      2010). In India, Gunamudian David Boaz (1908-1965) and Narendra Nath Sen Gupta (1889-1944) established

the first independent departments of psychology at the University of Madras and the University of Calcutta,
respectively. These developments provided an opportunity for Indian researchers to make important
contributions to the field (Gunamudian David Boaz, n.d.; Narendra Nath Sen Gupta, n.d.).
When the American Psychological Association (APA) was first founded in 1892, all of the members were White
males (Women and Minorities in Psychology, n.d.). However, by 1905, Mary Whiton Calkins was elected as the
first female president of the APA, and by 1946, nearly one-quarter of American psychologists were female.
Psychology became a popular degree option for students enrolled in the nation's historically Black higher
education institutions, increasing the number of Black Americans who went on to become psychologists. Given
demographic shifts occurring in the United States and increased access to higher educational opportunities
among historically underrepresented populations, there is reason to hope that the diversity of the field will
increasingly match the larger population, and that the research contributions made by the psychologists of the
future will better serve people of all backgrounds (Women and Minorities in Psychology, n.d.).

The Process of Scientific Research

Scientific knowledge is advanced through a process known as the scientific method. Basically, ideas (in the
form of theories and hypotheses) are tested against the real world (in the form of empirical observations), and
those empirical observations lead to more ideas that are tested against the real world, and so on. In this sense,
the scientific process is circular. The types of reasoning within the circle are called deductive and inductive. In
deductive reasoning, ideas are tested in the real world; in inductive reasoning, real-world observations lead
to new ideas (Figure 2.4). These processes are inseparable, like inhaling and exhaling, but different research
approaches place different emphasis on the deductive and inductive aspects.

                    FIGURE 2.4 Psychological research relies on both inductive and deductive reasoning.
In the scientific context, deductive reasoning begins with a generalization--one hypothesis--that is then used
to reach logical conclusions about the real world. If the hypothesis is correct, then the logical conclusions
reached through deductive reasoning should also be correct. A deductive reasoning argument might go
something like this: All living things require energy to survive (this would be your hypothesis). Ducks are living
things. Therefore, ducks require energy to survive (logical conclusion). In this example, the hypothesis is
correct; therefore, the conclusion is correct as well. Sometimes, however, an incorrect hypothesis may lead to a
logical but incorrect conclusion. Consider this argument: all ducks are born with the ability to see. Quackers is
a duck. Therefore, Quackers was born with the ability to see. Scientists use deductive reasoning to empirically
test their hypotheses. Returning to the example of the ducks, researchers might design a study to test the
hypothesis that if all living things require energy to survive, then ducks will be found to require energy to
survive.
Deductive reasoning starts with a generalization that is tested against real-world observations; however,
inductive reasoning moves in the opposite direction. Inductive reasoning uses empirical observations to
40 2 · Psychological Research

      construct broad generalizations. Unlike deductive reasoning, conclusions drawn from inductive reasoning
      may or may not be correct, regardless of the observations on which they are based. For instance, you may
      notice that your favorite fruits--apples, bananas, and oranges--all grow on trees; therefore, you assume that all
      fruit must grow on trees. This would be an example of inductive reasoning, and, clearly, the existence of
      strawberries, blueberries, and kiwi demonstrate that this generalization is not correct despite it being based
      on a number of direct observations. Scientists use inductive reasoning to formulate theories, which in turn
      generate hypotheses that are tested with deductive reasoning. In the end, science involves both deductive and
      inductive processes.
      For example, case studies, which you will read about in the next section, are heavily weighted on the side of
      empirical observations. Thus, case studies are closely associated with inductive processes as researchers
      gather massive amounts of observations and seek interesting patterns (new ideas) in the data. Experimental
      research, on the other hand, puts great emphasis on deductive reasoning.
      We've stated that theories and hypotheses are ideas, but what sort of ideas are they, exactly? A theory is a well-
      developed set of ideas that propose an explanation for observed phenomena. Theories are repeatedly checked
      against the world, but they tend to be too complex to be tested all at once; instead, researchers create
      hypotheses to test specific aspects of a theory.
      A hypothesis is a testable prediction about how the world will behave if our idea is correct, and it is often
      worded as an if-then statement (e.g., if I study all night, I will get a passing grade on the test). The hypothesis is
      extremely important because it bridges the gap between the realm of ideas and the real world. As specific
      hypotheses are tested, theories are modified and refined to reflect and incorporate the result of these tests
      Figure 2.5.

      FIGURE 2.5 The scientific method involves deriving hypotheses from theories and then testing those hypotheses. If
      the results are consistent with the theory, then the theory is supported. If the results are not consistent, then the
      theory should be modified and new hypotheses will be generated.
      To see how this process works, let's consider a specific theory and a hypothesis that might be generated from
      that theory. As you'll learn in a later chapter, the James-Lange theory of emotion asserts that emotional
      experience relies on the physiological arousal associated with the emotional state. If you walked out of your
      home and discovered a very aggressive snake waiting on your doorstep, your heart would begin to race and
      your stomach churn. According to the James-Lange theory, these physiological changes would result in your

       Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                                                   2.2 · Approaches to Research 41

feeling of fear. A hypothesis that could be derived from this theory might be that a person who is unaware of
the physiological arousal that the sight of the snake elicits will not feel fear.
A scientific hypothesis is also falsifiable, or capable of being shown to be incorrect. Recall from the
introductory chapter that Sigmund Freud had lots of interesting ideas to explain various human behaviors
(Figure 2.6). However, a major criticism of Freud's theories is that many of his ideas are not falsifiable; for
example, it is impossible to imagine empirical observations that would disprove the existence of the id, the
ego, and the superego--the three elements of personality described in Freud's theories. Despite this, Freud's
theories are widely taught in introductory psychology texts because of their historical significance for
personality psychology and psychotherapy, and these remain the root of all modern forms of therapy.

FIGURE 2.6 Many of the specifics of (a) Freud's theories, such as (b) his division of the mind into id, ego, and
superego, have fallen out of favor in recent decades because they are not falsifiable. In broader strokes, his views
set the stage for much of psychological thinking today, such as the unconscious nature of the majority of
psychological processes.
In contrast, the James-Lange theory does generate falsifiable hypotheses, such as the one described above.
Some individuals who suffer significant injuries to their spinal columns are unable to feel the bodily changes
that often accompany emotional experiences. Therefore, we could test the hypothesis by determining how
emotional experiences differ between individuals who have the ability to detect these changes in their
physiological arousal and those who do not. In fact, this research has been conducted and while the emotional
experiences of people deprived of an awareness of their physiological arousal may be less intense, they still
experience emotion (Chwalisz, Diener, & Gallagher, 1988).
Scientific research's dependence on falsifiability allows for great confidence in the information that it
produces. Typically, by the time information is accepted by the scientific community, it has been tested
repeatedly.

2.2 Approaches to Research

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Describe the different research methods used by psychologists
  · Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of case studies, naturalistic observation, surveys, and archival research
  · Compare longitudinal and cross-sectional approaches to research
  · Compare and contrast correlation and causation
There are many research methods available to psychologists in their efforts to understand, describe, and
42 2 · Psychological Research

      explain behavior and the cognitive and biological processes that underlie it. Some methods rely on
      observational techniques. Other approaches involve interactions between the researcher and the individuals
      who are being studied--ranging from a series of simple questions to extensive, in-depth interviews--to well-
      controlled experiments.

      Each of these research methods has unique strengths and weaknesses, and each method may only be
      appropriate for certain types of research questions. For example, studies that rely primarily on observation
      produce incredible amounts of information, but the ability to apply this information to the larger population is
      somewhat limited because of small sample sizes. Survey research, on the other hand, allows researchers to
      easily collect data from relatively large samples. While this allows for results to be generalized to the larger
      population more easily, the information that can be collected on any given survey is somewhat limited and
      subject to problems associated with any type of self-reported data. Some researchers conduct archival
      research by using existing records. While this can be a fairly inexpensive way to collect data that can provide
      insight into a number of research questions, researchers using this approach have no control on how or what
      kind of data was collected. All of the methods described thus far are correlational in nature. This means that
      researchers can speak to important relationships that might exist between two or more variables of interest.
      However, correlational data cannot be used to make claims about cause-and-effect relationships.

      Correlational research can find a relationship between two variables, but the only way a researcher can claim
      that the relationship between the variables is cause and effect is to perform an experiment. In experimental
      research, which will be discussed later in this chapter, there is a tremendous amount of control over variables
      of interest. While this is a powerful approach, experiments are often conducted in artificial settings. This calls
      into question the validity of experimental findings with regard to how they would apply in real-world settings.
      In addition, many of the questions that psychologists would like to answer cannot be pursued through
      experimental research because of ethical concerns.

     Clinical or Case Studies

     In 2011, the New York Times published a feature story on Krista and Tatiana Hogan, Canadian twin girls.
      These particular twins are unique because Krista and Tatiana are conjoined twins, connected at the head.
      There is evidence that the two girls are connected in a part of the brain called the thalamus, which is a major
      sensory relay center. Most incoming sensory information is sent through the thalamus before reaching higher
      regions of the cerebral cortex for processing.

          LINK TO LEARNING

      Watch this CBC video about Krista's and Tatiana's lives (http://openstax.org/l/hogans) to learn more.

      The implications of this potential connection mean that it might be possible for one twin to experience the
      sensations of the other twin. For instance, if Krista is watching a particularly funny television program, Tatiana
      might smile or laugh even if she is not watching the program. This particular possibility has piqued the
      interest of many neuroscientists who seek to understand how the brain uses sensory information.

      These twins represent an enormous resource in the study of the brain, and since their condition is very rare, it
      is likely that as long as their family agrees, scientists will follow these girls very closely throughout their lives to
      gain as much information as possible (Dominus, 2011).

      Over time, it has become clear that while Krista and Tatiana share some sensory experiences and motor
      control, they remain two distinct individuals, which provides invaluable insight for researchers interested in
      the mind and the brain (Egnor, 2017).

      In observational research, scientists are conducting a clinical or case study when they focus on one person or
      just a few individuals. Indeed, some scientists spend their entire careers studying just 10-20 individuals. Why
      would they do this? Obviously, when they focus their attention on a very small number of people, they can gain

       Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                                                   2.2 · Approaches to Research 43

a precious amount of insight into those cases. The richness of information that is collected in clinical or case
studies is unmatched by any other single research method. This allows the researcher to have a very deep
understanding of the individuals and the particular phenomenon being studied.

If clinical or case studies provide so much information, why are they not more frequent among researchers?
As it turns out, the major benefit of this particular approach is also a weakness. As mentioned earlier, this
approach is often used when studying individuals who are interesting to researchers because they have a rare
characteristic. Therefore, the individuals who serve as the focus of case studies are not like most other people.
If scientists ultimately want to explain all behavior, focusing attention on such a special group of people can
make it difficult to generalize any observations to the larger population as a whole. Generalizing refers to the
ability to apply the findings of a particular research project to larger segments of society. Again, case studies
provide enormous amounts of information, but since the cases are so specific, the potential to apply what's
learned to the average person may be very limited.

Naturalistic Observation

If you want to understand how behavior occurs, one of the best ways to gain information is to simply observe
the behavior in its natural context. However, people might change their behavior in unexpected ways if they
know they are being observed. How do researchers obtain accurate information when people tend to hide their
natural behavior? As an example, imagine that your professor asks everyone in your class to raise their hand if
they always wash their hands after using the restroom. Chances are that almost everyone in the classroom will
raise their hand, but do you think hand washing after every trip to the restroom is really that universal?

This is very similar to the phenomenon mentioned earlier in this chapter: many individuals do not feel
comfortable answering a question honestly. But if we are committed to finding out the facts about hand
washing, we have other options available to us.

Suppose we send a classmate into the restroom to actually watch whether everyone washes their hands after
using the restroom. Will our observer blend into the restroom environment by wearing a white lab coat, sitting
with a clipboard, and staring at the sinks? We want our researcher to be inconspicuous--perhaps standing at
one of the sinks pretending to put in contact lenses while secretly recording the relevant information. This
type of observational study is called naturalistic observation: observing behavior in its natural setting. To
better understand peer exclusion, Suzanne Fanger collaborated with colleagues at the University of Texas to
observe the behavior of preschool children on a playground. How did the observers remain inconspicuous
over the duration of the study? They equipped a few of the children with wireless microphones (which the
children quickly forgot about) and observed while taking notes from a distance. Also, the children in that
particular preschool (a "laboratory preschool") were accustomed to having observers on the playground
(Fanger, Frankel, & Hazen, 2012).

It is critical that the observer be as unobtrusive and as inconspicuous as possible: when people know they are
being watched, they are less likely to behave naturally. If you have any doubt about this, ask yourself how your
driving behavior might differ in two situations: In the first situation, you are driving down a deserted highway
during the middle of the day; in the second situation, you are being followed by a police car down the same
deserted highway (Figure 2.7).
44 2 · Psychological Research

           FIGURE 2.7 Seeing a police car behind you would probably affect your driving behavior. (credit: Michael Gil)
      It should be pointed out that naturalistic observation is not limited to research involving humans. Indeed,
      some of the best-known examples of naturalistic observation involve researchers going into the field to
      observe various kinds of animals in their own environments. As with human studies, the researchers maintain
      their distance and avoid interfering with the animal subjects so as not to influence their natural behaviors.
      Scientists have used this technique to study social hierarchies and interactions among animals ranging from
      ground squirrels to gorillas. The information provided by these studies is invaluable in understanding how
      those animals organize socially and communicate with one another. The anthropologist Jane Goodall, for
      example, spent nearly five decades observing the behavior of chimpanzees in Africa (Figure 2.8). As an
      illustration of the types of concerns that a researcher might encounter in naturalistic observation, some
      scientists criticized Goodall for giving the chimps names instead of referring to them by numbers--using
      names was thought to undermine the emotional detachment required for the objectivity of the study (McKie,
      2010).

      FIGURE 2.8 (a) Jane Goodall made a career of conducting naturalistic observations of (b) chimpanzee behavior.
      (credit "Jane Goodall": modification of work by Erik Hersman; "chimpanzee": modification of work by "Afrika
      Force"/Flickr.com)
      The greatest benefit of naturalistic observation is the validity, or accuracy, of information collected
      unobtrusively in a natural setting. Having individuals behave as they normally would in a given situation
      means that we have a higher degree of ecological validity, or realism, than we might achieve with other
      research approaches. Therefore, our ability to generalize the findings of the research to real-world situations is
      enhanced. If done correctly, we need not worry about people or animals modifying their behavior simply
      because they are being observed. Sometimes, people may assume that reality programs give us a glimpse into
      authentic human behavior. However, the principle of inconspicuous observation is violated as reality stars are
      followed by camera crews and are interviewed on camera for personal confessionals. Given that environment,
      we must doubt how natural and realistic their behaviors are.
      The major downside of naturalistic observation is that they are often difficult to set up and control. In our
      restroom study, what if you stood in the restroom all day prepared to record people's hand washing behavior
      and no one came in? Or, what if you have been closely observing a troop of gorillas for weeks only to find that
      they migrated to a new place while you were sleeping in your tent? The benefit of realistic data comes at a cost.
      As a researcher you have no control of when (or if) you have behavior to observe. In addition, this type of

       Access for free at openstax.org

observational research often requires significant investments of time, money, and a good dose of luck.
Sometimes studies involve structured observation. In these cases, people are observed while engaging in set,
specific tasks. An excellent example of structured observation comes from Strange Situation by Mary
Ainsworth (you will read more about this in the chapter on lifespan development). The Strange Situation is a
procedure used to evaluate attachment styles that exist between an infant and caregiver. In this scenario,
caregivers bring their infants into a room filled with toys. The Strange Situation involves a number of phases,
including a stranger coming into the room, the caregiver leaving the room, and the caregiver's return to the
room. The infant's behavior is closely monitored at each phase, but it is the behavior of the infant upon being
reunited with the caregiver that is most telling in terms of characterizing the infant's attachment style with the
caregiver.
Another potential problem in observational research is observer bias. Generally, people who act as observers
are closely involved in the research project and may unconsciously skew their observations to fit their
research goals or expectations. To protect against this type of bias, researchers should have clear criteria
established for the types of behaviors recorded and how those behaviors should be classified. In addition,
researchers often compare observations of the same event by multiple observers, in order to test inter-rater
reliability: a measure of reliability that assesses the consistency of observations by different observers.

Surveys

Often, psychologists develop surveys as a means of gathering data. Surveys are lists of questions to be
answered by research participants, and can be delivered as paper-and-pencil questionnaires, administered
electronically, or conducted verbally (Figure 2.9). Generally, the survey itself can be completed in a short time,
and the ease of administering a survey makes it easy to collect data from a large number of people.
Surveys allow researchers to gather data from larger samples than may be afforded by other research
methods. A sample is a subset of individuals selected from a population, which is the overall group of
individuals that the researchers are interested in. Researchers study the sample and seek to generalize their
findings to the population. Generally, researchers will begin this process by calculating various measures of
central tendency from the data they have collected. These measures provide an overall summary of what a
typical response looks like. There are three measures of central tendency: mode, median, and mean. The
mode is the most frequently occurring response, the median lies at the middle of a given data set, and the
mean is the arithmetic average of all data points. Means tend to be most useful in conducting additional
analyses like those described below; however, means are very sensitive to the effects of outliers, and so one
must be aware of those effects when making assessments of what measures of central tendency tell us about a
data set in question.

FIGURE 2.9 Surveys can be administered in a number of ways, including electronically administered research, like
the survey shown here. (credit: Robert Nyman)
46 2 · Psychological Research

      There is both strength and weakness of the survey in comparison to case studies. By using surveys, we can
      collect information from a larger sample of people. A larger sample is better able to reflect the actual diversity
      of the population, thus allowing better generalizability. Therefore, if our sample is sufficiently large and
      diverse, we can assume that the data we collect from the survey can be generalized to the larger population
      with more certainty than the information collected through a case study. However, given the greater number of
      people involved, we are not able to collect the same depth of information on each person that would be
      collected in a case study.
      Another potential weakness of surveys is something we touched on earlier in this chapter: People don't always
      give accurate responses. They may lie, misremember, or answer questions in a way that they think makes
      them look good. For example, people may report drinking less alcohol than is actually the case.
      Any number of research questions can be answered through the use of surveys. One real-world example is the
      research conducted by Jenkins, Ruppel, Kizer, Yehl, and Griffin (2012) about the backlash against the US Arab-
      American community following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Jenkins and colleagues wanted to
      determine to what extent these negative attitudes toward Arab-Americans still existed nearly a decade after
      the attacks occurred. In one study, 140 research participants filled out a survey with 10 questions, including
      questions asking directly about the participant's overt prejudicial attitudes toward people of various
      ethnicities. The survey also asked indirect questions about how likely the participant would be to interact with
      a person of a given ethnicity in a variety of settings (such as, "How likely do you think it is that you would
      introduce yourself to a person of Arab-American descent?"). The results of the research suggested that
      participants were unwilling to report prejudicial attitudes toward any ethnic group. However, there were
      significant differences between their pattern of responses to questions about social interaction with Arab-
      Americans compared to other ethnic groups: they indicated less willingness for social interaction with Arab-
      Americans compared to the other ethnic groups. This suggested that the participants harbored subtle forms of
      prejudice against Arab-Americans, despite their assertions that this was not the case (Jenkins et al., 2012).

     Archival Research

      Some researchers gain access to large amounts of data without interacting with a single research participant.
      Instead, they use existing records to answer various research questions. This type of research approach is
      known as archival research. Archival research relies on looking at past records or data sets to look for
      interesting patterns or relationships.
      For example, a researcher might access the academic records of all individuals who enrolled in college within
      the past ten years and calculate how long it took them to complete their degrees, as well as course loads,
      grades, and extracurricular involvement. Archival research could provide important information about who is
      most likely to complete their education, and it could help identify important risk factors for struggling
      students (Figure 2.10).

In comparing archival research to other research methods, there are several important distinctions. For one,
the researcher employing archival research never directly interacts with research participants. Therefore, the
investment of time and money to collect data is considerably less with archival research. Additionally,
researchers have no control over what information was originally collected. Therefore, research questions
have to be tailored so they can be answered within the structure of the existing data sets. There is also no
guarantee of consistency between the records from one source to another, which might make comparing and
contrasting different data sets problematic.

Longitudinal and Cross-Sectional Research

Sometimes we want to see how people change over time, as in studies of human development and lifespan.
When we test the same group of individuals repeatedly over an extended period of time, we are conducting
longitudinal research. Longitudinal research is a research design in which data-gathering is administered
repeatedly over an extended period of time. For example, we may survey a group of individuals about their
dietary habits at age 20, retest them a decade later at age 30, and then again at age 40.

Another approach is cross-sectional research. In cross-sectional research, a researcher compares multiple
segments of the population at the same time. Using the dietary habits example above, the researcher might
directly compare different groups of people by age. Instead of studying a group of people for 20 years to see
how their dietary habits changed from decade to decade, the researcher would study a group of 20-year-old
individuals and compare them to a group of 30-year-old individuals and a group of 40-year-old individuals.
While cross-sectional research requires a shorter-term investment, it is also limited by differences that exist
between the different generations (or cohorts) that have nothing to do with age per se, but rather reflect the
social and cultural experiences of different generations of individuals make them different from one another.

To illustrate this concept, consider the following survey findings. In recent years there has been significant
growth in the popular support of same-sex marriage. Many studies on this topic break down survey
participants into different age groups. In general, younger people are more supportive of same-sex marriage
than are those who are older (Jones, 2013). Does this mean that as we age we become less open to the idea of
same-sex marriage, or does this mean that older individuals have different perspectives because of the social
climates in which they grew up? Longitudinal research is a powerful approach because the same individuals
are involved in the research project over time, which means that the researchers need to be less concerned
with differences among cohorts affecting the results of their study.

Often longitudinal studies are employed when researching various diseases in an effort to understand
particular risk factors. Such studies often involve tens of thousands of individuals who are followed for several
decades. Given the enormous number of people involved in these studies, researchers can feel confident that
their findings can be generalized to the larger population. The Cancer Prevention Study-3 (CPS-3) is one of a
series of longitudinal studies sponsored by the American Cancer Society aimed at determining predictive risk
factors associated with cancer. When participants enter the study, they complete a survey about their lives and
family histories, providing information on factors that might cause or prevent the development of cancer. Then
every few years the participants receive additional surveys to complete. In the end, hundreds of thousands of
participants will be tracked over 20 years to determine which of them develop cancer and which do not.

Clearly, this type of research is important and potentially very informative. For instance, earlier longitudinal
studies sponsored by the American Cancer Society provided some of the first scientific demonstrations of the
now well-established links between increased rates of cancer and smoking (American Cancer Society, n.d.)
(Figure 2.11).

      cancer and other diseases. (credit: CDC/Debora Cartagena)
      As with any research strategy, longitudinal research is not without limitations. For one, these studies require
      an incredible time investment by the researcher and research participants. Given that some longitudinal
      studies take years, if not decades, to complete, the results will not be known for a considerable period of time.
      In addition to the time demands, these studies also require a substantial financial investment. Many
      researchers are unable to commit the resources necessary to see a longitudinal project through to the end.
      Research participants must also be willing to continue their participation for an extended period of time, and
      this can be problematic. People move, get married and take new names, get ill, and eventually die. Even
      without significant life changes, some people may simply choose to discontinue their participation in the
      project. As a result, the attrition rates, or reduction in the number of research participants due to dropouts, in
      longitudinal studies are quite high and increases over the course of a project. For this reason, researchers
      using this approach typically recruit many participants fully expecting that a substantial number will drop out
      before the end. As the study progresses, they continually check whether the sample still represents the larger
      population, and make adjustments as necessary.

    2.3 Analyzing Findings

      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Explain what a correlation coefficient tells us about the relationship between variables
        · Recognize that correlation does not indicate a cause-and-effect relationship between variables
        · Discuss our tendency to look for relationships between variables that do not really exist
        · Explain random sampling and assignment of participants into experimental and control groups
        · Discuss how experimenter or participant bias could affect the results of an experiment
        · Identify independent and dependent variables
      Did you know that as sales in ice cream increase, so does the overall rate of crime? Is it possible that indulging
      in your favorite flavor of ice cream could send you on a crime spree? Or, after committing crime do you think
      you might decide to treat yourself to a cone? There is no question that a relationship exists between ice cream
      and crime (e.g., Harper, 2013), but it would be pretty foolish to decide that one thing actually caused the other
      to occur.
      It is much more likely that both ice cream sales and crime rates are related to the temperature outside. When
      the temperature is warm, there are lots of people out of their houses, interacting with each other, getting
      annoyed with one another, and sometimes committing crimes. Also, when it is warm outside, we are more
      likely to seek a cool treat like ice cream. How do we determine if there is indeed a relationship between two
      things? And when there is a relationship, how can we discern whether it is attributable to coincidence or
      causation?

     Correlational Research

      Correlation means that there is a relationship between two or more variables (such as ice cream consumption
      and crime), but this relationship does not necessarily imply cause and effect. When two variables are

correlated, it simply means that as one variable changes, so does the other. We can measure correlation by
calculating a statistic known as a correlation coefficient. A correlation coefficient is a number from -1 to +1
that indicates the strength and direction of the relationship between variables. The correlation coefficient is
usually represented by the letter r.
The number portion of the correlation coefficient indicates the strength of the relationship. The closer the
number is to 1 (be it negative or positive), the more strongly related the variables are, and the more predictable
changes in one variable will be as the other variable changes. The closer the number is to zero, the weaker the
relationship, and the less predictable the relationships between the variables becomes. For instance, a
correlation coefficient of 0.9 indicates a far stronger relationship than a correlation coefficient of 0.3. If the
variables are not related to one another at all, the correlation coefficient is 0. The example above about ice
cream and crime is an example of two variables that we might expect to have no relationship to each other.
The sign--positive or negative--of the correlation coefficient indicates the direction of the relationship (Figure
2.12). A positive correlation means that the variables move in the same direction. Put another way, it means
that as one variable increases so does the other, and conversely, when one variable decreases so does the other.
A negative correlation means that the variables move in opposite directions. If two variables are negatively
correlated, a decrease in one variable is associated with an increase in the other and vice versa.
The example of ice cream and crime rates is a positive correlation because both variables increase when
temperatures are warmer. Other examples of positive correlations are the relationship between an individual's
height and weight or the relationship between a person's age and number of wrinkles. One might expect a
negative correlation to exist between someone's tiredness during the day and the number of hours they slept
the previous night: the amount of sleep decreases as the feelings of tiredness increase. In a real-world example
of negative correlation, student researchers at the University of Minnesota found a weak negative correlation (r
= -0.29) between the average number of days per week that students got fewer than 5 hours of sleep and their
GPA (Lowry, Dean, & Manders, 2010). Keep in mind that a negative correlation is not the same as no
correlation. For example, we would probably find no correlation between hours of sleep and shoe size.
As mentioned earlier, correlations have predictive value. Imagine that you are on the admissions committee of
a major university. You are faced with a huge number of applications, but you are able to accommodate only a
small percentage of the applicant pool. How might you decide who should be admitted? You might try to
correlate your current students' college GPA with their scores on standardized tests like the SAT or ACT. By
observing which correlations were strongest for your current students, you could use this information to
predict relative success of those students who have applied for admission into the university.

FIGURE 2.12 Scatterplots are a graphical view of the strength and direction of correlations. The stronger the
correlation, the closer the data points are to a straight line. In these examples, we see that there is (a) a positive
correlation between weight and height, (b) a negative correlation between tiredness and hours of sleep, and (c) no
correlation between shoe size and hours of sleep.

      Correlation Does Not Indicate Causation
      Correlational research is useful because it allows us to discover the strength and direction of relationships that
      exist between two variables. However, correlation is limited because establishing the existence of a
      relationship tells us little about cause and effect. While variables are sometimes correlated because one does
      cause the other, it could also be that some other factor, a confounding variable, is actually causing the
      systematic movement in our variables of interest. In the ice cream/crime rate example mentioned earlier,
      temperature is a confounding variable that could account for the relationship between the two variables.
      Even when we cannot point to clear confounding variables, we should not assume that a correlation between
      two variables implies that one variable causes changes in another. This can be frustrating when a cause-and-
      effect relationship seems clear and intuitive. Think back to our discussion of the research done by the
      American Cancer Society and how their research projects were some of the first demonstrations of the link
      between smoking and cancer. It seems reasonable to assume that smoking causes cancer, but if we were
      limited to correlational research, we would be overstepping our bounds by making this assumption.
      Unfortunately, people mistakenly make claims of causation as a function of correlations all the time. Such
      claims are especially common in advertisements and news stories. For example, recent research found that
      people who eat cereal on a regular basis achieve healthier weights than those who rarely eat cereal (Frantzen,
      Treviño, Echon, Garcia-Dominic, & DiMarco, 2013; Barton et al., 2005). Guess how the cereal companies report
      this finding. Does eating cereal really cause an individual to maintain a healthy weight, or are there other
      possible explanations, such as, someone at a healthy weight is more likely to regularly eat a healthy breakfast
      than someone who is obese or someone who avoids meals in an attempt to diet (Figure 2.13)? While
      correlational research is invaluable in identifying relationships among variables, a major limitation is the
      inability to establish causality. Psychologists want to make statements about cause and effect, but the only way
      to do that is to conduct an experiment to answer a research question. The next section describes how scientific
      experiments incorporate methods that eliminate, or control for, alternative explanations, which allow
      researchers to explore how changes in one variable cause changes in another variable.

      Illusory Correlations
      The temptation to make erroneous cause-and-effect statements based on correlational research is not the only
      way we tend to misinterpret data. We also tend to make the mistake of illusory correlations, especially with
      unsystematic observations. Illusory correlations, or false correlations, occur when people believe that
      relationships exist between two things when no such relationship exists. One well-known illusory correlation
      is the supposed effect that the moon's phases have on human behavior. Many people passionately assert that
      human behavior is affected by the phase of the moon, and specifically, that people act strangely when the

       Access for free at openstax.org

moon is full (Figure 2.14).

          FIGURE 2.14 Many people believe that a full moon makes people behave oddly. (credit: Cory Zanker)

There is no denying that the moon exerts a powerful influence on our planet. The ebb and flow of the ocean's
tides are tightly tied to the gravitational forces of the moon. Many people believe, therefore, that it is logical
that we are affected by the moon as well. After all, our bodies are largely made up of water. A meta-analysis of
nearly 40 studies consistently demonstrated, however, that the relationship between the moon and our
behavior does not exist (Rotton & Kelly, 1985). While we may pay more attention to odd behavior during the full
phase of the moon, the rates of odd behavior remain constant throughout the lunar cycle.

Why are we so apt to believe in illusory correlations like this? Often we read or hear about them and simply
accept the information as valid. Or, we have a hunch about how something works and then look for evidence to
support that hunch, ignoring evidence that would tell us our hunch is false; this is known as confirmation
bias. Other times, we find illusory correlations based on the information that comes most easily to mind, even
if that information is severely limited. And while we may feel confident that we can use these relationships to
better understand and predict the world around us, illusory correlations can have significant drawbacks. For
example, research suggests that illusory correlations--in which certain behaviors are inaccurately attributed to
certain groups--are involved in the formation of prejudicial attitudes that can ultimately lead to discriminatory
behavior (Fiedler, 2004).

Causality: Conducting Experiments and Using the Data

As you've learned, the only way to establish that there is a cause-and-effect relationship between two variables
is to conduct a scientific experiment. Experiment has a different meaning in the scientific context than in
everyday life. In everyday conversation, we often use it to describe trying something for the first time, such as
experimenting with a new hair style or a new food. However, in the scientific context, an experiment has
precise requirements for design and implementation.

The Experimental Hypothesis

In order to conduct an experiment, a researcher must have a specific hypothesis to be tested. As you've
learned, hypotheses can be formulated either through direct observation of the real world or after careful
review of previous research. For example, if you think that the use of technology in the classroom has negative
impacts on learning, then you have basically formulated a hypothesis--namely, that the use of technology in
the classroom should be limited because it decreases learning. How might you have arrived at this particular
hypothesis? You may have noticed that your classmates who take notes on their laptops perform at lower levels
on class exams than those who take notes by hand, or those who receive a lesson via a computer program
versus via an in-person teacher have different levels of performance when tested (Figure 2.15).
52 2 · Psychological Research

      FIGURE 2.15 How might the use of technology in the classroom impact learning? (credit: modification of work by
      Nikolay Georgiev/Pixabay)
      These sorts of personal observations are what often lead us to formulate a specific hypothesis, but we cannot
      use limited personal observations and anecdotal evidence to rigorously test our hypothesis. Instead, to find out
      if real-world data supports our hypothesis, we have to conduct an experiment.
      Designing an Experiment
      The most basic experimental design involves two groups: the experimental group and the control group. The
      two groups are designed to be the same except for one difference-- experimental manipulation. The
      experimental group gets the experimental manipulation--that is, the treatment or variable being tested (in
      this case, the use of technology)--and the control group does not. Since experimental manipulation is the only
      difference between the experimental and control groups, we can be sure that any differences between the two
      are due to experimental manipulation rather than chance.
      In our example of how the use of technology should be limited in the classroom, we have the experimental
      group learn algebra using a computer program and then test their learning. We measure the learning in our
      control group after they are taught algebra by a teacher in a traditional classroom. It is important for the
      control group to be treated similarly to the experimental group, with the exception that the control group does
      not receive the experimental manipulation.
      We also need to precisely define, or operationalize, how we measure learning of algebra. An operational
      definition is a precise description of our variables, and it is important in allowing others to understand exactly
      how and what a researcher measures in a particular experiment. In operationalizing learning, we might
      choose to look at performance on a test covering the material on which the individuals were taught by the
      teacher or the computer program. We might also ask our participants to summarize the information that was
      just presented in some way. Whatever we determine, it is important that we operationalize learning in such a
      way that anyone who hears about our study for the first time knows exactly what we mean by learning. This
      aids peoples' ability to interpret our data as well as their capacity to repeat our experiment should they choose
      to do so.
      Once we have operationalized what is considered use of technology and what is considered learning in our
      experiment participants, we need to establish how we will run our experiment. In this case, we might have
      participants spend 45 minutes learning algebra (either through a computer program or with an in-person
      math teacher) and then give them a test on the material covered during the 45 minutes.

Ideally, the people who score the tests are unaware of who was assigned to the experimental or control group,
in order to control for experimenter bias. Experimenter bias refers to the possibility that a researcher's
expectations might skew the results of the study. Remember, conducting an experiment requires a lot of
planning, and the people involved in the research project have a vested interest in supporting their
hypotheses. If the observers knew which child was in which group, it might influence how they interpret
ambiguous responses, such as sloppy handwriting or minor computational mistakes. By being blind to which
child is in which group, we protect against those biases. This situation is a single-blind study, meaning that
one of the groups (participants) are unaware as to which group they are in (experiment or control group) while
the researcher who developed the experiment knows which participants are in each group.
In a double-blind study, both the researchers and the participants are blind to group assignments. Why would
a researcher want to run a study where no one knows who is in which group? Because by doing so, we can
control for both experimenter and participant expectations. If you are familiar with the phrase placebo effect,
you already have some idea as to why this is an important consideration. The placebo effect occurs when
people's expectations or beliefs influence or determine their experience in a given situation. In other words,
simply expecting something to happen can actually make it happen.
The placebo effect is commonly described in terms of testing the effectiveness of a new medication. Imagine
that you work in a pharmaceutical company, and you think you have a new drug that is effective in treating
depression. To demonstrate that your medication is effective, you run an experiment with two groups: The
experimental group receives the medication, and the control group does not. But you don't want participants
to know whether they received the drug or not.
Why is that? Imagine that you are a participant in this study, and you have just taken a pill that you think will
improve your mood. Because you expect the pill to have an effect, you might feel better simply because you
took the pill and not because of any drug actually contained in the pill--this is the placebo effect.
To make sure that any effects on mood are due to the drug and not due to expectations, the control group
receives a placebo (in this case a sugar pill). Now everyone gets a pill, and once again neither the researcher
nor the experimental participants know who got the drug and who got the sugar pill. Any differences in mood
between the experimental and control groups can now be attributed to the drug itself rather than to
experimenter bias or participant expectations (Figure 2.16).

Independent and Dependent Variables
In a research experiment, we strive to study whether changes in one thing cause changes in another. To
achieve this, we must pay attention to two important variables, or things that can be changed, in any
54 2 · Psychological Research

      experimental study: the independent variable and the dependent variable. An independent variable is
      manipulated or controlled by the experimenter. In a well-designed experimental study, the independent
      variable is the only important difference between the experimental and control groups. In our example of how
      technology use in the classroom affects learning, the independent variable is the type of learning by
      participants in the study (Figure 2.17). A dependent variable is what the researcher measures to see how
      much effect the independent variable had. In our example, the dependent variable is the learning exhibited by
      our participants.

      FIGURE 2.17 In an experiment, manipulations of the independent variable are expected to result in changes in the
      dependent variable. (credit: "classroom" modification of work by Nikolay Georgiev/Pixabay; credit "note taking":
      modification of work by KF/Wikimedia)
      We expect that the dependent variable will change as a function of the independent variable. In other words,
     the dependent variable depends on the independent variable. A good way to think about the relationship
      between the independent and dependent variables is with this question: What effect does the independent
      variable have on the dependent variable? Returning to our example, what is the effect of being taught a lesson
      through a computer program versus through an in-person instructor?
      Selecting and Assigning Experimental Participants
      Now that our study is designed, we need to obtain a sample of individuals to include in our experiment. Our
      study involves human participants so we need to determine who to include. Participants are the subjects of
      psychological research, and as the name implies, individuals who are involved in psychological research
      actively participate in the process. Often, psychological research projects rely on college students to serve as
      participants. In fact, the vast majority of research in psychology subfields has historically involved students as
      research participants (Sears, 1986; Arnett, 2008). But are college students truly representative of the general
      population? College students tend to be younger, more educated, more liberal, and less diverse than the
      general population. Although using students as test subjects is an accepted practice, relying on such a limited
      pool of research participants can be problematic because it is difficult to generalize findings to the larger
      population.
      Our hypothetical experiment involves high school students, and we must first generate a sample of students.
      Samples are used because populations are usually too large to reasonably involve every member in our
      particular experiment (Figure 2.18). If possible, we should use a random sample (there are other types of

       Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                                                          2.3 · Analyzing Findings 55

samples, but for the purposes of this chapter, we will focus on random samples). A random sample is a subset
of a larger population in which every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.
Random samples are preferred because if the sample is large enough we can be reasonably sure that the
participating individuals are representative of the larger population. This means that the percentages of
characteristics in the sample--sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic level, and any other characteristics that might
affect the results--are close to those percentages in the larger population.
In our example, let's say we decide our population of interest is algebra students. But all algebra students is a
very large population, so we need to be more specific; instead we might say our population of interest is all
algebra students in a particular city. We should include students from various income brackets, family
situations, races, ethnicities, religions, and geographic areas of town. With this more manageable population,
we can work with the local schools in selecting a random sample of around 200 algebra students who we want
to participate in our experiment.
In summary, because we cannot test all of the algebra students in a city, we want to find a group of about 200
that reflects the composition of that city. With a representative group, we can generalize our findings to the
larger population without fear of our sample being biased in some way.

FIGURE 2.18 Researchers may work with (a) a large population or (b) a sample group that is a subset of the larger
population. (credit "crowd": modification of work by James Cridland; credit "students": modification of work by
Laurie Sullivan)
Now that we have a sample, the next step of the experimental process is to split the participants into
experimental and control groups through random assignment. With random assignment, all participants
have an equal chance of being assigned to either group. There is statistical software that will randomly assign
each of the algebra students in the sample to either the experimental or the control group.
Random assignment is critical for sound experimental design. With sufficiently large samples, random
assignment makes it unlikely that there are systematic differences between the groups. So, for instance, it
would be very unlikely that we would get one group composed entirely of males, a given ethnic identity, or a
given religious ideology. This is important because if the groups were systematically different before the
experiment began, we would not know the origin of any differences we find between the groups: Were the
differences preexisting, or were they caused by manipulation of the independent variable? Random
assignment allows us to assume that any differences observed between experimental and control groups
result from the manipulation of the independent variable.

Issues to Consider
While experiments allow scientists to make cause-and-effect claims, they are not without problems. True
56 2 · Psychological Research

      experiments require the experimenter to manipulate an independent variable, and that can complicate many
      questions that psychologists might want to address. For instance, imagine that you want to know what effect
      sex (the independent variable) has on spatial memory (the dependent variable). Although you can certainly
      look for differences between males and females on a task that taps into spatial memory, you cannot directly
      control a person's sex. We categorize this type of research approach as quasi-experimental and recognize that
      we cannot make cause-and-effect claims in these circumstances.

      Experimenters are also limited by ethical constraints. For instance, you would not be able to conduct an
      experiment designed to determine if experiencing abuse as a child leads to lower levels of self-esteem among
      adults. To conduct such an experiment, you would need to randomly assign some experimental participants to
      a group that receives abuse, and that experiment would be unethical.

      Interpreting Experimental Findings

      Once data is collected from both the experimental and the control groups, a statistical analysis is conducted to
      find out if there are meaningful differences between the two groups. A statistical analysis determines how
      likely any difference found is due to chance (and thus not meaningful). For example, if an experiment is done
      on the effectiveness of a nutritional supplement, and those taking a placebo pill (and not the supplement) have
      the same result as those taking the supplement, then the experiment has shown that the nutritional
      supplement is not effective. Generally, psychologists consider differences to be statistically significant if there
      is less than a five percent chance of observing them if the groups did not actually differ from one another.
      Stated another way, psychologists want to limit the chances of making "false positive" claims to five percent or
      less.

      The greatest strength of experiments is the ability to assert that any significant differences in the findings are
      caused by the independent variable. This occurs because random selection, random assignment, and a design
      that limits the effects of both experimenter bias and participant expectancy should create groups that are
      similar in composition and treatment. Therefore, any difference between the groups is attributable to the
      independent variable, and now we can finally make a causal statement. If we find that watching a violent
      television program results in more violent behavior than watching a nonviolent program, we can safely say
      that watching violent television programs causes an increase in the display of violent behavior.

      Reporting Research

      When psychologists complete a research project, they generally want to share their findings with other
      scientists. The American Psychological Association (APA) publishes a manual detailing how to write a paper for
     submission to scientific journals. Unlike an article that might be published in a magazine like Psychology
     Today, which targets a general audience with an interest in psychology, scientific journals generally publish
      peer-reviewed journal articles aimed at an audience of professionals and scholars who are actively involved
      in research themselves.

      A peer-reviewed journal article is read by several other scientists (generally anonymously) with expertise in
      the subject matter. These peer reviewers provide feedback--to both the author and the journal
      editor--regarding the quality of the draft. Peer reviewers look for a strong rationale for the research being
      described, a clear description of how the research was conducted, and evidence that the research was
      conducted in an ethical manner. They also look for flaws in the study's design, methods, and statistical
      analyses. They check that the conclusions drawn by the authors seem reasonable given the observations made
      during the research. Peer reviewers also comment on how valuable the research is in advancing the

discipline's knowledge. This helps prevent unnecessary duplication of research findings in the scientific
literature and, to some extent, ensures that each research article provides new information. Ultimately, the
journal editor will compile all of the peer reviewer feedback and determine whether the article will be
published in its current state (a rare occurrence), published with revisions, or not accepted for publication.

Peer review provides some degree of quality control for psychological research. Poorly conceived or executed
studies can be weeded out, and even well-designed research can be improved by the revisions suggested. Peer
review also ensures that the research is described clearly enough to allow other scientists to replicate it,
meaning they can repeat the experiment using different samples to determine reliability. Sometimes
replications involve additional measures that expand on the original finding. In any case, each replication
serves to provide more evidence to support the original research findings. Successful replications of published
research make scientists more apt to adopt those findings, while repeated failures tend to cast doubt on the
legitimacy of the original article and lead scientists to look elsewhere. For example, it would be a major
advancement in the medical field if a published study indicated that taking a new drug helped individuals
achieve a healthy weight without changing their diet. But if other scientists could not replicate the results, the
original study's claims would be questioned.

In recent years, there has been increasing concern about a "replication crisis" that has affected a number of
scientific fields, including psychology. Some of the most well-known studies and scientists have produced
research that has failed to be replicated by others (as discussed in Shrout & Rodgers, 2018). In fact, even a
famous Nobel Prize-winning scientist has recently retracted a published paper because she had difficulty
replicating her results (Nobel Prize-winning scientist Frances Arnold retracts paper, 2020 January 3). These
kinds of outcomes have prompted some scientists to begin to work together and more openly, and some would
argue that the current "crisis" is actually improving the ways in which science is conducted and in how its
results are shared with others (Aschwanden, 2018).

                                                                                                             DIG DEEPER

 The Vaccine-Autism Myth and Retraction of Published Studies

  Some scientists have claimed that routine childhood vaccines cause some children to develop autism, and, in
  fact, several peer-reviewed publications published research making these claims. Since the initial reports, large-
  scale epidemiological research has indicated that vaccinations are not responsible for causing autism and that it
  is much safer to have your child vaccinated than not. Furthermore, several of the original studies making this
  claim have since been retracted.

  A published piece of work can be rescinded when data is called into question because of falsification, fabrication,
  or serious research design problems. Once rescinded, the scientific community is informed that there are serious
  problems with the original publication. Retractions can be initiated by the researcher who led the study, by
  research collaborators, by the institution that employed the researcher, or by the editorial board of the journal in
  which the article was originally published. In the vaccine-autism case, the retraction was made because of a
  significant conflict of interest in which the leading researcher had a financial interest in establishing a link
  between childhood vaccines and autism (Offit, 2008). Unfortunately, the initial studies received so much media
  attention that many parents around the world became hesitant to have their children vaccinated (Figure 2.19).
  Continued reliance on such debunked studies has significant consequences. For instance, between January and
  October of 2019, there were 22 measles outbreaks across the United States and more than a thousand cases of
  individuals contracting measles (Patel et al., 2019). This is likely due to the anti-vaccination movements that
  have risen from the debunked research. For more information about how the vaccine/autism story unfolded, as
  well as the repercussions of this story, take a look at Paul Offit's book, Autism's False Prophets: Bad Science,
  Risky Medicine, and the Search for a Cure.

     Reliability and Validity

      Reliability and validity are two important considerations that must be made with any type of data collection.
      Reliability refers to the ability to consistently produce a given result. In the context of psychological research,
      this would mean that any instruments or tools used to collect data do so in consistent, reproducible ways.
      There are a number of different types of reliability. Some of these include inter-rater reliability (the degree to
      which two or more different observers agree on what has been observed), internal consistency (the degree to
      which different items on a survey that measure the same thing correlate with one another), and test-retest
      reliability (the degree to which the outcomes of a particular measure remain consistent over multiple
      administrations).
      Unfortunately, being consistent in measurement does not necessarily mean that you have measured
      something correctly. To illustrate this concept, consider a kitchen scale that would be used to measure the
      weight of cereal that you eat in the morning. If the scale is not properly calibrated, it may consistently under-
      or overestimate the amount of cereal that's being measured. While the scale is highly reliable in producing
      consistent results (e.g., the same amount of cereal poured onto the scale produces the same reading each
      time), those results are incorrect. This is where validity comes into play. Validity refers to the extent to which a
      given instrument or tool accurately measures what it's supposed to measure, and once again, there are a
      number of ways in which validity can be expressed. Ecological validity (the degree to which research results
      generalize to real-world applications), construct validity (the degree to which a given variable actually captures
      or measures what it is intended to measure), and face validity (the degree to which a given variable seems valid
      on the surface) are just a few types that researchers consider. While any valid measure is by necessity reliable,
      the reverse is not necessarily true. Researchers strive to use instruments that are both highly reliable and
      valid.

 How Valid Are the SAT and ACT?

  Standardized tests like the SAT and ACT are supposed to measure an individual's aptitude for a college
  education, but how reliable and valid are such tests? Research conducted by the College Board suggests that
  scores on the SAT have high predictive validity for first-year college students' GPA (Kobrin, Patterson, Shaw,
  Mattern, & Barbuti, 2008). In this context, predictive validity refers to the test's ability to effectively predict the
  GPA of college freshmen. Given that many institutions of higher education require the SAT or ACT for admission,
  this high degree of predictive validity might be comforting.

  However, the emphasis placed on SAT or ACT scores in college admissions is changing based on a number of
  factors. For one, some researchers assert that these tests are biased, and students from historically marginalized
  populations are at a disadvantage that unfairly reduces the likelihood of being admitted into a college (Santelices
  & Wilson, 2010). Additionally, some research has suggested that the predictive validity of these tests is grossly
  exaggerated in how well they are able to predict the GPA of first-year college students. In fact, it has been
  suggested that the SAT's predictive validity may be overestimated by as much as 150% (Rothstein, 2004). Many
  institutions of higher education are beginning to consider de-emphasizing the significance of SAT scores in
  making admission decisions (Rimer, 2008).

  Recent examples of high profile cheating scandals both domestically and abroad have only increased the scrutiny
  being placed on these types of tests, and as of March 2019, more than 1000 institutions of higher education have
  either relaxed or eliminated the requirements for SAT or ACT testing for admissions (Strauss, 2019, March 19).

2.4 Ethics

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Discuss how research involving human subjects is regulated
  · Summarize the processes of informed consent and debriefing
  · Explain how research involving animal subjects is regulated

Today, scientists agree that good research is ethical in nature and is guided by a basic respect for human
dignity and safety. However, as you will read in the feature box, this has not always been the case. Modern
researchers must demonstrate that the research they perform is ethically sound. This section presents how
ethical considerations affect the design and implementation of research conducted today.

Research Involving Human Participants

Any experiment involving the participation of human subjects is governed by extensive, strict guidelines
designed to ensure that the experiment does not result in harm. Any research institution that receives federal
support for research involving human participants must have access to an institutional review board (IRB).
The IRB is a committee of individuals often made up of members of the institution's administration, scientists,
and community members (Figure 2.20). The purpose of the IRB is to review proposals for research that
involves human participants. The IRB reviews these proposals with the principles mentioned above in mind,
and generally, approval from the IRB is required in order for the experiment to proceed.
60 2 · Psychological Research

      FIGURE 2.20 An institution's IRB meets regularly to review experimental proposals that involve human
      participants. (credit: International Hydropower Association/Flickr)
      An institution's IRB requires several components in any experiment it approves. For one, each participant
      must sign an informed consent form before they can participate in the experiment. An informed consent form
      provides a written description of what participants can expect during the experiment, including potential risks
      and implications of the research. It also lets participants know that their involvement is completely voluntary
      and can be discontinued without penalty at any time. Furthermore, the informed consent guarantees that any
      data collected in the experiment will remain completely confidential. In cases where research participants are
      under the age of 18, the parents or legal guardians are required to sign the informed consent form.

          LINK TO LEARNING

      View this example of a consent form (http://openstax.org/l/consentform) to learn more.

      While the informed consent form should be as honest as possible in describing exactly what participants will
      be doing, sometimes deception is necessary to prevent participants' knowledge of the exact research question
      from affecting the results of the study. Deception involves purposely misleading experiment participants in
      order to maintain the integrity of the experiment, but not to the point where the deception could be considered
      harmful. For example, if we are interested in how our opinion of someone is affected by their attire, we might
      use deception in describing the experiment to prevent that knowledge from affecting participants' responses.
      In cases where deception is involved, participants must receive a full debriefing upon conclusion of the
      study--complete, honest information about the purpose of the experiment, how the data collected will be used,
      the reasons why deception was necessary, and information about how to obtain additional information about
      the study.

                                                                                                                  DIG DEEPER
      Ethics and the Tuskegee Syphilis Study

        Unfortunately, the ethical guidelines that exist for research today were not always applied in the past. In 1932,
        rural, Black men from Tuskegee, Alabama, were recruited to participate in an experiment conducted by the U.S.
        Public Health Service, with the aim of studying syphilis in Black men (Figure 2.21). In exchange for free medical
        care, meals, and burial insurance, 600 men agreed to participate in the study. A little more than half of the men
        tested positive for syphilis, and they served as the experimental group (given that the researchers could not
        randomly assign participants to groups, this represents a quasi-experiment). The remaining syphilis-free

  individuals served as the control group. However, those individuals that tested positive for syphilis were never
  informed that they had the disease.
  While there was no treatment for syphilis when the study began, by 1947 penicillin was recognized as an
  effective treatment for the disease. Despite this, no penicillin was administered to the participants in this study,
  and the participants were not allowed to seek treatment at any other facilities if they continued in the study. Over
  the course of 40 years, many of the participants unknowingly spread syphilis to their wives (and subsequently
  their children born from their wives) and eventually died because they never received treatment for the disease.
  This study was discontinued in 1972 when the experiment was discovered by the national press (Tuskegee
  University, n.d.). The resulting outrage over the experiment led directly to the National Research Act of 1974 and
  the strict ethical guidelines for research on humans described in this chapter. Why is this study unethical? How
  were the men who participated and their families harmed as a function of this research?

Research Involving Animal Subjects

Many psychologists conduct research involving animal subjects. Often, these researchers use rodents (Figure
2.22) or birds as the subjects of their experiments--the APA estimates that 90% of all animal research in
psychology uses these species (American Psychological Association, n.d.). Because many basic processes in
animals are sufficiently similar to those in humans, these animals are acceptable substitutes for research that
would be considered unethical in human participants.

                FIGURE 2.22 Rats, like the one shown here, often serve as the subjects of animal research.
This does not mean that animal researchers are immune to ethical concerns. Indeed, the humane and ethical
62 2 · Psychological Research

      treatment of animal research subjects is a critical aspect of this type of research. Researchers must design
      their experiments to minimize any pain or distress experienced by animals serving as research subjects.
      Whereas IRBs review research proposals that involve human participants, animal experimental proposals are
      reviewed by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). An IACUC consists of institutional
      administrators, scientists, veterinarians, and community members. This committee is charged with ensuring
      that all experimental proposals require the humane treatment of animal research subjects. It also conducts
      semi-annual inspections of all animal facilities to ensure that the research protocols are being followed. No
      animal research project can proceed without the committee's approval.

Summary

2.1 Why Is Research Important?

Scientists are engaged in explaining and understanding how the world around them works, and they are able
to do so by coming up with theories that generate hypotheses that are testable and falsifiable. Theories that
stand up to their tests are retained and refined, while those that do not are discarded or modified. In this way,
research enables scientists to separate fact from simple opinion. Having good information generated from
research aids in making wise decisions both in public policy and in our personal lives.

2.2 Approaches to Research

The clinical or case study involves studying just a few individuals for an extended period of time. While this
approach provides an incredible depth of information, the ability to generalize these observations to the larger
population is problematic. Naturalistic observation involves observing behavior in a natural setting and allows

Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                                                                   2 · Summary 65

for the collection of valid, true-to-life information from realistic situations. However, naturalistic observation
does not allow for much control and often requires quite a bit of time and money to perform. Researchers
strive to ensure that their tools for collecting data are both reliable (consistent and replicable) and valid
(accurate).

Surveys can be administered in a number of ways and make it possible to collect large amounts of data quickly.
However, the depth of information that can be collected through surveys is somewhat limited compared to a
clinical or case study.

Archival research involves studying existing data sets to answer research questions.

Longitudinal research has been incredibly helpful to researchers who need to collect data on how people
change over time. Cross-sectional research compares multiple segments of a population at a single time.

2.3 Analyzing Findings

A correlation is described with a correlation coefficient, r, which ranges from -1 to 1. The correlation
coefficient tells us about the nature (positive or negative) and the strength of the relationship between two or
more variables. Correlations do not tell us anything about causation--regardless of how strong the relationship
is between variables. In fact, the only way to demonstrate causation is by conducting an experiment. People
often make the mistake of claiming that correlations exist when they really do not.

Researchers can test cause-and-effect hypotheses by conducting experiments. Ideally, experimental
participants are randomly selected from the population of interest. Then, the participants are randomly
assigned to their respective groups. Sometimes, the researcher and the participants are blind to group
membership to prevent their expectations from influencing the results.

In ideal experimental design, the only difference between the experimental and control groups is whether
participants are exposed to the experimental manipulation. Each group goes through all phases of the
experiment, but each group will experience a different level of the independent variable: the experimental
group is exposed to the experimental manipulation, and the control group is not exposed to the experimental
manipulation. The researcher then measures the changes that are produced in the dependent variable in each
group. Once data is collected from both groups, it is analyzed statistically to determine if there are meaningful
differences between the groups.

Psychologists report their research findings in peer-reviewed journal articles. Research published in this
format is checked by several other psychologists who serve as a filter separating ideas that are supported by
evidence from ideas that are not. Replication has an important role in ensuring the legitimacy of published
research. In the long run, only those findings that are capable of being replicated consistently will achieve
consensus in the scientific community.

2.4 Ethics

Ethics in research is an evolving field, and some practices that were accepted or tolerated in the past would be
considered unethical today. Researchers are expected to adhere to basic ethical guidelines when conducting
experiments that involve human participants. Any experiment involving human participants must be
approved by an IRB. Participation in experiments is voluntary and requires informed consent of the
participants. If any deception is involved in the experiment, each participant must be fully debriefed upon the
conclusion of the study.

Animal research is also held to a high ethical standard. Researchers who use animals as experimental subjects
must design their projects so that pain and distress are minimized. Animal research requires the approval of
an IACUC, and all animal facilities are subject to regular inspections to ensure that animals are being treated
humanely.

Critical Thinking Questions

25. In this section, there was a discussion about researchers arriving at different conclusions about the use of
      technology in certain student populations, with one study determining that a smartphone app for surgery
      students seemed effective, but another study finding negative impacts on sleep, communication, and time
      management resulting from the use of technology by undergraduates. How might an educational leader
      best work through these discrepancies?

26. The scientific method is often described as self-correcting and cyclical. Briefly describe your
      understanding of the scientific method with regard to these concepts.

27. In this section, conjoined twins, Krista and Tatiana, were described as being potential participants in a
      case study. In what other circumstances would you think that this particular research approach would be
      especially helpful and why?

28. Presumably, reality television programs aim to provide a realistic portrayal of the behavior displayed by
      the characters featured in such programs. This section pointed out why this is not really the case. What
      changes could be made in the way that these programs are produced that would result in more honest
      portrayals of realistic behavior?

29. Which of the research methods discussed in this section would be best suited to study the impact of diet
      and exercise on the prevalence of a disease such as diabetes? Why?

30. Aside from biomedical research, what other areas of research could greatly benefit by both longitudinal
      and archival research?

31. Earlier in this section, we read about research suggesting that there is a correlation between eating cereal
      and weight. Cereal companies that present this information in their advertisements could lead someone
      to believe that eating more cereal causes healthy weight. Why would they make such a claim and what
      arguments could you make to counter this cause-and-effect claim?

32. Recently a study was published in the journal, Nutrition and Cancer, which established a negative
      correlation between coffee consumption and breast cancer. Specifically, it was found that women
      consuming more than 5 cups of coffee a day were less likely to develop breast cancer than women who
      never consumed coffee (Lowcock, Cotterchio, Anderson, Boucher, & El-Sohemy, 2013). Imagine you see a
      newspaper story about this research that says, "Coffee Protects Against Cancer." Why is this headline
      misleading and why would a more accurate headline draw less interest?

33. Sometimes, true random sampling can be very difficult to obtain. Many researchers make use of
      convenience samples as an alternative. For example, one popular convenience sample would involve
      students enrolled in Introduction to Psychology courses. What are the implications of using this sampling
      technique?

34. Peer review is an important part of publishing research findings in many scientific disciplines. This
      process is normally conducted anonymously; in other words, the author of the article being reviewed does
      not know who is reviewing the article, and the reviewers are unaware of the author's identity. Why would
      this be an important part of this process?

3.5 The Endocrine System

INTRODUCTION Have you ever taken a device apart to find out how it works? Many of us have done so,
whether to attempt a repair or simply to satisfy our curiosity. A device's internal workings are often distinct
from its user interface on the outside. For example, we don't think about microchips and circuits when we turn
up the volume on a mobile phone; instead, we think about getting the volume just right. Similarly, the inner
workings of the human body are often distinct from the external expression of those workings. It is the job of
psychologists to find the connection between these--for example, to figure out how the firings of millions of
neurons become a thought.

This chapter strives to explain the biological mechanisms that underlie behavior. These physiological and
anatomical foundations are the basis for many areas of psychology. In this chapter, you will learn how genetics
influence both physiological and psychological traits. You will become familiar with the structure and function
of the nervous system. And, finally, you will learn how the nervous system interacts with the endocrine system.

      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Explain the basic principles of the theory of evolution by natural selection
        · Describe the differences between genotype and phenotype
        · Discuss how gene-environment interactions are critical for expression of physical and psychological

            characteristics
      Psychological researchers study genetics in order to better understand the biological factors that contribute to
      certain behaviors. While all humans share certain biological mechanisms, we are each unique. And while our
      bodies have many of the same parts--brains and hormones and cells with genetic codes--these are expressed
      in a wide variety of behaviors, thoughts, and reactions.
      Why do two people infected by the same disease have different outcomes: one surviving and one succumbing
      to the ailment? How are genetic diseases passed through family lines? Are there genetic components to
      psychological disorders, such as depression or schizophrenia? To what extent might there be a psychological
      basis to health conditions such as childhood obesity?
      To explore these questions, let's start by focusing on a specific genetic disorder, sickle cell anemia, and how it
      might manifest in two affected sisters. Sickle-cell anemia is a genetic condition in which red blood cells, which
      are normally round, take on a crescent-like shape (Figure 3.2). The changed shape of these cells affects how
      they function: sickle-shaped cells can clog blood vessels and block blood flow, leading to high fever, severe
      pain, swelling, and tissue damage.

      FIGURE 3.2 Normal blood cells travel freely through the blood vessels, while sickle-shaped cells form blockages
      preventing blood flow.
      Many people with sickle-cell anemia--and the particular genetic mutation that causes it--die at an early age.
      While the notion of "survival of the fittest" may suggest that people with this disorder have a low survival rate
      and therefore the disorder will become less common, this is not the case. Despite the negative evolutionary
      effects associated with this genetic mutation, the sickle-cell gene remains relatively common among people of
      African descent. Why is this? The explanation is illustrated with the following scenario.
      Imagine two young women--Luwi and Sena--sisters in rural Zambia, Africa. Luwi carries the gene for sickle-
      cell anemia; Sena does not carry the gene. Sickle-cell carriers have one copy of the sickle-cell gene but do not
      have full-blown sickle-cell anemia. They experience symptoms only if they are severely dehydrated or are
      deprived of oxygen (as in mountain climbing). Carriers are thought to be immune from malaria (an often
      deadly disease that is widespread in tropical climates) because changes in their blood chemistry and immune
      functioning prevent the malaria parasite from having its effects (Gong, Parikh, Rosenthal, & Greenhouse,
      2013). However, full-blown sickle-cell anemia, with two copies of the sickle-cell gene, does not provide
      immunity to malaria.

While walking home from school, both sisters are bitten by mosquitoes carrying the malaria parasite. Luwi is
protected against malaria because she carries the sickle-cell mutation. Sena, on the other hand, develops
malaria and dies just two weeks later. Luwi survives and eventually has children, to whom she may pass on the
sickle-cell mutation.

Malaria is rare in the United States, so the sickle-cell gene benefits nobody: the gene manifests primarily in
minor health problems for carriers with one copy, or a severe full-blown disease with no health benefits for
carriers with two copies. However, the situation is quite different in other parts of the world. In parts of Africa
where malaria is prevalent, having the sickle-cell mutation does provide health benefits for carriers
(protection from malaria).
The story of malaria fits with Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection (Figure 3.3). In simple
terms, the theory states that organisms that are better suited for their environment will survive and reproduce,
while those that are poorly suited for their environment will die off. In our example, we can see that, as a
carrier, Luwi's mutation is highly adaptive in her African homeland; however, if she resided in the United
States (where malaria is rare), her mutation could prove costly--with a high probability of the disease in her
descendants and minor health problems of her own.

 Two Perspectives on Genetics and Behavior

  It's easy to get confused about two fields that study the interaction of genes and the environment, such as the
  fields of evolutionary psychology and behavioral genetics. How can we tell them apart?
  In both fields, it is understood that genes not only code for particular traits, but also contribute to certain
  patterns of cognition and behavior. Evolutionary psychology focuses on how universal patterns of behavior and
  cognitive processes have evolved over time. Therefore, variations in cognition and behavior would make
  individuals more or less successful in reproducing and passing those genes on to their offspring. Evolutionary
  psychologists study a variety of psychological phenomena that may have evolved as adaptations, including fear
74 3 · Biopsychology

        response, food preferences, mate selection, and cooperative behaviors (Confer et al., 2010).
        Whereas evolutionary psychologists focus on universal patterns that evolved over millions of years, behavioral
        geneticists study how individual differences arise, in the present, through the interaction of genes and the
        environment. When studying human behavior, behavioral geneticists often employ twin and adoption studies to
        research questions of interest. Twin studies compare the likelihood that a given behavioral trait is shared among
        identical and fraternal twins; adoption studies compare those rates among biologically related relatives and
        adopted relatives. Both approaches provide some insight into the relative importance of genes and environment
        for the expression of a given trait.

     Genetic Variation

      Genetic variation, the genetic difference between individuals, is what contributes to a species' adaptation to its
      environment. In humans, genetic variation begins with an egg, about 100 million sperm, and fertilization.
      Roughly once per month, active ovaries release an egg from follicles. During the egg's journey from the ovary
      through the fallopian tubes, to the uterus, a sperm may fertilize the egg.
      The egg and the sperm each contain 23 chromosomes. Chromosomes are long strings of genetic material
      known as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). DNA is a helix-shaped molecule made up of nucleotide base pairs. In
      each chromosome, sequences of DNA make up genes that control or partially control a number of visible
      characteristics, known as traits, such as eye color, hair color, and so on. A single gene may have multiple
      possible variations, or alleles. An allele is a specific version of a gene. So, a given gene may code for the trait of
      hair color, and the different alleles of that gene affect which hair color an individual has.
      When a sperm and egg fuse, their 23 chromosomes combine to create a zygote with 46 chromosomes (23
      pairs). Therefore, each parent contributes half the genetic information carried by the offspring; the resulting
      physical characteristics of the offspring (called the phenotype) are determined by the interaction of genetic
      material supplied by the sperm and egg (called the genotype). A person's genotype is the genetic makeup of
      that individual. Phenotype, on the other hand, refers to the individual's inherited physical characteristics,
      which are a combination of genetic and environmental influences (Figure 3.4).

      FIGURE 3.4 (a) Genotype refers to the genetic makeup of an individual based on the genetic material (DNA)
      inherited from one's genetic contributors. (b) Phenotype describes an individual's observable characteristics, such
      as hair color, skin color, height, and build. (credit a: modification of work by Caroline Davis; credit b: modification of
      work by Cory Zanker)
      Note that, in genetics and reproduction, "parent" is often used to describe the individual organisms that

contribute genetic material to offspring, usually in the form of gamete cells (sperm and egg). The concept of a
genetic parent is distinct from social and legal concepts of parenthood, and may differ from those whom
people consider their parents.
Most traits are controlled by multiple genes, but some traits are controlled by one gene. A characteristic like
cleft chin, for example, is influenced by a single gene from each parent. In this example, we will call the gene
for cleft chin "B," and the gene for smooth chin "b." Cleft chin is a dominant trait, which means that having the
dominant allele either from one parent (Bb) or both parents (BB) will always result in the phenotype
associated with the dominant allele. When someone has two copies of the same allele, they are said to be
homozygous for that allele. When someone has a combination of alleles for a given gene, they are said to be
heterozygous. For example, smooth chin is a recessive trait, which means that an individual will only display
the smooth chin phenotype if they are homozygous for that recessive allele (bb).
Imagine that a person with a cleft chin mates with a person with a smooth chin. What type of chin will their
offspring have? The answer to that depends on which alleles each parent carries. If the person with a cleft is
homozygous for cleft chin (BB), their offspring will always have cleft chin. It gets a little more complicated,
however, if the person is heterozygous for this gene (Bb). Since the other person has a smooth chin--therefore
homozygous for the recessive allele (bb)--we can expect the offspring to have a 50% chance of having a cleft
chin and a 50% chance of having a smooth chin (Figure 3.5).

FIGURE 3.5 (a) A Punnett square is a tool used to predict how genes will interact in the production of offspring. The
capital B represents the dominant allele, and the lowercase b represents the recessive allele. In the example of the
cleft chin, where B is cleft chin (dominant allele), wherever a pair contains the dominant allele, B, you can expect a
cleft chin phenotype. You can expect a smooth chin phenotype only when there are two copies of the recessive
allele, bb. (b) A cleft chin, shown here, is an inherited trait.
In sickle cell anemia, heterozygous carriers (like Luwi from the example) can develop blood resistance to
malaria infection while those who are homozygous (like Sena) have a potentially lethal blood disorder. Sickle-
cell anemia is just one of many genetic disorders caused by the pairing of two recessive genes. For example,
phenylketonuria (PKU) is a condition in which individuals lack an enzyme that normally converts harmful
amino acids into harmless byproducts. If someone with this condition goes untreated, they will experience
significant deficits in cognitive function, seizures, and an increased risk of various psychiatric disorders.
Because PKU is a recessive trait, each parent must have at least one copy of the recessive allele in order to
produce a child with the condition (Figure 3.6).
So far, we have discussed traits that involve just one gene, but few human characteristics are controlled by a
single gene. Most traits are polygenic: controlled by more than one gene. Height is one example of a polygenic
trait, as are skin color and weight.
76 3 · Biopsychology

      FIGURE 3.6 In this Punnett square, N represents the normal allele, and p represents the recessive allele that is
      associated with PKU. If two individuals mate who are both heterozygous for the allele associated with PKU, their
      offspring have a 25% chance of expressing the PKU phenotype.
      Where do harmful genes that contribute to diseases like PKU come from? Gene mutations provide one source
      of harmful genes. A mutation is a sudden, permanent change in a gene. While many mutations can be harmful
      or lethal, once in a while, a mutation benefits an individual by giving that person an advantage over those who
      do not have the mutation. Recall that the theory of evolution asserts that individuals best adapted to their
      particular environments are more likely to reproduce and pass on their genes to future generations. In order
      for this process to occur, there must be competition--more technically, there must be variability in genes (and
      resultant traits) that allow for variation in adaptability to the environment. If a population consisted of
      identical individuals, then any dramatic changes in the environment would affect everyone in the same way,
      and there would be no variation in selection. In contrast, diversity in genes and associated traits allows some
      individuals to perform slightly better than others when faced with environmental change. This creates a
      distinct advantage for individuals best suited for their environments in terms of successful reproduction and
      genetic transmission.

                                                                                                                  DIG DEEPER
      Human Diversity

        This chapter focuses on biology. Later in this course you will learn about social psychology and issues of race,
        prejudice, and discrimination. When we focus strictly on biology, race becomes a weak construct. After the
        sequencing of the human genome at the turn of the millennium, many scientists began to argue that race was not
        a useful variable in genetic research and that its continued use represents a potential source of confusion and
        harm. The racial categories that some believed to be helpful in studying genetic diversity in humans are largely
        irrelevant. A person's skin tone, eye color, and hair texture are functions of their genetic makeups, but there is
        actually more genetic variation within a given racial category than there is between racial categories. In some
        cases, focus on race has led to difficulties with misdiagnoses and/or under-diagnoses of diseases ranging from
        sickle cell anemia to cystic fibrosis. Some argue that we need to distinguish between ancestry and race and then
        focus on ancestry. This approach would facilitate greater understanding of human genetic diversity (Yudell,
        Roberts, DeSalle, & Tishkoff, 2016).

Genes do not exist in a vacuum. Although we are all biological organisms, we also exist in an environment that
is incredibly important in determining not only when and how our genes express themselves, but also in what
combination. Each of us represents a unique interaction between our genetic makeup and our environment;
range of reaction is one way to describe this interaction. Range of reaction asserts that our genes set the
boundaries within which we can operate, and our environment interacts with the genes to determine where in
that range we will fall. For example, if an individual's genetic makeup predisposes them to high levels of
intellectual potential and they are reared in a rich, stimulating environment, then they will be more likely to
achieve full potential than if they were raised under conditions of significant deprivation. According to the
concept of range of reaction, genes set definite limits on potential, and environment determines how much of
that potential is achieved. Some disagree with this theory and argue that genes do not set a limit on a person's
potential with reaction norms being determined by the environment. For example, when individuals
experience neglect or abuse early in life, they are more likely to exhibit adverse psychological and/or physical
conditions that can last throughout their lives. These conditions may develop as a function of the negative
environmental experiences in individuals from dissimilar genetic backgrounds (Miguel, Pereira, Silveira, &
Meaney, 2019; Short & Baram, 2019).
Another perspective on the interaction between genes and the environment is the concept of genetic
environmental correlation. Stated simply, our genes influence our environment, and our environment
influences the expression of our genes (Figure 3.7). Not only do our genes and environment interact, as in
range of reaction, but they also influence one another bidirectionally. For example, the child of an NBA player
would probably be exposed to basketball from an early age. Such exposure might allow the child to realize
their full genetic, athletic potential. Thus, the parents' genes, which the child shares, influence the child's
environment, and that environment, in turn, is well suited to support the child's genetic potential.

FIGURE 3.7 Nature and nurture work together like complex pieces of a human puzzle. The interaction of our
environment and genes makes us the individuals we are. (credit "puzzle": modification of work by Cory Zanker)
In another approach to gene-environment interactions, the field of epigenetics looks beyond the genotype
itself and studies how the same genotype can be expressed in different ways. In other words, researchers study
how the same genotype can lead to very different phenotypes. As mentioned earlier, gene expression is often
influenced by environmental context in ways that are not entirely obvious. For instance, identical twins share
the same genetic information (identical twins develop from a single fertilized egg that split, so the genetic
material is exactly the same in each; in contrast, fraternal twins usually result from two different eggs
fertilized by different sperm, so the genetic material varies as with non-twin siblings). But even with identical
genes, there remains an incredible amount of variability in how gene expression can unfold over the course of
each twin's life. Sometimes, one twin will develop a disease and the other will not. In one example, Aliya, an
identical twin, died from cancer at age 7, but her twin, now 19 years old, has never had cancer. Although these
individuals share an identical genotype, their phenotypes differ as a result of how that genetic information is
78 3 · Biopsychology

      expressed over time and through their unique environmental interactions. The epigenetic perspective is very
      different from range of reaction, because here the genotype is not fixed and limited.

      Genes affect more than our physical characteristics. Indeed, scientists have found genetic linkages to a
      number of behavioral characteristics, ranging from basic personality traits to sexual orientation to spirituality
      (for examples, see Mustanski et al., 2005; Comings, Gonzales, Saucier, Johnson, & MacMurray, 2000). Genes are
      also associated with temperament and a number of psychological disorders, such as depression and
      schizophrenia. So while it is true that genes provide the biological blueprints for our cells, tissues, organs, and
      body, they also have a significant impact on our experiences and our behaviors.

      Let's look at the following findings regarding schizophrenia in light of our three views of gene-environment
      interactions. Which view do you think best explains this evidence?

     In a 2004 study by Tienari and colleagues, adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia and who had
      been raised in a disturbed family environment were much more likely to develop schizophrenia or another
      psychotic disorder than were any of the other groups in the study:

        · Of adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia (high genetic risk) and who were raised in
            disturbed family environments, 36.8% were likely to develop schizophrenia.

        · Of adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia (high genetic risk) and who were raised in
            healthy family environments, 5.8% were likely to develop schizophrenia.

        · Of adoptees with a low genetic risk (whose mothers did not have schizophrenia) and who were raised in
            disturbed family environments, 5.3% were likely to develop schizophrenia.

        · Of adoptees with a low genetic risk (whose mothers did not have schizophrenia) and who were raised in
            healthy family environments, 4.8% were likely to develop schizophrenia.

      The study shows that adoptees with high genetic risk were most likely to develop schizophrenia if they were
      raised in disturbed home environments. This research lends credibility to the notion that both genetic
      vulnerability and environmental stress are necessary for schizophrenia to develop, and that genes alone do not
      tell the full tale.

      Psychologists striving to understand the human mind may study the nervous system. Learning how the body's
      cells and organs function can help us understand the biological basis of human psychology. The nervous
      system is composed of two basic cell types: glial cells (also known as glia) and neurons. Glial cells are
      traditionally thought to play a supportive role to neurons, both physically and metabolically. Glial cells provide
      scaffolding on which the nervous system is built, help neurons line up closely with each other to allow
      neuronal communication, provide insulation to neurons, transport nutrients and waste products, and mediate
      immune responses. For years, researchers believed that there were many more glial cells than neurons;
      however, more recent work from Suzanna Herculano-Houzel's laboratory has called this long-standing
      assumption into question and has provided important evidence that there may be a nearly 1:1 ratio of glia cells
      to neurons. This is important because it suggests that human brains are more similar to other primate brains
      than previously thought (Azevedo et al, 2009; Herculano-Houzel, 2012; Herculano-Houzel, 2009). Neurons, on

the other hand, serve as interconnected information processors that are essential for all of the tasks of the
nervous system. This section briefly describes the structure and function of neurons.

Neuron Structure

Neurons are the central building blocks of the nervous system, 100 billion strong at birth. Like all cells,
neurons consist of several different parts, each serving a specialized function (Figure 3.8). A neuron's outer
surface is made up of a semipermeable membrane. This membrane allows smaller molecules and molecules
without an electrical charge to pass through it, while stopping larger or highly charged molecules.

            FIGURE 3.8 This illustration shows a prototypical neuron, which is being myelinated by a glial cell.
The nucleus of the neuron is located in the soma, or cell body. The soma has branching extensions known as
dendrites. The neuron is a small information processor, and dendrites serve as input sites where signals are
received from other neurons. These signals are transmitted electrically across the soma and down a major
extension from the soma known as the axon, which ends at multiple terminal buttons. The terminal buttons
contain synaptic vesicles that house neurotransmitters, the chemical messengers of the nervous system.
Axons range in length from a fraction of an inch to several feet. In some axons, glial cells form a fatty substance
known as the myelin sheath, which coats the axon and acts as an insulator, increasing the speed at which the
signal travels. The myelin sheath is not continuous and there are small gaps that occur down the length of the
axon. These gaps in the myelin sheath are known as the Nodes of Ranvier. The myelin sheath is crucial for the
normal operation of the neurons within the nervous system: the loss of the insulation it provides can be
detrimental to normal function. To understand how this works, let's consider an example. PKU, a genetic
disorder discussed earlier, causes a reduction in myelin and abnormalities in white matter cortical and
subcortical structures. The disorder is associated with a variety of issues including severe cognitive deficits,
exaggerated reflexes, and seizures (Anderson & Leuzzi, 2010; Huttenlocher, 2000). Another disorder, multiple
sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disorder, involves a large-scale loss of the myelin sheath on axons throughout
the nervous system. The resulting interference in the electrical signal prevents the quick transmittal of
information by neurons and can lead to a number of symptoms, such as dizziness, fatigue, loss of motor
control, and sexual dysfunction. While some treatments may help to modify the course of the disease and
manage certain symptoms, there is currently no known cure for multiple sclerosis.
In healthy individuals, the neuronal signal moves rapidly down the axon to the terminal buttons, where
synaptic vesicles release neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft (Figure 3.9). The synaptic cleft is a very
small space between two neurons and is an important site where communication between neurons occurs.
Once neurotransmitters are released into the synaptic cleft, they travel across it and bind with corresponding
receptors on the dendrite of an adjacent neuron. Receptors, proteins on the cell surface where
neurotransmitters attach, vary in shape, with different shapes "matching" different neurotransmitters.
How does a neurotransmitter "know" which receptor to bind to? The neurotransmitter and the receptor have
80 3 · Biopsychology

      what is referred to as a lock-and-key relationship--specific neurotransmitters fit specific receptors similar to
      how a key fits a lock. The neurotransmitter binds to any receptor that it fits.

      FIGURE 3.9 (a) The synaptic cleft is the space between the terminal button of one neuron and the dendrite of
      another neuron. (b) In this pseudo-colored image from a scanning electron microscope, a terminal button (green)
      has been opened to reveal the synaptic vesicles (orange and blue) inside. Each vesicle contains about 10,000
      neurotransmitter molecules. (credit b: modification of work by Tina Carvalho, NIH-NIGMS; scale-bar data from Matt
      Russell)

     Neuronal Communication

      Now that we have learned about the basic structures of the neuron and the role that these structures play in
      neuronal communication, let's take a closer look at the signal itself--how it moves through the neuron and then
      jumps to the next neuron, where the process is repeated.
      We begin at the neuronal membrane. The neuron exists in a fluid environment--it is surrounded by
      extracellular fluid and contains intracellular fluid (i.e., cytoplasm). The neuronal membrane keeps these two
      fluids separate--a critical role because the electrical signal that passes through the neuron depends on the
      intra- and extracellular fluids being electrically different. This difference in charge across the membrane,
      called the membrane potential, provides energy for the signal.
      The electrical charge of the fluids is caused by charged molecules (ions) dissolved in the fluid. The
      semipermeable nature of the neuronal membrane somewhat restricts the movement of these charged
      molecules, and, as a result, some of the charged particles tend to become more concentrated either inside or
      outside the cell.
      Between signals, the neuron membrane's potential is held in a state of readiness, called the resting potential.
      Like a rubber band stretched out and waiting to spring into action, ions line up on either side of the cell
      membrane, ready to rush across the membrane when the neuron goes active and the membrane opens its
      gates. Ions in high-concentration areas are ready to move to low-concentration areas, and positive ions are
      ready to move to areas with a negative charge.
      In the resting state, sodium (Na+) is at higher concentrations outside the cell, so it will tend to move into the
      cell. Potassium (K+), on the other hand, is more concentrated inside the cell, and will tend to move out of the
      cell (Figure 3.10). In addition, the inside of the cell is slightly negatively charged compared to the outside, due
      to the activity of the sodium-potassium pump. This pump actively transports three sodium ions out of the cell
      for every two potassium ions in, creating a net negative charge inside the cell. This provides an additional
      force on sodium, causing it to move into the cell.

FIGURE 3.10 At resting potential, Na+ (blue pentagons) is more highly concentrated outside the cell in the
extracellular fluid (shown in blue), whereas K+ (purple squares) is more highly concentrated near the membrane in
the cytoplasm or intracellular fluid. Other molecules, such as chloride ions (yellow circles) and negatively charged
proteins (brown squares), help contribute to a positive net charge in the extracellular fluid and a negative net charge
in the intracellular fluid.
From this resting potential state, the neuron receives a signal and its state changes abruptly (Figure 3.11).
When a neuron receives signals at the dendrites--due to neurotransmitters from an adjacent neuron binding
to its receptors--small pores, or gates, open on the neuronal membrane, allowing Na+ ions, propelled by both
charge and concentration differences, to move into the cell. With this influx of positive ions, the internal
charge of the cell becomes more positive. If that charge reaches a certain level, called the threshold of
excitation, the neuron becomes active and the action potential begins.
Many additional pores open, causing a massive influx of Na+ ions and a huge positive spike in the membrane
potential, the peak action potential. At the peak of the spike, the sodium gates close and the potassium gates
open. As positively charged potassium ions leave, the cell quickly begins repolarization. At first, it
hyperpolarizes, becoming slightly more negative than the resting potential, and then it levels off, returning to
the resting potential.

      FIGURE 3.11 During the action potential, the electrical charge across the membrane changes dramatically.
This positive spike constitutes the action potential: the electrical signal that typically moves from the cell body
down the axon to the axon terminals. The electrical signal moves down the axon with the impulses jumping in
a leapfrog fashion between the Nodes of Ranvier. The Nodes of Ranvier are natural gaps in the myelin sheath.
At each point, some of the sodium ions that enter the cell diffuse to the next section of the axon, raising the
charge past the threshold of excitation and triggering a new influx of sodium ions. The action potential moves
82 3 · Biopsychology

      all the way down the axon in this fashion until reaching the terminal buttons.
      The action potential is an all-or-none phenomenon. In simple terms, this means that an incoming signal from
      another neuron is either sufficient or insufficient to reach the threshold of excitation. There is no in-between,
      and there is no turning off an action potential once it starts. Think of it like sending an email or a text message.
      You can think about sending it all you want, but the message is not sent until you hit the send button.
      Furthermore, once you send the message, there is no stopping it.
      Because it is all or none, the action potential is recreated, or propagated, at its full strength at every point along
      the axon. Much like the lit fuse of a firecracker, it does not fade away as it travels down the axon. It is this all-or-
      none property that explains the fact that your brain perceives an injury to a distant body part like your toe as
      equally painful as one to your nose.
      As noted earlier, when the action potential arrives at the terminal button, the synaptic vesicles release their
      neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitters travel across the synapse and bind to
      receptors on the dendrites of the adjacent neuron, and the process repeats itself in the new neuron (assuming
      the signal is sufficiently strong to trigger an action potential). Once the signal is delivered, excess
      neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft drift away, are broken down into inactive fragments, or are reabsorbed
      in a process known as reuptake. Reuptake involves the neurotransmitter being pumped back into the neuron
      that released it, in order to clear the synapse (Figure 3.12). Clearing the synapse serves both to provide a clear
      "on" and "off" state between signals and to regulate the production of neurotransmitter (full synaptic vesicles
      provide signals that no additional neurotransmitters need to be produced).

      FIGURE 3.12 Reuptake involves moving a neurotransmitter from the synapse back into the axon terminal from
      which it was released.
      Neuronal communication is often referred to as an electrochemical event. The movement of the action
      potential down the length of the axon is an electrical event, and movement of the neurotransmitter across the
      synaptic space represents the chemical portion of the process. However, there are some specialized
      connections between neurons that are entirely electrical. In such cases, the neurons are said to communicate
      via an electrical synapse. In these cases, two neurons physically connect to one another via gap junctions,
      which allows the current from one cell to pass into the next. There are far fewer electrical synapses in the
      brain, but those that do exist are much faster than the chemical synapses that have been described above
      (Connors & Long, 2004).

Neurotransmitters and Drugs

There are several different types of neurotransmitters released by different neurons, and we can speak in
broad terms about the kinds of functions associated with different neurotransmitters (Table 3.1). Much of what
psychologists know about the functions of neurotransmitters comes from research on the effects of drugs in
psychological disorders. Psychologists who take a biological perspective and focus on the physiological
causes of behavior assert that psychological disorders like depression and schizophrenia are associated with
imbalances in one or more neurotransmitter systems. In this perspective, psychotropic medications can help
improve the symptoms associated with these disorders. Psychotropic medications are drugs that treat
psychiatric symptoms by restoring neurotransmitter balance.

                Major Neurotransmitters and How They Affect Behavior

Neurotransmitter  Involved in                         Potential Effect on Behavior

Acetylcholine     Muscle action, memory               Increased arousal, enhanced cognition

Beta-endorphin    Pain, pleasure                      Decreased anxiety, decreased tension

Dopamine          Mood, sleep, learning               Increased pleasure, suppressed appetite

Norepinephrine    Heart, intestines, alertness Increased arousal, suppressed appetite

Serotonin         Mood, sleep                         Modulated mood, suppressed appetite

TABLE 3.1

Psychoactive drugs can act as agonists or antagonists for a given neurotransmitter system. Agonists are
chemicals that mimic a neurotransmitter at the receptor site. An antagonist, on the other hand, blocks or
impedes the normal activity of a neurotransmitter at the receptor. Agonists and antagonists represent drugs
that are prescribed to correct the specific neurotransmitter imbalances underlying a person's condition. For
example, Parkinson's disease, a progressive nervous system disorder, is associated with low levels of
dopamine. Therefore, a common treatment strategy for Parkinson's disease involves using dopamine agonists,
which mimic the effects of dopamine by binding to dopamine receptors.

Certain symptoms of schizophrenia are associated with overactive dopamine neurotransmission. The
antipsychotics used to treat these symptoms are antagonists for dopamine--they block dopamine's effects by
binding its receptors without activating them. Thus, they prevent dopamine released by one neuron from
signaling information to adjacent neurons.

In contrast to agonists and antagonists, which both operate by binding to receptor sites, reuptake inhibitors
prevent unused neurotransmitters from being transported back to the neuron. This allows neurotransmitters
to remain active in the synaptic cleft for longer durations, increasing their effectiveness. Depression, which
has been consistently linked with reduced serotonin levels, is commonly treated with selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). By preventing reuptake, SSRIs strengthen the effect of serotonin, giving it more
time to interact with serotonin receptors on dendrites. Common SSRIs on the market today include Prozac,
Paxil, and Zoloft. The drug LSD is structurally very similar to serotonin, and it affects the same neurons and
receptors as serotonin. Psychotropic drugs are not instant solutions for people suffering from psychological
disorders. Often, an individual must take a drug for several weeks before seeing improvement, and many
84 3 · Biopsychology

      psychoactive drugs have significant negative side effects. Furthermore, individuals vary dramatically in how
      they respond to the drugs. To improve chances for success, it is not uncommon for people receiving
      pharmacotherapy to undergo psychological and/or behavioral therapies as well. Some research suggests that
      combining drug therapy with other forms of therapy tends to be more effective than any one treatment alone
      (for one such example, see March et al., 2007).

    3.3 Parts of the Nervous System

      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Describe the difference between the central and peripheral nervous systems
        · Explain the difference between the somatic and autonomic nervous systems
        · Differentiate between the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system
      The nervous system can be divided into two major subdivisions: the central nervous system (CNS) and the
      peripheral nervous system (PNS), shown in Figure 3.13. The CNS is comprised of the brain and spinal cord;
      the PNS connects the CNS to the rest of the body. In this section, we focus on the peripheral nervous system;
      later, we look at the brain and spinal cord.

      FIGURE 3.13 The nervous system is divided into two major parts: (a) the Central Nervous System and (b) the
      Peripheral Nervous System.

     Peripheral Nervous System

      The peripheral nervous system is made up of thick bundles of axons, called nerves, carrying messages back
      and forth between the CNS and the muscles, organs, and senses in the periphery of the body (i.e., everything
      outside the CNS). The PNS has two major subdivisions: the somatic nervous system and the autonomic

nervous system.
The somatic nervous system is associated with activities traditionally thought of as conscious or voluntary. It
is involved in the relay of sensory and motor information to and from the CNS; therefore, it consists of motor
neurons and sensory neurons. Motor neurons, carrying instructions from the CNS to the muscles, are efferent
fibers (efferent means "moving away from"). Sensory neurons, carrying sensory information to the CNS, are
afferent fibers (afferent means "moving toward"). A helpful way to remember this is that efferent = exit and
afferent = arrive. Each nerve is basically a bundle of neurons forming a two-way superhighway, containing
thousands of axons, both efferent and afferent.
The autonomic nervous system controls our internal organs and glands and is generally considered to be
outside the realm of voluntary control. It can be further subdivided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic
divisions (Figure 3.14). The sympathetic nervous system is involved in preparing the body for stress-related
activities; the parasympathetic nervous system is associated with returning the body to routine, day-to-day
operations. The two systems have complementary functions, operating in tandem to maintain the body's
homeostasis. Homeostasis is a state of equilibrium, or balance, in which biological conditions (such as body
temperature) are maintained at optimal levels.

FIGURE 3.14 The sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system have the opposite
effects on various systems.
The sympathetic nervous system is activated when we are faced with stressful or high-arousal situations. The
activity of this system was adaptive for our ancestors, increasing their chances of survival. Imagine, for
example, that one of our early ancestors, out hunting small game, suddenly disturbs a large bear with her cubs.
At that moment, the hunter's body undergoes a series of changes--a direct function of sympathetic
activation--preparing them to face the threat. The pupils dilate, the heart rate and blood pressure increase, the
bladder relaxes, and the liver releases glucose; adrenaline surges into the bloodstream. This constellation of
86 3 · Biopsychology

      physiological changes, known as the fight or flight response, allows the body access to energy reserves and
      heightened sensory capacity so that it might fight off a threat or run away to safety.

          LINK TO LEARNING

      Watch this video about the Fight Flight Freeze response (http://openstax.org/l/response) to learn more.

      While it is clear that such a response would be critical for survival for our ancestors, who lived in a world full of
      real physical threats, many of the high-arousal situations we face in the modern world are more psychological
      in nature. For example, think about how you feel when you have to stand up and give a presentation in front of
      a roomful of people, or right before taking a big test. You are in no real physical danger in those situations, and
      yet you have evolved to respond to a perceived threat with the fight or flight response. This kind of response is
      not nearly as adaptive in the modern world; in fact, we suffer negative health consequences when faced
      constantly with psychological threats that we can neither fight nor flee. Recent research suggests that an
      increase in susceptibility to heart disease (Chandola, Brunner, & Marmot, 2006) and impaired function of the
      immune system (Glaser & Kiecolt-Glaser, 2005) are among the many negative consequences of persistent and
      repeated exposure to stressful situations. Some of this tendency for stress reactivity can be wired by early
      experiences of trauma.

      Once the threat has been resolved, the parasympathetic nervous system takes over and returns bodily
      functions to a relaxed state. Our hunter's heart rate and blood pressure return to normal, the pupils constrict,
      bladder control is restored, and the liver begins to store glucose in the form of glycogen for future use. These
      restorative processes are associated with activation of the parasympathetic nervous system.

    3.4 The Brain and Spinal Cord

      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Explain the functions of the spinal cord
        · Identify the hemispheres and lobes of the brain
        · Describe the types of techniques available to clinicians and researchers to image or scan the brain

      The brain is a remarkably complex organ comprised of billions of interconnected neurons and glia. It is a
      bilateral, or two-sided, structure that can be separated into distinct lobes. Each lobe is associated with certain
      types of functions, but, ultimately, all of the areas of the brain interact with one another to provide the
      foundation for our thoughts and behaviors. In this section, we discuss the overall organization of the brain and
      the functions associated with different brain areas, beginning with what can be seen as an extension of the
      brain, the spinal cord.

     The Spinal Cord

      It can be said that the spinal cord is what connects the brain to the outside world. Because of it, the brain can
      act. The spinal cord is like a relay station, but a very smart one. It not only routes messages to and from the
      brain, but it also has its own system of automatic processes, called reflexes.

      The top of the spinal cord is a bundle of nerves that merges with the brain stem, where the basic processes of
      life are controlled, such as breathing and digestion. In the opposite direction, the spinal cord ends just below
      the ribs--contrary to what we might expect, it does not extend all the way to the base of the spine.

      The spinal cord is functionally organized in 30 segments, corresponding with the vertebrae. Each segment is
      connected to a specific part of the body through the peripheral nervous system. Nerves branch out from the
      spine at each vertebra. Sensory nerves bring messages in; motor nerves send messages out to the muscles and
      organs. Messages travel to and from the brain through every segment.

      Some sensory messages are immediately acted on by the spinal cord, without any input from the brain.

Withdrawal from a hot object and the knee jerk are two examples. When a sensory message meets certain
parameters, the spinal cord initiates an automatic reflex. The signal passes from the sensory nerve to a simple
processing center, which initiates a motor command. Seconds are saved, because messages don't have to go
the brain, be processed, and get sent back. In matters of survival, the spinal reflexes allow the body to react
extraordinarily fast.
The spinal cord is protected by bony vertebrae and cushioned in cerebrospinal fluid, but injuries still occur.
When the spinal cord is damaged in a particular segment, all lower segments are cut off from the brain,
causing paralysis. Therefore, the lower on the spine damage occurs, the fewer functions an injured individual
will lose.
Neuroplasticity
Bob Woodruff, a reporter for ABC, suffered a traumatic brain injury after a bomb exploded next to the vehicle
he was in while covering a news story in Iraq. As a consequence of these injuries, Woodruff experienced many
cognitive deficits including difficulties with memory and language. However, over time and with the aid of
intensive amounts of cognitive and speech therapy, Woodruff has shown an incredible recovery of function
(Fernandez, 2008, October 16).
One of the factors that made this recovery possible was neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity refers to how the
nervous system can change and adapt. Neuroplasticity can occur in a variety of ways including personal
experiences, developmental processes, or, as in Woodruff's case, in response to some sort of damage or injury
that has occurred. Neuroplasticity can involve creation of new synapses, pruning of synapses that are no
longer used, changes in glial cells, and even the birth of new neurons. Because of neuroplasticity, our brains
are constantly changing and adapting, and while our nervous system is most plastic when we are very young,
as Woodruff's case suggests, it is still capable of remarkable changes later in life.

The Two Hemispheres

The surface of the brain, known as the cerebral cortex, is very uneven, characterized by a distinctive pattern
of folds or bumps, known as gyri (singular: gyrus), and grooves, known as sulci (singular: sulcus), shown in
Figure 3.15. These gyri and sulci form important landmarks that allow us to separate the brain into functional
centers. The most prominent sulcus, known as the longitudinal fissure, is the deep groove that separates the
brain into two halves or hemispheres: the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere.

FIGURE 3.15 The surface of the brain is covered with gyri and sulci. A deep sulcus is called a fissure, such as the
longitudinal fissure that divides the brain into left and right hemispheres. (credit: modification of work by Bruce
Blaus)
There is evidence of specialization of function--referred to as lateralization--in each hemisphere, mainly
regarding differences in language functions. The left hemisphere controls the right half of the body, and the
right hemisphere controls the left half of the body. Decades of research on lateralization of function by Michael
88 3 · Biopsychology

      Gazzaniga and his colleagues suggest that a variety of functions ranging from cause-and-effect reasoning to
      self-recognition may follow patterns that suggest some degree of hemispheric dominance (Gazzaniga, 2005).
      For example, the left hemisphere has been shown to be superior for forming associations in memory, selective
      attention, and positive emotions. The right hemisphere, on the other hand, has been shown to be superior in
      pitch perception, arousal, and negative emotions (Ehret, 2006). However, it should be pointed out that
      research on which hemisphere is dominant in a variety of different behaviors has produced inconsistent
      results, and therefore, it is probably better to think of how the two hemispheres interact to produce a given
      behavior rather than attributing certain behaviors to one hemisphere versus the other (Banich & Heller, 1998).
      The two hemispheres are connected by a thick band of neural fibers known as the corpus callosum, consisting
      of about 200 million axons. The corpus callosum allows the two hemispheres to communicate with each other
      and allows for information being processed on one side of the brain to be shared with the other side.
      Normally, we are not aware of the different roles that our two hemispheres play in day-to-day functions, but
      there are people who come to know the capabilities and functions of their two hemispheres quite well. In some
      cases of severe epilepsy, doctors elect to sever the corpus callosum as a means of controlling the spread of
      seizures (Figure 3.16). While this is an effective treatment option, it results in individuals who have "split
      brains." After surgery, these split-brain patients show a variety of interesting behaviors. For instance, a split-
      brain patient is unable to name a picture that is shown in the patient's left visual field because the information
      is only available in the largely nonverbal right hemisphere. However, they are able to recreate the picture with
      their left hand, which is also controlled by the right hemisphere. When the more verbal left hemisphere sees
      the picture that the hand drew, the patient is able to name it (assuming the left hemisphere can interpret what
      was drawn by the left hand).

      FIGURE 3.16 (a, b) The corpus callosum connects the left and right hemispheres of the brain. (c) A scientist
      spreads this dissected sheep brain apart to show the corpus callosum between the hemispheres. (credit c:

      Much of what we know about the functions of different areas of the brain comes from studying changes in the
      behavior and ability of individuals who have suffered damage to the brain. For example, researchers study the
      behavioral changes caused by strokes to learn about the functions of specific brain areas. A stroke, caused by
      an interruption of blood flow to a region in the brain, causes a loss of brain function in the affected region. The
      damage can be in a small area, and, if it is, this gives researchers the opportunity to link any resulting
      behavioral changes to a specific area. The types of deficits displayed after a stroke will be largely dependent on
      where in the brain the damage occurred.
      Consider Theona, an intelligent, self-sufficient woman, who is 62 years old. Recently, she suffered a stroke in
      the front portion of her right hemisphere. As a result, she has great difficulty moving her left leg. (As you
      learned earlier, the right hemisphere controls the left side of the body; also, the brain's main motor centers are
      located at the front of the head, in the frontal lobe.) Theona has also experienced behavioral changes. For
      example, while in the produce section of the grocery store, she sometimes eats grapes, strawberries, and
      apples directly from their bins before paying for them. This behavior--which would have been very
      embarrassing to her before the stroke--is consistent with damage in another region in the frontal lobe--the

prefrontal cortex, which is associated with judgment, reasoning, and impulse control.

Forebrain Structures

The two hemispheres of the cerebral cortex are part of the forebrain (Figure 3.17), which is the largest part of
the brain. The forebrain contains the cerebral cortex and a number of other structures that lie beneath the
cortex (called subcortical structures): thalamus, hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and the limbic system (a
collection of structures). The cerebral cortex, which is the outer surface of the brain, is associated with higher
level processes such as consciousness, thought, emotion, reasoning, language, and memory. Each cerebral
hemisphere can be subdivided into four lobes, each associated with different functions.

FIGURE 3.17 The brain and its parts can be divided into three main categories: the forebrain, midbrain, and
hindbrain.
Lobes of the Brain
The four lobes of the brain are the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes (Figure 3.18). The frontal
lobe is located in the forward part of the brain, extending back to a fissure known as the central sulcus. The
frontal lobe is involved in reasoning, motor control, emotion, and language. It contains the motor cortex,
which is involved in planning and coordinating movement; the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for
higher-level cognitive functioning; and Broca's area, which is essential for language production.

                                              FIGURE 3.18 The lobes of the brain are shown.
People who suffer damage to Broca's area have great difficulty producing language of any form (Figure 3.18).
For example, Padma was an electrical engineer who was socially active and a caring, involved parent. About
twenty years ago, she was in a car accident and suffered damage to her Broca's area. She completely lost the
ability to speak and form any kind of meaningful language. There is nothing wrong with her mouth or her vocal
90 3 · Biopsychology

      cords, but she is unable to produce words. She can follow directions but can't respond verbally, and she can
      read but no longer write. She can do routine tasks like running to the market to buy milk, but she could not
      communicate verbally if a situation called for it.
      Probably the most famous case of frontal lobe damage is that of a man by the name of Phineas Gage. On
      September 13, 1848, Gage (age 25) was working as a railroad foreman in Vermont. He and his crew were using
      an iron rod to tamp explosives down into a blasting hole to remove rock along the railway's path.
      Unfortunately, the iron rod created a spark and caused the rod to explode out of the blasting hole, into Gage's
      face, and through his skull (Figure 3.19). Although lying in a pool of his own blood with brain matter emerging
      from his head, Gage was conscious and able to get up, walk, and speak. But in the months following his
      accident, people noticed that his personality had changed. Many of his friends described him as no longer
      being himself. Before the accident, it was said that Gage was a well-mannered, soft-spoken man, but he began
      to behave in odd and inappropriate ways after the accident. Such changes in personality would be consistent
      with loss of impulse control--a frontal lobe function.
      Beyond the damage to the frontal lobe itself, subsequent investigations into the rod's path also identified
      probable damage to pathways between the frontal lobe and other brain structures, including the limbic
      system. With connections between the planning functions of the frontal lobe and the emotional processes of
      the limbic system severed, Gage had difficulty controlling his emotional impulses.
      However, there is some evidence suggesting that the dramatic changes in Gage's personality were exaggerated
      and embellished. Gage's case occurred in the midst of a 19th century debate over localization--regarding
      whether certain areas of the brain are associated with particular functions. On the basis of extremely limited
      information about Gage, the extent of his injury, and his life before and after the accident, scientists tended to
      find support for their own views, on whichever side of the debate they fell (Macmillan, 1999).

      FIGURE 3.19 (a) Phineas Gage holds the iron rod that penetrated his skull in an 1848 railroad construction
      accident. (b) Gage's prefrontal cortex was severely damaged in the left hemisphere. The rod entered Gage's face on
      the left side, passed behind his eye, and exited through the top of his skull, before landing about 80 feet away.

      The brain's parietal lobe is located immediately behind the frontal lobe, and is involved in processing
      information from the body's senses. It contains the somatosensory cortex, which is essential for processing
      sensory information from across the body, such as touch, temperature, and pain. The somatosensory cortex is
      an area of the brain which processes touch and sensation. The somatosensory cortex is fascinating because
      each different area of the cortex processes sensations from a different part of your body. Furthermore, the
      larger the surface area of the specific body part and the greater amount of nerves in that body part, the larger
      the area dedicated to processing sensation from that body part in the somatosensory cortex. For example,

fingers take up a lot more space than toes. As you can notice from (Figure 3.20), the amount of space to process
sensation from fingers is much greater than that of toes.

One fascinating example of neuroplasticity involves reorganization of the somatosensory cortex following limb
amputation. Check out this NPR segment about amputees' experiences of "phantom limbs" following
amputation (http://openstax.org/l/phantomlimb) to learn more.

     FIGURE 3.20 Spatial relationships in the body are mirrored in the organization of the somatosensory cortex.
The temporal lobe is located on the side of the head (temporal means "near the temples"), and is associated
with hearing, memory, emotion, and some aspects of language. The auditory cortex, the main area
responsible for processing auditory information, is located within the temporal lobe. Wernicke's area,
important for speech comprehension, is also located here. Whereas individuals with damage to Broca's area
have difficulty producing language, those with damage to Wernicke's area can produce sensible language, but
they are unable to understand it (Figure 3.21).

FIGURE 3.21 Damage to either Broca's area or Wernicke's area can result in language deficits. The types of deficits
are very different, however, depending on which area is affected.
The occipital lobe is located at the very back of the brain, and contains the primary visual cortex, which is
responsible for interpreting incoming visual information. The occipital cortex is organized retinotopically,
92 3 · Biopsychology

      which means there is a close relationship between the position of an object in a person's visual field and the
      position of that object's representation on the cortex. You will learn much more about how visual information
      is processed in the occipital lobe when you study sensation and perception.
      Other Areas of the Forebrain
      Other areas of the forebrain, located beneath the cerebral cortex, include the thalamus and the limbic system.
      The thalamus is a sensory relay for the brain. All of our senses, with the exception of smell, are routed through
      the thalamus before being directed to other areas of the brain for processing (Figure 3.22).

        FIGURE 3.22 The thalamus serves as the relay center of the brain where most senses are routed for processing.
      The limbic system is involved in processing both emotion and memory. Interestingly, the sense of smell
      projects directly to the limbic system; therefore, not surprisingly, smell can evoke emotional responses in ways
      that other sensory modalities cannot. The limbic system is made up of a number of different structures, but
      three of the most important are the hippocampus, the amygdala, and the hypothalamus (Figure 3.23). The
      hippocampus is an essential structure for learning and memory. The amygdala is involved in our experience
      of emotion and in tying emotional meaning to our memories. The hypothalamus regulates a number of
      homeostatic processes, including the regulation of body temperature, appetite, and blood pressure. The
      hypothalamus also serves as an interface between the nervous system and the endocrine system and in the
      regulation of sexual motivation and behavior.

The Case of Henry Molaison (H.M.)
In 1953, Henry Gustav Molaison (H. M.) was a 27-year-old man who experienced severe seizures. In an attempt
to control his seizures, H. M. underwent brain surgery to remove his hippocampus and amygdala. Following
the surgery, H.M's seizures became much less severe, but he also suffered some unexpected--and
devastating--consequences of the surgery: he lost his ability to form many types of new memories. For
example, he was unable to learn new facts, such as who was president of the United States. He was able to learn
new skills, but afterward he had no recollection of learning them. For example, while he might learn to use a
computer, he would have no conscious memory of ever having used one. He could not remember new faces,
and he was unable to remember events, even immediately after they occurred. Researchers were fascinated by
his experience, and he is considered one of the most studied cases in medical and psychological history
(Hardt, Einarsson, & Nader, 2010; Squire, 2009). Indeed, his case has provided tremendous insight into the
role that the hippocampus plays in the consolidation of new learning into explicit memory.

Midbrain and Hindbrain Structures

The midbrain is comprised of structures located deep within the brain, between the forebrain and the
hindbrain. The reticular formation is centered in the midbrain, but it actually extends up into the forebrain
and down into the hindbrain. The reticular formation is important in regulating the sleep/wake cycle, arousal,
alertness, and motor activity.
The substantia nigra (Latin for "black substance") and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are also located in
the midbrain (Figure 3.24). Both regions contain cell bodies that produce the neurotransmitter dopamine, and
both are critical for movement. Degeneration of the substantia nigra and VTA is involved in Parkinson's
disease. In addition, these structures are involved in mood, reward, and addiction (Berridge & Robinson, 1998;
Gardner, 2011; George, Le Moal, & Koob, 2012).

             FIGURE 3.24 The substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area (VTA) are located in the midbrain.
The hindbrain is located at the back of the head and looks like an extension of the spinal cord. It contains the
medulla, pons, and cerebellum (Figure 3.25). The medulla controls the automatic processes of the autonomic
nervous system, such as breathing, blood pressure, and heart rate. The word pons literally means "bridge,"
94 3 · Biopsychology

      and as the name suggests, the pons serves to connect the hindbrain to the rest of the brain. It also is involved
      in regulating brain activity during sleep. The medulla, pons, and various structures are known as the
      brainstem, and aspects of the brainstem span both the midbrain and the hindbrain.

                                   FIGURE 3.25 The pons, medulla, and cerebellum make up the hindbrain.
      The cerebellum (Latin for "little brain") receives messages from muscles, tendons, joints, and structures in
      our ear to control balance, coordination, movement, and motor skills. The cerebellum is also thought to be an
      important area for processing some types of memories. In particular, procedural memory, or memory involved
      in learning and remembering how to perform tasks, is thought to be associated with the cerebellum. Recall
      that H. M. was unable to form new explicit memories, but he could learn new tasks. This is likely due to the fact
      that H. M.'s cerebellum remained intact.

                                                                                                WHAT DO YOU THINK?
      Brain Dead and on Life Support

        What would you do if your spouse or loved one was declared brain dead but their body was being kept alive by
        medical equipment? Whose decision should it be to remove a feeding tube? Should medical care costs be a
        factor?
        On February 25, 1990, a Florida woman named Terri Schiavo went into cardiac arrest, apparently triggered by a
        bulimic episode. She was eventually revived, but her brain had been deprived of oxygen for a long time. Brain
        scans indicated that there was no activity in her cerebral cortex, and she suffered from severe and permanent
        cerebral atrophy. Basically, Schiavo was in a vegetative state. Medical professionals determined that she would
        never again be able to move, talk, or respond in any way. To remain alive, she required a feeding tube, and there
        was no chance that her situation would ever improve.
        On occasion, Schiavo's eyes would move, and sometimes she would groan. Despite the doctors' insistence to the
        contrary, her parents believed that these were signs that she was trying to communicate with them.
        After 12 years, Schiavo's husband argued that his wife would not have wanted to be kept alive with no feelings,
        sensations, or brain activity. Her parents, however, were very much against removing her feeding tube.
        Eventually, the case made its way to the courts, both in the state of Florida and at the federal level. By 2005, the
        courts found in favor of Schiavo's husband, and the feeding tube was removed on March 18, 2005. Schiavo died
        13 days later.
        Why did Schiavo's eyes sometimes move, and why did she groan? Although the parts of her brain that control

  thought, voluntary movement, and feeling were completely damaged, her brainstem was still intact. Her medulla
  and pons maintained her breathing and caused involuntary movements of her eyes and the occasional groans.
  Over the 15-year period that she was on a feeding tube, Schiavo's medical costs may have topped $7 million
  (Arnst, 2003).
  These questions were brought to popular conscience decades ago in the case of Terri Schiavo, and they have
  persisted. In 2013, a 13-year-old girl who suffered complications after tonsil surgery was declared brain dead.
  There was a battle between her family, who wanted her to remain on life support, and the hospital's policies
  regarding persons declared brain dead. In another complicated 2013-14 case in Texas, a pregnant EMT
  professional declared brain dead was kept alive for weeks, despite her spouse's directives, which were based on
  her wishes should this situation arise. In this case, state laws designed to protect an unborn fetus came into
  consideration until doctors determined the fetus unviable.
  Decisions surrounding the medical response to patients declared brain dead are complex. What do you think
  about these issues?

Brain Imaging

You have learned how brain injury can provide information about the functions of different parts of the brain.
Increasingly, however, we are able to obtain that information using brain imaging techniques on individuals
who have not suffered brain injury. In this section, we take a more in-depth look at some of the techniques that
are available for imaging the brain, including techniques that rely on radiation, magnetic fields, or electrical
activity within the brain.
Techniques Involving Radiation
A computerized tomography (CT) scan involves taking a number of x-rays of a particular section of a person's
body or brain (Figure 3.26). The x-rays pass through tissues of different densities at different rates, allowing a
computer to construct an overall image of the area of the body being scanned. A CT scan is often used to
determine whether someone has a tumor or significant brain atrophy.

FIGURE 3.26 A CT scan can be used to show brain tumors. (a) The image on the left shows a healthy brain, whereas
(b) the image on the right indicates a brain tumor in the left frontal lobe. (credit a: modification of work by
"Aceofhearts1968"/Wikimedia Commons; credit b: modification of work by Roland Schmitt et al)
Positron emission tomography (PET) scans create pictures of the living, active brain (Figure 3.27). An
individual receiving a PET scan drinks or is injected with a mildly radioactive substance, called a tracer. Once
in the bloodstream, the amount of tracer in any given region of the brain can be monitored. As a brain area
becomes more active, more blood flows to that area. A computer monitors the movement of the tracer and
creates a rough map of active and inactive areas of the brain during a given behavior. PET scans show little
detail, are unable to pinpoint events precisely in time, and require that the brain be exposed to radiation;
therefore, this technique has been replaced by the fMRI as an alternative diagnostic tool. However, combined
96 3 · Biopsychology

      with CT, PET technology is still being used in certain contexts. For example, CT/PET scans allow better imaging
      of the activity of neurotransmitter receptors and open new avenues in schizophrenia research. In this hybrid
      CT/PET technology, CT contributes clear images of brain structures, while PET shows the brain's activity.

      FIGURE 3.27 A PET scan is helpful for showing activity in different parts of the brain. (credit: Health and Human
      Services Department, National Institutes of Health)
      Techniques Involving Magnetic Fields
      In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a person is placed inside a machine that generates a strong magnetic
      field. The magnetic field causes the hydrogen atoms in the body's cells to move. When the magnetic field is
      turned off, the hydrogen atoms emit electromagnetic signals as they return to their original positions. Tissues
      of different densities give off different signals, which a computer interprets and displays on a monitor.
      Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) operates on the same principles, but it shows changes in
      brain activity over time by tracking blood flow and oxygen levels. The fMRI provides more detailed images of
      the brain's structure, as well as better accuracy in time, than is possible in PET scans (Figure 3.28). With their
      high level of detail, MRI and fMRI are often used to compare the brains of healthy individuals to the brains of
      individuals diagnosed with psychological disorders. This comparison helps determine what structural and
      functional differences exist between these populations.

      Techniques Involving Electrical Activity

      needing information on the actual location of the activity. Electroencephalography (EEG) serves this purpose
      by providing a measure of a brain's electrical activity. An array of electrodes is placed around a person's head

(Figure 3.29). The signals received by the electrodes result in a printout of the electrical activity of their brain,
or brainwaves, showing both the frequency (number of waves per second) and amplitude (height) of the
recorded brainwaves, with an accuracy within milliseconds. Such information is especially helpful to
researchers studying sleep patterns among individuals with sleep disorders.

3.5 The Endocrine System

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Identify the major glands of the endocrine system
  · Identify the hormones secreted by each gland
  · Describe each hormone's role in regulating bodily functions
The endocrine system consists of a series of glands that produce chemical substances known as hormones
(Figure 3.30). Like neurotransmitters, hormones are chemical messengers that must bind to a receptor in
order to send their signal. However, unlike neurotransmitters, which are released in close proximity to cells
with their receptors, hormones are secreted into the bloodstream and travel throughout the body, affecting any
cells that contain receptors for them. Thus, whereas neurotransmitters' effects are localized, the effects of
hormones are widespread. Also, hormones are slower to take effect, and tend to be longer lasting.

                                      FIGURE 3.30 The major glands of the endocrine system are shown.
      Hormones are involved in regulating all sorts of bodily functions, and they are ultimately controlled through
      interactions between the hypothalamus (in the central nervous system) and the pituitary gland (in the
      endocrine system). Imbalances in hormones are related to a number of disorders. This section explores some
      of the major glands that make up the endocrine system and the hormones secreted by these glands (Table 3.2).

     Major Glands

      The pituitary gland descends from the hypothalamus at the base of the brain, and acts in close association
      with it. The pituitary is often referred to as the "master gland" because its messenger hormones control all the
      other glands in the endocrine system, although it mostly carries out instructions from the hypothalamus. In
      addition to messenger hormones, the pituitary also secretes growth hormone, endorphins for pain relief, and a
      number of key hormones that regulate fluid levels in the body.
      Located in the neck, the thyroid gland releases hormones that regulate growth, metabolism, and appetite. In
      hyperthyroidism, or Grave's disease, the thyroid secretes too much of the hormone thyroxine, causing
      agitation, bulging eyes, and weight loss. In hypothyroidism, reduced hormone levels cause sufferers to
      experience tiredness, and they often complain of feeling cold. Fortunately, thyroid disorders are often treatable
      with medications that help reestablish a balance in the hormones secreted by the thyroid.
      The adrenal glands sit atop our kidneys and secrete hormones involved in the stress response, such as
      epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). The pancreas is an internal organ that secretes
      hormones that regulate blood sugar levels: insulin and glucagon. These pancreatic hormones are essential for
      maintaining stable levels of blood sugar throughout the day by lowering blood glucose levels (insulin) or
      raising them (glucagon). People who suffer from diabetes do not produce enough insulin; therefore, they must
      take medications that stimulate or replace insulin production, and they must closely control the amount of
      sugars and carbohydrates they consume.
      The gonads secrete sexual hormones, which are important in reproduction, and mediate both sexual
      motivation and behavior. The female gonads are the ovaries; the male gonads are the testes. Ovaries secrete
      estrogens and progesterone, and the testes secrete androgens, such as testosterone.

Athletes and Anabolic Steroids

Although it is against Federal laws and many professional athletic associations (The National Football League, for
example) have banned their use, anabolic steroid drugs continue to be used by amateur and professional
athletes. The drugs are believed to enhance athletic performance. Anabolic steroid drugs mimic the effects of the
body's own steroid hormones, like testosterone and its derivatives. These drugs have the potential to provide a
competitive edge by increasing muscle mass, strength, and endurance, although not all users may experience
these results. Moreover, use of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) does not come without risks. Anabolic
steroid use has been linked with a wide variety of potentially negative outcomes, ranging in severity from largely
cosmetic (acne) to life threatening (heart attack). Furthermore, use of these substances can result in profound
changes in mood and can increase aggressive behavior (National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2001).

Baseball player Alex Rodriguez (A-Rod) spent the latter part of his playing career at the center of a media storm
regarding his use of illegal PEDs. Rodriguez excelled while using the drugs; his success played a large role in
negotiating a contract that made him the highest paid player in professional baseball. A subsequent scandal and
suspension tarnished his reputation and, according to a statement he made once retired, cost him over $40
million. Even lower-profile athletes, particularly in cycling and Olympic sports, have been revealed as steroid
users. What are your thoughts on athletes and doping? Why or why not should the use of PEDs be banned? What
advice would you give an athlete who was considering using PEDs?

Summary

3.1 Human Genetics

Genes are sequences of DNA that code for a particular trait. Different versions of a gene are called
alleles--sometimes alleles can be classified as dominant or recessive. A dominant allele always results in the
dominant phenotype. In order to exhibit a recessive phenotype, an individual must be homozygous for the
recessive allele. Genes affect both physical and psychological characteristics. Ultimately, how and when a gene
is expressed, and what the outcome will be--in terms of both physical and psychological characteristics--is a
function of the interaction between our genes and our environments.

3.2 Cells of the Nervous System

Glia and neurons are the two cell types that make up the nervous system. While glia generally play supporting
roles, the communication between neurons is fundamental to all of the functions associated with the nervous
system. Neuronal communication is made possible by the neuron's specialized structures. The soma contains
the cell nucleus, and the dendrites extend from the soma in tree-like branches. The axon is another major
extension of the cell body; axons are often covered by a myelin sheath, which increases the speed of
transmission of neural impulses. At the end of the axon are terminal buttons that contain synaptic vesicles
filled with neurotransmitters.

Neuronal communication is an electrochemical event. The dendrites contain receptors for neurotransmitters
released by nearby neurons. If the signals received from other neurons are sufficiently strong, an action
potential will travel down the length of the axon to the terminal buttons, resulting in the release of
neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. Action potentials operate on the all-or-none principle and involve

                                                                                                                                                      3 · Review Questions 103

the movement of Na+ and K+ across the neuronal membrane.

Different neurotransmitters are associated with different functions. Often, psychological disorders involve
imbalances in a given neurotransmitter system. Therefore, psychotropic drugs are prescribed in an attempt to
bring the neurotransmitters back into balance. Drugs can act either as agonists or as antagonists for a given
neurotransmitter system.

3.3 Parts of the Nervous System

The brain and spinal cord make up the central nervous system. The peripheral nervous system is comprised of
the somatic and autonomic nervous systems. The somatic nervous system transmits sensory and motor
signals to and from the central nervous system. The autonomic nervous system controls the function of our
organs and glands, and can be divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions. Sympathetic
activation prepares us for fight or flight, while parasympathetic activation is associated with normal
functioning under relaxed conditions.

3.4 The Brain and Spinal Cord

The brain consists of two hemispheres, each controlling the opposite side of the body. Each hemisphere can be
subdivided into different lobes: frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital. In addition to the lobes of the
cerebral cortex, the forebrain includes the thalamus (sensory relay) and limbic system (emotion and memory
circuit). The midbrain contains the reticular formation, which is important for sleep and arousal, as well as the
substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area. These structures are important for movement, reward, and
addictive processes. The hindbrain contains the structures of the brainstem (medulla, pons, and midbrain),
which control automatic functions like breathing and blood pressure. The hindbrain also contains the
cerebellum, which helps coordinate movement and certain types of memories.

Individuals with brain damage have been studied extensively to provide information about the role of different
areas of the brain, and recent advances in technology allow us to glean similar information by imaging brain
structure and function. These techniques include CT, PET, MRI, fMRI, and EEG.

3.5 The Endocrine System

The glands of the endocrine system secrete hormones to regulate normal body functions. The hypothalamus
serves as the interface between the nervous system and the endocrine system, and it controls the secretions of
the pituitary. The pituitary serves as the master gland, controlling the secretions of all other glands. The
thyroid secretes thyroxine, which is important for basic metabolic processes and growth; the adrenal glands
secrete hormones involved in the stress response; the pancreas secretes hormones that regulate blood sugar
levels; and the ovaries and testes produce sex hormones that regulate sexual motivation and behavior.

4.6 Other States of Consciousness

INTRODUCTION Our lives involve regular, dramatic changes in the degree to which we are aware of our
surroundings and our internal states. While awake, we feel alert and aware of the many important things going
on around us. Our experiences change dramatically while we are in deep sleep and once again when we are
dreaming. Some people also experience altered states of consciousness through meditation, hypnosis, or
alcohol and other drugs.
This chapter will discuss states of consciousness with a particular emphasis on sleep. The different stages of
sleep will be identified, and sleep disorders will be described. The chapter will close with discussions of altered
states of consciousness produced by psychoactive drugs, hypnosis, and meditation.

     4.1 What Is Consciousness?

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Understand what is meant by consciousness
         · Explain how circadian rhythms are involved in regulating the sleep-wake cycle, and how circadian cycles can be

             disrupted
         · Discuss the concept of sleep debt
       Consciousness describes our awareness of internal and external stimuli. Awareness of internal stimuli
       includes feeling pain, hunger, thirst, sleepiness, and being aware of our thoughts and emotions. Awareness of
       external stimuli includes experiences such as seeing the light from the sun, feeling the warmth of a room, and
       hearing the voice of a friend.
       We experience different states of consciousness and different levels of awareness on a regular basis. We might
       even describe consciousness as a continuum that ranges from full awareness to a deep sleep. Sleep is a state
       marked by relatively low levels of physical activity and reduced sensory awareness that is distinct from periods
       of rest that occur during wakefulness. Wakefulness is characterized by high levels of sensory awareness,
       thought, and behavior. Beyond being awake or asleep, there are many other states of consciousness people
       experience. These include daydreaming, intoxication, and unconsciousness due to anesthesia. We might also
       experience unconscious states of being via drug-induced anesthesia for medical purposes. Often, we are not
       completely aware of our surroundings, even when we are fully awake. For instance, have you ever daydreamed
       while driving home from work or school without really thinking about the drive itself? You were capable of
       engaging in the all of the complex tasks involved with operating a motor vehicle even though you were not
       aware of doing so. Many of these processes, like much of psychological behavior, are rooted in our biology.

      Biological Rhythms

       Biological rhythms are internal rhythms of biological activity. A woman's menstrual cycle is an example of a
       biological rhythm--a recurring, cyclical pattern of bodily changes. One complete menstrual cycle takes about
       28 days--a lunar month--but many biological cycles are much shorter. For example, body temperature
       fluctuates cyclically over a 24-hour period (Figure 4.2). Alertness is associated with higher body temperatures,
       and sleepiness with lower body temperatures.

       FIGURE 4.2 This chart illustrates the circadian change in body temperature over 28 hours in a group of eight young
       men. Body temperature rises throughout the waking day, peaking in the afternoon, and falls during sleep with the
       lowest point occurring during the very early morning hours.

This pattern of temperature fluctuation, which repeats every day, is one example of a circadian rhythm. A
circadian rhythm is a biological rhythm that takes place over a period of about 24 hours. Our sleep-wake
cycle, which is linked to our environment's natural light-dark cycle, is perhaps the most obvious example of a
circadian rhythm, but we also have daily fluctuations in heart rate, blood pressure, blood sugar, and body
temperature. Some circadian rhythms play a role in changes in our state of consciousness.
If we have biological rhythms, then is there some sort of biological clock? In the brain, the hypothalamus,
which lies above the pituitary gland, is a main center of homeostasis. Homeostasis is the tendency to maintain
a balance, or optimal level, within a biological system.
The brain's clock mechanism is located in an area of the hypothalamus known as the suprachiasmatic
nucleus (SCN). The axons of light-sensitive neurons in the retina provide information to the SCN based on the
amount of light present, allowing this internal clock to be synchronized with the outside world (Klein, Moore, &
Reppert, 1991; Welsh, Takahashi, & Kay, 2010) (Figure 4.3).

FIGURE 4.3 The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) serves as the brain's clock mechanism. The clock sets itself with
light information received through projections from the retina.

Problems With Circadian Rhythms

Generally, and for most people, our circadian cycles are aligned with the outside world. For example, most
people sleep during the night and are awake during the day. One important regulator of sleep-wake cycles is
the hormone melatonin. The pineal gland, an endocrine structure located inside the brain that releases
melatonin, is thought to be involved in the regulation of various biological rhythms and of the immune system
during sleep (Hardeland, Pandi-Perumal, & Cardinali, 2006). Melatonin release is stimulated by darkness and
inhibited by light.
There are individual differences in regard to our sleep-wake cycle. For instance, some people would say they
are morning people, while others would consider themselves to be night owls. These individual differences in
circadian patterns of activity are known as a person's chronotype, and research demonstrates that morning
larks and night owls differ with regard to sleep regulation (Taillard, Philip, Coste, Sagaspe, & Bioulac, 2003).
Sleep regulation refers to the brain's control of switching between sleep and wakefulness as well as
coordinating this cycle with the outside world.

       Disruptions of Normal Sleep
       Whether lark, owl, or somewhere in between, there are situations in which a person's circadian clock gets out
       of synchrony with the external environment. One way that this happens involves traveling across multiple time
       zones. When we do this, we often experience jet lag. Jet lag is a collection of symptoms that results from the
       mismatch between our internal circadian cycles and our environment. These symptoms include fatigue,
       sluggishness, irritability, and insomnia (i.e., a consistent difficulty in falling or staying asleep for at least three
       nights a week over a month's time) (Roth, 2007).
       Individuals who do rotating shift work are also likely to experience disruptions in circadian cycles. Rotating
       shift work refers to a work schedule that changes from early to late on a daily or weekly basis. For example, a
       person may work from 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. on Monday, 3:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. on Tuesday, and 11:00 a.m. to
       7:00 p.m. on Wednesday. In such instances, the individual's schedule changes so frequently that it becomes
       difficult for a normal circadian rhythm to be maintained. This often results in sleeping problems, and it can
       lead to signs of depression and anxiety. These kinds of schedules are common for individuals working in
       health care professions and service industries, and they are associated with persistent feelings of exhaustion
       and agitation that can make someone more prone to making mistakes on the job (Gold et al., 1992; Presser,
       1995).
       Rotating shift work has pervasive effects on the lives and experiences of individuals engaged in that kind of
       work, which is clearly illustrated in stories reported in a qualitative study that researched the experiences of
       middle-aged nurses who worked rotating shifts (West, Boughton & Byrnes, 2009). Several of the nurses
       interviewed commented that their work schedules affected their relationships with their family. One of the
       nurses said,

             If you've had a partner who does work regular job 9 to 5 office hours . . . the ability to spend time, good
             time with them when you're not feeling absolutely exhausted . . . that would be one of the problems
             that I've encountered. (West et al., 2009, p. 114)
       While disruptions in circadian rhythms can have negative consequences, there are things we can do to help us
       realign our biological clocks with the external environment. Some of these approaches, such as using a bright
       light as shown in Figure 4.4, have been shown to alleviate some of the problems experienced by individuals
       suffering from jet lag or from the consequences of rotating shift work. Because the biological clock is driven by
       light, exposure to bright light during working shifts and dark exposure when not working can help combat
       insomnia and symptoms of anxiety and depression (Huang, Tsai, Chen, & Hsu, 2013).

       FIGURE 4.4 Devices like this are designed to provide exposure to bright light to help people maintain a regular
       circadian cycle. They can be helpful for people working night shifts or for people affected by seasonal variations in
       light.

Insufficient Sleep

When people have difficulty getting sleep due to their work or the demands of day-to-day life, they accumulate
a sleep debt. A person with a sleep debt does not get sufficient sleep on a chronic basis. The consequences of
sleep debt include decreased levels of alertness and mental efficiency. Interestingly, since the advent of
electric light, the amount of sleep that people get has declined. While we certainly welcome the convenience of
having the darkness lit up, we also suffer the consequences of reduced amounts of sleep because we are more
active during the nighttime hours than our ancestors were. As a result, many of us sleep less than 7-8 hours a
night and accrue a sleep debt. While there is tremendous variation in any given individual's sleep needs, the
National Sleep Foundation (n.d.) cites research to estimate that newborns require the most sleep (between 12
and 18 hours a night) and that this amount declines to just 7-9 hours by the time we are adults.

If you lie down to take a nap and fall asleep very easily, chances are you may have sleep debt. Given that college
students are notorious for suffering from significant sleep debt (Hicks, Fernandez, & Pellegrini, 2001; Hicks,
Johnson, & Pellegrini, 1992; Miller, Shattuck, & Matsangas, 2010), chances are you and your classmates deal
with sleep debt-related issues on a regular basis. In 2015, the National Sleep Foundation updated their sleep
duration hours, to better accommodate individual differences. Table 4.1 shows the new recommendations,
which describe sleep durations that are "recommended", "may be appropriate", and "not recommended".

Sleep debt and sleep deprivation have significant negative psychological and physiological consequences
Figure 4.5. As mentioned earlier, lack of sleep can result in decreased mental alertness and cognitive function.
114 4 · States of Consciousness

       In addition, sleep deprivation often results in depression-like symptoms. These effects can occur as a function
       of accumulated sleep debt or in response to more acute periods of sleep deprivation. It may surprise you to
       know that sleep deprivation is associated with obesity, increased blood pressure, increased levels of stress
       hormones, and reduced immune functioning (Banks & Dinges, 2007). A sleep deprived individual generally
       will fall asleep more quickly than if they were not sleep deprived. Some sleep-deprived individuals have
       difficulty staying awake when they stop moving (example sitting and watching television or driving a car). That
       is why individuals suffering from sleep deprivation can also put themselves and others at risk when they put
       themselves behind the wheel of a car or work with dangerous machinery. Some research suggests that sleep
       deprivation affects cognitive and motor function as much as, if not more than, alcohol intoxication (Williamson
       & Feyer, 2000). Research shows that the most severe effects of sleep deprivation occur when a person stays
       awake for more than 24 hours (Killgore & Weber, 2014; Killgore et al., 2007), or following repeated nights with
       fewer than four hours in bed (Wickens, Hutchins, Lauk, Seebook, 2015). For example, irritability, distractibility,
       and impairments in cognitive and moral judgment can occur with fewer than four hours of sleep. If someone
       stays awake for 48 consecutive hours, they could start to hallucinate.

       FIGURE 4.5 This figure illustrates some of the negative consequences of sleep deprivation. While cognitive deficits
       may be the most obvious, many body systems are negatively impacted by lack of sleep. (credit: modification of work

       The amount of sleep we get varies across the lifespan. When we are very young, we spend up to 16 hours a day
       sleeping. As we grow older, we sleep less. In fact, a meta-analysis, which is a study that combines the results of
       many related studies, conducted within the last decade indicates that by the time we are 65 years old, we
       average fewer than 7 hours of sleep per day (Ohayon, Carskadon, Guilleminault, & Vitiello, 2004).

between 73 and 79 years old (Singh & Siahpush, 2006), we can expect to spend approximately 25 years of our
lives sleeping. Some animals never sleep (e.g., some fish and amphibian species); other animals sleep very
little without apparent negative consequences (e.g., giraffes); yet some animals (e.g., rats) die after two weeks
of sleep deprivation (Siegel, 2008). Why do we devote so much time to sleeping? Is it absolutely essential that
we sleep? This section will consider these questions and explore various explanations for why we sleep.

What is Sleep?

You have read that sleep is distinguished by low levels of physical activity and reduced sensory awareness. As
discussed by Siegel (2008), a definition of sleep must also include mention of the interplay of the circadian and
homeostatic mechanisms that regulate sleep. Homeostatic regulation of sleep is evidenced by sleep rebound
following sleep deprivation. Sleep rebound refers to the fact that a sleep-deprived individual will fall asleep
more quickly during subsequent opportunities for sleep. Sleep is characterized by certain patterns of activity
of the brain that can be visualized using electroencephalography (EEG), and different phases of sleep can be
differentiated using EEG as well.
Sleep-wake cycles seem to be controlled by multiple brain areas acting in conjunction with one another. Some
of these areas include the thalamus, the hypothalamus, and the pons. As already mentioned, the
hypothalamus contains the SCN--the biological clock of the body--in addition to other nuclei that, in
conjunction with the thalamus, regulate slow-wave sleep. The pons is important for regulating rapid eye
movement (REM) sleep (National Institutes of Health, n.d.).
Sleep is also associated with the secretion and regulation of a number of hormones from several endocrine
glands including: melatonin, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and growth
hormone (National Institutes of Health, n.d.). You have read that the pineal gland releases melatonin during
sleep (Figure 4.6). Melatonin is thought to be involved in the regulation of various biological rhythms and the
immune system (Hardeland et al., 2006). During sleep, the pituitary gland secretes both FSH and LH which are
important in regulating the reproductive system (Christensen et al., 2012; Sofikitis et al., 2008). The pituitary
gland also secretes growth hormone, during sleep, which plays a role in physical growth and maturation as
well as other metabolic processes (Bartke, Sun, & Longo, 2013).

                  FIGURE 4.6 The pineal and pituitary glands secrete a number of hormones during sleep.

Why Do We Sleep?

Given the central role that sleep plays in our lives and the number of adverse consequences that have been
associated with sleep deprivation, one would think that we would have a clear understanding of why it is that
we sleep. Unfortunately, this is not the case; however, several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the
function of sleep.
116 4 · States of Consciousness

       Adaptive Function of Sleep

       One popular hypothesis of sleep incorporates the perspective of evolutionary psychology. Evolutionary
       psychology is a discipline that studies how universal patterns of behavior and cognitive processes have
       evolved over time as a result of natural selection. Variations and adaptations in cognition and behavior make
       individuals more or less successful in reproducing and passing their genes to their offspring. One hypothesis
       from this perspective might argue that sleep is essential to restore resources that are expended during the day.
       Just as bears hibernate in the winter when resources are scarce, perhaps people sleep at night to reduce their
       energy expenditures. While this is an intuitive explanation of sleep, there is little research that supports this
       explanation. In fact, it has been suggested that there is no reason to think that energetic demands could not be
       addressed with periods of rest and inactivity (Frank, 2006; Rial et al., 2007), and some research has actually
       found a negative correlation between energetic demands and the amount of time spent sleeping (Capellini,
       Barton, McNamara, Preston, & Nunn, 2008).

       Another evolutionary hypothesis of sleep holds that our sleep patterns evolved as an adaptive response to
       predatory risks, which increase in darkness. Thus we sleep in safe areas to reduce the chance of harm. Again,
       this is an intuitive and appealing explanation for why we sleep. Perhaps our ancestors spent extended periods
       of time asleep to reduce attention to themselves from potential predators. Comparative research indicates,
       however, that the relationship that exists between predatory risk and sleep is very complex and equivocal.
       Some research suggests that species that face higher predatory risks sleep fewer hours than other species
       (Capellini et al., 2008), while other researchers suggest there is no relationship between the amount of time a
       given species spends in deep sleep and its predation risk (Lesku, Roth, Amlaner, & Lima, 2006).

       It is quite possible that sleep serves no single universally adaptive function, and different species have evolved
       different patterns of sleep in response to their unique evolutionary pressures. While we have discussed the
       negative outcomes associated with sleep deprivation, it should be pointed out that there are many benefits that
       are associated with adequate amounts of sleep. A few such benefits listed by the National Sleep Foundation
       (n.d.) include maintaining healthy weight, lowering stress levels, improving mood, and increasing motor
       coordination, as well as a number of benefits related to cognition and memory formation.

       Cognitive Function of Sleep

       Another theory regarding why we sleep involves sleep's importance for cognitive function and memory
       formation (Rattenborg, Lesku, Martinez-Gonzalez, & Lima, 2007). Indeed, we know sleep deprivation results in
       disruptions in cognition and memory deficits (Brown, 2012), leading to impairments in our abilities to
       maintain attention, make decisions, and recall long-term memories. Moreover, these impairments become
       more severe as the amount of sleep deprivation increases (Alhola & Polo-Kantola, 2007). Furthermore, slow-
       wave sleep after learning a new task can improve resultant performance on that task (Huber, Ghilardi,
       Massimini, & Tononi, 2004) and seems essential for effective memory formation (Stickgold, 2005).
       Understanding the impact of sleep on cognitive function should help you understand that cramming all night
       for a test may be not effective and can even prove counterproductive.

       Getting the optimal amount of sleep has also been associated with other cognitive benefits. Research indicates
       that included among these possible benefits are increased capacities for creative thinking (Cai, Mednick,
       Harrison, Kanady, & Mednick, 2009; Wagner, Gais, Haider, Verleger, & Born, 2004), language learning (Fenn,
       Nusbaum, & Margoliash, 2003; Gómez, Bootzin, & Nadel, 2006), and inferential judgments (Ellenbogen, Hu,
       Payne, Titone, & Walker, 2007). It is possible that even the processing of emotional information is influenced by
       certain aspects of sleep (Walker, 2009).

4.3 Stages of Sleep

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Differentiate between REM and non-REM sleep
  · Describe the differences between the three stages of non-REM sleep
  · Understand the role that REM and non-REM sleep play in learning and memory
Sleep is not a uniform state of being. Instead, sleep is composed of several different stages that can be
differentiated from one another by the patterns of brain wave activity that occur during each stage. While
awake, our brain wave activity is dominated by beta waves. As compared to the brain wave patterns while
asleep, beta waves have the highest frequency (13-30 Hz) and lowest amplitude, and they tend to show more
variability. As we begin to fall asleep, our brain wave activity changes. These changes can be visualized using
an EEG and are distinguished from one another by both the frequency and amplitude of the brain wave. The
frequency of a brain wave is how many brain waves occur in a second, and frequency is measured in Hertz
(Hz). Amplitude is the height of the brain wave (Figure 4.7). Sleep can be divided into two different general
phases: REM sleep and non-REM (NREM) sleep. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is characterized by darting
movements of the eyes under closed eyelids. Brain waves during REM sleep appear very similar to brain waves
during wakefulness. In contrast, non-REM (NREM) sleep is subdivided into three stages distinguished from
each other and from wakefulness by characteristic patterns of brain waves. The first three stages of sleep are
NREM sleep, typically followed by REM sleep. In this section, we will discuss each of these stages of sleep and
their associated patterns of brain wave activity.

FIGURE 4.7 Brainwave activity changes dramatically across the different stages of sleep. (credit "sleeping":
modification of work by Ryan Vaarsi)

NREM Stages of Sleep

As we begin to fall asleep, we enter NREM sleep, and brain wave patterns decrease in frequency and increase
in amplitude. The first stage of NREM sleep is known as stage 1 sleep. Stage 1 sleep is a transitional phase that
occurs between wakefulness and sleep, the period during which we drift off to sleep. During this time, there is
a slowdown in both the rates of respiration and heartbeat. In addition, stage 1 sleep involves a marked
118 4 · States of Consciousness

       decrease in both overall muscle tension and core body temperature.
       In terms of brain wave activity, stage 1 sleep is associated with both alpha and theta waves. The early portion of
       stage 1 sleep produces alpha waves. These patterns of electrical activity (waves) resemble that of someone
       who is very relaxed, yet awake, but they have less variability (are more synchronized) and are relatively lower
       in frequency (8-12 Hz) and higher in amplitude than beta waves (Figure 4.8). As an individual continues
       through stage 1 sleep, there is an increase in theta wave activity. Theta waves are even lower frequency (4-7
       Hz), and higher in amplitude, than the alpha wave patterns. It is relatively easy to wake someone from stage 1
       sleep; in fact, people often report that they have not been asleep if they are awoken during stage 1 sleep.

                         FIGURE 4.8 Brainwave activity changes dramatically across the different stages of sleep.
       As we move into stage 2 sleep, the body goes into a state of deep relaxation. Theta waves still dominate the
       activity of the brain, but they are interrupted by brief bursts of activity known as sleep spindles (Figure 4.9). A
       sleep spindle is a rapid burst of higher frequency brain waves that may be important for learning and memory
       (Fogel & Smith, 2011; Poe, Walsh, & Bjorness, 2010). In addition, the appearance of K-complexes is often
       associated with stage 2 sleep. A K-complex is a very high amplitude pattern of brain activity that may in some
       cases occur in response to environmental stimuli. Thus, K-complexes might serve as a bridge to higher levels
       of arousal in response to what is going on in our environments (Halász, 1993; Steriade & Amzica, 1998).

                FIGURE 4.9 Stage 2 sleep is characterized by the appearance of both sleep spindles and K-complexes.
       NREM stage 3 sleep is often referred to as deep sleep or slow-wave sleep because this stage is characterized by
       low frequency (less than 3 Hz), high amplitude delta waves (Figure 4.10). These delta waves have the lowest
       frequency and highest amplitude of our sleeping brain wave patterns. During this time, an individual's heart
       rate and respiration slow dramatically, and it is much more difficult to awaken someone from sleep during

stage 3 than during earlier stages. Interestingly, individuals who have increased levels of alpha brain wave
activity (more often associated with wakefulness and transition into stage 1 sleep) during stage 3 often report
that they do not feel refreshed upon waking, regardless of how long they slept (Stone, Taylor, McCrae, Kalsekar,
& Lichstein, 2008).

FIGURE 4.10 (a) Delta waves, which are low frequency and high amplitude, characterize (b) slow-wave stage 3 and
REM sleep.

REM Sleep

As mentioned earlier, REM sleep is marked by rapid movements of the eyes. The brain waves associated with
this stage of sleep are very similar to those observed when a person is awake, as shown in Figure 4.11, and this
is the period of sleep in which dreaming occurs. It is also associated with paralysis of muscle systems in the
body with the exception of those that make circulation and respiration possible. Therefore, no movement of
voluntary muscles occurs during REM sleep in a normal individual; REM sleep is often referred to as
paradoxical sleep because of this combination of high brain activity and lack of muscle tone. Like NREM sleep,
REM has been implicated in various aspects of learning and memory (Wagner, Gais, & Born, 2001; Siegel,
2001).

FIGURE 4.11 (a) A period of rapid eye movement is marked by the short red line segment. The brain waves
associated with REM sleep, outlined in the red box in (a), look very similar to those seen (b) during wakefulness.
If people are deprived of REM sleep and then allowed to sleep without disturbance, they will spend more time
in REM sleep in what would appear to be an effort to recoup the lost time in REM. This is known as the REM
rebound, and it suggests that REM sleep is also homeostatically regulated. Aside from the role that REM sleep
may play in processes related to learning and memory, REM sleep may also be involved in emotional
120 4 · States of Consciousness

       processing and regulation. In such instances, REM rebound may actually represent an adaptive response to
       stress in nondepressed individuals by suppressing the emotional salience of aversive events that occurred in
       wakefulness (Suchecki, Tiba, & Machado, 2012). Sleep deprivation in general is associated with a number of
       negative consequences (Brown, 2012).
       The hypnogram below (Figure 4.12) shows a person's passage through the stages of sleep.

       Dreams
       Dreams and their associated meanings vary across different cultures and periods of time. By the late 19th
       century, Austrian psychiatrist Sigmund Freud had become convinced that dreams represented an opportunity
       to gain access to the unconscious. By analyzing dreams, Freud thought people could increase self-awareness
       and gain valuable insight to help them deal with the problems they faced in their lives. Freud made
       distinctions between the manifest content and the latent content of dreams. Manifest content is the actual
       content, or storyline, of a dream. Latent content, on the other hand, refers to the hidden meaning of a dream.
       For instance, if a woman dreams about being chased by a snake, Freud might have argued that this represents
       the woman's fear of sexual intimacy, with the snake serving as a symbol of a man's penis.
       Freud was not the only theorist to focus on the content of dreams. The 20th century Swiss psychiatrist Carl
       Jung believed that dreams allowed us to tap into the collective unconscious. The collective unconscious, as
       described by Jung, is a theoretical repository of information he believed to be shared by everyone. According
       to Jung, certain symbols in dreams reflected universal archetypes with meanings that are similar for all people
       regardless of culture or location.
       The sleep and dreaming researcher Rosalind Cartwright, however, believes that dreams simply reflect life
       events that are important to the dreamer. Unlike Freud and Jung, Cartwright's ideas about dreaming have
       found empirical support. For example, she and her colleagues published a study in which women going
       through divorce were asked several times over a five month period to report the degree to which their former
       spouses were on their minds. These same women were awakened during REM sleep in order to provide a
       detailed account of their dream content. There was a significant positive correlation between the degree to
       which women thought about their former spouses during waking hours and the number of times their former
       spouses appeared as characters in their dreams (Cartwright, Agargun, Kirkby, & Friedman, 2006). Recent
       research (Horikawa, Tamaki, Miyawaki, & Kamitani, 2013) has uncovered new techniques by which

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                                          4.4 · Sleep Problems and Disorders 121

researchers may effectively detect and classify the visual images that occur during dreaming by using fMRI for
neural measurement of brain activity patterns, opening the way for additional research in this area.

Alan Hobson, a neuroscientist, is credited for developing activation-synthesis theory of dreaming. Early
versions of this theory proposed that dreams were not the meaning-filled representations of angst proposed by
Freud and others, but were rather the result of our brain attempting to make sense of ("synthesize") the neural
activity ("activation") that was happening during REM sleep. Recent adaptations (e.g., Hobson, 2002) continue
to update the theory based on accumulating evidence. For example, Hobson (2009) suggests that dreaming
may represent a state of protoconsciousness. In other words, dreaming involves constructing a virtual reality
in our heads that we might use to help us during wakefulness. Among a variety of neurobiological evidence,
John Hobson cites research on lucid dreams as an opportunity to better understand dreaming in general.
Lucid dreams are dreams in which certain aspects of wakefulness are maintained during a dream state. In a
lucid dream, a person becomes aware of the fact that they are dreaming, and as such, they can control the
dream's content (LaBerge, 1990).

4.4 Sleep Problems and Disorders

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Describe the symptoms and treatments of insomnia
  · Recognize the symptoms of several parasomnias
  · Describe the symptoms and treatments for sleep apnea
  · Recognize risk factors associated with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and steps to prevent it
  · Describe the symptoms and treatments for narcolepsy

Many people experience disturbances in their sleep at some point in their lives. Depending on the population
and sleep disorder being studied, between 30% and 50% of the population suffers from a sleep disorder at
some point in their lives (Bixler, Kales, Soldatos, Kaels, & Healey, 1979; Hossain & Shapiro, 2002; Ohayon,
1997, 2002; Ohayon & Roth, 2002). This section will describe several sleep disorders as well as some of their
treatment options.

Insomnia

Insomnia, a consistent difficulty in falling or staying asleep, is the most common of the sleep disorders.
Individuals with insomnia often experience long delays between the times that they go to bed and actually fall
asleep. In addition, these individuals may wake up several times during the night only to find that they have
difficulty getting back to sleep. As mentioned earlier, one of the criteria for insomnia involves experiencing
these symptoms for at least three nights a week for at least one month's time (Roth, 2007).

It is not uncommon for people suffering from insomnia to experience increased levels of anxiety about their
inability to fall asleep. This becomes a self-perpetuating cycle because increased anxiety leads to increased
arousal, and higher levels of arousal make the prospect of falling asleep even more unlikely. Chronic insomnia
is almost always associated with feeling overtired and may be associated with symptoms of depression.

There may be many factors that contribute to insomnia, including age, drug use, exercise, mental status, and
bedtime routines. Not surprisingly, insomnia treatment may take one of several different approaches. People
who suffer from insomnia might limit their use of stimulant drugs (such as caffeine) or increase their amount
of physical exercise during the day. Some people might turn to over-the-counter (OTC) or prescribed sleep
medications to help them sleep, but this should be done sparingly because many sleep medications result in
dependence and alter the nature of the sleep cycle, and they can increase insomnia over time. Those who
continue to have insomnia, particularly if it affects their quality of life, should seek professional treatment.

Some forms of psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, can help sufferers of insomnia.
Cognitive-behavioral therapy is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on cognitive processes and problem
122 4 · States of Consciousness

       behaviors. The treatment of insomnia likely would include stress management techniques and changes in
       problematic behaviors that could contribute to insomnia (e.g., spending more waking time in bed). Cognitive-
       behavioral therapy has been demonstrated to be quite effective in treating insomnia (Savard, Simard, Ivers, &
       Morin, 2005; Williams, Roth, Vatthauer, & McCrae, 2013).

                                                                                             EVERYDAY CONNECTION

        Solutions to Support Healthy Sleep

         Has something like this ever happened to you? My sophomore college housemate got so stressed out during
         finals sophomore year he drank almost a whole bottle of Nyquil to try to fall asleep. When he told me, I made him
         go see the college therapist.

         Many college students struggle getting the recommended 7-9 hours of sleep each night. However, for some, it's
         not because of all-night partying or late-night study sessions. It's simply that they feel so overwhelmed and
         stressed that they cannot fall asleep or stay asleep. One or two nights of sleep difficulty is not unusual, but if you
         experience anything more than that, you should seek a doctor's advice.

         Here are some tips to maintain healthy sleep:

           · Stick to a sleep schedule, even on the weekends. Try going to bed and waking up at the same time every day
               to keep your biological clock in sync so your body gets in the habit of sleeping every night.

           · Avoid anything stimulating for an hour before bed. That includes exercise and bright light from devices.
           · Exercise daily.
           · Avoid naps.
           · Keep your bedroom temperature between 60 and 67 degrees. People sleep better in cooler temperatures.
           · Avoid alcohol, cigarettes, caffeine, and heavy meals before bed. It may feel like alcohol helps you sleep, but

               it actually disrupts REM sleep and leads to frequent awakenings. Heavy meals may make you sleepy, but
               they can also lead to frequent awakenings due to gastric distress.
           · If you cannot fall asleep, leave your bed and do something else until you feel tired again. Train your body to
               associate the bed with sleeping rather than other activities like studying, eating, or watching television
               shows.

      Parasomnias

       A parasomnia is one of a group of sleep disorders in which unwanted, disruptive motor activity and/or
       experiences during sleep play a role. Parasomnias can occur in either REM or NREM phases of sleep.
       Sleepwalking, restless leg syndrome, and night terrors are all examples of parasomnias (Mahowald & Schenck,
       2000).

       Sleepwalking

       In sleepwalking, or somnambulism, the sleeper engages in relatively complex behaviors ranging from
       wandering about to driving an automobile. During periods of sleepwalking, sleepers often have their eyes
       open, but they are not responsive to attempts to communicate with them. Sleepwalking most often occurs
       during slow-wave sleep, but it can occur at any time during a sleep period in some affected individuals
       (Mahowald & Schenck, 2000).

       Historically, somnambulism has been treated with a variety of pharmacotherapies ranging from
       benzodiazepines to antidepressants. However, the success rate of such treatments is questionable.
       Guilleminault et al. (2005) found that sleepwalking was not alleviated with the use of benzodiazepines.
       However, all of their somnambulistic patients who also suffered from sleep-related breathing problems
       showed a marked decrease in sleepwalking when their breathing problems were effectively treated.

 A Sleepwalking Defense?

  On January 16, 1997, Scott Falater sat down to dinner with his wife and children and told them about difficulties
  he was experiencing on a project at work. After dinner, he prepared some materials to use in leading a church
  youth group the following morning, and then he attempted to repair the family's swimming pool pump before
  retiring to bed. The following morning, he awoke to barking dogs and unfamiliar voices from downstairs. As he
  went to investigate what was going on, he was met by a group of police officers who arrested him for the murder
  of his wife (Cartwright, 2004; CNN, 1999).

  Yarmila Falater's body was found in the family's pool with 44 stab wounds. A neighbor called the police after
  witnessing Falater standing over his wife's body before dragging her into the pool. Upon a search of the premises,
  police found blood-stained clothes and a bloody knife in the trunk of Falater's car, and he had blood stains on his
  neck.

  Remarkably, Falater insisted that he had no recollection of hurting his wife in any way. His children and his wife's
  parents all agreed that Falater had an excellent relationship with his wife and they couldn't think of a reason that
  would provide any sort of motive to murder her (Cartwright, 2004).

  Scott Falater had a history of regular episodes of sleepwalking as a child, and he had even behaved violently
  toward his sister once when she tried to prevent him from leaving their home in his pajamas during a
  sleepwalking episode. He suffered from no apparent anatomical brain anomalies or psychological disorders. It
  appeared that Scott Falater had killed his wife in his sleep, or at least, that is the defense he used when he was
  tried for his wife's murder (Cartwright, 2004; CNN, 1999). In Falater's case, a jury found him guilty of first degree
  murder in June of 1999 (CNN, 1999); however, there are other murder cases where the sleepwalking defense
  has been used successfully. As scary as it sounds, many sleep researchers believe that homicidal sleepwalking is
  possible in individuals suffering from the types of sleep disorders described below (Broughton et al., 1994;
  Cartwright, 2004; Mahowald, Schenck, & Cramer Bornemann, 2005; Pressman, 2007).

REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD)

REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) occurs when the muscle paralysis associated with the REM sleep phase
does not occur. Individuals who suffer from RBD have high levels of physical activity during REM sleep,
especially during disturbing dreams. These behaviors vary widely, but they can include kicking, punching,
scratching, yelling, and behaving like an animal that has been frightened or attacked. People who suffer from
this disorder can injure themselves or their sleeping partners when engaging in these behaviors. Furthermore,
these types of behaviors ultimately disrupt sleep, although affected individuals have no memories that these
behaviors have occurred (Arnulf, 2012).

This disorder is associated with a number of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. In fact,
this relationship is so robust that some view the presence of RBD as a potential aid in the diagnosis and
treatment of a number of neurodegenerative diseases (Ferini-Strambi, 2011). Clonazepam, an anti-anxiety
medication with sedative properties, is most often used to treat RBD. It is administered alone or in conjunction
with doses of melatonin (the hormone secreted by the pineal gland). As part of treatment, the sleeping
environment is often modified to make it a safer place for those suffering from RBD (Zangini, Calandra-
Buonaura, Grimaldi, & Cortelli, 2011).

Other Parasomnias

A person with restless leg syndrome has uncomfortable sensations in the legs during periods of inactivity or
when trying to fall asleep. This discomfort is relieved by deliberately moving the legs, which, not surprisingly,
contributes to difficulty in falling or staying asleep. Restless leg syndrome is quite common and has been
124 4 · States of Consciousness

       associated with a number of other medical diagnoses, such as chronic kidney disease and diabetes (Mahowald
       & Schenck, 2000). There are a variety of drugs that treat restless leg syndrome: benzodiazepines, opiates, and
       anticonvulsants (Restless Legs Syndrome Foundation, n.d.).
       Night terrors result in a sense of panic in the sufferer and are often accompanied by screams and attempts to
       escape from the immediate environment (Mahowald & Schenck, 2000). Although individuals suffering from
       night terrors appear to be awake, they generally have no memories of the events that occurred, and attempts to
       console them are ineffective. Typically, individuals suffering from night terrors will fall back asleep again
       within a short time. Night terrors apparently occur during the NREM phase of sleep (Provini, Tinuper, Bisulli, &
       Lagaresi, 2011). Generally, treatment for night terrors is unnecessary unless there is some underlying medical
       or psychological condition that is contributing to the night terrors (Mayo Clinic, n.d.).

      Sleep Apnea

       Sleep apnea is defined by episodes during which a sleeper's breathing stops. These episodes can last 10-20
       seconds or longer and often are associated with brief periods of arousal. While individuals suffering from sleep
       apnea may not be aware of these repeated disruptions in sleep, they do experience increased levels of fatigue.
       Many individuals diagnosed with sleep apnea first seek treatment because their sleeping partners indicate
       that they snore loudly and/or stop breathing for extended periods of time while sleeping (Henry & Rosenthal,
       2013). Sleep apnea is much more common in overweight people and is often associated with loud snoring.
       Surprisingly, sleep apnea may exacerbate cardiovascular disease (Sánchez-de-la-Torre, Campos-Rodriguez, &
       Barbé, 2012). While sleep apnea is less common in thin people, anyone, regardless of their weight, who snores
       loudly or gasps for air while sleeping, should be checked for sleep apnea.
       While people are often unaware of their sleep apnea, they are keenly aware of some of the adverse
       consequences of insufficient sleep. Consider a patient who believed that as a result of his sleep apnea he "had
       three car accidents in six weeks. They were ALL my fault. Two of them I didn't even know I was involved in
       until afterwards" (Henry & Rosenthal, 2013, p. 52). It is not uncommon for people suffering from undiagnosed
       or untreated sleep apnea to fear that their careers will be affected by the lack of sleep, illustrated by this
       statement from another patient, "I'm in a job where there's a premium on being mentally alert. I was really
       sleepy... and having trouble concentrating.... It was getting to the point where it was kind of scary" (Henry &
       Rosenthal, 2013, p. 52).
       There are two types of sleep apnea: obstructive sleep apnea and central sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea
       occurs when an individual's airway becomes blocked during sleep, and air is prevented from entering the
       lungs. In central sleep apnea, disruption in signals sent from the brain that regulate breathing cause periods
       of interrupted breathing (White, 2005).
       One of the most common treatments for sleep apnea involves the use of a special device during sleep. A
       continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device includes a mask that fits over the sleeper's nose and
       mouth, which is connected to a pump that pumps air into the person's airways, forcing them to remain open,
       as shown in Figure 4.13. Some newer CPAP masks are smaller and cover only the nose. This treatment option
       has proven to be effective for people suffering from mild to severe cases of sleep apnea (McDaid et al., 2009).
       However, alternative treatment options are being explored because consistent compliance by users of CPAP
       devices is a problem. Recently, a new EPAP (expiratory positive air pressure) device has shown promise in
       double-blind trials as one such alternative (Berry, Kryger, & Massie, 2011).

and a mask that covers the nose and mouth.
SIDS
In sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) an infant stops breathing during sleep and dies. Infants younger
than 12 months appear to be at the highest risk for SIDS, and boys have a greater risk than girls. A number of
risk factors have been associated with SIDS including premature birth, smoking within the home, and
hyperthermia. There may also be differences in both brain structure and function in infants that die from SIDS
(Berkowitz, 2012; Mage & Donner, 2006; Thach, 2005).
The substantial amount of research on SIDS has led to a number of recommendations to parents to protect
their children (Figure 4.14). For one, research suggests that infants should be placed on their backs when put
down to sleep, and their cribs should not contain any items which pose suffocation threats, such as blankets,
pillows or padded crib bumpers (cushions that cover the bars of a crib). Infants should not have caps placed on
their heads when put down to sleep in order to prevent overheating, and people in the child's household should
abstain from smoking in the home. Recommendations like these have helped to decrease the number of infant
deaths from SIDS in recent years (Mitchell, 2009; Task Force on Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, 2011).

FIGURE 4.14 The Safe to Sleep campaign educates the public about how to minimize risk factors associated with
SIDS. This campaign is sponsored in part by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

Narcolepsy

Unlike the other sleep disorders described in this section, a person with narcolepsy cannot resist falling
asleep at inopportune times. These sleep episodes are often associated with cataplexy, which is a lack of
muscle tone or muscle weakness, and in some cases involves complete paralysis of the voluntary muscles.
This is similar to the kind of paralysis experienced by healthy individuals during REM sleep (Burgess &
Scammell, 2012; Hishikawa & Shimizu, 1995; Luppi et al., 2011). Narcoleptic episodes take on other features
of REM sleep. For example, around one third of individuals diagnosed with narcolepsy experience vivid,
dream-like hallucinations during narcoleptic attacks (Chokroverty, 2010).
Surprisingly, narcoleptic episodes are often triggered by states of heightened arousal or stress. The typical
episode can last from a minute or two to half an hour. Once awakened from a narcoleptic attack, people report
that they feel refreshed (Chokroverty, 2010). Obviously, regular narcoleptic episodes could interfere with the
ability to perform one's job or complete schoolwork, and in some situations, narcolepsy can result in
significant harm and injury (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery or other potentially dangerous
equipment).
126 4 · States of Consciousness

       Generally, narcolepsy is treated using psychomotor stimulant drugs, such as amphetamines (Mignot, 2012).
       These drugs promote increased levels of neural activity. Narcolepsy is associated with reduced levels of the
       signaling molecule hypocretin in some areas of the brain (De la Herrán-Arita & Drucker-Colín, 2012; Han,
       2012), and the traditional stimulant drugs do not have direct effects on this system. Therefore, it is quite likely
       that new medications that are developed to treat narcolepsy will be designed to target the hypocretin system.

       There is a tremendous amount of variability among sufferers, both in terms of how symptoms of narcolepsy
       manifest and the effectiveness of currently available treatment options. This is illustrated by McCarty's (2010)
       case study of a 50-year-old woman who sought help for the excessive sleepiness during normal waking hours
       that she had experienced for several years. She indicated that she had fallen asleep at inappropriate or
       dangerous times, including while eating, while socializing with friends, and while driving her car. During
       periods of emotional arousal, the woman complained that she felt some weakness in the right side of her body.
       Although she did not experience any dream-like hallucinations, she was diagnosed with narcolepsy as a result
       of sleep testing. In her case, the fact that her cataplexy was confined to the right side of her body was quite
       unusual. Early attempts to treat her condition with a stimulant drug alone were unsuccessful. However, when a
       stimulant drug was used in conjunction with a popular antidepressant, her condition improved dramatically.

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe the diagnostic criteria for substance use disorders
         · Identify the neurotransmitter systems impacted by various categories of drugs
         · Describe how different categories of drugs affect behavior and experience

       While we all experience altered states of consciousness in the form of sleep on a regular basis, some people
       use drugs and other substances that result in altered states of consciousness as well. This section will present
       information relating to the use of various psychoactive drugs and problems associated with such use. This will
       be followed by brief descriptions of the effects of some of the more well-known drugs commonly used today.

      Substance Use Disorders

       The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) is used by
       clinicians to diagnose individuals suffering from various psychological disorders. Drug use disorders are
       addictive disorders, and the criteria for specific substance (drug) use disorders are described in DSM-5. A
       person who has a substance use disorder often uses more of the substance than they originally intended to and
       continues to use that substance despite experiencing significant adverse consequences. In individuals
       diagnosed with a substance use disorder, there is a compulsive pattern of drug use that is often associated with
       both physical and psychological dependence.

       Physical dependence involves changes in normal bodily functions--the user will experience withdrawal from
       the drug upon cessation of use. In contrast, a person who has psychological dependence has an emotional,
       rather than physical, need for the drug and may use the drug to relieve psychological distress. Tolerance is
       linked to physiological dependence, and it occurs when a person requires more and more drug to achieve
       effects previously experienced at lower doses. Tolerance can cause the user to increase the amount of drug
       used to a dangerous level--even to the point of overdose and death.

       Drug withdrawal includes a variety of negative symptoms experienced when drug use is discontinued. These
       symptoms usually are opposite of the effects of the drug. For example, withdrawal from sedative drugs often
       produces unpleasant arousal and agitation. In addition to withdrawal, many individuals who are diagnosed
       with substance use disorders will also develop tolerance to these substances. Psychological dependence, or
       drug craving, is a recent addition to the diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder in DSM-5. This is an
       important factor because we can develop tolerance and experience withdrawal from any number of drugs that
       we do not abuse. In other words, physical dependence in and of itself is of limited utility in determining

whether or not someone has a substance use disorder.

Drug Categories

The effects of all psychoactive drugs occur through their interactions with our endogenous neurotransmitter
systems. Many of these drugs, and their relationships, are shown in Table 4.2. As you have learned, drugs can
act as agonists or antagonists of a given neurotransmitter system. An agonist facilitates the activity of a
neurotransmitter system, and antagonists impede neurotransmitter activity.

TABLE 4.2

Alcohol and Other Depressants
Ethanol, which we commonly refer to as alcohol, is in a class of psychoactive drugs known as depressants
128 4 · States of Consciousness

       (Figure 4.15). A depressant is a drug that tends to suppress central nervous system activity. Other depressants
       include barbiturates and benzodiazepines. These drugs share in common their ability to serve as agonists of
       the gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitter system. Because GABA has a quieting effect on the
       brain, GABA agonists also have a quieting effect; these types of drugs are often prescribed to treat both anxiety
       and insomnia.

       FIGURE 4.15 The GABA-gated chloride (Cl-) channel is embedded in the cell membrane of certain neurons. The
       channel has multiple receptor sites where alcohol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines bind to exert their effects. The
       binding of these molecules opens the chloride channel, allowing negatively-charged chloride ions (Cl-) into the
       neuron's cell body. Changing its charge in a negative direction pushes the neuron away from firing; thus, activating a
       GABA neuron has a quieting effect on the brain.
       Acute alcohol administration results in a variety of changes to consciousness. At rather low doses, alcohol use
       is associated with feelings of euphoria. As the dose increases, people report feeling sedated. Generally, alcohol
       is associated with decreases in reaction time and visual acuity, lowered levels of alertness, and reduction in
       behavioral control. With excessive alcohol use, a person might experience a complete loss of consciousness
       and/or difficulty remembering events that occurred during a period of intoxication (McKim & Hancock, 2013).
       In addition, if a pregnant person consumes alcohol, their infant may be born with a cluster of birth defects and
       symptoms collectively called fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) or fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS).
       With repeated use of many central nervous system depressants, such as alcohol, a person becomes physically
       dependent upon the substance and will exhibit signs of both tolerance and withdrawal. Psychological
       dependence on these drugs is also possible. Therefore, the abuse potential of central nervous system
       depressants is relatively high.
       Drug withdrawal is usually an aversive experience, and it can be a life-threatening process in individuals who
       have a long history of very high doses of alcohol and/or barbiturates. This is of such concern that people who
       are trying to overcome addiction to these substances should only do so under medical supervision.

Stimulants

Stimulants are drugs that tend to increase overall levels of neural activity. Many of these drugs act as agonists
of the dopamine neurotransmitter system. Dopamine activity is often associated with reward and craving;
therefore, drugs that affect dopamine neurotransmission often have abuse liability. Drugs in this category
include cocaine, amphetamines (including methamphetamine), cathinones (i.e., bath salts), MDMA (ecstasy),
nicotine, and caffeine.

Cocaine can be taken in multiple ways. While many users snort cocaine, intravenous injection and inhalation
(smoking) are also common. The freebase version of cocaine, known as crack, is a potent, smokable version of
the drug. Like many other stimulants, cocaine agonizes the dopamine neurotransmitter system by blocking
the reuptake of dopamine in the neuronal synapse.

                                                                                                             DIG DEEPER

 Methamphetamine

  Methamphetamine in its smokable form, often called "crystal meth" due to its resemblance to rock crystal
  formations, is highly addictive. The smokable form reaches the brain very quickly to produce an intense euphoria
  that dissipates almost as fast as it arrives, prompting users to continuing taking the drug. Users often consume
  the drug every few hours across days-long binges called "runs," in which the user forgoes food and sleep. The
  availability of potent and inexpensive forms of methamphetamine, coupled with a lower risk of overdose than
  with opiate drugs, is making crystal meth a popular choice among drug users today (NIDA, 2019). Using crystal
  meth poses a number of serious long-term health issues, including dental problems (often called "meth mouth"),
  skin abrasions caused by excessive scratching, memory loss, sleep problems, violent behavior, paranoia, and
  hallucinations. Methamphetamine addiction produces an intense craving that is difficult to treat.

Amphetamines have a mechanism of action quite similar to cocaine in that they block the reuptake of
dopamine in addition to stimulating its release (Figure 4.16). While amphetamines are often abused, they are
also commonly prescribed to people diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It may
seem counterintuitive that stimulant medications are prescribed to treat a disorder that involves hyperactivity,
but the therapeutic effect comes from increases in neurotransmitter activity within certain areas of the brain
associated with impulse control. These brain areas include the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia.
130 4 · States of Consciousness

       FIGURE 4.16 As one of their mechanisms of action, cocaine and amphetamines block the reuptake of dopamine
       from the synapse into the presynaptic cell.
       In recent years, methamphetamine (meth) use has become increasingly widespread. Methamphetamine is a
       type of amphetamine that can be made from ingredients that are readily available (e.g., medications
       containing pseudoephedrine, a compound found in many over-the-counter cold and flu remedies). Despite
       recent changes in laws designed to make obtaining pseudoephedrine more difficult, methamphetamine
       continues to be an easily accessible and relatively inexpensive drug option (Shukla, Crump, & Chrisco, 2012).
       Stimulant users seek a euphoric high, feelings of intense elation and pleasure, especially in those users who
       take the drug via intravenous injection or smoking. MDMA (3.4-methelynedioxy-methamphetamine,
       commonly known as "ecstasy" or "Molly") is a mild stimulant with perception-altering effects. It is typically
       consumed in pill form. Users experience increased energy, feelings of pleasure, and emotional warmth.
       Repeated use of these stimulants can have significant adverse consequences. Users can experience physical
       symptoms that include nausea, elevated blood pressure, and increased heart rate. In addition, these drugs can
       cause feelings of anxiety, hallucinations, and paranoia (Fiorentini et al., 2011). Normal brain functioning is
       altered after repeated use of these drugs. For example, repeated use can lead to overall depletion among the
       monoamine neurotransmitters (dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin). Depletion of certain
       neurotransmitters can lead to mood dysphoria, cognitive problems, and other factors. This can lead to people
       compulsively using stimulants such as cocaine and amphetamines, in part to try to reestablish the person's
       physical and psychological pre-use baseline. (Jayanthi & Ramamoorthy, 2005; Rothman, Blough, & Baumann,
       2007).
       Caffeine is another stimulant drug. While it is probably the most commonly used drug in the world, the
       potency of this particular drug pales in comparison to the other stimulant drugs described in this section.
       Generally, people use caffeine to maintain increased levels of alertness and arousal. Caffeine is found in many
       common medicines (such as weight loss drugs), beverages, foods, and even cosmetics (Herman & Herman,
       2013). While caffeine may have some indirect effects on dopamine neurotransmission, its primary
       mechanism of action involves antagonizing adenosine activity (Porkka-Heiskanen, 2011). Adenosine is a

neurotransmitter that promotes sleep. Caffeine is an adenosine antagonist, so caffeine inhibits the adenosine
receptors, thus decreasing sleepiness and promoting wakefulness.

While caffeine is generally considered a relatively safe drug, high blood levels of caffeine can result in
insomnia, agitation, muscle twitching, nausea, irregular heartbeat, and even death (Reissig, Strain, & Griffiths,
2009; Wolt, Ganetsky, & Babu, 2012). In 2012, Kromann and Nielson reported on a case study of a 40-year-old
woman who suffered significant ill effects from her use of caffeine. The woman used caffeine in the past to
boost her mood and to provide energy, but over the course of several years, she increased her caffeine
consumption to the point that she was consuming three liters of soda each day. Although she had been taking a
prescription antidepressant, her symptoms of depression continued to worsen and she began to suffer
physically, displaying significant warning signs of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Upon admission to an
outpatient clinic for treatment of mood disorders, she met all of the diagnostic criteria for substance
dependence and was advised to dramatically limit her caffeine intake. Once she was able to limit her use to
less than 12 ounces of soda a day, both her mental and physical health gradually improved. Despite the
prevalence of caffeine use and the large number of people who confess to suffering from caffeine addiction,
this was the first published description of soda dependence appearing in scientific literature.

Nicotine is highly addictive, and the use of tobacco products is associated with increased risks of heart disease,
stroke, and a variety of cancers. Nicotine exerts its effects through its interaction with acetylcholine receptors.
Acetylcholine functions as a neurotransmitter in motor neurons. In the central nervous system, it plays a role
in arousal and reward mechanisms. Nicotine is most commonly used in the form of tobacco products like
cigarettes or chewing tobacco; therefore, there is a tremendous interest in developing effective smoking
cessation techniques. To date, people have used a variety of nicotine replacement therapies in addition to
various psychotherapeutic options in an attempt to discontinue their use of tobacco products. In general,
smoking cessation programs may be effective in the short term, but it is unclear whether these effects persist
(Cropley, Theadom, Pravettoni, & Webb, 2008; Levitt, Shaw, Wong, & Kaczorowski, 2007; Smedslund, Fisher,
Boles, & Lichtenstein, 2004). Vaping as a means to deliver nicotine is becoming increasingly popular,
especially among teens and young adults. Vaping uses battery-powered devices, sometimes called e-cigarettes,
that deliver liquid nicotine and flavorings as a vapor. Originally reported as a safe alternative to the known
cancer-causing agents found in cigarettes, vaping is now known to be very dangerous and has led to serious
lung disease and death in users (Shmerling, 2019).

Opioids

An opioid is one of a category of drugs that includes heroin, morphine, methadone, and codeine. Opioids have
analgesic properties; that is, they decrease pain. Humans have an endogenous opioid neurotransmitter
system--the body makes small quantities of opioid compounds that bind to opioid receptors reducing pain and
producing euphoria. Thus, opioid drugs, which mimic this endogenous painkilling mechanism, have an
extremely high potential for abuse. Natural opioids, called opiates, are derivatives of opium, which is a
naturally occurring compound found in the poppy plant. There are now several synthetic versions of opiate
drugs (correctly called opioids) that have very potent painkilling effects, and they are often abused. For
example, the National Institutes of Drug Abuse has sponsored research that suggests the misuse and abuse of
the prescription pain killers hydrocodone and oxycodone are significant public health concerns (Maxwell,
2006). In 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommended tighter controls on their medical use.

Historically, heroin has been a major opioid drug of abuse (Figure 4.17). Heroin can be snorted, smoked, or
injected intravenously. Heroin produces intense feelings of euphoria and pleasure, which are amplified when
the heroin is injected intravenously. Following the initial "rush," users experience 4-6 hours of "going on the
nod," alternating between conscious and semiconscious states. Heroin users often shoot the drug directly into
their veins. Some people who have injected many times into their arms will show "track marks," while other
users will inject into areas between their fingers or between their toes, so as not to show obvious track marks
and, like all abusers of intravenous drugs, have an increased risk for contraction of both tuberculosis and HIV.

       (b) Heroin is cooked on a spoon over a candle. (credit a: modification of work by Todd Huffman)
       Aside from their utility as analgesic drugs, opioid-like compounds are often found in cough suppressants, anti-
       nausea, and anti-diarrhea medications. Given that withdrawal from a drug often involves an experience
       opposite to the effect of the drug, it should be no surprise that opioid withdrawal resembles a severe case of the
       flu. While opioid withdrawal can be extremely unpleasant, it is not life-threatening (Julien, 2005). Still, people
       experiencing opioid withdrawal may be given methadone to make withdrawal from the drug less difficult.
       Methadone is a synthetic opioid that is less euphorigenic than heroin and similar drugs. Methadone clinics
       help people who previously struggled with opioid addiction manage withdrawal symptoms through the use of
       methadone. Other drugs, including the opioid buprenorphine, have also been used to alleviate symptoms of
       opiate withdrawal.
       Codeine is an opioid with relatively low potency. It is often prescribed for minor pain, and it is available over-
       the-counter in some other countries. Like all opioids, codeine does have abuse potential. In fact, abuse of
       prescription opioid medications is becoming a major concern worldwide (Aquina, Marques-Baptista,
       Bridgeman, & Merlin, 2009; Casati, Sedefov, & Pfeiffer-Gerschel, 2012).

                                                                                             EVERYDAY CONNECTION

        The Opioid Crisis

         Few people in the United States remain untouched by the recent opioid epidemic. It seems like everyone knows
         a friend, family member, or neighbor who has died of an overdose. Opioid addiction reached crisis levels in the
         United States such that by 2019, an average of 130 people died each day of an opioid overdose (NIDA, 2019).
         The crisis actually began in the 1990s, when pharmaceutical companies began mass-marketing pain-relieving
         opioid drugs like OxyContin with the promise (now known to be false) that they were non-addictive. Increased
         prescriptions led to greater rates of misuse, along with greater incidence of addiction, even among patients who
         used these drugs as prescribed. Physiologically, the body can become addicted to opiate drugs in less than a
         week, including when taken as prescribed. Withdrawal from opioids includes pain, which patients often
         misinterpret as pain caused by the problem that led to the original prescription, and which motivates patients to
         continue using the drugs.
         The FDA's 2013 recommendation for tighter controls on opiate prescriptions left many patients addicted to
         prescription drugs like OxyContin unable to obtain legitimate prescriptions. This created a black market for the
         drug, where prices soared to $80 or more for a single pill. To prevent withdrawal, many people turned to cheaper
         heroin, which could be bought for $5 a dose or less. To keep heroin affordable, many dealers began adding more
         potent synthetic opioids including fentanyl and carfentanyl to increase the effects of heroin. These synthetic
         drugs are so potent that even small doses can cause overdose and death.
         Large-scale public health campaigns by the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of Drug Abuse
         have led to recent declines in the opioid crisis. These initiatives include increasing access to treatment and

  recovery services, increasing access to overdose-reversal drugs like Naloxone, and implementing better public
  health monitoring systems (NIDA, 2019).

Hallucinogens
A hallucinogen is one of a class of drugs that results in profound alterations in sensory and perceptual
experiences (Figure 4.18). In some cases, users experience vivid visual hallucinations. It is also common for
these types of drugs to cause hallucinations of body sensations (e.g., feeling as if you are a giant) and a skewed
perception of the passage of time.

FIGURE 4.18 Psychedelic images like this are often associated with hallucinogenic compounds. (credit:
modification of work by "new 1lluminati"/Flickr)
As a group, hallucinogens are incredibly varied in terms of the neurotransmitter systems they affect.
Mescaline and LSD are serotonin agonists, and PCP (angel dust) and ketamine (an animal anesthetic) act as
antagonists of the NMDA glutamate receptor. In general, these drugs are not thought to possess the same sort
of abuse potential as other classes of drugs discussed in this section.

 Medical Marijuana

  The decade from 2010-2019 brought many changes in laws regarding marijuana. While the possession and use
  of marijuana remains illegal in many states, it is now legal to possess limited quantities of marijuana for
  recreational use in eleven states: Alaska, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada,
  Oregon, Vermont, and Washington. Medical marijuana is legal in over half of the United States and in the District
  of Columbia (Figure 4.19). Medical marijuana is marijuana that is prescribed by a doctor for the treatment of a
  health condition. For example, people who undergo chemotherapy will often be prescribed marijuana to
  stimulate their appetites and prevent excessive weight loss resulting from the side effects of chemotherapy
  treatment. Marijuana may also have some promise in the treatment of a variety of medical conditions (Mather,

         While medical marijuana laws have been passed on a state-by-state basis, federal laws still classify this as an
         illicit substance, making conducting research on the potentially beneficial medicinal uses of marijuana
         problematic. There is quite a bit of controversy within the scientific community as to the extent to which
         marijuana might have medicinal benefits due to a lack of large-scale, controlled research (Bostwick, 2012). As a
         result, many scientists have urged the federal government to allow for relaxation of current marijuana laws and
         classifications in order to facilitate a more widespread study of the drug's effects (Aggarwal et al., 2009;
         Bostwick, 2012; Kogan & Mechoulam, 2007).
         Until recently, the United States Department of Justice routinely arrested people involved and seized marijuana
         used in medicinal settings. In the latter part of 2013, however, the United States Department of Justice issued
         statements indicating that they would not continue to challenge state medical marijuana laws. This shift in policy
         may be in response to the scientific community's recommendations and/or reflect changing public opinion
         regarding marijuana.

       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Define hypnosis and meditation
         · Understand the similarities and differences of hypnosis and meditation
       Our states of consciousness change as we move from wakefulness to sleep. We also alter our consciousness
       through the use of various psychoactive drugs. This final section will consider hypnotic and meditative states
       as additional examples of altered states of consciousness experienced by some individuals.

      Hypnosis

       Hypnosis is a state of extreme self-focus and attention in which minimal attention is given to external stimuli.
       In the therapeutic setting, a clinician may use relaxation and suggestion in an attempt to alter the thoughts
       and perceptions of a patient. Hypnosis has also been used to draw out information believed to be buried deeply
       in someone's memory. For individuals who are especially open to the power of suggestion, hypnosis can prove
       to be a very effective technique, and brain imaging studies have demonstrated that hypnotic states are
       associated with global changes in brain functioning (Del Casale et al., 2012; Guldenmund, Vanhaudenhuyse,
       Boly, Laureys, & Soddu, 2012).
       Historically, hypnosis has been viewed with some suspicion because of its portrayal in popular media and
       entertainment (Figure 4.20). Therefore, it is important to make a distinction between hypnosis as an
       empirically based therapeutic approach versus as a form of entertainment. Contrary to popular belief,
       individuals undergoing hypnosis usually have clear memories of the hypnotic experience and are in control of
       their own behaviors. While hypnosis may be useful in enhancing memory or a skill, such enhancements are
       very modest in nature (Raz, 2011).

                FIGURE 4.20 Popular portrayals of hypnosis have led to some widely-held misconceptions.
How exactly does a hypnotist bring a participant to a state of hypnosis? While there are variations, there are
four parts that appear consistent in bringing people into the state of suggestibility associated with hypnosis
(National Research Council, 1994). These components include:

  · The participant is guided to focus on one thing, such as the hypnotist's words or a ticking watch.
  · The participant is made comfortable and is directed to be relaxed and sleepy.
  · The participant is told to be open to the process of hypnosis, trust the hypnotist and let go.
  · The participant is encouraged to use their imagination.
These steps are conducive to being open to the heightened suggestibility of hypnosis.
People vary in terms of their ability to be hypnotized, but a review of available research suggests that most
people are at least moderately hypnotizable (Kihlstrom, 2013). Hypnosis in conjunction with other techniques
is used for a variety of therapeutic purposes and has shown to be at least somewhat effective for pain
management, treatment of depression and anxiety, smoking cessation, and weight loss (Alladin, 2012; Elkins,
Johnson, & Fisher, 2012; Golden, 2012; Montgomery, Schnur, & Kravits, 2012).
How does hypnosis work? Two theories attempt to answer this question: One theory views hypnosis as
dissociation and the other theory views it as the performance of a social role. According to the dissociation
view, hypnosis is effectively a dissociated state of consciousness, much like our earlier example where you may
drive to work, but you are only minimally aware of the process of driving because your attention is focused
elsewhere. This theory is supported by Ernest Hilgard's research into hypnosis and pain. In Hilgard's
experiments, he induced participants into a state of hypnosis, and placed their arms into ice water.
Participants were told they would not feel pain, but they could press a button if they did; while they reported
not feeling pain, they did, in fact, press the button, suggesting a dissociation of consciousness while in the
hypnotic state (Hilgard & Hilgard, 1994).
Taking a different approach to explain hypnosis, the social-cognitive theory of hypnosis sees people in
hypnotic states as performing the social role of a hypnotized person. As you will learn when you study social
roles, people's behavior can be shaped by their expectations of how they should act in a given situation. Some
view a hypnotized person's behavior not as an altered or dissociated state of consciousness, but as their
fulfillment of the social expectations for that role (Coe, 2009; Coe & Sarbin, 1966).

      Meditation

       Meditation is the act of focusing on a single target (such as the breath or a repeated sound) to increase
       awareness of the moment. While hypnosis is generally achieved through the interaction of a therapist and the
       person being treated, an individual can perform meditation alone. Often, however, people wishing to learn to
       meditate receive some training in techniques to achieve a meditative state.
       Although there are a number of different techniques in use, the central feature of all meditation is clearing the
       mind in order to achieve a state of relaxed awareness and focus (Chen et al., 2013; Lang et al., 2012).
       Mindfulness meditation has recently become popular. In the variation of mindful meditation, the meditator's
       attention is focused on some internal process or an external object (Zeidan, Grant, Brown, McHaffie, & Coghill,
       2012).
       Meditative techniques have their roots in religious practices (Figure 4.21), but their use has grown in
       popularity among practitioners of alternative medicine. Research indicates that meditation may help reduce
       blood pressure, and the American Heart Association suggests that meditation might be used in conjunction
       with more traditional treatments as a way to manage hypertension, although there is not sufficient data for a
       recommendation to be made (Brook et al., 2013). Like hypnosis, meditation also shows promise in stress
       management, sleep quality (Caldwell, Harrison, Adams, Quin, & Greeson, 2010), treatment of mood and
       anxiety disorders (Chen et al., 2013; Freeman et al., 2010; Vøllestad, Nielsen, & Nielsen, 2012), and pain
       management (Reiner, Tibi, & Lipsitz, 2013).

Summary

4.1 What Is Consciousness?

States of consciousness vary over the course of the day and throughout our lives. Important factors in these
changes are the biological rhythms, and, more specifically, the circadian rhythms generated by the
suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Typically, our biological clocks are aligned with our external environment,
and light tends to be an important cue in setting this clock. When people travel across multiple time zones or
work rotating shifts, they can experience disruptions of their circadian cycles that can lead to insomnia,
sleepiness, and decreased alertness. Bright light therapy has shown to be promising in dealing with circadian
disruptions. If people go extended periods of time without sleep, they will accrue a sleep debt and potentially
experience a number of adverse psychological and physiological consequences.

4.2 Sleep and Why We Sleep

We devote a very large portion of time to sleep, and our brains have complex systems that control various
aspects of sleep. Several hormones important for physical growth and maturation are secreted during sleep.
While the reason we sleep remains something of a mystery, there is some evidence to suggest that sleep is very
important to learning and memory.

4.3 Stages of Sleep

The different stages of sleep are characterized by the patterns of brain waves associated with each stage. As a
person transitions from being awake to falling asleep, alpha waves are replaced by theta waves. Sleep spindles
and K-complexes emerge in stage 2 sleep. Stage 3 and stage 4 are described as slow-wave sleep that is marked
by a predominance of delta waves. REM sleep involves rapid movements of the eyes, paralysis of voluntary
muscles, and dreaming. Both NREM and REM sleep appear to play important roles in learning and memory.
Dreams may represent life events that are important to the dreamer. Alternatively, dreaming may represent a
state of protoconsciousness, or a virtual reality, in the mind that helps a person during consciousness.

4.4 Sleep Problems and Disorders

Many individuals suffer from some type of sleep disorder or disturbance at some point in their lives. Insomnia
is a common experience in which people have difficulty falling or staying asleep. Parasomnias involve
unwanted motor behavior or experiences throughout the sleep cycle and include RBD, sleepwalking, restless
leg syndrome, and night terrors. Sleep apnea occurs when individuals stop breathing during their sleep, and in
the case of sudden infant death syndrome, infants will stop breathing during sleep and die. Narcolepsy
involves an irresistible urge to fall asleep during waking hours and is often associated with cataplexy and
hallucination.

4.5 Substance Use and Abuse

Substance use disorder is defined in DSM-5 as a compulsive pattern of drug use despite negative
consequences. Both physical and psychological dependence are important parts of this disorder. Alcohol,
barbiturates, and benzodiazepines are central nervous system depressants that affect GABA
neurotransmission. Cocaine, amphetamine, cathinones, and MDMA are all central nervous stimulants that
agonize dopamine neurotransmission, while nicotine and caffeine affect acetylcholine and adenosine,
respectively. Opiate drugs serve as powerful analgesics through their effects on the endogenous opioid
neurotransmitter system, and hallucinogenic drugs cause pronounced changes in sensory and perceptual
experiences. The hallucinogens are variable with regards to the specific neurotransmitter systems they affect.

4.6 Other States of Consciousness

Hypnosis is a focus on the self that involves suggested changes of behavior and experience. Meditation
involves relaxed, yet focused, awareness. Both hypnotic and meditative states may involve altered states of
consciousness that have potential application for the treatment of a variety of physical and psychological

5.6 Gestalt Principles of Perception

INTRODUCTION Imagine standing on a city street corner. You might be struck by movement everywhere as
cars and people go about their business, by the sound of a street musician's melody or a horn honking in the
distance, by the smell of exhaust fumes or of food being sold by a nearby vendor, and by the sensation of hard
pavement under your feet.

We rely on our sensory systems to provide important information about our surroundings. We use this
information to successfully navigate and interact with our environment so that we can find nourishment, seek
shelter, maintain social relationships, and avoid potentially dangerous situations.

This chapter will provide an overview of how sensory information is received and processed by the nervous
system and how that affects our conscious experience of the world. We begin by learning the distinction
between sensation and perception. Then we consider the physical properties of light and sound stimuli, along
with an overview of the basic structure and function of the major sensory systems. The chapter will close with
a discussion of a historically important theory of perception called Gestalt.

     5.1 Sensation versus Perception

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Distinguish between sensation and perception
         · Describe the concepts of absolute threshold and difference threshold
         · Discuss the roles attention, motivation, and sensory adaptation play in perception

      Sensation

       What does it mean to sense something? Sensory receptors are specialized neurons that respond to specific
       types of stimuli. When sensory information is detected by a sensory receptor, sensation has occurred. For
       example, light that enters the eye causes chemical changes in cells that line the back of the eye. These cells
       relay messages, in the form of action potentials (as you learned when studying biopsychology), to the central
       nervous system. The conversion from sensory stimulus energy to action potential is known as transduction.

       You have probably known since elementary school that we have five senses: vision, hearing (audition), smell
       (olfaction), taste (gustation), and touch (somatosensation). It turns out that this notion of five senses is
       oversimplified. We also have sensory systems that provide information about balance (the vestibular sense),
       body position and movement (proprioception and kinesthesia), pain (nociception), and temperature
       (thermoception).

       The sensitivity of a given sensory system to the relevant stimuli can be expressed as an absolute threshold.
       Absolute threshold refers to the minimum amount of stimulus energy that must be present for the stimulus to
       be detected 50% of the time. Another way to think about this is by asking how dim can a light be or how soft
       can a sound be and still be detected half of the time. The sensitivity of our sensory receptors can be quite
       amazing. It has been estimated that on a clear night, the most sensitive sensory cells in the back of the eye can
       detect a candle flame 30 miles away (Okawa & Sampath, 2007). Under quiet conditions, the hair cells (the
       receptor cells of the inner ear) can detect the tick of a clock 20 feet away (Galanter, 1962).

       It is also possible for us to get messages that are presented below the threshold for conscious awareness--these
       are called subliminal messages. A stimulus reaches a physiological threshold when it is strong enough to
       excite sensory receptors and send nerve impulses to the brain: This is an absolute threshold. A message below
       that threshold is said to be subliminal: We receive it, but we are not consciously aware of it. Over the years
       there has been a great deal of speculation about the use of subliminal messages in advertising, rock music, and
       self-help audio programs. Research evidence shows that in laboratory settings, people can process and
       respond to information outside of awareness. But this does not mean that we obey these messages like
       zombies; in fact, hidden messages have little effect on behavior outside the laboratory (Kunst-Wilson & Zajonc,
       1980; Rensink, 2004; Nelson, 2008; Radel, Sarrazin, Legrain, & Gobancé, 2009; Loersch, Durso, & Petty, 2013).

       Absolute thresholds are generally measured under incredibly controlled conditions in situations that are
       optimal for sensitivity. Sometimes, we are more interested in how much difference in stimuli is required to
       detect a difference between them. This is known as the just noticeable difference ( jnd) or difference
       threshold. Unlike the absolute threshold, the difference threshold changes depending on the stimulus
       intensity. As an example, imagine yourself in a very dark movie theater. If an audience member were to receive
       a text message that caused the cell phone screen to light up, chances are that many people would notice the
       change in illumination in the theater. However, if the same thing happened in a brightly lit arena during a
       basketball game, very few people would notice. The cell phone brightness does not change, but its ability to be
       detected as a change in illumination varies dramatically between the two contexts. Ernst Weber proposed this
       theory of change in difference threshold in the 1830s, and it has become known as Weber's law: The difference
       threshold is a constant fraction of the original stimulus, as the example illustrates.

Perception

While our sensory receptors are constantly collecting information from the environment, it is ultimately how
we interpret that information that affects how we interact with the world. Perception refers to the way sensory
information is organized, interpreted, and consciously experienced. Perception involves both bottom-up and
top-down processing. Bottom-up processing refers to sensory information from a stimulus in the
environment driving a process, and top-down processing refers to knowledge and expectancy driving a
process, as shown in Figure 5.2 (Egeth & Yantis, 1997; Fine & Minnery, 2009; Yantis & Egeth, 1999).

                          FIGURE 5.2 Top-down and bottom-up are ways we process our perceptions.
Imagine that you and some friends are sitting in a crowded restaurant eating lunch and talking. It is very noisy,
and you are concentrating on your friend's face to hear what they are saying, then the sound of breaking glass
and clang of metal pans hitting the floor rings out. The server dropped a large tray of food. Although you were
attending to your meal and conversation, that crashing sound would likely get through your attentional filters
and capture your attention. You would have no choice but to notice it. That attentional capture would be caused
by the sound from the environment: it would be bottom-up.
Alternatively, top-down processes are generally goal directed, slow, deliberate, effortful, and under your
control (Fine & Minnery, 2009; Miller & Cohen, 2001; Miller & D'Esposito, 2005). For instance, if you misplaced
your keys, how would you look for them? If you had a yellow key fob, you would probably look for yellowness of
a certain size in specific locations, such as on the counter, coffee table, and other similar places. You would not
look for yellowness on your ceiling fan, because you know keys are not normally lying on top of a ceiling fan.
That act of searching for a certain size of yellowness in some locations and not others would be top-
down--under your control and based on your experience.
One way to think of this concept is that sensation is a physical process, whereas perception is psychological.
For example, upon walking into a kitchen and smelling the scent of baking cinnamon rolls, the sensation is the
scent receptors detecting the odor of cinnamon, but the perception may be "Mmm, this smells like the bread
Grandma used to bake when the family gathered for holidays."
Although our perceptions are built from sensations, not all sensations result in perception. In fact, we often
don't perceive stimuli that remain relatively constant over prolonged periods of time. This is known as
sensory adaptation. Imagine going to a city that you have never visited. You check in to the hotel, but when
you get to your room, there is a road construction sign with a bright flashing light outside your window.
Unfortunately, there are no other rooms available, so you are stuck with a flashing light. You decide to watch
television to unwind. The flashing light was extremely annoying when you first entered your room. It was as if
someone was continually turning a bright yellow spotlight on and off in your room, but after watching
television for a short while, you no longer notice the light flashing. The light is still flashing and filling your
room with yellow light every few seconds, and the photoreceptors in your eyes still sense the light, but you no
longer perceive the rapid changes in lighting conditions. That you no longer perceive the flashing light
demonstrates sensory adaptation and shows that while closely associated, sensation and perception are
different.
148 5 · Sensation and Perception

       There is another factor that affects sensation and perception: attention. Attention plays a significant role in
       determining what is sensed versus what is perceived. Imagine you are at a party full of music, chatter, and
       laughter. You get involved in an interesting conversation with a friend, and you tune out all the background
       noise. If someone interrupted you to ask what song had just finished playing, you would probably be unable to
       answer that question.

           LINK TO LEARNING

       See for yourself how inattentional blindness works by checking out this selective attention test
       (http://openstax.org/l/blindness) from Simons and Chabris (1999).

       One of the most interesting demonstrations of how important attention is in determining our perception of the
       environment occurred in a famous study conducted by Daniel Simons and Christopher Chabris (1999). In this
       study, participants watched a video of people dressed in black and white passing basketballs. Participants
       were asked to count the number of times the team dressed in white passed the ball. During the video, a person
       dressed in a black gorilla costume walks among the two teams. You would think that someone would notice the
       gorilla, right? Nearly half of the people who watched the video didn't notice the gorilla at all, despite the fact
       that he was clearly visible for nine seconds. Because participants were so focused on the number of times the
       team dressed in white was passing the ball, they completely tuned out other visual information. Inattentional
       blindness is the failure to notice something that is completely visible because the person was actively
       attending to something else and did not pay attention to other things (Mack & Rock, 1998; Simons & Chabris,
       1999).
       In a similar experiment, researchers tested inattentional blindness by asking participants to observe images
       moving across a computer screen. They were instructed to focus on either white or black objects, disregarding
       the other color. When a red cross passed across the screen, about one third of subjects did not notice it (Figure
       5.3) (Most, Simons, Scholl, & Chabris, 2000).

       FIGURE 5.3 Nearly one third of participants in a study did not notice that a red cross passed on the screen because
       their attention was focused on the black or white figures. (credit: Cory Zanker)
       Motivation can also affect perception. Have you ever been expecting a really important phone call and, while
       taking a shower, you think you hear the phone ringing, only to discover that it is not? If so, then you have
       experienced how motivation to detect a meaningful stimulus can shift our ability to discriminate between a
       true sensory stimulus and background noise. The ability to identify a stimulus when it is embedded in a
       distracting background is called signal detection theory. This might also explain why a mother is awakened
       by a quiet murmur from her baby but not by other sounds that occur while she is asleep. Signal detection
       theory has practical applications, such as increasing air traffic controller accuracy. Controllers need to be able
       to detect planes among many signals (blips) that appear on the radar screen and follow those planes as they
       move through the sky. In fact, the original work of the researcher who developed signal detection theory was
       focused on improving the sensitivity of air traffic controllers to plane blips (Swets, 1964).

Our perceptions can also be affected by our beliefs, values, prejudices, expectations, and life experiences. As
you will see later in this chapter, individuals who are deprived of the experience of binocular vision during
critical periods of development have trouble perceiving depth (Fawcett, Wang, & Birch, 2005). The shared
experiences of people within a given cultural context can have pronounced effects on perception. For example,
Marshall Segall, Donald Campbell, and Melville Herskovits (1963) published the results of a multinational
study in which they demonstrated that individuals from Western cultures were more prone to experience
certain types of visual illusions than individuals from non-Western cultures, and vice versa. One such illusion
that Westerners were more likely to experience was the Müller-Lyer illusion (Figure 5.4): The lines appear to be
different lengths, but they are actually the same length.

FIGURE 5.4 In the Müller-Lyer illusion, lines appear to be different lengths although they are identical. (a) Arrows at
the ends of lines may make the line on the right appear longer, although the lines are the same length. (b) When
applied to a three-dimensional image, the line on the right again may appear longer although both black lines are
the same length.
These perceptual differences were consistent with differences in the types of environmental features
experienced on a regular basis by people in a given cultural context. People in Western cultures, for example,
have a perceptual context of buildings with straight lines, what Segall's study called a carpentered world (Segall
et al., 1966). In contrast, people from certain non-Western cultures with an uncarpentered view, such as the
Zulu of South Africa, whose villages are made up of round huts arranged in circles, are less susceptible to this
illusion (Segall et al., 1999). It is not just vision that is affected by cultural factors. Indeed, research has
demonstrated that the ability to identify an odor, and rate its pleasantness and its intensity, varies cross-
culturally (Ayabe-Kanamura, Saito, Distel, Martínez-Gómez, & Hudson, 1998).
Children described as thrill seekers are more likely to show taste preferences for intense sour flavors (Liem,
Westerbeek, Wolterink, Kok, & de Graaf, 2004), which suggests that basic aspects of personality might affect
perception. Furthermore, individuals who hold positive attitudes toward reduced-fat foods are more likely to
rate foods labeled as reduced fat as tasting better than people who have less positive attitudes about these
products (Aaron, Mela, & Evans, 1994).

5.2 Waves and Wavelengths

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Describe important physical features of wave forms
  · Show how physical properties of light waves are associated with perceptual experience
  · Show how physical properties of sound waves are associated with perceptual experience
Visual and auditory stimuli both occur in the form of waves. Although the two stimuli are very different in
terms of composition, wave forms share similar characteristics that are especially important to our visual and
150 5 · Sensation and Perception

       auditory perceptions. In this section, we describe the physical properties of the waves as well as the perceptual
       experiences associated with them.

      Amplitude and Wavelength

       Two physical characteristics of a wave are amplitude and wavelength (Figure 5.5). The amplitude of a wave is
       the distance from the center line to the top point of the crest or the bottom point of the trough. Wavelength
       refers to the length of a wave from one peak to the next.

       FIGURE 5.5 The amplitude or height of a wave is measured from the peak to the trough. The wavelength is
       measured from peak to peak.
       Wavelength is directly related to the frequency of a given wave form. Frequency refers to the number of waves
       that pass a given point in a given time period and is often expressed in terms of hertz (Hz), or cycles per
       second. Longer wavelengths will have lower frequencies, and shorter wavelengths will have higher frequencies
       (Figure 5.6).

       FIGURE 5.6 This figure illustrates waves of differing wavelengths/frequencies. At the top of the figure, the red wave
       has a long wavelength/short frequency. Moving from top to bottom, the wavelengths decrease and frequencies
       increase.

      Light Waves

       The visible spectrum is the portion of the larger electromagnetic spectrum that we can see. As Figure 5.7
       shows, the electromagnetic spectrum encompasses all of the electromagnetic radiation that occurs in our
       environment and includes gamma rays, x-rays, ultraviolet light, visible light, infrared light, microwaves, and
       radio waves. The visible spectrum in humans is associated with wavelengths that range from 380 to 740 nm--a
       very small distance, since a nanometer (nm) is one billionth of a meter. Other species can detect other portions
       of the electromagnetic spectrum. For instance, honeybees can see light in the ultraviolet range (Wakakuwa,
       Stavenga, & Arikawa, 2007), and some snakes can detect infrared radiation in addition to more traditional
       visual light cues (Chen, Deng, Brauth, Ding, & Tang, 2012; Hartline, Kass, & Loop, 1978).

      FIGURE 5.7 Light that is visible to humans makes up only a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.
In humans, light wavelength is associated with perception of color (Figure 5.8). Within the visible spectrum,
our experience of red is associated with longer wavelengths, greens are intermediate, and blues and violets are
shorter in wavelength. (An easy way to remember this is the mnemonic ROYGBIV: red, orange, yellow, green,
blue, indigo, violet.) The amplitude of light waves is associated with our experience of brightness or intensity of
color, with larger amplitudes appearing brighter.

FIGURE 5.8 Different wavelengths of light are associated with our perception of different colors. (credit:

Sound Waves

Like light waves, the physical properties of sound waves are associated with various aspects of our perception
of sound. The frequency of a sound wave is associated with our perception of that sound's pitch. High-
frequency sound waves are perceived as high-pitched sounds, while low-frequency sound waves are perceived
as low-pitched sounds. The audible range of sound frequencies is between 20 and 20000 Hz, with greatest
sensitivity to those frequencies that fall in the middle of this range.
As was the case with the visible spectrum, other species show differences in their audible ranges. For instance,
chickens have a very limited audible range, from 125 to 2000 Hz. Mice have an audible range from 1000 to
91000 Hz, and the beluga whale's audible range is from 1000 to 123000 Hz. Our pet dogs and cats have audible
ranges of about 70-45000 Hz and 45-64000 Hz, respectively (Strain, 2003).
The loudness of a given sound is closely associated with the amplitude of the sound wave. Higher amplitudes
are associated with louder sounds. Loudness is measured in terms of decibels (dB), a logarithmic unit of
sound intensity. A typical conversation would correlate with 60 dB; a rock concert might check in at 120 dB
(Figure 5.9). A whisper 5 feet away or rustling leaves are at the low end of our hearing range; sounds like a
window air conditioner, a normal conversation, and even heavy traffic or a vacuum cleaner are within a
tolerable range. However, there is the potential for hearing damage from about 80 dB to 130 dB: These are
sounds of a food processor, power lawnmower, heavy truck (25 feet away), subway train (20 feet away), live
152 5 · Sensation and Perception

       rock music, and a jackhammer. About one-third of all hearing loss is due to noise exposure, and the louder the
       sound, the shorter the exposure needed to cause hearing damage (Le, Straatman, Lea, & Westerberg, 2017).
       Listening to music through earbuds at maximum volume (around 100-105 decibels) can cause noise-induced
       hearing loss after 15 minutes of exposure. Although listening to music at maximum volume may not seem to
       cause damage, it increases the risk of age-related hearing loss (Kujawa & Liberman, 2006). The threshold for
       pain is about 130 dB, a jet plane taking off or a revolver firing at close range (Dunkle, 1982).

       FIGURE 5.9 This figure illustrates the loudness of common sounds. (credit "planes": modification of work by Max

       Although wave amplitude is generally associated with loudness, there is some interaction between frequency
       and amplitude in our perception of loudness within the audible range. For example, a 10 Hz sound wave is
       inaudible no matter the amplitude of the wave. A 1000 Hz sound wave, on the other hand, would vary
       dramatically in terms of perceived loudness as the amplitude of the wave increased.

Of course, different musical instruments can play the same musical note at the same level of loudness, yet they
still sound quite different. This is known as the timbre of a sound. Timbre refers to a sound's purity, and it is
affected by the complex interplay of frequency, amplitude, and timing of sound waves.

5.3 Vision

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Describe the basic anatomy of the visual system
  · Discuss how rods and cones contribute to different aspects of vision
  · Describe how monocular and binocular cues are used in the perception of depth
The visual system constructs a mental representation of the world around us (Figure 5.10). This contributes to
our ability to successfully navigate through physical space and interact with important individuals and objects
in our environments. This section will provide an overview of the basic anatomy and function of the visual
system. In addition, we will explore our ability to perceive color and depth.

Anatomy of the Visual System

The eye is the major sensory organ involved in vision (Figure 5.11). Light waves are transmitted across the
cornea and enter the eye through the pupil. The cornea is the transparent covering over the eye. It serves as a
barrier between the inner eye and the outside world, and it is involved in focusing light waves that enter the
eye. The pupil is the small opening in the eye through which light passes, and the size of the pupil can change
as a function of light levels as well as emotional arousal. When light levels are low, the pupil will become
dilated, or expanded, to allow more light to enter the eye. When light levels are high, the pupil will constrict, or
become smaller, to reduce the amount of light that enters the eye. The pupil's size is controlled by muscles that
are connected to the iris, which is the colored portion of the eye.
154 5 · Sensation and Perception

                                         FIGURE 5.11 The anatomy of the eye is illustrated in this diagram.
       After passing through the pupil, light crosses the lens, a curved, transparent structure that serves to provide
       additional focus. The lens is attached to muscles that can change its shape to aid in focusing light that is
       reflected from near or far objects. In a normal-sighted individual, the lens will focus images perfectly on a
       small indentation in the back of the eye known as the fovea, which is part of the retina, the light-sensitive
       lining of the eye. The fovea contains densely packed specialized photoreceptor cells (Figure 5.12). These
       photoreceptor cells, known as cones, are light-detecting cells. The cones are specialized types of
       photoreceptors that work best in bright light conditions. Cones are very sensitive to acute detail and provide
       tremendous spatial resolution. They also are directly involved in our ability to perceive color.
       While cones are concentrated in the fovea, where images tend to be focused, rods, another type of
       photoreceptor, are located throughout the remainder of the retina. Rods are specialized photoreceptors that
       work well in low light conditions, and while they lack the spatial resolution and color function of the cones,
       they are involved in our vision in dimly lit environments as well as in our perception of movement on the
       periphery of our visual field.

FIGURE 5.12 The two types of photoreceptors are shown in this image. Cones are colored green and rods are blue.
We have all experienced the different sensitivities of rods and cones when making the transition from a
brightly lit environment to a dimly lit environment. Imagine going to see a blockbuster movie on a clear
summer day. As you walk from the brightly lit lobby into the dark theater, you notice that you immediately have
difficulty seeing much of anything. After a few minutes, you begin to adjust to the darkness and can see the
interior of the theater. In the bright environment, your vision was dominated primarily by cone activity. As you
move to the dark environment, rod activity dominates, but there is a delay in transitioning between the phases.
If your rods do not transform light into nerve impulses as easily and efficiently as they should, you will have
difficulty seeing in dim light, a condition known as night blindness.
Rods and cones are connected (via several interneurons) to retinal ganglion cells. Axons from the retinal
ganglion cells converge and exit through the back of the eye to form the optic nerve. The optic nerve carries
visual information from the retina to the brain. There is a point in the visual field called the blind spot: Even
when light from a small object is focused on the blind spot, we do not see it. We are not consciously aware of
our blind spots for two reasons: First, each eye gets a slightly different view of the visual field; therefore, the
blind spots do not overlap. Second, our visual system fills in the blind spot so that although we cannot respond
to visual information that occurs in that portion of the visual field, we are also not aware that information is
missing.
The optic nerve from each eye merges just below the brain at a point called the optic chiasm. As Figure 5.13
shows, the optic chiasm is an X-shaped structure that sits just below the cerebral cortex at the front of the
brain. At the point of the optic chiasm, information from the right visual field (which comes from both eyes) is
sent to the left side of the brain, and information from the left visual field is sent to the right side of the brain.

       FIGURE 5.13 This illustration shows the optic chiasm at the front of the brain and the pathways to the occipital lobe
       at the back of the brain, where visual sensations are processed into meaningful perceptions.
       Once inside the brain, visual information is sent via a number of structures to the occipital lobe at the back of
       the brain for processing. Visual information might be processed in parallel pathways which can generally be
       described as the "what pathway" and the "where/how" pathway. The "what pathway" is involved in object
       recognition and identification, while the "where/how pathway" is involved with location in space and how one
       might interact with a particular visual stimulus (Milner & Goodale, 2008; Ungerleider & Haxby, 1994). For
       example, when you see a ball rolling down the street, the "what pathway" identifies what the object is, and the
       "where/how pathway" identifies its location or movement in space.

                                                                                                  WHAT DO YOU THINK?
        The Ethics of Research Using Animals

         David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel were awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1981 for their research on the
         visual system. They collaborated for more than twenty years and made significant discoveries about the
         neurology of visual perception (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959, 1962, 1963, 1970; Wiesel & Hubel, 1963). They studied
         animals, mostly cats and monkeys. Although they used several techniques, they did considerable single unit
         recordings, during which tiny electrodes were inserted in the animal's brain to determine when a single cell was
         activated. Among their many discoveries, they found that specific brain cells respond to lines with specific
         orientations (called ocular dominance), and they mapped the way those cells are arranged in areas of the visual
         cortex known as columns and hypercolumns.
         In some of their research, they sutured one eye of newborn kittens closed and followed the development of the
         kittens' vision. They discovered there was a critical period of development for vision. If kittens were deprived of
         input from one eye, other areas of their visual cortex filled in the area that was normally used by the eye that was
         sewn closed. In other words, neural connections that exist at birth can be lost if they are deprived of sensory
         input.
         What do you think about sewing a kitten's eye closed for research? To many animal advocates, this would seem
         brutal, abusive, and unethical. What if you could do research that would help ensure babies and children born
         with certain conditions could develop full vision instead of becoming blind? Would you want that research done?
         Would you conduct that research, even if it meant causing some harm to cats? Would you think the same way if

  Like virtually every other industrialized nation, the United States permits medical experimentation on animals,
  with few limitations (assuming sufficient scientific justification). The goal of any laws that exist is not to ban such
  tests but rather to limit unnecessary animal suffering by establishing standards for the humane treatment and
  housing of animals in laboratories.

  As explained by Stephen Latham, the director of the Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics at Yale (2012),
  possible legal and regulatory approaches to animal testing vary on a continuum from strong government
  regulation and monitoring of all experimentation at one end, to a self-regulated approach that depends on the
  ethics of the researchers at the other end. The United Kingdom has the most significant regulatory scheme,
  whereas Japan uses the self-regulation approach. The U.S. approach is somewhere in the middle, the result of a
  gradual blending of the two approaches.

  There is no question that medical research is a valuable and important practice. The question is whether the use
  of animals is a necessary or even best practice for producing the most reliable results. Alternatives include the
  use of patient-drug databases, virtual drug trials, computer models and simulations, and noninvasive imaging
  techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scans ("Animals in Science/
  Alternatives," n.d.). Other techniques, such as microdosing, use humans not as test animals but as a means to
  improve the accuracy and reliability of test results. In vitro methods based on human cell and tissue cultures,
  stem cells, and genetic testing methods are also increasingly available.

  Today, at the local level, any facility that uses animals and receives federal funding must have an Institutional
  Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) that ensures that the NIH guidelines are being followed. The IACUC
  must include researchers, administrators, a veterinarian, and at least one person with no ties to the institution:
  that is, a concerned citizen. This committee also performs inspections of laboratories and protocols.

Color and Depth Perception

We do not see the world in black and white; neither do we see it as two-dimensional (2-D) or flat (just height
and width, no depth). Let's look at how color vision works and how we perceive three dimensions (height,
width, and depth).

Color Vision

Normal-sighted individuals have three different types of cones that mediate color vision. Each of these cone
types is maximally sensitive to a slightly different wavelength of light. According to the trichromatic theory of
color vision, shown in Figure 5.14, all colors in the spectrum can be produced by combining red, green, and
blue. The three types of cones are each receptive to one of the colors.

      Colorblindness: A Personal Story

       Several years ago, I dressed to go to a public function and walked into the kitchen where my 7-year-old daughter
       sat. She looked up at me, and in her most stern voice, said, "You can't wear that." I asked, "Why not?" and she
       informed me the colors of my clothes did not match. She had complained frequently that I was bad at matching my
       shirts, pants, and ties, but this time, she sounded especially alarmed. As a single father with no one else to ask at
       home, I drove us to the nearest convenience store and asked the store clerk if my clothes matched. She said my
       pants were a bright green color, my shirt was a reddish orange, and my tie was brown. She looked at my quizzically
       and said, "No way do your clothes match." Over the next few days, I started asking my coworkers and friends if my
       clothes matched. After several days of being told that my coworkers just thought I had "a really unique style," I
       made an appointment with an eye doctor and was tested (Figure 5.15). It was then that I found out that I was
       colorblind. I cannot differentiate between most greens, browns, and reds. Fortunately, other than unknowingly
       being badly dressed, my colorblindness rarely harms my day-to-day life.

       FIGURE 5.15 The Ishihara test evaluates color perception by assessing whether individuals can discern numbers
       that appear in a circle of dots of varying colors and sizes.
       Some forms of color deficiency are rare. Seeing in grayscale (only shades of black and white) is extremely rare, and
       people who do so only have rods, which means they have very low visual acuity and cannot see very well. The most
       common X-linked inherited abnormality is red-green color blindness (Birch, 2012). Approximately 8% of males with
       European Caucasian decent, 5% of Asian males, 4% of African males, and less than 2% of indigenous American
       males, Australian males, and Polynesian males have red-green color deficiency (Birch, 2012). Comparatively, only

about 0.4% in females from European Caucasian descent have red-green color deficiency (Birch, 2012).

The trichromatic theory of color vision is not the only theory--another major theory of color vision is known as
the opponent-process theory. According to this theory, color is coded in opponent pairs: black-white, yellow-
blue, and green-red. The basic idea is that some cells of the visual system are excited by one of the opponent
colors and inhibited by the other. So, a cell that was excited by wavelengths associated with green would be
inhibited by wavelengths associated with red, and vice versa. One of the implications of opponent processing is
that we do not experience greenish-reds or yellowish-blues as colors. Another implication is that this leads to
the experience of negative afterimages. An afterimage describes the continuation of a visual sensation after
removal of the stimulus. For example, when you stare briefly at the sun and then look away from it, you may
still perceive a spot of light although the stimulus (the sun) has been removed. When color is involved in the
stimulus, the color pairings identified in the opponent-process theory lead to a negative afterimage. You can
test this concept using the flag in Figure 5.16.

FIGURE 5.16 Stare at the white dot for 30-60 seconds and then move your eyes to a blank piece of white paper.
What do you see? This is known as a negative afterimage, and it provides empirical support for the opponent-
process theory of color vision.
But these two theories--the trichromatic theory of color vision and the opponent-process theory--are not
mutually exclusive. Research has shown that they just apply to different levels of the nervous system. For
visual processing on the retina, trichromatic theory applies: the cones are responsive to three different
wavelengths that represent red, blue, and green. But once the signal moves past the retina on its way to the
brain, the cells respond in a way consistent with opponent-process theory (Land, 1959; Kaiser, 1997).

Depth Perception
Our ability to perceive spatial relationships in three-dimensional (3-D) space is known as depth perception.
With depth perception, we can describe things as being in front, behind, above, below, or to the side of other
things.
Our world is three-dimensional, so it makes sense that our mental representation of the world has three-
dimensional properties. We use a variety of cues in a visual scene to establish our sense of depth. Some of
these are binocular cues, which means that they rely on the use of both eyes. One example of a binocular
depth cue is binocular disparity, the slightly different view of the world that each of our eyes receives. To
experience this slightly different view, do this simple exercise: extend your arm fully and extend one of your
160 5 · Sensation and Perception

       fingers and focus on that finger. Now, close your left eye without moving your head, then open your left eye and
       close your right eye without moving your head. You will notice that your finger seems to shift as you alternate
       between the two eyes because of the slightly different view each eye has of your finger.
       A 3-D movie works on the same principle: the special glasses you wear allow the two slightly different images
       projected onto the screen to be seen separately by your left and your right eye. As your brain processes these
       images, you have the illusion that the leaping animal or running person is coming right toward you.
       Although we rely on binocular cues to experience depth in our 3-D world, we can also perceive depth in 2-D
       arrays. Think about all the paintings and photographs you have seen. Generally, you pick up on depth in these
       images even though the visual stimulus is 2-D. When we do this, we are relying on a number of monocular
       cues, or cues that require only one eye. If you think you can't see depth with one eye, note that you don't bump
       into things when using only one eye while walking--and, in fact, we have more monocular cues than binocular
       cues.
       An example of a monocular cue would be what is known as linear perspective. Linear perspective refers to the
       fact that we perceive depth when we see two parallel lines that seem to converge in an image (Figure 5.17).
       Some other monocular depth cues are interposition, the partial overlap of objects, and the relative size and
       closeness of images to the horizon.

       FIGURE 5.17 We perceive depth in a two-dimensional figure like this one through the use of monocular cues like
       linear perspective, like the parallel lines converging as the road narrows in the distance. (credit: Marc Dalmulder)

        Stereoblindness

         Bruce Bridgeman was born with an extreme case of lazy eye that resulted in him being stereoblind, or unable to
         respond to binocular cues of depth. He relied heavily on monocular depth cues, but he never had a true
         appreciation of the 3-D nature of the world around him. This all changed one night in 2012 while Bruce was
         seeing a movie with his wife.
         The movie the couple was going to see was shot in 3-D, and even though he thought it was a waste of money,
         Bruce paid for the 3-D glasses when he purchased his ticket. As soon as the film began, Bruce put on the glasses
         and experienced something completely new. For the first time in his life he appreciated the true depth of the
         world around him. Remarkably, his ability to perceive depth persisted outside of the movie theater.
         There are cells in the nervous system that respond to binocular depth cues. Normally, these cells require
         activation during early development in order to persist, so experts familiar with Bruce's case (and others like his)

  assume that at some point in his development, Bruce must have experienced at least a fleeting moment of
  binocular vision. It was enough to ensure the survival of the cells in the visual system tuned to binocular cues.
  The mystery now is why it took Bruce nearly 70 years to have these cells activated (Peck, 2012).

5.4 Hearing

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Describe the basic anatomy and function of the auditory system
  · Explain how we encode and perceive pitch
  · Discuss how we localize sound
Our auditory system converts pressure waves into meaningful sounds. This translates into our ability to hear
the sounds of nature, to appreciate the beauty of music, and to communicate with one another through spoken
language. This section will provide an overview of the basic anatomy and function of the auditory system. It
will include a discussion of how the sensory stimulus is translated into neural impulses, where in the brain
that information is processed, how we perceive pitch, and how we know where sound is coming from.

Anatomy of the Auditory System

The ear can be separated into multiple sections. The outer ear includes the pinna, which is the visible part of
the ear that protrudes from our heads, the auditory canal, and the tympanic membrane, or eardrum. The
middle ear contains three tiny bones known as the ossicles, which are named the malleus (or hammer), incus
(or anvil), and the stapes (or stirrup). The inner ear contains the semi-circular canals, which are involved in
balance and movement (the vestibular sense), and the cochlea. The cochlea is a fluid-filled, snail-shaped
structure that contains the sensory receptor cells (hair cells) of the auditory system (Figure 5.18).

FIGURE 5.18 The ear is divided into outer (pinna and tympanic membrane), middle (the three ossicles: malleus,
incus, and stapes), and inner (cochlea and basilar membrane) divisions.
Sound waves travel along the auditory canal and strike the tympanic membrane, causing it to vibrate. This
vibration results in movement of the three ossicles. As the ossicles move, the stapes presses into a thin
membrane of the cochlea known as the oval window. As the stapes presses into the oval window, the fluid
inside the cochlea begins to move, which in turn stimulates hair cells, which are auditory receptor cells of the
inner ear embedded in the basilar membrane. The basilar membrane is a thin strip of tissue within the
cochlea.
162 5 · Sensation and Perception

       The activation of hair cells is a mechanical process: the stimulation of the hair cell ultimately leads to
       activation of the cell. As hair cells become activated, they generate neural impulses that travel along the
       auditory nerve to the brain. Auditory information is shuttled to the inferior colliculus, the medial geniculate
       nucleus of the thalamus, and finally to the auditory cortex in the temporal lobe of the brain for processing. Like
       the visual system, there is also evidence suggesting that information about auditory recognition and
       localization is processed in parallel streams (Rauschecker & Tian, 2000; Renier et al., 2009).

      Pitch Perception

       Different frequencies of sound waves are associated with differences in our perception of the pitch of those
       sounds. Low-frequency sounds are lower pitched, and high-frequency sounds are higher pitched. How does
       the auditory system differentiate among various pitches?

       Several theories have been proposed to account for pitch perception. We'll discuss two of them here: temporal
       theory and place theory. The temporal theory of pitch perception asserts that frequency is coded by the
       activity level of a sensory neuron. This would mean that a given hair cell would fire action potentials related to
       the frequency of the sound wave. While this is a very intuitive explanation, we detect such a broad range of
       frequencies (20-20,000 Hz) that the frequency of action potentials fired by hair cells cannot account for the
       entire range. Because of properties related to sodium channels on the neuronal membrane that are involved in
       action potentials, there is a point at which a cell cannot fire any faster (Shamma, 2001).

       The place theory of pitch perception suggests that different portions of the basilar membrane are sensitive to
       sounds of different frequencies. More specifically, the base of the basilar membrane responds best to high
       frequencies and the tip of the basilar membrane responds best to low frequencies. Therefore, hair cells that
       are in the base portion would be labeled as high-pitch receptors, while those in the tip of basilar membrane
       would be labeled as low-pitch receptors (Shamma, 2001).

       In reality, both theories explain different aspects of pitch perception. At frequencies up to about 4000 Hz, it is
       clear that both the rate of action potentials and place contribute to our perception of pitch. However, much
       higher frequency sounds can only be encoded using place cues (Shamma, 2001).

      Sound Localization

       The ability to locate sound in our environments is an important part of hearing. Localizing sound could be
       considered similar to the way that we perceive depth in our visual fields. Like the monocular and binocular
       cues that provided information about depth, the auditory system uses both monaural (one-eared) and
       binaural (two-eared) cues to localize sound.

       Each pinna interacts with incoming sound waves differently, depending on the sound's source relative to our
       bodies. This interaction provides a monaural cue that is helpful in locating sounds that occur above or below
       and in front or behind us. The sound waves received by your two ears from sounds that come from directly
       above, below, in front, or behind you would be identical; therefore, monaural cues are essential (Grothe, Pecka,
       & McAlpine, 2010).

       Binaural cues, on the other hand, provide information on the location of a sound along a horizontal axis by
       relying on differences in patterns of vibration of the eardrum between our two ears. If a sound comes from an
       off-center location, it creates two types of binaural cues: interaural level differences and interaural timing
       differences. Interaural level difference refers to the fact that a sound coming from the right side of your body
       is more intense at your right ear than at your left ear because of the attenuation of the sound wave as it passes
       through your head. Interaural timing difference refers to the small difference in the time at which a given
       sound wave arrives at each ear (Figure 5.19). Certain brain areas monitor these differences to construct where
       along a horizontal axis a sound originates (Grothe et al., 2010).

Hearing Loss

Deafness is the partial or complete inability to hear. Some people are born without hearing, which is known as
congenital deafness. Other people suffer from conductive hearing loss, which is due to a problem delivering
sound energy to the cochlea. Causes for conductive hearing loss include blockage of the ear canal, a hole in the
tympanic membrane, problems with the ossicles, or fluid in the space between the eardrum and cochlea.
Another group of people suffer from sensorineural hearing loss, which is the most common form of hearing
loss. Sensorineural hearing loss can be caused by many factors, such as aging, head or acoustic trauma,
infections and diseases (such as measles or mumps), medications, environmental effects such as noise
exposure (noise-induced hearing loss, as shown in Figure 5.20), tumors, and toxins (such as those found in
certain solvents and metals).

FIGURE 5.20 Environmental factors that can lead to sensorineural hearing loss include regular exposure to loud
music or construction equipment. (a) Musical performers and (b) construction workers are at risk for this type of
hearing loss. (credit a: modification of work by "GillyBerlin_Flickr"/Flickr; credit b: modification of work by Nick
Allen)
Given the mechanical nature by which the sound wave stimulus is transmitted from the eardrum through the
ossicles to the oval window of the cochlea, some degree of hearing loss is inevitable. With conductive hearing
164 5 · Sensation and Perception

       loss, hearing problems are associated with a failure in the vibration of the eardrum and/or movement of the
       ossicles. These problems are often dealt with through devices like hearing aids that amplify incoming sound
       waves to make vibration of the eardrum and movement of the ossicles more likely to occur.
       When the hearing problem is associated with a failure to transmit neural signals from the cochlea to the brain,
       it is called sensorineural hearing loss. One disease that results in sensorineural hearing loss is Ménière's
       disease. Although not well understood, Ménière's disease results in a degeneration of inner ear structures that
       can lead to hearing loss, tinnitus (constant ringing or buzzing), vertigo (a sense of spinning), and an increase
       in pressure within the inner ear (Semaan & Megerian, 2011). This kind of loss cannot be treated with hearing
       aids, but some individuals might be candidates for a cochlear implant as a treatment option. Cochlear
       implants are electronic devices that consist of a microphone, a speech processor, and an electrode array. The
       device receives incoming sound information and directly stimulates the auditory nerve to transmit
       information to the brain.

        Deaf Culture

         In the United States and other places around the world, deaf people have their own language, schools, and
         customs. This is called deaf culture. In the United States, deaf individuals often communicate using American
         Sign Language (ASL); ASL has no verbal component and is based entirely on visual signs and gestures. The
         primary mode of communication is signing. One of the values of deaf culture is to continue traditions like using
         sign language rather than teaching deaf children to try to speak, read lips, or have cochlear implant surgery.
         When a child is diagnosed as deaf, parents have difficult decisions to make. Should the child be enrolled in
         mainstream schools and taught to verbalize and read lips? Or should the child be sent to a school for deaf
         children to learn ASL and have significant exposure to deaf culture? Do you think there might be differences in
         the way that parents approach these decisions depending on whether or not they are also deaf?

       Vision and hearing have received an incredible amount of attention from researchers over the years. While
       there is still much to be learned about how these sensory systems work, we have a much better understanding
       of them than of our other sensory modalities. In this section, we will explore our chemical senses (taste and
       smell) and our body senses (touch, temperature, pain, balance, and body position).

       Taste (gustation) and smell (olfaction) are called chemical senses because both have sensory receptors that
       respond to molecules in the food we eat or in the air we breathe. There is a pronounced interaction between
       our chemical senses. For example, when we describe the flavor of a given food, we are really referring to both
       gustatory and olfactory properties of the food working in combination.

Taste (Gustation)
You have learned since elementary school that there are four basic groupings of taste: sweet, salty, sour, and
bitter. Research demonstrates, however, that we have at least six taste groupings. Umami is our fifth taste.
Umami is actually a Japanese word that roughly translates to yummy, and it is associated with a taste for
monosodium glutamate (Kinnamon & Vandenbeuch, 2009). There is also a growing body of experimental
evidence suggesting that we possess a taste for the fatty content of a given food (Mizushige, Inoue, & Fushiki,
2007).
Molecules from the food and beverages we consume dissolve in our saliva and interact with taste receptors on
our tongue and in our mouth and throat. Taste buds are formed by groupings of taste receptor cells with hair-
like extensions that protrude into the central pore of the taste bud (Figure 5.21). Taste buds have a life cycle of
ten days to two weeks, so even destroying some by burning your tongue won't have any long-term effect; they
just grow right back. Taste molecules bind to receptors on this extension and cause chemical changes within
the sensory cell that result in neural impulses being transmitted to the brain via different nerves, depending
on where the receptor is located. Taste information is transmitted to the medulla, thalamus, and limbic
system, and to the gustatory cortex, which is tucked underneath the overlap between the frontal and temporal
lobes (Maffei, Haley, & Fontanini, 2012; Roper, 2013).

FIGURE 5.21 (a) Taste buds are composed of a number of individual taste receptors cells that transmit information
to nerves. (b) This micrograph shows a close-up view of the tongue's surface. (credit a: modification of work by
Jonas Töle; credit b: scale-bar data from Matt Russell)
Smell (Olfaction)
Olfactory receptor cells are located in a mucous membrane at the top of the nose. Small hair-like extensions
from these receptors serve as the sites for odor molecules dissolved in the mucus to interact with chemical
receptors located on these extensions (Figure 5.22). Once an odor molecule has bound a given receptor,
chemical changes within the cell result in signals being sent to the olfactory bulb: a bulb-like structure at the
tip of the frontal lobe where the olfactory nerves begin. From the olfactory bulb, information is sent to regions
of the limbic system and to the primary olfactory cortex, which is located very near the gustatory cortex
(Lodovichi & Belluscio, 2012; Spors et al., 2013).
166 5 · Sensation and Perception

       FIGURE 5.22 Olfactory receptors are the hair-like parts that extend from the olfactory bulb into the mucous
       membrane of the nasal cavity.
       There is tremendous variation in the sensitivity of the olfactory systems of different species. We often think of
       dogs as having far superior olfactory systems than our own, and indeed, dogs can do some remarkable things
       with their noses. There is some evidence to suggest that dogs can "smell" dangerous drops in blood glucose
       levels as well as cancerous tumors (Wells, 2010). Dogs' extraordinary olfactory abilities may be due to the
       increased number of functional genes for olfactory receptors (between 800 and 1200), compared to the fewer
       than 400 observed in humans and other primates (Niimura & Nei, 2007).
       Many species respond to chemical messages, known as pheromones, sent by another individual (Wysocki &
       Preti, 2004). Pheromonal communication often involves providing information about the reproductive status
       of a potential mate. So, for example, when a female rat is ready to mate, it secretes pheromonal signals that
       draw attention from nearby male rats. Pheromonal activation is actually an important component in eliciting
       sexual behavior in the male rat (Furlow, 1996, 2012; Purvis & Haynes, 1972; Sachs, 1997). There has also been
       a good deal of research (and controversy) about pheromones in humans (Comfort, 1971; Russell, 1976;
       Wolfgang-Kimball, 1992; Weller, 1998).

      Touch, Thermoception, and Nociception

       A number of receptors are distributed throughout the skin to respond to various touch-related stimuli (Figure
       5.23). These receptors include Meissner's corpuscles, Pacinian corpuscles, Merkel's disks, and Ruffini
       corpuscles. Meissner's corpuscles respond to pressure and lower frequency vibrations, and Pacinian
       corpuscles detect transient pressure and higher frequency vibrations. Merkel's disks respond to light
       pressure, while Ruffini corpuscles detect stretch (Abraira & Ginty, 2013).

FIGURE 5.23 There are many types of sensory receptors located in the skin, each attuned to specific touch-related
stimuli.
In addition to the receptors located in the skin, there are also a number of free nerve endings that serve
sensory functions. These nerve endings respond to a variety of different types of touch-related stimuli and
serve as sensory receptors for both thermoception (temperature perception) and nociception (a signal
indicating potential harm and maybe pain) (Garland, 2012; Petho & Reeh, 2012; Spray, 1986). Sensory
information collected from the receptors and free nerve endings travels up the spinal cord and is transmitted
to regions of the medulla, thalamus, and ultimately to somatosensory cortex, which is located in the
postcentral gyrus of the parietal lobe.
Pain Perception
Pain is an unpleasant experience that involves both physical and psychological components. Feeling pain is
quite adaptive because it makes us aware of an injury, and it motivates us to remove ourselves from the cause
of that injury. In addition, pain also makes us less likely to suffer additional injury because we will be gentler
with our injured body parts.
Generally speaking, pain can be considered to be neuropathic or inflammatory in nature. Pain that signals
some type of tissue damage is known as inflammatory pain. In some situations, pain results from damage to
neurons of either the peripheral or central nervous system. As a result, pain signals that are sent to the brain
get exaggerated. This type of pain is known as neuropathic pain. Multiple treatment options for pain relief
range from relaxation therapy to the use of analgesic medications to deep brain stimulation. The most effective
treatment option for a given individual will depend on a number of considerations, including the severity and
persistence of the pain and any medical/psychological conditions.
Some individuals are born without the ability to feel pain. This very rare genetic disorder is known as
congenital insensitivity to pain (or congenital analgesia). While those with congenital analgesia can detect
differences in temperature and pressure, they cannot experience pain. As a result, they often suffer significant
injuries. Young children have serious mouth and tongue injuries because they have bitten themselves
repeatedly. Not surprisingly, individuals suffering from this disorder have much shorter life expectancies due
to their injuries and secondary infections of injured sites (U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2013).

The Vestibular Sense, Proprioception, and Kinesthesia

The vestibular sense contributes to our ability to maintain balance and body posture. As Figure 5.24 shows,
the major sensory organs (utricle, saccule, and the three semicircular canals) of this system are located next to
the cochlea in the inner ear. The vestibular organs are fluid-filled and have hair cells, similar to the ones found
168 5 · Sensation and Perception

       in the auditory system, which respond to movement of the head and gravitational forces. When these hair cells
       are stimulated, they send signals to the brain via the vestibular nerve. Although we may not be consciously
       aware of our vestibular system's sensory information under normal circumstances, its importance is apparent
       when we experience motion sickness and/or dizziness related to infections of the inner ear (Khan & Chang,
       2013).

       FIGURE 5.24 The major sensory organs of the vestibular system are located next to the cochlea in the inner ear.
       These include the utricle, saccule, and the three semicircular canals (posterior, superior, and horizontal).
       In addition to maintaining balance, the vestibular system collects information critical for controlling
       movement and the reflexes that move various parts of our bodies to compensate for changes in body position.
       Therefore, both proprioception (perception of body position) and kinesthesia (perception of the body's
       movement through space) interact with information provided by the vestibular system.
       These sensory systems also gather information from receptors that respond to stretch and tension in muscles,
       joints, skin, and tendons (Lackner & DiZio, 2005; Proske, 2006; Proske & Gandevia, 2012). Proprioceptive and
       kinesthetic information travels to the brain via the spinal column. Several cortical regions in addition to the
       cerebellum receive information from and send information to the sensory organs of the proprioceptive and
       kinesthetic systems.

     5.6 Gestalt Principles of Perception

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain the figure-ground relationship
         · Define Gestalt principles of grouping
         · Describe how perceptual set is influenced by an individual's characteristics and mental state
       In the early part of the 20th century, Max Wertheimer published a paper demonstrating that individuals
       perceived motion in rapidly flickering static images--an insight that came to him as he used a child's toy
       tachistoscope. Wertheimer, and his assistants Wolfgang Köhler and Kurt Koffka, who later became his
       partners, believed that perception involved more than simply combining sensory stimuli. This belief led to a
       new movement within the field of psychology known as Gestalt psychology. The word gestalt literally means
       form or pattern, but its use reflects the idea that the whole is different from the sum of its parts. In other words,
       the brain creates a perception that is more than simply the sum of available sensory inputs, and it does so in
       predictable ways. Gestalt psychologists translated these predictable ways into principles by which we organize
       sensory information. As a result, Gestalt psychology has been extremely influential in the area of sensation

and perception (Rock & Palmer, 1990).
One Gestalt principle is the figure-ground relationship. According to this principle, we tend to segment our
visual world into figure and ground. Figure is the object or person that is the focus of the visual field, while the
ground is the background. As Figure 5.25 shows, our perception can vary tremendously, depending on what is
perceived as figure and what is perceived as ground. Presumably, our ability to interpret sensory information
depends on what we label as figure and what we label as ground in any particular case, although this
assumption has been called into question (Peterson & Gibson, 1994; Vecera & O'Reilly, 1998).

FIGURE 5.25 The concept of figure-ground relationship explains why this image can be perceived either as a vase
or as a pair of faces.
Another Gestalt principle for organizing sensory stimuli into meaningful perception is proximity. This
principle asserts that things that are close to one another tend to be grouped together, as Figure 5.26
illustrates.

FIGURE 5.26 The Gestalt principle of proximity suggests that you see (a) one block of dots on the left side and (b)
three columns on the right side.
How we read something provides another illustration of the proximity concept. For example, we read this
sentence like this, notl iket hiso rt hat. We group the letters of a given word together because there are no
spaces between the letters, and we perceive words because there are spaces between each word. Here are
some more examples: Cany oum akes enseo ft hiss entence? What doth es e wor dsmea n?
We might also use the principle of similarity to group things in our visual fields. According to this principle,
things that are alike tend to be grouped together (Figure 5.27). For example, when watching a football game, we
tend to group individuals based on the colors of their uniforms. When watching an offensive drive, we can get a
170 5 · Sensation and Perception

       sense of the two teams simply by grouping along this dimension.

       FIGURE 5.27 When looking at this array of dots, we likely perceive alternating rows of colors. We are grouping these
       dots according to the principle of similarity.
       Two additional Gestalt principles are the law of continuity (or good continuation) and closure. The law of
       continuity suggests that we are more likely to perceive continuous, smooth flowing lines rather than jagged,
       broken lines (Figure 5.28). The principle of closure states that we organize our perceptions into complete
       objects rather than as a series of parts (Figure 5.29).

       FIGURE 5.28 Good continuation would suggest that we are more likely to perceive this as two overlapping lines,
       rather than four lines meeting in the center.

       FIGURE 5.29 Closure suggests that we will perceive a complete circle and rectangle rather than a series of
       segments.

According to Gestalt theorists, pattern perception, or our ability to discriminate among different figures and
shapes, occurs by following the principles described above. You probably feel fairly certain that your
perception accurately matches the real world, but this is not always the case. Our perceptions are based on
perceptual hypotheses: educated guesses that we make while interpreting sensory information. These
hypotheses are informed by a number of factors, including our personalities, experiences, and expectations.
We use these hypotheses to generate our perceptual set. For instance, research has demonstrated that those
who are given verbal priming produce a biased interpretation of complex ambiguous figures (Goolkasian &
Woodbury, 2010).

                                                                                                             DIG DEEPER

 The Depths of Perception: Bias, Prejudice, and Cultural Factors

  In this chapter, you have learned that perception is a complex process. Built from sensations, but influenced by
  our own experiences, biases, prejudices, and cultures, perceptions can be very different from person to person.
  Research suggests that implicit racial prejudice and stereotypes affect perception. For instance, several studies
  have demonstrated that non-Black participants identify weapons faster and are more likely to identify non-
  weapons as weapons when the image of the weapon is paired with the image of a Black person (Payne, 2001;
  Payne, Shimizu, & Jacoby, 2005). Furthermore, White individuals' decisions to shoot an armed target in a video
  game is made more quickly when the target is Black (Correll, Park, Judd, & Wittenbrink, 2002; Correll, Urland, &
  Ito, 2006). This research is important, considering the number of very high-profile cases in the last few decades
  in which Black people were killed by people who claimed to believe that the unarmed individuals were armed
  and/or represented some threat to their personal safety.

Summary

5.1 Sensation versus Perception

Sensation occurs when sensory receptors detect sensory stimuli. Perception involves the organization,
interpretation, and conscious experience of those sensations. All sensory systems have both absolute and
difference thresholds, which refer to the minimum amount of stimulus energy or the minimum amount of
difference in stimulus energy required to be detected about 50% of the time, respectively. Sensory adaptation,
selective attention, and signal detection theory can help explain what is perceived and what is not. In addition,
our perceptions are affected by a number of factors, including beliefs, values, prejudices, culture, and life
experiences.

5.2 Waves and Wavelengths

Both light and sound can be described in terms of wave forms with physical characteristics like amplitude,
wavelength, and timbre. Wavelength and frequency are inversely related so that longer waves have lower
frequencies, and shorter waves have higher frequencies. In the visual system, a light wave's wavelength is
generally associated with color, and its amplitude is associated with brightness. In the auditory system, a
sound's frequency is associated with pitch, and its amplitude is associated with loudness.

5.3 Vision

Light waves cross the cornea and enter the eye at the pupil. The eye's lens focuses this light so that the image is
focused on a region of the retina known as the fovea. The fovea contains cones that possess high levels of
visual acuity and operate best in bright light conditions. Rods are located throughout the retina and operate
best under dim light conditions. Visual information leaves the eye via the optic nerve. Information from each
visual field is sent to the opposite side of the brain at the optic chiasm. Visual information then moves through
a number of brain sites before reaching the occipital lobe, where it is processed.

Two theories explain color perception. The trichromatic theory asserts that three distinct cone groups are
tuned to slightly different wavelengths of light, and it is the combination of activity across these cone types that
results in our perception of all the colors we see. The opponent-process theory of color vision asserts that color
is processed in opponent pairs and accounts for the interesting phenomenon of a negative afterimage. We
perceive depth through a combination of monocular and binocular depth cues.

5.4 Hearing

Sound waves are funneled into the auditory canal and cause vibrations of the eardrum; these vibrations move
the ossicles. As the ossicles move, the stapes presses against the oval window of the cochlea, which causes fluid
inside the cochlea to move. As a result, hair cells embedded in the basilar membrane become enlarged, which
sends neural impulses to the brain via the auditory nerve.

Pitch perception and sound localization are important aspects of hearing. Our ability to perceive pitch relies
on both the firing rate of the hair cells in the basilar membrane as well as their location within the membrane.
In terms of sound localization, both monaural and binaural cues are used to locate where sounds originate in
our environment.

Individuals can be born deaf, or they can develop deafness as a result of age, genetic predisposition, and/or
environmental causes. Hearing loss that results from a failure of the vibration of the eardrum or the resultant
movement of the ossicles is called conductive hearing loss. Hearing loss that involves a failure of the

transmission of auditory nerve impulses to the brain is called sensorineural hearing loss.

5.5 The Other Senses

Taste (gustation) and smell (olfaction) are chemical senses that employ receptors on the tongue and in the
nose that bind directly with taste and odor molecules in order to transmit information to the brain for
processing. Our ability to perceive touch, temperature, and pain is mediated by a number of receptors and free
nerve endings that are distributed throughout the skin and various tissues of the body. The vestibular sense
helps us maintain a sense of balance through the response of hair cells in the utricle, saccule, and semi-
circular canals that respond to changes in head position and gravity. Our proprioceptive and kinesthetic
systems provide information about body position and body movement through receptors that detect stretch
and tension in the muscles, joints, tendons, and skin of the body.

5.6 Gestalt Principles of Perception

Gestalt theorists have been incredibly influential in the areas of sensation and perception. Gestalt principles
such as figure-ground relationship, grouping by proximity or similarity, the law of good continuation, and
closure are all used to help explain how we organize sensory information. Our perceptions are not infallible,
and they can be influenced by bias, prejudice, and other factors.

CHAPTER OUTLINE

6.1 What Is Learning?
6.2 Classical Conditioning
6.3 Operant Conditioning
6.4 Observational Learning (Modeling)

INTRODUCTION The summer sun shines brightly on a deserted stretch of beach. Suddenly, a tiny grey head
emerges from the sand, then another and another. Soon the beach is teeming with loggerhead sea turtle
hatchlings (Figure 6.1). Although only minutes old, the hatchlings know exactly what to do. Their flippers are
not very efficient for moving across the hot sand, yet they continue onward, instinctively. Some are quickly
snapped up by gulls circling overhead and others become lunch for hungry ghost crabs that dart out of their
holes. Despite these dangers, the hatchlings are driven to leave the safety of their nest and find the ocean.

Not far down this same beach, Ben and his son, Julian, paddle out into the ocean on surfboards. A wave
approaches. Julian crouches on his board, then jumps up and rides the wave for a few seconds before losing
his balance. He emerges from the water in time to watch his father ride the face of the wave.

Unlike baby sea turtles, which know how to find the ocean and swim with no help from their parents, we are
not born knowing how to swim (or surf). Yet we humans pride ourselves on our ability to learn. In fact, over
thousands of years and across cultures, we have created institutions devoted entirely to learning. But have you
ever asked yourself how exactly it is that we learn? What processes are at work as we come to know what we
know? This chapter focuses on the primary ways in which learning occurs.
182 6 · Learning

     6.1 What Is Learning?

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain how learned behaviors are different from instincts and reflexes
         · Define learning
         · Recognize and define three basic forms of learning--classical conditioning, operant conditioning, and

             observational learning

       Birds build nests and migrate as winter approaches. Infants suckle for nurishment. Dogs shake water off wet
       fur. Salmon swim upstream to spawn, and spiders spin intricate webs. What do these seemingly unrelated
       behaviors have in common? They all are unlearned behaviors. Both instincts and reflexes are innate
       (unlearned) behaviors that organisms are born with. Reflexes are a motor or neural reaction to a specific
       stimulus in the environment. They tend to be simpler than instincts, involve the activity of specific body parts
       and systems (e.g., the knee-jerk reflex and the contraction of the pupil in bright light), and involve more
       primitive centers of the central nervous system (e.g., the spinal cord and the medulla). In contrast, instincts
       are innate behaviors that are triggered by a broader range of events, such as maturation and the change of
       seasons. They are more complex patterns of behavior, involve movement of the organism as a whole (e.g.,
       sexual activity and migration), and involve higher brain centers.

       Both reflexes and instincts help an organism adapt to its environment and do not have to be learned. For
       example, every healthy human baby has a sucking reflex, present at birth. Babies are born knowing how to
       suck on a nipple, whether artificial (from a bottle) or human. Nobody teaches the baby to suck, just as no one
       teaches a sea turtle hatchling to move toward the ocean. Learning, like reflexes and instincts, allows an
       organism to adapt to its environment. But unlike instincts and reflexes, learned behaviors involve change and
       experience: learning is a relatively permanent change in behavior or knowledge that results from experience.
       In contrast to the innate behaviors discussed above, learning involves acquiring knowledge and skills through
       experience. Looking back at our surfing scenario, Julian will have to spend much more time training with his
       surfboard before he learns how to ride the waves like his father.

       Learning to surf, as well as any complex learning process (e.g., learning about the discipline of psychology),
       involves a complex interaction of conscious and unconscious processes. Learning has traditionally been
       studied in terms of its simplest components--the associations our minds automatically make between events.
       Our minds have a natural tendency to connect events that occur closely together or in sequence. Associative
       learning occurs when an organism makes connections between stimuli or events that occur together in the
       environment. You will see that associative learning is central to all three basic learning processes discussed in
       this chapter; classical conditioning tends to involve unconscious processes, operant conditioning tends to
       involve conscious processes, and observational learning adds social and cognitive layers to all the basic
       associative processes, both conscious and unconscious. These learning processes will be discussed in detail
       later in the chapter, but it is helpful to have a brief overview of each as you begin to explore how learning is
       understood from a psychological perspective.

       In classical conditioning, also known as Pavlovian conditioning, organisms learn to associate events--or
       stimuli--that repeatedly happen together. We experience this process throughout our daily lives. For example,
       you might see a flash of lightning in the sky during a storm and then hear a loud boom of thunder. The sound of
       the thunder naturally makes you jump (loud noises have that effect by reflex). Because lightning reliably
       predicts the impending boom of thunder, you may associate the two and jump when you see lightning.
       Psychological researchers study this associative process by focusing on what can be seen and
       measured--behaviors. Researchers ask if one stimulus triggers a reflex, can we train a different stimulus to
       trigger that same reflex? In operant conditioning, organisms learn, again, to associate events--a behavior and
       its consequence (reinforcement or punishment). A pleasant consequence encourages more of that behavior in
       the future, whereas a punishment deters the behavior. Imagine you are teaching your dog, Hodor, to sit. You

tell Hodor to sit, and give him a treat when he does. After repeated experiences, Hodor begins to associate the
act of sitting with receiving a treat. He learns that the consequence of sitting is that he gets a doggie biscuit
(Figure 6.2). Conversely, if the dog is punished when exhibiting a behavior, it becomes conditioned to avoid
that behavior (e.g., receiving a small shock when crossing the boundary of an invisible electric fence).

FIGURE 6.2 In operant conditioning, a response is associated with a consequence. This dog has learned that
certain behaviors result in receiving a treat. (credit: Crystal Rolfe)
Observational learning extends the effective range of both classical and operant conditioning. In contrast to
classical and operant conditioning, in which learning occurs only through direct experience, observational
learning is the process of watching others and then imitating what they do. A lot of learning among humans
and other animals comes from observational learning. To get an idea of the extra effective range that
observational learning brings, consider Ben and his son Julian from the introduction. How might observation
help Julian learn to surf, as opposed to learning by trial and error alone? By watching his father, he can imitate
the moves that bring success and avoid the moves that lead to failure. Can you think of something you have
learned how to do after watching someone else?
All of the approaches covered in this chapter are part of a particular tradition in psychology, called
behaviorism, which we discuss in the next section. However, these approaches do not represent the entire
study of learning. Separate traditions of learning have taken shape within different fields of psychology, such
as memory and cognition, so you will find that other chapters will round out your understanding of the topic.
Over time these traditions tend to converge. For example, in this chapter you will see how cognition has come
to play a larger role in behaviorism, whose more extreme adherents once insisted that behaviors are triggered
by the environment with no intervening thought.

6.2 Classical Conditioning

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Explain how classical conditioning occurs
  · Summarize the processes of acquisition, extinction, spontaneous recovery, generalization, and discrimination
Does the name Ivan Pavlov ring a bell? Even if you are new to the study of psychology, chances are that you
have heard of Pavlov and his famous dogs.
Pavlov (1849-1936), a Russian scientist, performed extensive research on dogs and is best known for his
experiments in classical conditioning (Figure 6.3). As we discussed briefly in the previous section, classical
conditioning is a process by which we learn to associate stimuli and, consequently, to anticipate events.
184 6 · Learning

       FIGURE 6.3 Ivan Pavlov's research on the digestive system of dogs unexpectedly led to his discovery of the learning
       process now known as classical conditioning.
       Pavlov came to his conclusions about how learning occurs completely by accident. Pavlov was a physiologist,
       not a psychologist. Physiologists study the life processes of organisms, from the molecular level to the level of
       cells, organ systems, and entire organisms. Pavlov's area of interest was the digestive system (Hunt, 2007). In
       his studies with dogs, Pavlov measured the amount of saliva produced in response to various foods. Over time,
       Pavlov (1927) observed that the dogs began to salivate not only at the taste of food, but also at the sight of food,
       at the sight of an empty food bowl, and even at the sound of the laboratory assistants' footsteps. Salivating to
       food in the mouth is reflexive, so no learning is involved. However, dogs don't naturally salivate at the sight of
       an empty bowl or the sound of footsteps.
       These unusual responses intrigued Pavlov, and he wondered what accounted for what he called the dogs'
       "psychic secretions" (Pavlov, 1927). To explore this phenomenon in an objective manner, Pavlov designed a
       series of carefully controlled experiments to see which stimuli would cause the dogs to salivate. He was able to
       train the dogs to salivate in response to stimuli that clearly had nothing to do with food, such as the sound of a
       bell, a light, and a touch on the leg. Through his experiments, Pavlov realized that an organism has two types of
       responses to its environment: (1) unconditioned (unlearned) responses, or reflexes, and (2) conditioned
       (learned) responses.
       In Pavlov's experiments, the dogs salivated each time meat powder was presented to them. The meat powder
       in this situation was an unconditioned stimulus (UCS): a stimulus that elicits a reflexive response in an
       organism. The dogs' salivation was an unconditioned response (UCR): a natural (unlearned) reaction to a
       given stimulus. Before conditioning, think of the dogs' stimulus and response like this:

       In classical conditioning, a neutral stimulus is presented immediately before an unconditioned stimulus.
       Pavlov would sound a tone (like ringing a bell) and then give the dogs the meat powder (Figure 6.4). The tone
       was the neutral stimulus (NS), which is a stimulus that does not naturally elicit a response. Prior to
       conditioning, the dogs did not salivate when they just heard the tone because the tone had no association for
       the dogs.

       When Pavlov paired the tone with the meat powder over and over again, the previously neutral stimulus (the
       tone) also began to elicit salivation from the dogs. Thus, the neutral stimulus became the conditioned
       stimulus (CS), which is a stimulus that elicits a response after repeatedly being paired with an unconditioned
       stimulus. Eventually, the dogs began to salivate to the tone alone, just as they previously had salivated at the
       sound of the assistants' footsteps. The behavior caused by the conditioned stimulus is called the conditioned
       response (CR). In the case of Pavlov's dogs, they had learned to associate the tone (CS) with being fed, and they
       began to salivate (CR) in anticipation of food.

FIGURE 6.4 Before conditioning, an unconditioned stimulus (food) produces an unconditioned response
(salivation), and a neutral stimulus (bell) does not produce a response. During conditioning, the unconditioned
stimulus (food) is presented repeatedly just after the presentation of the neutral stimulus (bell). After conditioning,
the neutral stimulus alone produces a conditioned response (salivation), thus becoming a conditioned stimulus.

Real World Application of Classical Conditioning

How does classical conditioning work in the real world? Consider the case of Moisha, who was diagnosed with
cancer. When she received her first chemotherapy treatment, she vomited shortly after the chemicals were
injected. In fact, every trip to the doctor for chemotherapy treatment shortly after the drugs were injected, she
vomited. Moisha's treatment was a success and her cancer went into remission. Now, when she visits her
oncologist's office every 6 months for a check-up, she becomes nauseous. In this case, the chemotherapy drugs
are the unconditioned stimulus (UCS), vomiting is the unconditioned response (UCR), the doctor's office is the
conditioned stimulus (CS) after being paired with the UCS, and nausea is the conditioned response (CR). Let's
assume that the chemotherapy drugs that Moisha takes are given through a syringe injection. After entering
the doctor's office, Moisha sees a syringe, and then gets her medication. In addition to the doctor's office,
Moisha will learn to associate the syringe with the medication and will respond to syringes with nausea. This is
an example of higher-order (or second-order) conditioning, when the conditioned stimulus (the doctor's office)
serves to condition another stimulus (the syringe). It is hard to achieve anything above second-order
conditioning. For example, if someone rang a bell every time Moisha received a syringe injection of
chemotherapy drugs in the doctor's office, Moisha likely will never get sick in response to the bell.
Consider another example of classical conditioning. Let's say you have a cat named Tiger, who is quite spoiled.
You keep her food in a separate cabinet, and you also have a special electric can opener that you use only to
open cans of cat food. For every meal, Tiger hears the distinctive sound of the electric can opener ("zzhzhz")
and then gets her food. Tiger quickly learns that when she hears "zzhzhz" she is about to get fed. What do you
think Tiger does when she hears the electric can opener? She will likely get excited and run to where you are
186 6 · Learning

       preparing her food. This is an example of classical conditioning. In this case, what are the UCS, CS, UCR, and
       CR?
       What if the cabinet holding Tiger's food becomes squeaky? In that case, Tiger hears "squeak" (the cabinet),
       "zzhzhz" (the electric can opener), and then she gets her food. Tiger will learn to get excited when she hears
       the "squeak" of the cabinet. Pairing a new neutral stimulus ("squeak") with the conditioned stimulus
       ("zzhzhz") is called higher-order conditioning, or second-order conditioning. This means you are using the
       conditioned stimulus of the can opener to condition another stimulus: the squeaky cabinet (Figure 6.5). It is
       hard to achieve anything above second-order conditioning. For example, if you ring a bell, open the cabinet
       ("squeak"), use the can opener ("zzhzhz"), and then feed Tiger, Tiger will likely never get excited when hearing
       the bell alone.

       FIGURE 6.5 In higher-order conditioning, an established conditioned stimulus is paired with a new neutral stimulus
       (the second-order stimulus), so that eventually the new stimulus also elicits the conditioned response, without the
       initial conditioned stimulus being presented.

                                                                                             EVERYDAY CONNECTION
        Classical Conditioning at Stingray City

         Kate and her spouse recently vacationed in the Cayman Islands, and booked a boat tour to Stingray City, where
         they could feed and swim with the southern stingrays. The boat captain explained how the normally solitary
         stingrays have become accustomed to interacting with humans. About 40 years ago, people began to clean fish

  and conch (unconditioned stimulus) at a particular sandbar near a barrier reef, and large numbers of stingrays
  would swim in to eat (unconditioned response) what the people threw into the water; this continued for years. By
  the late 1980s, word of the large group of stingrays spread among scuba divers, who then started feeding them
  by hand. Over time, the southern stingrays in the area were classically conditioned much like Pavlov's dogs.
  When they hear the sound of a boat engine (neutral stimulus that becomes a conditioned stimulus), they know
  that they will get to eat (conditioned response).
  As soon as they reached Stingray City, over two dozen stingrays surrounded their tour boat. The couple slipped
  into the water with bags of squid, the stingrays' favorite treat. The swarm of stingrays bumped and rubbed up
  against their legs like hungry cats (Figure 6.6). Kate was able to feed, pet, and even kiss (for luck) these amazing
  creatures. Then all the squid was gone, and so were the stingrays.

  FIGURE 6.6 Kate holds a southern stingray at Stingray City in the Cayman Islands. These stingrays have been
  classically conditioned to associate the sound of a boat motor with food provided by tourists. (credit: Kathryn
  Dumper)

Classical conditioning also applies to humans, even babies. For example, Elan buys formula in blue canisters
for their six-month-old daughter, Angelina. Whenever Elan takes out a formula container, Angelina gets
excited, tries to reach toward the food, and most likely salivates. Why does Angelina get excited when she sees
the formula canister? What are the UCS, CS, UCR, and CR here?
So far, all of the examples have involved food, but classical conditioning extends beyond the basic need to be
fed. Consider our earlier example of a dog whose owners install an invisible electric dog fence. A small
electrical shock (unconditioned stimulus) elicits discomfort (unconditioned response). When the
unconditioned stimulus (shock) is paired with a neutral stimulus (the edge of a yard), the dog associates the
discomfort (unconditioned response) with the edge of the yard (conditioned stimulus) and stays within the set
boundaries. In this example, the edge of the yard elicits fear and anxiety in the dog. Fear and anxiety are the
conditioned response.

      General Processes in Classical Conditioning

       Now that you know how classical conditioning works and have seen several examples, let's take a look at some
       of the general processes involved. In classical conditioning, the initial period of learning is known as
       acquisition, when an organism learns to connect a neutral stimulus and an unconditioned stimulus. During
       acquisition, the neutral stimulus begins to elicit the conditioned response, and eventually the neutral stimulus
       becomes a conditioned stimulus capable of eliciting the conditioned response by itself. Timing is important for
       conditioning to occur. Typically, there should only be a brief interval between presentation of the conditioned
       stimulus and the unconditioned stimulus. Depending on what is being conditioned, sometimes this interval is
       as little as five seconds (Chance, 2009). However, with other types of conditioning, the interval can be up to
       several hours.

       Taste aversion is a type of conditioning in which an interval of several hours may pass between the
       conditioned stimulus (something ingested) and the unconditioned stimulus (nausea or illness). Here's how it
       works. Between classes, you and a friend grab a quick lunch from a food cart on campus. You share a dish of
       chicken curry and head off to your next class. A few hours later, you feel nauseous and become ill. Although
       your friend is fine and you determine that you have intestinal flu (the food is not the culprit), you've developed
       a taste aversion; the next time you are at a restaurant and someone orders curry, you immediately feel ill.
       While the chicken dish is not what made you sick, you are experiencing taste aversion: you've been
       conditioned to be averse to a food after a single, bad experience.

       How does this occur--conditioning based on a single instance and involving an extended time lapse between
       the event and the negative stimulus? Research into taste aversion suggests that this response may be an
       evolutionary adaptation designed to help organisms quickly learn to avoid harmful foods (Garcia & Rusiniak,
       1980; Garcia & Koelling, 1966). Not only may this contribute to species survival via natural selection, but it
       may also help us develop strategies for challenges such as helping cancer patients through the nausea induced
       by certain treatments (Holmes, 1993; Jacobsen et al., 1993; Hutton, Baracos, & Wismer, 2007; Skolin et al.,
       2006). Garcia and Koelling (1966) showed not only that taste aversions could be conditioned, but also that
       there were biological constraints to learning. In their study, separate groups of rats were conditioned to
       associate either a flavor with illness, or lights and sounds with illness. Results showed that all rats exposed to
       flavor-illness pairings learned to avoid the flavor, but none of the rats exposed to lights and sounds with illness
       learned to avoid lights or sounds. This added evidence to the idea that classical conditioning could contribute
       to species survival by helping organisms learn to avoid stimuli that posed real dangers to health and welfare.

       Robert Rescorla demonstrated how powerfully an organism can learn to predict the UCS from the CS. Take, for
       example, the following two situations. Ari's dad always has dinner on the table every day at 6:00. Soraya's mom
       switches it up so that some days they eat dinner at 6:00, some days they eat at 5:00, and other days they eat at
       7:00. For Ari, 6:00 reliably and consistently predicts dinner, so Ari will likely start feeling hungry every day
       right before 6:00, even if he's had a late snack. Soraya, on the other hand, will be less likely to associate 6:00
       with dinner, since 6:00 does not always predict that dinner is coming. Rescorla, along with his colleague at Yale
       University, Alan Wagner, developed a mathematical formula that could be used to calculate the probability that
       an association would be learned given the ability of a conditioned stimulus to predict the occurrence of an
       unconditioned stimulus and other factors; today this is known as the Rescorla-Wagner model (Rescorla &
       Wagner, 1972)

       Once we have established the connection between the unconditioned stimulus and the conditioned stimulus,
       how do we break that connection and get the dog, cat, or child to stop responding? In Tiger's case, imagine
       what would happen if you stopped using the electric can opener for her food and began to use it only for
       human food. Now, Tiger would hear the can opener, but she would not get food. In classical conditioning terms,
       you would be giving the conditioned stimulus, but not the unconditioned stimulus. Pavlov explored this
       scenario in his experiments with dogs: sounding the tone without giving the dogs the meat powder. Soon the
       dogs stopped responding to the tone. Extinction is the decrease in the conditioned response when the

unconditioned stimulus is no longer presented with the conditioned stimulus. When presented with the
conditioned stimulus alone, the dog, cat, or other organism would show a weaker and weaker response, and
finally no response. In classical conditioning terms, there is a gradual weakening and disappearance of the
conditioned response.
What happens when learning is not used for a while--when what was learned lies dormant? As we just
discussed, Pavlov found that when he repeatedly presented the bell (conditioned stimulus) without the meat
powder (unconditioned stimulus), extinction occurred; the dogs stopped salivating to the bell. However, after a
couple of hours of resting from this extinction training, the dogs again began to salivate when Pavlov rang the
bell. What do you think would happen with Tiger's behavior if your electric can opener broke, and you did not
use it for several months? When you finally got it fixed and started using it to open Tiger's food again, Tiger
would remember the association between the can opener and her food--she would get excited and run to the
kitchen when she heard the sound. The behavior of Pavlov's dogs and Tiger illustrates a concept Pavlov called
spontaneous recovery: the return of a previously extinguished conditioned response following a rest period
(Figure 6.7).

FIGURE 6.7 This is the curve of acquisition, extinction, and spontaneous recovery. The rising curve shows the
conditioned response quickly getting stronger through the repeated pairing of the conditioned stimulus and the
unconditioned stimulus (acquisition). Then the curve decreases, which shows how the conditioned response
weakens when only the conditioned stimulus is presented (extinction). After a break or pause from conditioning, the
conditioned response reappears (spontaneous recovery).
Of course, these processes also apply in humans. For example, let's say that every day when you walk to
campus, an ice cream truck passes your route. Day after day, you hear the truck's music (neutral stimulus), so
you finally stop and purchase a chocolate ice cream bar. You take a bite (unconditioned stimulus) and then
your mouth waters (unconditioned response). This initial period of learning is known as acquisition, when you
begin to connect the neutral stimulus (the sound of the truck) and the unconditioned stimulus (the taste of the
chocolate ice cream in your mouth). During acquisition, the conditioned response gets stronger and stronger
through repeated pairings of the conditioned stimulus and unconditioned stimulus. Several days (and ice
cream bars) later, you notice that your mouth begins to water (conditioned response) as soon as you hear the
truck's musical jingle--even before you bite into the ice cream bar. Then one day you head down the street. You
hear the truck's music (conditioned stimulus), and your mouth waters (conditioned response). However, when
you get to the truck, you discover that they are all out of ice cream. You leave disappointed. The next few days
you pass by the truck and hear the music, but don't stop to get an ice cream bar because you're running late for
class. You begin to salivate less and less when you hear the music, until by the end of the week, your mouth no
longer waters when you hear the tune. This illustrates extinction. The conditioned response weakens when
only the conditioned stimulus (the sound of the truck) is presented, without being followed by the
unconditioned stimulus (chocolate ice cream in the mouth). Then the weekend comes. You don't have to go to
190 6 · Learning

       class, so you don't pass the truck. Monday morning arrives and you take your usual route to campus. You
       round the corner and hear the truck again. What do you think happens? Your mouth begins to water again.
       Why? After a break from conditioning, the conditioned response reappears, which indicates spontaneous
       recovery.
       Acquisition and extinction involve the strengthening and weakening, respectively, of a learned association.
       Two other learning processes--stimulus discrimination and stimulus generalization--are involved in
       determining which stimuli will trigger learned responses. Animals (including humans) need to distinguish
       between stimuli--for example, between sounds that predict a threatening event and sounds that do not--so that
       they can respond appropriately (such as running away if the sound is threatening). When an organism learns
       to respond differently to various stimuli that are similar, it is called stimulus discrimination. In classical
       conditioning terms, the organism demonstrates the conditioned response only to the conditioned stimulus.
       Pavlov's dogs discriminated between the basic tone that sounded before they were fed and other tones (e.g.,
       the doorbell), because the other sounds did not predict the arrival of food. Similarly, Tiger, the cat,
       discriminated between the sound of the can opener and the sound of the electric mixer. When the electric
       mixer is going, Tiger is not about to be fed, so she does not come running to the kitchen looking for food. In our
       other example, Moisha, the cancer patient, discriminated between oncologists and other types of doctors. She
       learned not to feel ill when visiting doctors for other types of appointments, such as her annual physical.
       On the other hand, when an organism demonstrates the conditioned response to stimuli that are similar to the
       condition stimulus, it is called stimulus generalization, the opposite of stimulus discrimination. The more
       similar a stimulus is to the condition stimulus, the more likely the organism is to give the conditioned
       response. For instance, if the electric mixer sounds very similar to the electric can opener, Tiger may come
       running after hearing its sound. But if you do not feed her following the electric mixer sound, and you continue
       to feed her consistently after the electric can opener sound, she will quickly learn to discriminate between the
       two sounds (provided they are sufficiently dissimilar that she can tell them apart). In our other example,
       Moisha continued to feel ill whenever visiting other oncologists or other doctors in the same building as her
       oncologist.

      Behaviorism

       John B. Watson, shown in Figure 6.8, is considered the founder of behaviorism. Behaviorism is a school of
       thought that arose during the first part of the 20th century, which incorporates elements of Pavlov's classical
       conditioning (Hunt, 2007). In stark contrast with Freud, who considered the reasons for behavior to be hidden
       in the unconscious, Watson championed the idea that all behavior can be studied as a simple stimulus-
       response reaction, without regard for internal processes. Watson argued that in order for psychology to
       become a legitimate science, it must shift its concern away from internal mental processes because mental
       processes cannot be seen or measured. Instead, he asserted that psychology must focus on outward
       observable behavior that can be measured.

        FIGURE 6.8 John B. Watson used the principles of classical conditioning in the study of human emotion.
Watson's ideas were influenced by Pavlov's work. According to Watson, human behavior, just like animal
behavior, is primarily the result of conditioned responses. Whereas Pavlov's work with dogs involved the
conditioning of reflexes, Watson believed the same principles could be extended to the conditioning of human
emotions (Watson, 1919).
In 1920, while chair of the psychology department at Johns Hopkins University, Watson and his graduate
student, Rosalie Rayner, conducted research on a baby nicknamed Little Albert. Rayner and Watson's
experiments with Little Albert demonstrated how fears can be conditioned using classical conditioning.
Through these experiments, Little Albert was exposed to and conditioned to fear certain things. Initially he was
presented with various neutral stimuli, including a rabbit, a dog, a monkey, masks, cotton wool, and a white
rat. He was not afraid of any of these things. Then Watson, with the help of Rayner, conditioned Little Albert to
associate these stimuli with an emotion--fear. For example, Watson handed Little Albert the white rat, and
Little Albert enjoyed playing with it. Then Watson made a loud sound, by striking a hammer against a metal
bar hanging behind Little Albert's head, each time Little Albert touched the rat. Little Albert was frightened by
the sound--demonstrating a reflexive fear of sudden loud noises--and began to cry. Watson repeatedly paired
the loud sound with the white rat. Soon Little Albert became frightened by the white rat alone. In this case,
what are the UCS, CS, UCR, and CR? Days later, Little Albert demonstrated stimulus generalization--he became
afraid of other furry things: a rabbit, a furry coat, and even a Santa Claus mask (Figure 6.9). Watson had
succeeded in conditioning a fear response in Little Albert, thus demonstrating that emotions could become
conditioned responses. It had been Watson's intention to produce a phobia--a persistent, excessive fear of a
specific object or situation-- through conditioning alone, thus countering Freud's view that phobias are caused
by deep, hidden conflicts in the mind. However, there is no evidence that Little Albert experienced phobias in
later years. Little Albert's mother moved away, ending the experiment. While Watson's research provided new
insight into conditioning, it would be considered unethical by today's standards.

Claus mask.

        Advertising and Associative Learning

         Advertising executives are pros at applying the principles of associative learning. Think about the car
         commercials you have seen on television. Many of them feature an attractive model. By associating the model
         with the car being advertised, you come to see the car as being desirable (Cialdini, 2008). You may be asking
         yourself, does this advertising technique actually work? According to Cialdini (2008), men who viewed a car
         commercial that included an attractive model later rated the car as being faster, more appealing, and better
         designed than did men who viewed an advertisement for the same car minus the model.
         Have you ever noticed how quickly advertisers cancel contracts with a famous athlete following a scandal? As far
         as the advertiser is concerned, that athlete is no longer associated with positive feelings; therefore, the athlete
         cannot be used as an unconditioned stimulus to condition the public to associate positive feelings (the
         unconditioned response) with their product (the conditioned stimulus).
         Now that you are aware of how associative learning works, see if you can find examples of these types of
         advertisements on television, in magazines, or on the Internet.

       The previous section of this chapter focused on the type of associative learning known as classical
       conditioning. Remember that in classical conditioning, something in the environment triggers a reflex
       automatically, and researchers train the organism to react to a different stimulus. Now we turn to the second
       type of associative learning, operant conditioning. In operant conditioning, organisms learn to associate a
       behavior and its consequence (Table 6.1). A pleasant consequence makes that behavior more likely to be
       repeated in the future. For example, Spirit, a dolphin at the National Aquarium in Baltimore, does a flip in the
       air when her trainer blows a whistle. The consequence is that she gets a fish.

TABLE 6.1

Psychologist B. F. Skinner saw that classical conditioning is limited to existing behaviors that are reflexively
elicited, and it doesn't account for new behaviors such as riding a bike. He proposed a theory about how such
behaviors come about. Skinner believed that behavior is motivated by the consequences we receive for the
behavior: the reinforcements and punishments. His idea that learning is the result of consequences is based
on the law of effect, which was first proposed by psychologist Edward Thorndike. According to the law of
effect, behaviors that are followed by consequences that are satisfying to the organism are more likely to be
repeated, and behaviors that are followed by unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated
(Thorndike, 1911). Essentially, if an organism does something that brings about a desired result, the organism
is more likely to do it again. If an organism does something that does not bring about a desired result, the
organism is less likely to do it again. An example of the law of effect is in employment. One of the reasons (and
often the main reason) we show up for work is because we get paid to do so. If we stop getting paid, we will
likely stop showing up--even if we love our job.

Working with Thorndike's law of effect as his foundation, Skinner began conducting scientific experiments on
animals (mainly rats and pigeons) to determine how organisms learn through operant conditioning (Skinner,
1938). He placed these animals inside an operant conditioning chamber, which has come to be known as a
"Skinner box" (Figure 6.10). A Skinner box contains a lever (for rats) or disk (for pigeons) that the animal can
press or peck for a food reward via the dispenser. Speakers and lights can be associated with certain behaviors.
A recorder counts the number of responses made by the animal.

In discussing operant conditioning, we use several everyday words--positive, negative, reinforcement, and
punishment--in a specialized manner. In operant conditioning, positive and negative do not mean good and
bad. Instead, positive means you are adding something, and negative means you are taking something away.
Reinforcement means you are increasing a behavior, and punishment means you are decreasing a behavior.
Reinforcement can be positive or negative, and punishment can also be positive or negative. All reinforcers
(positive or negative) increase the likelihood of a behavioral response. All punishers (positive or negative)
decrease the likelihood of a behavioral response. Now let's combine these four terms: positive reinforcement,
negative reinforcement, positive punishment, and negative punishment (Table 6.2).

TABLE 6.2

Reinforcement

The most effective way to teach a person or animal a new behavior is with positive reinforcement. In positive
reinforcement, a desirable stimulus is added to increase a behavior.

For example, you tell your five-year-old son, Jerome, that if he cleans his room, he will get a toy. Jerome quickly
cleans his room because he wants a new art set. Let's pause for a moment. Some people might say, "Why
should I reward my child for doing what is expected?" But in fact we are constantly and consistently rewarded
in our lives. Our paychecks are rewards, as are high grades and acceptance into our preferred school. Being
praised for doing a good job and for passing a driver's test is also a reward. Positive reinforcement as a
learning tool is extremely effective. It has been found that one of the most effective ways to increase
achievement in school districts with below-average reading scores was to pay the children to read. Specifically,
second-grade students in Dallas were paid $2 each time they read a book and passed a short quiz about the
book. The result was a significant increase in reading comprehension (Fryer, 2010). What do you think about
this program? If Skinner were alive today, he would probably think this was a great idea. He was a strong
proponent of using operant conditioning principles to influence students' behavior at school. In fact, in
addition to the Skinner box, he also invented what he called a teaching machine that was designed to reward
small steps in learning (Skinner, 1961)--an early forerunner of computer-assisted learning. His teaching
machine tested students' knowledge as they worked through various school subjects. If students answered
questions correctly, they received immediate positive reinforcement and could continue; if they answered
incorrectly, they did not receive any reinforcement. The idea was that students would spend additional time
studying the material to increase their chance of being reinforced the next time (Skinner, 1961).

In negative reinforcement, an undesirable stimulus is removed to increase a behavior. For example, car
manufacturers use the principles of negative reinforcement in their seatbelt systems, which go "beep, beep,
beep" until you fasten your seatbelt. The annoying sound stops when you exhibit the desired behavior,

increasing the likelihood that you will buckle up in the future. Negative reinforcement is also used frequently
in horse training. Riders apply pressure--by pulling the reins or squeezing their legs--and then remove the
pressure when the horse performs the desired behavior, such as turning or speeding up. The pressure is the
negative stimulus that the horse wants to remove.

Punishment

Many people confuse negative reinforcement with punishment in operant conditioning, but they are two very
different mechanisms. Remember that reinforcement, even when it is negative, always increases a behavior. In
contrast, punishment always decreases a behavior. In positive punishment, you add an undesirable stimulus
to decrease a behavior. An example of positive punishment is scolding a student to get the student to stop
texting in class. In this case, a stimulus (the reprimand) is added in order to decrease the behavior (texting in
class). In negative punishment, you remove a pleasant stimulus to decrease behavior. For example, when a
child misbehaves, a parent can take away a favorite toy. In this case, a stimulus (the toy) is removed in order to
decrease the behavior.

Punishment, especially when it is immediate, is one way to decrease undesirable behavior. For example,
imagine your four-year-old son, Brandon, hit his younger brother. You have Brandon write 100 times "I will not
hit my brother" (positive punishment). Chances are he won't repeat this behavior. While strategies like this are
common today, in the past children were often subject to physical punishment, such as spanking. It's
important to be aware of some of the drawbacks in using physical punishment on children. First, punishment
may teach fear. Brandon may become fearful of the street, but he also may become fearful of the person who
delivered the punishment--you, his parent. Similarly, children who are punished by teachers may come to fear
the teacher and try to avoid school (Gershoff et al., 2010). Consequently, most schools in the United States have
banned corporal punishment. Second, punishment may cause children to become more aggressive and prone
to antisocial behavior and delinquency (Gershoff, 2002). They see their parents resort to spanking when they
become angry and frustrated, so, in turn, they may act out this same behavior when they become angry and
frustrated. For example, because you spank Brenda when you are angry with her for her misbehavior, she
might start hitting her friends when they won't share their toys.

While positive punishment can be effective in some cases, Skinner suggested that the use of punishment
should be weighed against the possible negative effects. Today's psychologists and parenting experts favor
reinforcement over punishment--they recommend that you catch your child doing something good and reward
them for it.

Shaping

In his operant conditioning experiments, Skinner often used an approach called shaping. Instead of rewarding
only the target behavior, in shaping, we reward successive approximations of a target behavior. Why is shaping
needed? Remember that in order for reinforcement to work, the organism must first display the behavior.
Shaping is needed because it is extremely unlikely that an organism will display anything but the simplest of
behaviors spontaneously. In shaping, behaviors are broken down into many small, achievable steps. The
specific steps used in the process are the following:

1. Reinforce any response that resembles the desired behavior.
2. Then reinforce the response that more closely resembles the desired behavior. You will no longer reinforce

      the previously reinforced response.
3. Next, begin to reinforce the response that even more closely resembles the desired behavior.
4. Continue to reinforce closer and closer approximations of the desired behavior.
5. Finally, only reinforce the desired behavior.

Shaping is often used in teaching a complex behavior or chain of behaviors. Skinner used shaping to teach
pigeons not only such relatively simple behaviors as pecking a disk in a Skinner box, but also many unusual
and entertaining behaviors, such as turning in circles, walking in figure eights, and even playing ping pong; the
196 6 · Learning

       technique is commonly used by animal trainers today. An important part of shaping is stimulus
       discrimination. Recall Pavlov's dogs--he trained them to respond to the tone of a bell, and not to similar tones
       or sounds. This discrimination is also important in operant conditioning and in shaping behavior.

       It's easy to see how shaping is effective in teaching behaviors to animals, but how does shaping work with
       humans? Let's consider parents whose goal is to have their child learn to clean his room. They use shaping to
       help him master steps toward the goal. Instead of performing the entire task, they set up these steps and
       reinforce each step. First, he cleans up one toy. Second, he cleans up five toys. Third, he chooses whether to
       pick up ten toys or put his books and clothes away. Fourth, he cleans up everything except two toys. Finally, he
       cleans his entire room.

      Primary and Secondary Reinforcers

       Rewards such as stickers, praise, money, toys, and more can be used to reinforce learning. Let's go back to
       Skinner's rats again. How did the rats learn to press the lever in the Skinner box? They were rewarded with
       food each time they pressed the lever. For animals, food would be an obvious reinforcer.

       What would be a good reinforcer for humans? For your child Chris, it was the promise of a toy when they
       cleaned their room. How about Sydney, the soccer player? If you gave Sydney a piece of candy every time
       Sydney scored a goal, you would be using a primary reinforcer. Primary reinforcers are reinforcers that have
       innate reinforcing qualities. These kinds of reinforcers are not learned. Water, food, sleep, shelter, sex, and
       touch, among others, are primary reinforcers. Pleasure is also a primary reinforcer. Organisms do not lose
       their drive for these things. For most people, jumping in a cool lake on a very hot day would be reinforcing and
       the cool lake would be innately reinforcing--the water would cool the person off (a physical need), as well as
       provide pleasure.

       A secondary reinforcer has no inherent value and only has reinforcing qualities when linked with a primary
       reinforcer. Praise, linked to affection, is one example of a secondary reinforcer, as when you called out "Great
       shot!" every time Sydney made a goal. Another example, money, is only worth something when you can use it
       to buy other things--either things that satisfy basic needs (food, water, shelter--all primary reinforcers) or
       other secondary reinforcers. If you were on a remote island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and you had
       stacks of money, the money would not be useful if you could not spend it. What about the stickers on the
       behavior chart? They also are secondary reinforcers.

       Sometimes, instead of stickers on a sticker chart, a token is used. Tokens, which are also secondary
       reinforcers, can then be traded in for rewards and prizes. Entire behavior management systems, known as
       token economies, are built around the use of these kinds of token reinforcers. Token economies have been
       found to be very effective at modifying behavior in a variety of settings such as schools, prisons, and mental
       hospitals. For example, a study by Adibsereshki and Abkenar (2014) found that use of a token economy
       increased appropriate social behaviors and reduced inappropriate behaviors in a group of eight grade
       students. Similar studies show demonstrable gains on behavior and academic achievement for groups ranging
       from first grade to high school, and representing a wide array of abilities and disabilities. For example, during
       studies involving younger students, when children in the study exhibited appropriate behavior (not hitting or
       pinching), they received a "quiet hands" token. When they hit or pinched, they lost a token. The children could
       then exchange specified amounts of tokens for minutes of playtime.

Behavior Modification in Children

Parents and teachers often use behavior modification to change a child's behavior. Behavior modification uses
the principles of operant conditioning to accomplish behavior change so that undesirable behaviors are switched
for more socially acceptable ones. Some teachers and parents create a sticker chart, in which several behaviors
are listed (Figure 6.11). Sticker charts are a form of token economies, as described in the text. Each time children
perform the behavior, they get a sticker, and after a certain number of stickers, they get a prize, or reinforcer. The
goal is to increase acceptable behaviors and decrease misbehavior. Remember, it is best to reinforce desired
behaviors, rather than to use punishment. In the classroom, the teacher can reinforce a wide range of behaviors,
from students raising their hands, to walking quietly in the hall, to turning in their homework. At home, parents
might create a behavior chart that rewards children for things such as putting away toys, brushing their teeth,
and helping with dinner. In order for behavior modification to be effective, the reinforcement needs to be
connected with the behavior; the reinforcement must matter to the child and be done consistently.

FIGURE 6.11 Sticker charts are a form of positive reinforcement and a tool for behavior modification. Once this
child earns a certain number of stickers for demonstrating a desired behavior, she will be rewarded with a trip to
the ice cream parlor. (credit: Abigail Batchelder)
Time-out is another popular technique used in behavior modification with children. It operates on the principle of
negative punishment. When a child demonstrates an undesirable behavior, they are removed from the desirable
activity at hand (Figure 6.12). For example, say that Sophia and her brother Mario are playing with building
blocks. Sophia throws some blocks at her brother, so you give her a warning that she will go to time-out if she
does it again. A few minutes later, she throws more blocks at Mario. You remove Sophia from the room for a few
minutes. When she comes back, she doesn't throw blocks.
There are several important points that you should know if you plan to implement time-out as a behavior
modification technique. First, make sure the child is being removed from a desirable activity and placed in a less
desirable location. If the activity is something undesirable for the child, this technique will backfire because it is
more enjoyable for the child to be removed from the activity. Second, the length of the time-out is important. The
general rule of thumb is one minute for each year of the child's age. Sophia is five; therefore, she sits in a time-
out for five minutes. Setting a timer helps children know how long they have to sit in time-out. Finally, as a
caregiver, keep several guidelines in mind over the course of a time-out: remain calm when directing your child to
time-out; ignore your child during time-out (because caregiver attention may reinforce misbehavior); and give the
child a hug or a kind word when time-out is over.

         child might be playing on the playground with friends and push another child; (b) the child who misbehaved
         would then be removed from the activity for a short period of time. (credit a: modification of work by Simone

      Reinforcement Schedules

       Remember, the best way to teach a person or animal a behavior is to use positive reinforcement. For example,
       Skinner used positive reinforcement to teach rats to press a lever in a Skinner box. At first, the rat might
       randomly hit the lever while exploring the box, and out would come a pellet of food. After eating the pellet,
       what do you think the hungry rat did next? It hit the lever again, and received another pellet of food. Each time
       the rat hit the lever, a pellet of food came out. When an organism receives a reinforcer each time it displays a
       behavior, it is called continuous reinforcement. This reinforcement schedule is the quickest way to teach
       someone a behavior, and it is especially effective in training a new behavior. Let's look back at the dog that was
       learning to sit earlier in the chapter. Now, each time he sits, you give him a treat. Timing is important here: you
       will be most successful if you present the reinforcer immediately after he sits, so that he can make an
       association between the target behavior (sitting) and the consequence (getting a treat).

       Once a behavior is trained, researchers and trainers often turn to another type of reinforcement
       schedule--partial reinforcement. In partial reinforcement, also referred to as intermittent reinforcement, the
       person or animal does not get reinforced every time they perform the desired behavior. There are several
       different types of partial reinforcement schedules (Table 6.3). These schedules are described as either fixed or
       variable, and as either interval or ratio. Fixed refers to the number of responses between reinforcements, or
       the amount of time between reinforcements, which is set and unchanging. Variable refers to the number of
       responses or amount of time between reinforcements, which varies or changes. Interval means the schedule is
       based on the time between reinforcements, and ratio means the schedule is based on the number of responses
       between reinforcements.

Now let's combine these four terms. A fixed interval reinforcement schedule is when behavior is rewarded
after a set amount of time. For example, June undergoes major surgery in a hospital. During recovery, they are
expected to experience pain and will require prescription medications for pain relief. June is given an IV drip
with a patient-controlled painkiller. Their doctor sets a limit: one dose per hour. June pushes a button when
pain becomes difficult, and they receive a dose of medication. Since the reward (pain relief) only occurs on a
fixed interval, there is no point in exhibiting the behavior when it will not be rewarded.

With a variable interval reinforcement schedule, the person or animal gets the reinforcement based on
varying amounts of time, which are unpredictable. Say that Manuel is the manager at a fast-food restaurant.
Every once in a while someone from the quality control division comes to Manuel's restaurant. If the restaurant
is clean and the service is fast, everyone on that shift earns a $20 bonus. Manuel never knows when the quality
control person will show up, so he always tries to keep the restaurant clean and ensures that his employees
provide prompt and courteous service. His productivity regarding prompt service and keeping a clean
restaurant are steady because he wants his crew to earn the bonus.

With a fixed ratio reinforcement schedule, there are a set number of responses that must occur before the
behavior is rewarded. Carla sells glasses at an eyeglass store, and she earns a commission every time she sells
a pair of glasses. She always tries to sell people more pairs of glasses, including prescription sunglasses or a
backup pair, so she can increase her commission. She does not care if the person really needs the prescription
sunglasses, Carla just wants her bonus. The quality of what Carla sells does not matter because her
commission is not based on quality; it's only based on the number of pairs sold. This distinction in the quality
of performance can help determine which reinforcement method is most appropriate for a particular
situation. Fixed ratios are better suited to optimize the quantity of output, whereas a fixed interval, in which
the reward is not quantity based, can lead to a higher quality of output.

In a variable ratio reinforcement schedule, the number of responses needed for a reward varies. This is the
most powerful partial reinforcement schedule. An example of the variable ratio reinforcement schedule is
200 6 · Learning

       gambling. Imagine that Sarah--generally a smart, thrifty woman--visits Las Vegas for the first time. She is not a
       gambler, but out of curiosity she puts a quarter into the slot machine, and then another, and another. Nothing
       happens. Two dollars in quarters later, her curiosity is fading, and she is just about to quit. But then, the
       machine lights up, bells go off, and Sarah gets 50 quarters back. That's more like it! Sarah gets back to
       inserting quarters with renewed interest, and a few minutes later she has used up all her gains and is $10 in
       the hole. Now might be a sensible time to quit. And yet, she keeps putting money into the slot machine because
       she never knows when the next reinforcement is coming. She keeps thinking that with the next quarter she
       could win $50, or $100, or even more. Because the reinforcement schedule in most types of gambling has a
       variable ratio schedule, people keep trying and hoping that the next time they will win big. This is one of the
       reasons that gambling is so addictive--and so resistant to extinction.
       In operant conditioning, extinction of a reinforced behavior occurs at some point after reinforcement stops,
       and the speed at which this happens depends on the reinforcement schedule. In a variable ratio schedule, the
       point of extinction comes very slowly, as described above. But in the other reinforcement schedules, extinction
       may come quickly. For example, if June presses the button for the pain relief medication before the allotted
       time the doctor has approved, no medication is administered. They are on a fixed interval reinforcement
       schedule (dosed hourly), so extinction occurs quickly when reinforcement doesn't come at the expected time.
       Among the reinforcement schedules, variable ratio is the most productive and the most resistant to extinction.
       Fixed interval is the least productive and the easiest to extinguish (Figure 6.13).

       FIGURE 6.13 The four reinforcement schedules yield different response patterns. The variable ratio schedule is
       unpredictable and yields high and steady response rates, with little if any pause after reinforcement (e.g., gambler).
       A fixed ratio schedule is predictable and produces a high response rate, with a short pause after reinforcement (e.g.,
       eyeglass saleswoman). The variable interval schedule is unpredictable and produces a moderate, steady response
       rate (e.g., restaurant manager). The fixed interval schedule yields a scallop-shaped response pattern, reflecting a
       significant pause after reinforcement (e.g., surgery patient).

                CONNECT THE CONCEPTS
      Gambling and the Brain

       Skinner (1953) stated, "If the gambling establishment cannot persuade a patron to turn over money with no return,
       it may achieve the same effect by returning part of the patron's money on a variable-ratio schedule" (p. 397).
       Skinner uses gambling as an example of the power of the variable-ratio reinforcement schedule for maintaining
       behavior even during long periods without any reinforcement. In fact, Skinner was so confident in his knowledge of
       gambling addiction that he even claimed he could turn a pigeon into a pathological gambler ("Skinner's Utopia,"
       1971). It is indeed true that variable-ratio schedules keep behavior quite persistent--just imagine the frequency of a
       child's tantrums if a parent gives in even once to the behavior. The occasional reward makes it almost impossible to
       stop the behavior.
       Recent research in rats has failed to support Skinner's idea that training on variable-ratio schedules alone causes

pathological gambling (Laskowski et al., 2019). However, other research suggests that gambling does seem to work
on the brain in the same way as most addictive drugs, and so there may be some combination of brain chemistry
and reinforcement schedule that could lead to problem gambling (Figure 6.14). Specifically, modern research shows
the connection between gambling and the activation of the reward centers of the brain that use the
neurotransmitter (brain chemical) dopamine (Murch & Clark, 2016). Interestingly, gamblers don't even have to win
to experience the "rush" of dopamine in the brain. "Near misses," or almost winning but not actually winning, also
have been shown to increase activity in the ventral striatum and other brain reward centers that use dopamine
(Chase & Clark, 2010). These brain effects are almost identical to those produced by addictive drugs like cocaine
and heroin (Murch & Clark, 2016). Based on the neuroscientific evidence showing these similarities, the DSM-5 now
considers gambling an addiction, while earlier versions of the DSM classified gambling as an impulse control
disorder.

FIGURE 6.14 Some research suggests that pathological gamblers use gambling to compensate for abnormally low
levels of the hormone norepinephrine, which is associated with stress and is secreted in moments of arousal and
thrill. (credit: Ted Murphy)
In addition to dopamine, gambling also appears to involve other neurotransmitters, including norepinephrine and
serotonin (Potenza, 2013). Norepinephrine is secreted when a person feels stress, arousal, or thrill. It may be that
pathological gamblers use gambling to increase their levels of this neurotransmitter. Deficiencies in serotonin might
also contribute to compulsive behavior, including a gambling addiction (Potenza, 2013).
It may be that pathological gamblers' brains are different than those of other people, and perhaps this difference
may somehow have led to their gambling addiction, as these studies seem to suggest. However, it is very difficult to
ascertain the cause because it is impossible to conduct a true experiment (it would be unethical to try to turn
randomly assigned participants into problem gamblers). Therefore, it may be that causation actually moves in the
opposite direction--perhaps the act of gambling somehow changes neurotransmitter levels in some gamblers'
brains. It also is possible that some overlooked factor, or confounding variable, played a role in both the gambling
addiction and the differences in brain chemistry.

Cognition and Latent Learning

Strict behaviorists like Watson and Skinner focused exclusively on studying behavior rather than cognition
(such as thoughts and expectations). In fact, Skinner was such a staunch believer that cognition didn't matter
that his ideas were considered radical behaviorism. Skinner considered the mind a "black box"--something
completely unknowable--and, therefore, something not to be studied. However, another behaviorist, Edward C.
Tolman, had a different opinion. Tolman's experiments with rats demonstrated that organisms can learn even
if they do not receive immediate reinforcement (Tolman & Honzik, 1930; Tolman, Ritchie, & Kalish, 1946). This
finding was in conflict with the prevailing idea at the time that reinforcement must be immediate in order for
learning to occur, thus suggesting a cognitive aspect to learning.
202 6 · Learning

       In the experiments, Tolman placed hungry rats in a maze with no reward for finding their way through it. He
       also studied a comparison group that was rewarded with food at the end of the maze. As the unreinforced rats
       explored the maze, they developed a cognitive map: a mental picture of the layout of the maze (Figure 6.15).
       After 10 sessions in the maze without reinforcement, food was placed in a goal box at the end of the maze. As
       soon as the rats became aware of the food, they were able to find their way through the maze quickly, just as
       quickly as the comparison group, which had been rewarded with food all along. This is known as latent
       learning: learning that occurs but is not observable in behavior until there is a reason to demonstrate it.

       FIGURE 6.15 Psychologist Edward Tolman found that rats use cognitive maps to navigate through a maze. Have you
       ever worked your way through various levels on a video game? You learned when to turn left or right, move up or
       down. In that case you were relying on a cognitive map, just like the rats in a maze. (credit: modification of work by
       "FutUndBeidl"/Flickr)
       Latent learning also occurs in humans. Children may learn by watching the actions of their parents but only
       demonstrate it at a later date, when the learned material is needed. For example, suppose that Ravi's dad
       drives him to school every day. In this way, Ravi learns the route from his house to his school, but he's never
       driven there himself, so he has not had a chance to demonstrate that he's learned the way. One morning Ravi's
       dad has to leave early for a meeting, so he can't drive Ravi to school. Instead, Ravi follows the same route on his
       bike that his dad would have taken in the car. This demonstrates latent learning. Ravi had learned the route to
       school, but had no need to demonstrate this knowledge earlier.

  Whenever we go someplace new, we build a mental representation--or cognitive map--of the location, as
  Tolman's rats built a cognitive map of their maze. However, some buildings are confusing because they include
  many areas that look alike or have short lines of sight. Because of this, it's often difficult to predict what's around
  a corner or decide whether to turn left or right to get out of a building. Psychologist Laura Carlson (2010)
  suggests that what we place in our cognitive map can impact our success in navigating through the environment.
  She suggests that paying attention to specific features upon entering a building, such as a picture on the wall, a
  fountain, a statue, or an escalator, adds information to our cognitive map that can be used later to help find our
  way out of the building.

6.4 Observational Learning (Modeling)

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Define observational learning
  · Discuss the steps in the modeling process
  · Explain the prosocial and antisocial effects of observational learning
Previous sections of this chapter focused on classical and operant conditioning, which are forms of associative
learning. In observational learning, we learn by watching others and then imitating, or modeling, what they
do or say. For instance, have you ever gone to YouTube to find a video showing you how to do something? The
individuals performing the imitated behavior are called models. Research suggests that this imitative learning
involves a specific type of neuron, called a mirror neuron (Hickock, 2010; Rizzolatti, Fadiga, Fogassi, & Gallese,
2002; Rizzolatti, Fogassi, & Gallese, 2006).
Humans and other animals are capable of observational learning. For example, in a study of social learning in
chimpanzees, researchers gave juice boxes with straws to two groups of captive chimpanzees. The first group
dipped the straw into the juice box, and then sucked on the small amount of juice at the end of the straw. The
second group sucked through the straw directly, getting much more juice. When the first group, the "dippers,"
observed the second group, "the suckers," what do you think happened? All of the "dippers" in the first group
switched to sucking through the straws directly. By simply observing the other chimps and modeling their
behavior, they learned that this was a more efficient method of getting juice (Yamamoto, Humle, and Tanaka,
2013).

       Imitation is sometimes called the highest form of flattery. But consider Claire's experience with observational
       learning. Claire's nine-year-old son, Jay, was getting into trouble at school and was defiant at home. Claire
       feared that Jay would end up like her brothers, two of whom were in prison. One day, after yet another bad day
       at school and another negative note from the teacher, Claire, at her wit's end, beat her son with a belt to get him
       to behave. Later that night, as she put her children to bed, Claire witnessed her four-year-old daughter, Anna,

       Like Tolman, whose experiments with rats suggested a cognitive component to learning, psychologist Albert
       Bandura's ideas about learning were different from those of strict behaviorists. Bandura and other researchers
       proposed a brand of behaviorism called social learning theory, which took cognitive processes into account.
       According to Bandura, pure behaviorism could not explain why learning can take place in the absence of
       external reinforcement. He felt that internal mental states must also have a role in learning and that
       observational learning involves much more than imitation. In imitation, a person simply copies what the
       model does. Observational learning is much more complex. According to Lefrançois (2012) there are several
       ways that observational learning can occur:
        1. You learn a new response. After watching your coworker get chewed out by your boss for coming in late,

             you start leaving home 10 minutes earlier so that you won't be late.
        2. You choose whether or not to imitate the model depending on what you saw happen to the model.

             Remember Julian and his father? When learning to surf, Julian might watch how his father pops up
             successfully on his surfboard and then attempt to do the same thing. On the other hand, Julian might learn
             not to touch a hot stove after watching his father get burned on a stove.
        3. You learn a general rule that you can apply to other situations.
       Bandura identified three kinds of models: live, verbal, and symbolic. A live model demonstrates a behavior in
       person, as when Ben stood up on his surfboard so that Julian could see how he did it. A verbal instructional
       model does not perform the behavior, but instead explains or describes the behavior, as when a soccer coach
       tells his young players to kick the ball with the side of the foot, not with the toe. A symbolic model can be
       fictional characters or real people who demonstrate behaviors in books, movies, television shows, video
       games, or Internet sources (Figure 6.17).

Latent learning and modeling are used all the time in the world of marketing and advertising. This Ford
commercial starring Derek Jeter (http://openstax.org/l/jeter) played for months across the New York, New
Jersey, and Connecticut areas. Jeter was an award-winning baseball player for the New York Yankees. The
commercial aired in a part of the country where Jeter is an incredibly well-known athlete. He is wealthy, and
considered very loyal and good looking. What message are the advertisers sending by having him featured in
the ad? How effective do you think it is?

Steps in the Modeling Process

Of course, we don't learn a behavior simply by observing a model. Bandura described specific steps in the
process of modeling that must be followed if learning is to be successful: attention, retention, reproduction,
and motivation. First, you must be focused on what the model is doing--you have to pay attention. Next, you
must be able to retain, or remember, what you observed; this is retention. Then, you must be able to perform
the behavior that you observed and committed to memory; this is reproduction. Finally, you must have
motivation. You need to want to copy the behavior, and whether or not you are motivated depends on what
happened to the model. If you saw that the model was reinforced for their behavior, you will be more motivated
to copy them. This is known as vicarious reinforcement. On the other hand, if you observed the model being
punished, you would be less motivated to copy them. This is called vicarious punishment. For example,
imagine that four-year-old Allison watched her older sister Kaitlyn playing in their mother's makeup, and then
saw Kaitlyn get a time out when their mother came in. After their mother left the room, Allison was tempted to
play in the make-up, but she did not want to get a time-out from her mother. What do you think she did? Once
you actually demonstrate the new behavior, the reinforcement you receive plays a part in whether or not you
will repeat the behavior.

Bandura researched modeling behavior, particularly children's modeling of adults' aggressive and violent
behaviors (Bandura, Ross, & Ross, 1961). He conducted an experiment with a five-foot inflatable doll that he
called a Bobo doll. In the experiment, children's aggressive behavior was influenced by whether the teacher
was punished for her behavior. In one scenario, a teacher acted aggressively with the doll, hitting, throwing,
and even punching the doll, while a child watched. There were two types of responses by the children to the
teacher's behavior. When the teacher was punished for her bad behavior, the children decreased their
tendency to act as she had. When the teacher was praised or ignored (and not punished for her behavior), the
children imitated what she did, and even what she said. They punched, kicked, and yelled at the doll.

Watch this video clip about the famous Bobo doll experiment (http://openstax.org/l/bobodoll) to see a portion
of the experiment and an interview with Albert Bandura.

What are the implications of this study? Bandura concluded that we watch and learn, and that this learning can
have both prosocial and antisocial effects. Prosocial (positive) models can be used to encourage socially
acceptable behavior. Parents in particular should take note of this finding. If you want your children to read,
then read to them. Let them see you reading. Keep books in your home. Talk about your favorite books. If you
want your children to be healthy, then let them see you eat right and exercise, and spend time engaging in
physical fitness activities together. The same holds true for qualities like kindness, courtesy, and honesty. The
main idea is that children observe and learn from their parents, even their parents' morals, so be consistent
and toss out the old adage "Do as I say, not as I do," because children tend to copy what you do instead of what
you say. Besides parents, many public figures, such as Martin Luther King, Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi, are
viewed as prosocial models who are able to inspire global social change. Can you think of someone who has
206 6 · Learning

       been a prosocial model in your life?
       The antisocial effects of observational learning are also worth mentioning. As you saw from the example of
       Claire at the beginning of this section, her daughter viewed Claire's aggressive behavior and copied it.
       Research suggests that this may help to explain why victims of abuse often grow up to be abusers themselves
       (Murrell, Christoff, & Henning, 2007). In fact, about 30% of child abuse victims become abusive parents (U.S.
       Department of Health & Human Services, 2013). We tend to do what we know. Children who grow up
       witnessing their parents deal with anger and frustration through violent and aggressive acts often learn to
       behave in that manner themselves.
       Some studies suggest that violent television shows, movies, and video games may also have antisocial effects
       (Figure 6.18) although further research needs to be done to understand the correlational and causational
       aspects of media violence and behavior. Some studies have found a link between viewing violence and
       aggression seen in children (Anderson & Gentile, 2008; Kirsch, 2010; Miller, Grabell, Thomas, Bermann, &
       Graham-Bermann, 2012). These findings may not be surprising, given that a child graduating from high school
       has been exposed to around 200,000 violent acts including murder, robbery, torture, bombings, beatings, and
       rape through various forms of media (Huston et al., 1992). Not only might viewing media violence affect
       aggressive behavior by teaching people to act that way in real life situations, but it has also been suggested that
       repeated exposure to violent acts also desensitizes people to it. Psychologists are working to understand this
       dynamic.

        Violent Media and Aggression

         Does watching violent media or playing violent video games cause aggression? Albert Bandura's early studies
         suggested television violence increased aggression in children, and more recent studies support these findings.
         For example, research by Craig Anderson and colleagues (Anderson, Bushman, Donnerstein, Hummer, &
         Warburton, 2015; Anderson et al., 2010; Bushman et al., 2016) found extensive evidence to suggest a causal
         link between hours of exposure to violent media and aggressive thoughts and behaviors. However, studies by
         Christopher Ferguson and others suggests that while there may be a link between violent media exposure and
         aggression, research to date has not accounted for other risk factors for aggression including mental health and
         family life (Ferguson, 2011; Gentile, 2016). What do think?

Summary

6.1 What Is Learning?

Instincts and reflexes are innate behaviors--they occur naturally and do not involve learning. In contrast,
learning is a change in behavior or knowledge that results from experience. There are three main types of
learning: classical conditioning, operant conditioning, and observational learning. Both classical and operant
conditioning are forms of associative learning where associations are made between events that occur
together. Observational learning is just as it sounds: learning by observing others.

6.2 Classical Conditioning

Pavlov's pioneering work with dogs contributed greatly to what we know about learning. His experiments
explored the type of associative learning we now call classical conditioning. In classical conditioning,
organisms learn to associate events that repeatedly happen together, and researchers study how a reflexive
response to a stimulus can be mapped to a different stimulus--by training an association between the two
stimuli. Pavlov's experiments show how stimulus-response bonds are formed. Watson, the founder of
behaviorism, was greatly influenced by Pavlov's work. He tested humans by conditioning fear in an infant
known as Little Albert. His findings suggest that classical conditioning can explain how some fears develop.

6.3 Operant Conditioning

Operant conditioning is based on the work of B. F. Skinner. Operant conditioning is a form of learning in which
the motivation for a behavior happens after the behavior is demonstrated. An animal or a human receives a
consequence after performing a specific behavior. The consequence is either a reinforcer or a punisher. All
reinforcement (positive or negative) increases the likelihood of a behavioral response. All punishment
(positive or negative) decreases the likelihood of a behavioral response. Several types of reinforcement
schedules are used to reward behavior depending on either a set or variable period of time.

6.4 Observational Learning (Modeling)

According to Bandura, learning can occur by watching others and then modeling what they do or say. This is
known as observational learning. There are specific steps in the process of modeling that must be followed if
learning is to be successful. These steps include attention, retention, reproduction, and motivation. Through
modeling, Bandura has shown that children learn many things both good and bad simply by watching their
parents, siblings, and others.

INTRODUCTION What is the best way to solve a problem? How does a person who has never seen or touched
snow in real life develop an understanding of the concept of snow? How do young children acquire the ability
to learn language with no formal instruction? Psychologists who study thinking explore questions like these
and are called cognitive psychologists.

Cognitive psychologists also study intelligence. What is intelligence, and how does it vary from person to
person? Are "street smarts" a kind of intelligence, and if so, how do they relate to other types of intelligence?
What does an IQ test really measure? These questions and more will be explored in this chapter as you study
thinking and intelligence.

In other chapters, we discussed the cognitive processes of perception, learning, and memory. In this chapter,
we will focus on high-level cognitive processes. As a part of this discussion, we will consider thinking and
briefly explore the development and use of language. We will also discuss problem solving and creativity
before ending with a discussion of how intelligence is measured and how our biology and environments
interact to affect intelligence. After finishing this chapter, you will have a greater appreciation of the higher-
level cognitive processes that contribute to our distinctiveness as a species.

     7.1 What Is Cognition?

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe cognition
         · Distinguish concepts and prototypes
         · Explain the difference between natural and artificial concepts
         · Describe how schemata are organized and constructed
       Imagine all of your thoughts as if they were physical entities, swirling rapidly inside your mind. How is it
       possible that the brain is able to move from one thought to the next in an organized, orderly fashion? The brain
       is endlessly perceiving, processing, planning, organizing, and remembering--it is always active. Yet, you don't
       notice most of your brain's activity as you move throughout your daily routine. This is only one facet of the
       complex processes involved in cognition. Simply put, cognition is thinking, and it encompasses the processes
       associated with perception, knowledge, problem solving, judgment, language, and memory. Scientists who
       study cognition are searching for ways to understand how we integrate, organize, and utilize our conscious
       cognitive experiences without being aware of all of the unconscious work that our brains are doing (for
       example, Kahneman, 2011).

      Cognition

       Upon waking each morning, you begin thinking--contemplating the tasks that you must complete that day. In
       what order should you run your errands? Should you go to the bank, the cleaners, or the grocery store first?
       Can you get these things done before you head to class or will they need to wait until school is done? These
       thoughts are one example of cognition at work. Exceptionally complex, cognition is an essential feature of
       human consciousness, yet not all aspects of cognition are consciously experienced.
       Cognitive psychology is the field of psychology dedicated to examining how people think. It attempts to
       explain how and why we think the way we do by studying the interactions among human thinking, emotion,
       creativity, language, and problem solving, in addition to other cognitive processes. Cognitive psychologists
       strive to determine and measure different types of intelligence, why some people are better at problem solving
       than others, and how emotional intelligence affects success in the workplace, among countless other topics.
       They also sometimes focus on how we organize thoughts and information gathered from our environments
       into meaningful categories of thought, which will be discussed later.

      Concepts and Prototypes

       The human nervous system is capable of handling endless streams of information. The senses serve as the
       interface between the mind and the external environment, receiving stimuli and translating it into nervous
       impulses that are transmitted to the brain. The brain then processes this information and uses the relevant
       pieces to create thoughts, which can then be expressed through language or stored in memory for future use.
       To make this process more complex, the brain does not gather information from external environments only.
       When thoughts are formed, the mind synthesizes information from emotions and memories (Figure 7.2).
       Emotion and memory are powerful influences on both our thoughts and behaviors.

In order to organize this staggering amount of information, the mind has developed a "file cabinet" of sorts in
the mind. The different files stored in the file cabinet are called concepts. Concepts are categories or groupings
of linguistic information, images, ideas, or memories, such as life experiences. Concepts are, in many ways, big
ideas that are generated by observing details, and categorizing and combining these details into cognitive
structures. You use concepts to see the relationships among the different elements of your experiences and to
keep the information in your mind organized and accessible.
Concepts are informed by our semantic memory (you will learn more about semantic memory in a later
chapter) and are present in every aspect of our lives; however, one of the easiest places to notice concepts is
inside a classroom, where they are discussed explicitly. When you study United States history, for example, you
learn about more than just individual events that have happened in America's past. You absorb a large quantity
of information by listening to and participating in discussions, examining maps, and reading first-hand
accounts of people's lives. Your brain analyzes these details and develops an overall understanding of
American history. In the process, your brain gathers details that inform and refine your understanding of
related concepts like democracy, power, and freedom.
Concepts can be complex and abstract, like justice, or more concrete, like types of birds. In psychology, for
example, Piaget's stages of development are abstract concepts. Some concepts, like tolerance, are agreed upon
by many people, because they have been used in various ways over many years. Other concepts, like the
characteristics of your ideal friend or your family's birthday traditions, are personal and individualized. In this
way, concepts touch every aspect of our lives, from our many daily routines to the guiding principles behind
the way governments function.
Another technique used by your brain to organize information is the identification of prototypes for the
concepts you have developed. A prototype is the best example or representation of a concept. For example,
what comes to your mind when you think of a dog? Most likely your early experiences with dogs will shape
what you imagine. If your first pet was a Golden Retriever, there is a good chance that this would be your
prototype for the category of dogs.

Natural and Artificial Concepts

In psychology, concepts can be divided into two categories, natural and artificial. Natural concepts are created
"naturally" through your experiences and can be developed from either direct or indirect experiences. For
example, if you live in Essex Junction, Vermont, you have probably had a lot of direct experience with snow.
You've watched it fall from the sky, you've seen lightly falling snow that barely covers the windshield of your
car, and you've shoveled out 18 inches of fluffy white snow as you've thought, "This is perfect for skiing."
216 7 · Thinking and Intelligence

       You've thrown snowballs at your best friend and gone sledding down the steepest hill in town. In short, you
       know snow. You know what it looks like, smells like, tastes like, and feels like. If, however, you've lived your
       whole life on the island of Saint Vincent in the Caribbean, you may never have actually seen snow, much less
       tasted, smelled, or touched it. You know snow from the indirect experience of seeing pictures of falling
       snow--or from watching films that feature snow as part of the setting. Either way, snow is a natural concept
       because you can construct an understanding of it through direct observations, experiences with snow, or
       indirect knowledge (such as from films or books) (Figure 7.3).

       FIGURE 7.3 (a) Our concept of snow is an example of a natural concept--one that we understand through direct
       observation and experience. (b) In contrast, artificial concepts are ones that we know by a specific set of
       characteristics that they always exhibit, such as what defines different basic shapes. (credit a: modification of work
       by Maarten Takens; credit b: modification of work by "Shayan (USA)"/Flickr)
       An artificial concept, on the other hand, is a concept that is defined by a specific set of characteristics. Various
       properties of geometric shapes, like squares and triangles, serve as useful examples of artificial concepts. A
       triangle always has three angles and three sides. A square always has four equal sides and four right angles.
       Mathematical formulas, like the equation for area (length × width) are artificial concepts defined by specific
       sets of characteristics that are always the same. Artificial concepts can enhance the understanding of a topic
       by building on one another. For example, before learning the concept of "area of a square" (and the formula to
       find it), you must understand what a square is. Once the concept of "area of a square" is understood, an
       understanding of area for other geometric shapes can be built upon the original understanding of area. The
       use of artificial concepts to define an idea is crucial to communicating with others and engaging in complex
       thought. According to Goldstone and Kersten (2003), concepts act as building blocks and can be connected in
       countless combinations to create complex thoughts.

      Schemata

       A schema is a mental construct consisting of a cluster or collection of related concepts (Bartlett, 1932). There
       are many different types of schemata, and they all have one thing in common: schemata are a method of
       organizing information that allows the brain to work more efficiently. When a schema is activated, the brain
       makes immediate assumptions about the person or object being observed.
       There are several types of schemata. A role schema makes assumptions about how individuals in certain roles
       will behave (Callero, 1994). For example, imagine you meet someone who introduces himself as a firefighter.
       When this happens, your brain automatically activates the "firefighter schema" and begins making
       assumptions that this person is brave, selfless, and community-oriented. Despite not knowing this person,
       already you have unknowingly made judgments about them. Schemata also help you fill in gaps in the
       information you receive from the world around you. While schemata allow for more efficient information
       processing, there can be problems with schemata, regardless of whether they are accurate: Perhaps this
       particular firefighter is not brave, they just work as a firefighter to pay the bills while studying to become a
       children's librarian.

An event schema, also known as a cognitive script, is a set of behaviors that can feel like a routine. Think
about what you do when you walk into an elevator (Figure 7.4). First, the doors open and you wait to let exiting
passengers leave the elevator car. Then, you step into the elevator and turn around to face the doors, looking
for the correct button to push. You never face the back of the elevator, do you? And when you're riding in a
crowded elevator and you can't face the front, it feels uncomfortable, doesn't it? Interestingly, event schemata
can vary widely among different cultures and countries. For example, while it is quite common for people to
greet one another with a handshake in the United States, in Tibet, you greet someone by sticking your tongue
out at them, and in Belize, you bump fists (Cairns Regional Council, n.d.)

          FIGURE 7.4 What event schema do you perform when riding in an elevator? (credit: "Gideon"/Flickr)
Because event schemata are automatic, they can be difficult to change. Imagine that you are driving home from
work or school. This event schema involves getting in the car, shutting the door, and buckling your seatbelt
before putting the key in the ignition. You might perform this script two or three times each day. As you drive
home, you hear your phone's ring tone. Typically, the event schema that occurs when you hear your phone
ringing involves locating the phone and answering it or responding to your latest text message. So without
thinking, you reach for your phone, which could be in your pocket, in your bag, or on the passenger seat of the
car. This powerful event schema is informed by your pattern of behavior and the pleasurable stimulation that a
phone call or text message gives your brain. Because it is a schema, it is extremely challenging for us to stop
reaching for the phone, even though we know that we endanger our own lives and the lives of others while we
do it (Neyfakh, 2013) (Figure 7.5).

       FIGURE 7.5 Texting while driving is dangerous, but it is a difficult event schema for some people to resist.
Remember the elevator? It feels almost impossible to walk in and not face the door. Our powerful event schema
dictates our behavior in the elevator, and it is no different with our phones. Current research suggests that it is
the habit, or event schema, of checking our phones in many different situations that makes refraining from
checking them while driving especially difficult (Bayer & Campbell, 2012). Because texting and driving has
become a dangerous epidemic in recent years, psychologists are looking at ways to help people interrupt the
"phone schema" while driving. Event schemata like these are the reason why many habits are difficult to break
once they have been acquired. As we continue to examine thinking, keep in mind how powerful the forces of
concepts and schemata are to our understanding of the world.

     7.2 Language

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Define language and demonstrate familiarity with the components of language
         · Understand the development of language
         · Explain the relationship between language and thinking

       Language is a communication system that involves using words and systematic rules to organize those words
       to transmit information from one individual to another. While language is a form of communication, not all
       communication is language. Many species communicate with one another through their postures, movements,
       odors, or vocalizations. This communication is crucial for species that need to interact and develop social
       relationships with their conspecifics. However, many people have asserted that it is language that makes
       humans unique among all of the animal species (Corballis & Suddendorf, 2007; Tomasello & Rakoczy, 2003).
       This section will focus on what distinguishes language as a special form of communication, how the use of
       language develops, and how language affects the way we think.

      Components of Language

       Language, be it spoken, signed, or written, has specific components: a lexicon and grammar. Lexicon refers to
       the words of a given language. Thus, lexicon is a language's vocabulary. Grammar refers to the set of rules that
       are used to convey meaning through the use of the lexicon (Fernández & Cairns, 2011). For instance, English
       grammar dictates that most verbs receive an "-ed" at the end to indicate past tense.

       Words are formed by combining the various phonemes that make up the language. A phoneme (e.g., the
       sounds "ah" vs. "eh") is a basic sound unit of a given language, and different languages have different sets of
       phonemes. Phonemes are combined to form morphemes, which are the smallest units of language that convey
       some type of meaning (e.g., "I" is both a phoneme and a morpheme). We use semantics and syntax to construct
       language. Semantics and syntax are part of a language's grammar. Semantics refers to the process by which
       we derive meaning from morphemes and words. Syntax refers to the way words are organized into sentences
       (Chomsky, 1965; Fernández & Cairns, 2011).

       We apply the rules of grammar to organize the lexicon in novel and creative ways, which allow us to
       communicate information about both concrete and abstract concepts. We can talk about our immediate and
       observable surroundings as well as the surface of unseen planets. We can share our innermost thoughts, our
       plans for the future, and debate the value of a college education. We can provide detailed instructions for
       cooking a meal, fixing a car, or building a fire. Through our use of words and language, we are able to form,
       organize, and express ideas, schema, and artificial concepts.

      Language Development

       Given the remarkable complexity of a language, one might expect that mastering a language would be an
       especially arduous task; indeed, for those of us trying to learn a second language as adults, this might seem to
       be true. However, young children master language very quickly with relative ease. B. F. Skinner (1957)
       proposed that language is learned through reinforcement. Noam Chomsky (1965) criticized this behaviorist
       approach, asserting instead that the mechanisms underlying language acquisition are biologically
       determined. The use of language develops in the absence of formal instruction and appears to follow a very
       similar pattern in children from vastly different cultures and backgrounds. It would seem, therefore, that we
       are born with a biological predisposition to acquire a language (Chomsky, 1965; Fernández & Cairns, 2011).
       Moreover, it appears that there is a critical period for language acquisition, such that this proficiency at
       acquiring language is maximal early in life; generally, as people age, the ease with which they acquire and
       master new languages diminishes (Johnson & Newport, 1989; Lenneberg, 1967; Singleton, 1995).

       Children begin to learn about language from a very early age (Table 7.1). In fact, it appears that this is

occurring even before we are born. Newborns show preference for their mother's voice and appear to be able
to discriminate between the language spoken by their mother and other languages. Babies are also attuned to
the languages being used around them and show preferences for videos of faces that are moving in synchrony
with the audio of spoken language versus videos that do not synchronize with the audio (Blossom & Morgan,
2006; Pickens, 1994; Spelke & Cortelyou, 1981).

The Case of Genie

In the fall of 1970, a social worker in the Los Angeles area found a 13-year-old girl who was being raised in
extremely neglectful and abusive conditions. The girl, who came to be known as Genie, had lived most of her life
tied to a potty chair or confined to a crib in a small room that was kept closed with the curtains drawn. For a little
over a decade, Genie had virtually no social interaction and no access to the outside world. As a result of these
conditions, Genie was unable to stand up, chew solid food, or speak (Fromkin, Krashen, Curtiss, Rigler, & Rigler,
1974; Rymer, 1993). The police took Genie into protective custody.

Genie's abilities improved dramatically following her removal from her abusive environment, and early on, it
appeared she was acquiring language--much later than would be predicted by critical period hypotheses that
had been posited at the time (Fromkin et al., 1974). Genie managed to amass an impressive vocabulary in a
relatively short amount of time. However, she never developed a mastery of the grammatical aspects of language
(Curtiss, 1981). Perhaps being deprived of the opportunity to learn language during a critical period impeded
Genie's ability to fully acquire and use language.

You may recall that each language has its own set of phonemes that are used to generate morphemes, words,
and so on. Babies can discriminate among the sounds that make up a language (for example, they can tell the
difference between the "s" in vision and the "ss" in fission); early on, they can differentiate between the sounds
of all human languages, even those that do not occur in the languages that are used in their environments.
However, by the time that they are about 1 year old, they can only discriminate among those phonemes that are
used in the language or languages in their environments (Jensen, 2011; Werker & Lalonde, 1988; Werker &
Tees, 1984).
220 7 · Thinking and Intelligence

           LINK TO LEARNING

       Watch this video about how babies lose the ability to discriminate among all possible human phonemes as they
       age (http://openstax.org/l/language) to learn more.

       After the first few months of life, babies enter what is known as the babbling stage, during which time they tend
       to produce single syllables that are repeated over and over. As time passes, more variations appear in the
       syllables that they produce. During this time, it is unlikely that the babies are trying to communicate; they are
       just as likely to babble when they are alone as when they are with their caregivers (Fernández & Cairns, 2011).
       Interestingly, babies who are raised in environments in which sign language is used will also begin to show
       babbling in the gestures of their hands during this stage (Petitto, Holowka, Sergio, Levy, & Ostry, 2004).

       Generally, a child's first word is uttered sometime between the ages of 1 year to 18 months, and for the next few
       months, the child will remain in the "one word" stage of language development. During this time, children
       know a number of words, but they only produce one-word utterances. The child's early vocabulary is limited to
       familiar objects or events, often nouns. Although children in this stage only make one-word utterances, these
       words often carry larger meaning (Fernández & Cairns, 2011). So, for example, a child saying "cookie" could be
       identifying a cookie or asking for a cookie.

       As a child's lexicon grows, they begin to utter simple sentences and to acquire new vocabulary at a very rapid
       pace. In addition, children begin to demonstrate a clear understanding of the specific rules that apply to their
       language(s). Even the mistakes that children sometimes make provide evidence of just how much they
       understand about those rules. This is sometimes seen in the form of overgeneralization. In this context,
       overgeneralization refers to an extension of a language rule to an exception to the rule. For example, in
       English, it is usually the case that an "s" is added to the end of a word to indicate plurality. For example, we
       speak of one dog versus two dogs. Young children will overgeneralize this rule to cases that are exceptions to
       the "add an s to the end of the word" rule and say things like "those two gooses" or "three mouses." Clearly, the
       rules of the language are understood, even if the exceptions to the rules are still being learned (Moskowitz,
       1978).

      Language and Thought

       When we speak one language, we agree that words are representations of ideas, people, places, and events. The
       given language that children learn is connected to their culture and surroundings. But can words themselves
       shape the way we think about things? Psychologists have long investigated the question of whether language
       shapes thoughts and actions, or whether our thoughts and beliefs shape our language. Two researchers,
       Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf, began this investigation in the 1940s. They wanted to understand how
       the language habits of a community encourage members of that community to interpret language in a
       particular manner (Sapir, 1941/1964). Sapir and Whorf proposed that language determines thought. For
       example, in some languages there are many different words for love. However, in English we use the word love
       for all types of love. Does this affect how we think about love depending on the language that we speak (Whorf,
       1956)? Researchers have since identified this view as too absolute, pointing out a lack of empiricism behind
       what Sapir and Whorf proposed (Abler, 2013; Boroditsky, 2011; van Troyer, 1994). Today, psychologists
       continue to study and debate the relationship between language and thought.

                                                                                                  WHAT DO YOU THINK?

        The Meaning of Language

         Think about what you know of other languages; perhaps you even speak multiple languages. Imagine for a
         moment that your closest friend fluently speaks more than one language. Do you think that friend thinks
         differently, depending on which language is being spoken? You may know a few words that are not translatable

  from their original language into English. For example, the Portuguese word saudade originated during the 15th
  century, when Portuguese sailors left home to explore the seas and travel to Africa or Asia. Those left behind
  described the emptiness and fondness they felt as saudade (Figure 7.6). The word came to express many
  meanings, including loss, nostalgia, yearning, warm memories, and hope. There is no single word in English that
  includes all of those emotions in a single description. Do words such as saudade indicate that different languages
  produce different patterns of thought in people? What do you think??

  FIGURE 7.6 These two works of art depict saudade. (a) Saudade de Nápoles, which is translated into "missing
  Naples," was painted by Bertha Worms in 1895. (b) Almeida Júnior painted Saudade in 1899.

Language may indeed influence the way that we think, an idea known as linguistic determinism. One recent
demonstration of this phenomenon involved differences in the way that English and Mandarin Chinese
speakers talk and think about time. English speakers tend to talk about time using terms that describe
changes along a horizontal dimension, for example, saying something like "I'm running behind schedule" or
"Don't get ahead of yourself." While Mandarin Chinese speakers also describe time in horizontal terms, it is not
uncommon to also use terms associated with a vertical arrangement. For example, the past might be described
as being "up" and the future as being "down." It turns out that these differences in language translate into
differences in performance on cognitive tests designed to measure how quickly an individual can recognize
temporal relationships. Specifically, when given a series of tasks with vertical priming, Mandarin Chinese
speakers were faster at recognizing temporal relationships between months. Indeed, Boroditsky (2001) sees
these results as suggesting that "habits in language encourage habits in thought" (p. 12).
One group of researchers who wanted to investigate how language influences thought compared how English
speakers and the Dani people of Papua New Guinea think and speak about color. The Dani have two words for
color: one word for light and one word for dark. In contrast, the English language has 11 color words.
Researchers hypothesized that the number of color terms could limit the ways that the Dani people
conceptualized color. However, the Dani were able to distinguish colors with the same ability as English
speakers, despite having fewer words at their disposal (Berlin & Kay, 1969). A recent review of research aimed
at determining how language might affect something like color perception suggests that language can
influence perceptual phenomena, especially in the left hemisphere of the brain. You may recall from earlier
chapters that the left hemisphere is associated with language for most people. However, the right (less
222 7 · Thinking and Intelligence

linguistic hemisphere) of the brain is less affected by linguistic influences on perception (Regier & Kay, 2009)

7.3 Problem Solving

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Describe problem solving strategies
  · Define algorithm and heuristic
  · Explain some common roadblocks to effective problem solving and decision making

People face problems every day--usually, multiple problems throughout the day. Sometimes these problems
are straightforward: To double a recipe for pizza dough, for example, all that is required is that each ingredient
in the recipe be doubled. Sometimes, however, the problems we encounter are more complex. For example,
say you have a work deadline, and you must mail a printed copy of a report to your supervisor by the end of the
business day. The report is time-sensitive and must be sent overnight. You finished the report last night, but
your printer will not work today. What should you do? First, you need to identify the problem and then apply a
strategy for solving the problem.

Problem-Solving Strategies

When you are presented with a problem--whether it is a complex mathematical problem or a broken printer,
how do you solve it? Before finding a solution to the problem, the problem must first be clearly identified. After
that, one of many problem solving strategies can be applied, hopefully resulting in a solution.

A problem-solving strategy is a plan of action used to find a solution. Different strategies have different action
plans associated with them (Table 7.2). For example, a well-known strategy is trial and error. The old adage,
"If at first you don't succeed, try, try again" describes trial and error. In terms of your broken printer, you could
try checking the ink levels, and if that doesn't work, you could check to make sure the paper tray isn't jammed.
Or maybe the printer isn't actually connected to your laptop. When using trial and error, you would continue to
try different solutions until you solved your problem. Although trial and error is not typically one of the most
time-efficient strategies, it is a commonly used one.

Another type of strategy is an algorithm. An algorithm is a problem-solving formula that provides you with
step-by-step instructions used to achieve a desired outcome (Kahneman, 2011). You can think of an algorithm
as a recipe with highly detailed instructions that produce the same result every time they are performed.
Algorithms are used frequently in our everyday lives, especially in computer science. When you run a search
on the Internet, search engines like Google use algorithms to decide which entries will appear first in your list
of results. Facebook also uses algorithms to decide which posts to display on your newsfeed. Can you identify
other situations in which algorithms are used?

A heuristic is another type of problem solving strategy. While an algorithm must be followed exactly to produce
a correct result, a heuristic is a general problem-solving framework (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). You can
think of these as mental shortcuts that are used to solve problems. A "rule of thumb" is an example of a
heuristic. Such a rule saves the person time and energy when making a decision, but despite its time-saving
characteristics, it is not always the best method for making a rational decision. Different types of heuristics are
used in different types of situations, but the impulse to use a heuristic occurs when one of five conditions is
met (Pratkanis, 1989):

  · When one is faced with too much information
  · When the time to make a decision is limited
  · When the decision to be made is unimportant
  · When there is access to very little information to use in making the decision
  · When an appropriate heuristic happens to come to mind in the same moment

Working backwards is a useful heuristic in which you begin solving the problem by focusing on the end
result. Consider this example: You live in Washington, D.C. and have been invited to a wedding at 4 PM on
Saturday in Philadelphia. Knowing that Interstate 95 tends to back up any day of the week, you need to plan
your route and time your departure accordingly. If you want to be at the wedding service by 3:30 PM, and it
takes 2.5 hours to get to Philadelphia without traffic, what time should you leave your house? You use the
working backwards heuristic to plan the events of your day on a regular basis, probably without even thinking
about it.

Another useful heuristic is the practice of accomplishing a large goal or task by breaking it into a series of
smaller steps. Students often use this common method to complete a large research project or long essay for
school. For example, students typically brainstorm, develop a thesis or main topic, research the chosen topic,
organize their information into an outline, write a rough draft, revise and edit the rough draft, develop a final
draft, organize the references list, and proofread their work before turning in the project. The large task
becomes less overwhelming when it is broken down into a series of small steps.

 Solving Puzzles

  Problem-solving abilities can improve with practice. Many people challenge themselves every day with puzzles
  and other mental exercises to sharpen their problem-solving skills. Sudoku puzzles appear daily in most
  newspapers. Typically, a sudoku puzzle is a 9×9 grid. The simple sudoku below (Figure 7.7) is a 4×4 grid. To solve
  the puzzle, fill in the empty boxes with a single digit: 1, 2, 3, or 4. Here are the rules: The numbers must total 10
  in each bolded box, each row, and each column; however, each digit can only appear once in a bolded box, row,
  and column. Time yourself as you solve this puzzle and compare your time with a classmate.

Pitfalls to Problem Solving

Not all problems are successfully solved, however. What challenges stop us from successfully solving a
problem? Imagine a person in a room that has four doorways. One doorway that has always been open in the
past is now locked. The person, accustomed to exiting the room by that particular doorway, keeps trying to get
out through the same doorway even though the other three doorways are open. The person is stuck--but they
just need to go to another doorway, instead of trying to get out through the locked doorway. A mental set is
where you persist in approaching a problem in a way that has worked in the past but is clearly not working
now.
Functional fixedness is a type of mental set where you cannot perceive an object being used for something
other than what it was designed for. Duncker (1945) conducted foundational research on functional fixedness.
He created an experiment in which participants were given a candle, a book of matches, and a box of
thumbtacks. They were instructed to use those items to attach the candle to the wall so that it did not drip wax
onto the table below. Participants had to use functional fixedness to overcome the problem (Figure 7.10).
During the Apollo 13 mission to the moon, NASA engineers at Mission Control had to overcome functional
fixedness to save the lives of the astronauts aboard the spacecraft. An explosion in a module of the spacecraft
damaged multiple systems. The astronauts were in danger of being poisoned by rising levels of carbon dioxide
because of problems with the carbon dioxide filters. The engineers found a way for the astronauts to use spare
plastic bags, tape, and air hoses to create a makeshift air filter, which saved the lives of the astronauts.

       Researchers have investigated whether functional fixedness is affected by culture. In one experiment,
       individuals from the Shuar group in Ecuador were asked to use an object for a purpose other than that for
       which the object was originally intended. For example, the participants were told a story about a bear and a
       rabbit that were separated by a river and asked to select among various objects, including a spoon, a cup,
       erasers, and so on, to help the animals. The spoon was the only object long enough to span the imaginary river,
       but if the spoon was presented in a way that reflected its normal usage, it took participants longer to choose
       the spoon to solve the problem. (German & Barrett, 2005). The researchers wanted to know if exposure to
       highly specialized tools, as occurs with individuals in industrialized nations, affects their ability to transcend
       functional fixedness. It was determined that functional fixedness is experienced in both industrialized and
       nonindustrialized cultures (German & Barrett, 2005).
       In order to make good decisions, we use our knowledge and our reasoning. Often, this knowledge and
       reasoning is sound and solid. Sometimes, however, we are swayed by biases or by others manipulating a
       situation. For example, let's say you and three friends wanted to rent a house and had a combined target
       budget of $1,600. The realtor shows you only very run-down houses for $1,600 and then shows you a very nice
       house for $2,000. Might you ask each person to pay more in rent to get the $2,000 home? Why would the
       realtor show you the run-down houses and the nice house? The realtor may be challenging your anchoring
       bias. An anchoring bias occurs when you focus on one piece of information when making a decision or solving
       a problem. In this case, you're so focused on the amount of money you are willing to spend that you may not
       recognize what kinds of houses are available at that price point.
       The confirmation bias is the tendency to focus on information that confirms your existing beliefs. For
       example, if you think that your professor is not very nice, you notice all of the instances of rude behavior
       exhibited by the professor while ignoring the countless pleasant interactions he is involved in on a daily basis.
       Hindsight bias leads you to believe that the event you just experienced was predictable, even though it really
       wasn't. In other words, you knew all along that things would turn out the way they did. Representative bias
       describes a faulty way of thinking, in which you unintentionally stereotype someone or something; for
       example, you may assume that your professors spend their free time reading books and engaging in
       intellectual conversation, because the idea of them spending their time playing volleyball or visiting an
       amusement park does not fit in with your stereotypes of professors.
       Finally, the availability heuristic is a heuristic in which you make a decision based on an example,

information, or recent experience that is that readily available to you, even though it may not be the best
example to inform your decision. Biases tend to "preserve that which is already established--to maintain our
preexisting knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, and hypotheses" (Aronson, 1995; Kahneman, 2011). These biases are
summarized in Table 7.3.

     7.4 What Are Intelligence and Creativity?

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Define intelligence
         · Explain the triarchic theory of intelligence
         · Identify the difference between intelligence theories
         · Explain emotional intelligence
         · Define creativity

       A four-and-a-half-year-old boy sits at the kitchen table with his father, who is reading a new story aloud to him.
       He turns the page to continue reading, but before he can begin, the boy says, "Wait, Daddy!" He points to the
       words on the new page and reads aloud, "Go, Pig! Go!" The father stops and looks at his son. "Can you read
       that?" he asks. "Yes, Daddy!" And he points to the words and reads again, "Go, Pig! Go!"

       This father was not actively teaching his son to read, even though the child constantly asked questions about
       letters, words, and symbols that they saw everywhere: in the car, in the store, on the television. The dad
       wondered about what else his son might understand and decided to try an experiment. Grabbing a sheet of
       blank paper, he wrote several simple words in a list: mom, dad, dog, bird, bed, truck, car, tree. He put the list
       down in front of the boy and asked him to read the words. "Dad, dog, bird, bed, truck, car, tree," he read,
       slowing down to carefully pronounce bird and truck. Then, "Did I do it, Daddy?" "You sure did! That is very
       good." The father gave his little boy a warm hug and continued reading the story about the pig, all the while
       wondering if his son's abilities were an indication of exceptional intelligence or simply a normal pattern of
       linguistic development. Like the father in this example, psychologists have wondered what constitutes
       intelligence and how it can be measured.

      Classifying Intelligence

       What exactly is intelligence? The way that researchers have defined the concept of intelligence has been
       modified many times since the birth of psychology. British psychologist Charles Spearman believed
       intelligence consisted of one general factor, called g, which could be measured and compared among
       individuals. Spearman focused on the commonalities among various intellectual abilities and de-emphasized
       what made each unique. Long before modern psychology developed, however, ancient philosophers, such as
       Aristotle, held a similar view (Cianciolo & Sternberg, 2004).

       Others psychologists believe that instead of a single factor, intelligence is a collection of distinct abilities. In the
       1940s, Raymond Cattell proposed a theory of intelligence that divided general intelligence into two
       components: crystallized intelligence and fluid intelligence (Cattell, 1963). Crystallized intelligence is
       characterized as acquired knowledge and the ability to retrieve it. When you learn, remember, and recall
       information, you are using crystallized intelligence. You use crystallized intelligence all the time in your
       coursework by demonstrating that you have mastered the information covered in the course. Fluid
       intelligence encompasses the ability to see complex relationships and solve problems. Navigating your way
       home after being detoured onto an unfamiliar route because of road construction would draw upon your fluid
       intelligence. Fluid intelligence helps you tackle complex, abstract challenges in your daily life, whereas
       crystallized intelligence helps you overcome concrete, straightforward problems (Cattell, 1963).

       Other theorists and psychologists believe that intelligence should be defined in more practical terms. For
       example, what types of behaviors help you get ahead in life? Which skills promote success? Think about this
       for a moment. Being able to recite all 45 presidents of the United States in order is an excellent party trick, but
       will knowing this make you a better person?

       Robert Sternberg developed another theory of intelligence, which he titled the triarchic theory of intelligence
       because it sees intelligence as comprised of three parts (Sternberg, 1988): practical, creative, and analytical
       intelligence (Figure 7.12).

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                                7.4 · What Are Intelligence and Creativity? 229

        FIGURE 7.12 Sternberg's theory identifies three types of intelligence: practical, creative, and analytical.
Practical intelligence, as proposed by Sternberg, is sometimes compared to "street smarts." Being practical
means you find solutions that work in your everyday life by applying knowledge based on your experiences.
This type of intelligence appears to be separate from traditional understanding of IQ; individuals who score
high in practical intelligence may or may not have comparable scores in creative and analytical intelligence
(Sternberg, 1988).
Analytical intelligence is closely aligned with academic problem solving and computations. Sternberg says
that analytical intelligence is demonstrated by an ability to analyze, evaluate, judge, compare, and contrast.
When reading a classic novel for literature class, for example, it is usually necessary to compare the motives of
the main characters of the book or analyze the historical context of the story. In a science course such as
anatomy, you must study the processes by which the body uses various minerals in different human systems.
In developing an understanding of this topic, you are using analytical intelligence. When solving a challenging
math problem, you would apply analytical intelligence to analyze different aspects of the problem and then
solve it section by section.
Creative intelligence is marked by inventing or imagining a solution to a problem or situation. Creativity in
this realm can include finding a novel solution to an unexpected problem or producing a beautiful work of art
or a well-developed short story. Imagine for a moment that you are camping in the woods with some friends
and realize that you've forgotten your camp coffee pot. The person in your group who figures out a way to
successfully brew coffee for everyone would be credited as having higher creative intelligence.
Multiple Intelligences Theory was developed by Howard Gardner, a Harvard psychologist and former student
of Erik Erikson. In Gardner's theory, each person possesses at least eight intelligences. The eight intelligences
are linguistic intelligence, logical-mathematical intelligence, musical intelligence, bodily kinesthetic
intelligence, spatial intelligence, interpersonal intelligence, intrapersonal intelligence, and naturalistic
intelligence. Among cognitive psychologists, Gardner's theory has been heavily criticized for lacking empirical
evidence. However, educators continue to study and use Gardner's theory, with some colleges even discussing
how they integrate Gardner's theory into their classrooms. Gottfredson describes one possible reason for the
continued use of Gardner's theory: " . . . that there are multiple independent intelligences, suggesting that
everyone can be smart in some way. This is, understandably, a very attractive idea in democratic societies"
(2004).
Gardner's inter- and intrapersonal intelligences are often combined into a single type: emotional intelligence.
Emotional intelligence encompasses the ability to understand the emotions of yourself and others, show
empathy, understand social relationships and cues, and regulate your own emotions and respond in culturally
appropriate ways (Parker, Saklofske, & Stough, 2009). People with high emotional intelligence typically have
well-developed social skills. Some researchers, including Daniel Goleman, the author of Emotional
Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More than IQ, argue that emotional intelligence is a better predictor of success
than traditional intelligence (Goleman, 1995). However, emotional intelligence has been widely debated, with
230 7 · Thinking and Intelligence

       researchers pointing out inconsistencies in how it is defined and described, as well as questioning results of
       studies on a subject that is difficult to measure and study empirically (Locke, 2005; Mayer, Salovey, & Caruso,
       2004)

       The most comprehensive theory of intelligence to date is the Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) theory of cognitive
       abilities (Schneider & McGrew, 2018). In this theory, abilities are related and arranged in a hierarchy with
       general abilities at the top, broad abilities in the middle, and narrow (specific) abilities at the bottom. The
       narrow abilities are the only ones that can be directly measured; however, they are integrated within the other
       abilities. At the general level is general intelligence. Next, the broad level consists of general abilities such as
       fluid reasoning, short-term memory, and processing speed. Finally, as the hierarchy continues, the narrow
       level includes specific forms of cognitive abilities. For example, short-term memory would further break down
       into memory span and working memory capacity.

       Intelligence can also have different meanings and values in different cultures. If you live on a small island,
       where most people get their food by fishing from boats, it would be important to know how to fish and how to
       repair a boat. If you were an exceptional angler, your peers would probably consider you intelligent. If you were
       also skilled at repairing boats, your intelligence might be known across the whole island. Think about your
       own family's culture. What values are important for Latinx families? Italian families? In Irish families,
       hospitality and telling an entertaining story are marks of the culture. If you are a skilled storyteller, other
       members of Irish culture are likely to consider you intelligent.

       Some cultures place a high value on working together as a collective. In these cultures, the importance of the
       group supersedes the importance of individual achievement. When you visit such a culture, how well you
       relate to the values of that culture exemplifies your cultural intelligence, sometimes referred to as cultural
       competence.

      Creativity

       Creativity is the ability to generate, create, or discover new ideas, solutions, and possibilities. Very creative
       people often have intense knowledge about something, work on it for years, look at novel solutions, seek out
       the advice and help of other experts, and take risks. Although creativity is often associated with the arts, it is
       actually a vital form of intelligence that drives people in many disciplines to discover something new.
       Creativity can be found in every area of life, from the way you decorate your residence to a new way of
       understanding how a cell works.

       Creativity is often connected to a person's ability to engage in divergent thinking. Divergent thinking can be
       described as thinking "outside the box;" it allows an individual to arrive at unique, multiple solutions to a given
       problem. In contrast, convergent thinking describes the ability to provide a correct or well-established answer
       or solution to a problem (Cropley, 2006; Gilford, 1967)

                                                                                             EVERYDAY CONNECTION

  important good mentorship is in the early stages of one's career development and constant face-to-face
  conversations, debate and discussions with colleagues at all stages of research. Outstanding discoveries,
  insights and developments do not happen in a vacuum" (Steitz, 2010, para. 39). Based on Steitz's comment, it
  becomes clear that someone's creativity, although an individual strength, benefits from interactions with others.
  Think of a time when your creativity was sparked by a conversation with a friend or classmate. How did that
  person influence you and what problem did you solve using creativity?

7.5 Measures of Intelligence

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Explain how intelligence tests are developed
  · Describe the history of the use of IQ tests
  · Describe the purposes and benefits of intelligence testing

While you're likely familiar with the term "IQ" and associate it with the idea of intelligence, what does IQ really
mean? IQ stands for intelligence quotient and describes a score earned on a test designed to measure
intelligence. You've already learned that there are many ways psychologists describe intelligence (or more
aptly, intelligences). Similarly, IQ tests--the tools designed to measure intelligence--have been the subject of
debate throughout their development and use.

When might an IQ test be used? What do we learn from the results, and how might people use this
information? While there are certainly many benefits to intelligence testing, it is important to also note the
limitations and controversies surrounding these tests. For example, IQ tests have sometimes been used as
arguments in support of insidious purposes, such as the eugenics movement (Severson, 2011). The infamous
Supreme Court Case, Buck v. Bell, legalized the forced sterilization of some people deemed "feeble-minded"
through this type of testing, resulting in about 65,000 sterilizations (Buck v. Bell, 274 U.S. 200; Ko, 2016).
Today, only professionals trained in psychology can administer IQ tests, and the purchase of most tests
requires an advanced degree in psychology. Other professionals in the field, such as social workers and
psychiatrists, cannot administer IQ tests. In this section, we will explore what intelligence tests measure, how
they are scored, and how they were developed.

Measuring Intelligence

It seems that the human understanding of intelligence is somewhat limited when we focus on traditional or
academic-type intelligence. How then, can intelligence be measured? And when we measure intelligence, how
do we ensure that we capture what we're really trying to measure (in other words, that IQ tests function as valid
measures of intelligence)? In the following paragraphs, we will explore how intelligence tests were developed
and the history of their use.

The IQ test has been synonymous with intelligence for over a century. In the late 1800s, Sir Francis Galton
developed the first broad test of intelligence (Flanagan & Kaufman, 2004). Although he was not a psychologist,
his contributions to the concepts of intelligence testing are still felt today (Gordon, 1995). Reliable intelligence
testing (you may recall from earlier chapters that reliability refers to a test's ability to produce consistent
results) began in earnest during the early 1900s with a researcher named Alfred Binet (Figure 7.13). Binet was
asked by the French government to develop an intelligence test to use on children to determine which ones
might have difficulty in school; it included many verbally based tasks. American researchers soon realized the
value of such testing. Louis Terman, a Stanford professor, modified Binet's work by standardizing the
administration of the test and tested thousands of different-aged children to establish an average score for
each age. As a result, the test was normed and standardized, which means that the test was administered
consistently to a large enough representative sample of the population that the range of scores resulted in a
bell curve (bell curves will be discussed later). Standardization means that the manner of administration,
232 7 · Thinking and Intelligence

       scoring, and interpretation of results is consistent. Norming involves giving a test to a large population so data
       can be collected comparing groups, such as age groups. The resulting data provide norms, or referential
       scores, by which to interpret future scores. Norms are not expectations of what a given group should know but
       a demonstration of what that group does know. Norming and standardizing the test ensures that new scores
       are reliable. This new version of the test was called the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale (Terman, 1916).
       Remarkably, an updated version of this test is still widely used today.

       FIGURE 7.13 French psychologist Alfred Binet helped to develop intelligence testing. (b) This page is from a 1908
       version of the Binet-Simon Intelligence Scale. Children being tested were asked which face, of each pair, was
       prettier.
       In 1939, David Wechsler, a psychologist who spent part of his career working with World War I veterans,
       developed a new IQ test in the United States. Wechsler combined several subtests from other intelligence tests
       used between 1880 and World War I. These subtests tapped into a variety of verbal and nonverbal skills,
       because Wechsler believed that intelligence encompassed "the global capacity of a person to act purposefully,
       to think rationally, and to deal effectively with his environment" (Wechsler, 1958, p. 7). He named the test the
       Wechsler-Bellevue Intelligence Scale (Wechsler, 1981). This combination of subtests became one of the most
       extensively used intelligence tests in the history of psychology. Although its name was later changed to the
       Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) and has been revised several times, the aims of the test remain
       virtually unchanged since its inception (Boake, 2002). Today, there are three intelligence tests credited to
       Wechsler, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-fourth edition (WAIS-IV), the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for
       Children (WISC-V), and the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence--IV (WPPSI-IV) (Wechsler,
       2012). These tests are used widely in schools and communities throughout the United States, and they are
       periodically normed and standardized as a means of recalibration. As a part of the recalibration process, the
       WISC-V was given to thousands of children across the country, and children taking the test today are compared
       with their same-age peers (Figure 7.13).
       The WISC-V is composed of 14 subtests, which comprise five indices, which then render an IQ score. The five
       indices are Verbal Comprehension, Visual Spatial, Fluid Reasoning, Working Memory, and Processing Speed.
       When the test is complete, individuals receive a score for each of the five indices and a Full Scale IQ score. The
       method of scoring reflects the understanding that intelligence is comprised of multiple abilities in several
       cognitive realms and focuses on the mental processes that the child used to arrive at their answers to each test
       item.

Interestingly, the periodic recalibrations have led to an interesting observation known as the Flynn effect.
Named after James Flynn, who was among the first to describe this trend, the Flynn effect refers to the
observation that each generation has a significantly higher IQ than the last. Flynn himself argues, however,
that increased IQ scores do not necessarily mean that younger generations are more intelligent per se (Flynn,
Shaughnessy, & Fulgham, 2012).

Ultimately, we are still left with the question of how valid intelligence tests are. Certainly, the most modern
versions of these tests tap into more than verbal competencies, yet the specific skills that should be assessed
in IQ testing, the degree to which any test can truly measure an individual's intelligence, and the use of the
results of IQ tests are still issues of debate (Gresham & Witt, 1997; Flynn, Shaughnessy, & Fulgham, 2012;
Richardson, 2002; Schlinger, 2003).

                                                                                           WHAT DO YOU THINK?

 Capital Punishment and People with Intellectual Disabilities

  The case of Atkins v. Virginia was a landmark case in the United States Supreme Court. On August 16, 1996, two
  men, Daryl Atkins and William Jones, robbed, kidnapped, and then shot and killed Eric Nesbitt, a local airman
  from the U.S. Air Force. A clinical psychologist evaluated Atkins and testified at the trial that Atkins had an IQ of
  59. The mean IQ score is 100. The psychologist concluded that Atkins had an intellectual disability.

  The jury found Atkins guilty, and he was sentenced to death. Atkins and his attorneys appealed to the Supreme
  Court. In June 2002, the Supreme Court reversed a previous decision and ruled that executions of people with
  intellectual disabilities are `cruel and unusual punishments' prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. Using the
  accepted language of the time, the court wrote in their decision:

        Clinical definitions of mental retardation require not only subaverage intellectual functioning, but also
        significant limitations in adaptive skills. Mentally retarded persons frequently know the difference
        between right and wrong and are competent to stand trial. Because of their impairments, however, by
        definition they have diminished capacities to understand and process information, to communicate, to
        abstract from mistakes and learn from experience, to engage in logical reasoning, to control impulses,
        and to understand others' reactions. Their deficiencies do not warrant an exemption from criminal
        sanctions, but diminish their personal culpability (Atkins v. Virginia, 2002, par. 5).

  The court also decided that there was a state legislature consensus against the execution of people with
  intellectual disabilities and that this consensus should stand for all of the states. The Supreme Court ruling left it
  up to the states to determine their own definitions of intellectual disability. The definitions vary among states as
  to who can be executed. In the Atkins case, a jury decided that because he had many contacts with his lawyers
  and thus was provided with intellectual stimulation, his IQ had reportedly increased to a level where the state
  could execute him. He was given an execution date and then received a stay of execution after it was revealed
  that lawyers for co-defendant, William Jones, coached Jones to "produce a testimony against Mr. Atkins that did
  match the evidence" (Liptak, 2008). After the revelation of this misconduct, Atkins was re-sentenced to life
  imprisonment.

  Atkins v. Virginia (2002) highlights several issues regarding society's beliefs around intelligence. In the Atkins
  case, the Supreme Court decided that intellectual disability does affect decision making and therefore should
  affect the nature of the punishment such criminals receive. Where, however, should the lines of intellectual
  disability be drawn? In May 2014, the Supreme Court ruled in a related case (Hall v. Florida) that IQ scores
  cannot be used as a final determination of a prisoner's eligibility for the death penalty (Roberts, 2014).

The Bell Curve

The results of intelligence tests follow the bell curve, a graph in the general shape of a bell. When the bell curve
234 7 · Thinking and Intelligence

       is used in psychological testing, the graph demonstrates a normal distribution of a trait, in this case,
       intelligence, in the human population. Many human traits naturally follow the bell curve. For example, if you
       lined up all your female schoolmates according to height, it is likely that a large cluster of them would be the
       average height for an American woman: 5'4"-5'6". This cluster would fall in the center of the bell curve,
       representing the average height for American women (Figure 7.14). There would be fewer women who stand
       closer to 4'11". The same would be true for women of above-average height: those who stand closer to 5'11".
       The trick to finding a bell curve in nature is to use a large sample size. Without a large sample size, it is less
       likely that the bell curve will represent the wider population. A representative sample is a subset of the
       population that accurately represents the general population. If, for example, you measured the height of the
       women in your classroom only, you might not actually have a representative sample. Perhaps the women's
       basketball team wanted to take this course together, and they are all in your class. Because basketball players
       tend to be taller than average, the women in your class may not be a good representative sample of the
       population of American women. But if your sample included all the women at your school, it is likely that their
       heights would form a natural bell curve.

                                   FIGURE 7.14 Are you of below-average, average, or above-average height?
       The same principles apply to intelligence tests scores. Individuals earn a score called an intelligence quotient
       (IQ). Over the years, different types of IQ tests have evolved, but the way scores are interpreted remains the
       same. On most IQ tests, the average (or mean) IQ score is 100. Standard deviations describe how data are
       dispersed in a population and give context to large data sets. The bell curve uses the standard deviation to
       show how all scores are dispersed from the average score (Figure 7.15). In modern IQ testing, one standard
       deviation is 15 points. So a score of 85 would be described as "one standard deviation below the mean." How
       would you describe a score of 115 and a score of 70? Any IQ score that falls within one standard deviation
       above and below the mean (between 85 and 115) is considered average, and 68% of the population has IQ
       scores in this range. An IQ score of 130 or above is considered a superior level.

                           FIGURE 7.15 The majority of people have an IQ score between 85 and 115.

Only 2.2% of the population has an IQ score below 70 (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013). If a
person earns a score approximately two standard deviations below the mean on an intelligence test, (about 70
on a test with a mean of 100), has major deficits in adaptive functioning, and these cognitive and adaptive
deficits were present before the age of 18, they could be diagnosed as having an intellectual disability (ID).
Formerly known as mental retardation, the accepted term now is intellectual disability, and it has four
subtypes: mild, moderate, severe, and profound (Table 7.4). The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Psychological Disorders lists criteria for each subgroup (APA, 2013).

TABLE 7.4

On the other end of the intelligence spectrum are those individuals whose IQs fall into the highest ranges.
Consistent with the bell curve, about 2% of the population falls into this category. People are considered to
have a higher aptitude for learning (and may be classified as "gifted" within educational systems) if they have
an IQ score of 130 or higher, or superior intelligence in a particular area. Long ago, popular belief suggested
that people of high intelligence were maladjusted. This idea was disproven through a groundbreaking study of
these children. In 1921, Lewis Terman began a longitudinal study of over 1500 children with IQs over 135
(Terman, 1925). His findings showed that these children became well-educated, successful adults who were, in
236 7 · Thinking and Intelligence

       fact, well-adjusted (Terman & Oden, 1947). Additionally, Terman's study showed that the subjects were above
       average in physical build and attractiveness, dispelling an earlier popular notion that highly intelligent people
       were "weaklings." Some people with very high IQs elect to join Mensa, an organization dedicated to identifying,
       researching, and fostering intelligence. Members must have an IQ score in the top 2% of the population, and
       they may be required to pass other exams in their application to join the group.

                                                                                                                   DIG DEEPER

        What's in a Name? Intellectual Disabilities

         In the past, individuals with IQ scores below 70 and significant adaptive and social functioning delays were
         diagnosed with mental retardation. When this diagnosis was first named, it was replacing more negative and
         insensitive terms, and the title held no social stigma; several prominent research and support organizations even
         used the word in their names and mission statements. However, members of those populations as well as their
         families and supporting professionals found that the term was not only inaccurate, but demeaning and insulting.
         As such, the DSM-5 now labels this diagnosis as "intellectual disability." Many states once had a Department of
         Mental Retardation to serve those diagnosed with such cognitive delays, but most have changed their name to
         Department of Developmental Disabilities or something similar in language. Due to the passage of "Rosa's Law"
         in 2010 and to the growing support for changing the terminology, most U.S. federal agencies formally adopted
         the words "intellectual disability." While the change was widely supported, you can view in the Federal Register
         several counterpoints from parents of people with intellectual disabilities, who felt that the new term was
         imprecise and less applicable to their children. Earlier in the chapter, we discussed how language affects how we
         think. Do you think changing the title of this department has any impact on how people regard those with
         developmental disabilities? Does a different name give people more dignity, and if so, how? Do you think the
         terminology is likely to change again? Why or why not?

      Why Measure Intelligence?

       The value of IQ testing is most evident in educational or clinical settings. Children who seem to be
       experiencing learning difficulties or severe behavioral problems can be tested to ascertain whether the child's
       difficulties can be partly attributed to an IQ score that is significantly different from the mean for their age
       group. Without IQ testing--or another measure of intelligence--children and adults needing extra support
       might not be identified effectively. In addition, IQ testing is used in courts to determine whether a defendant
       has special or extenuating circumstances that preclude them from participating in some way in a trial. People
       also use IQ testing results to seek disability benefits from the Social Security Administration.

       The following case study demonstrates the usefulness and benefits of IQ testing. Candace, a 14-year-old girl
       experiencing problems at school in Connecticut, was referred for a court-ordered psychological evaluation.
       She was in regular education classes in ninth grade and was failing every subject. Candace had never been a
       stellar student but had always been passed to the next grade. Frequently, she would curse at any of her
       teachers who called on her in class. She also got into fights with other students and occasionally shoplifted.
       When she arrived for the evaluation, Candace immediately said that she hated everything about school,
       including the teachers, the rest of the staff, the building, and the homework. Her parents stated that they felt
       their daughter was picked on, because she was of a different ethnicity than the teachers and most of the other
       students. When asked why she cursed at her teachers, Candace replied, "They only call on me when I don't
       know the answer. I don't want to say, `I don't know' all of the time and look like an idiot in front of my friends.
       The teachers embarrass me." She was given a battery of tests, including an IQ test. Her score on the IQ test was
       68. What does Candace's score say about her ability to excel or even succeed in regular education classes
       without assistance? Why were her difficulties never noticed or addressed?

tests are continually evolving. Researchers such as Jack A. Naglieri (2020) have developed or improved on
testing programs in order to make them more accurate, equitable, and useful. Beyond new testing
instruments, some researchers demonstrate value in differentiating tests for different age groups, abilities,
and contexts.

7.6 The Source of Intelligence

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Describe how genetics and environment affect intelligence
  · Explain the relationship between IQ scores and socioeconomic status
  · Describe the difference between a learning disability and a developmental disorder
A young girl, born of teenage parents, lives with her grandmother in rural Mississippi. They have a very low
income, but they do their best to get by with what they have. She learns to read when she is just 3 years old. As
she grows older, she longs to live with her mother, who now resides in Wisconsin. She moves there at the age of
6 years. At 9 years of age, she is raped. During the next several years, several different male relatives
repeatedly molest her. Her life unravels. She turns to drugs and sex to fill the deep, lonely void inside her. Her
mother then sends her to Nashville to live with her father, who imposes strict behavioral expectations upon
her, and over time, her wild life settles once again. She begins to experience success in school, and at 19 years
old, becomes the youngest and first African-American female news anchor ("Dates and Events," n.d.). The
woman--Oprah Winfrey--goes on to become a media giant known for both her intelligence and her empathy.

High Intelligence: Nature or Nurture?

Where does high intelligence come from? Some researchers believe that intelligence is a trait inherited from a
person's parents. Scientists who research this topic typically use twin studies to determine the heritability of
intelligence. The Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart is one of the most well-known twin studies. In this
investigation, researchers found that identical twins raised together and identical twins raised apart exhibit a
higher correlation between their IQ scores than siblings or fraternal twins raised together (Bouchard, Lykken,
McGue, Segal, & Tellegen, 1990). The findings from this study reveal a genetic component to intelligence
(Figure 7.16). At the same time, other psychologists believe that intelligence is shaped by a child's
developmental environment. If parents were to provide their children with intellectual stimuli from before
they are born, it is likely that they would absorb the benefits of that stimulation, and it would be reflected in
intelligence levels.

FIGURE 7.16 The correlations of IQs of unrelated versus related persons reared apart or together suggest a genetic
238 7 · Thinking and Intelligence

       component to intelligence.

       The reality is that aspects of each idea are probably correct. In fact, one study suggests that although genetics
       seem to be in control of the level of intelligence, the environmental influences provide both stability and
       change to trigger manifestation of cognitive abilities (Bartels, Rietveld, Van Baal, & Boomsma, 2002). Certainly,
       there are behaviors that support the development of intelligence, but the genetic component of high
       intelligence should not be ignored. As with all heritable traits, however, it is not always possible to isolate how
       and when high intelligence is passed on to the next generation.

       Range of Reaction is the theory that each person responds to the environment in a unique way based on their
       genetic makeup. According to this idea, your genetic potential is a fixed quantity, but whether you reach your
       full intellectual potential is dependent upon the environmental stimulation you experience, especially in
       childhood. Think about this scenario: A couple adopts a child who has average genetic intellectual potential.
       They raise her in an extremely stimulating environment. What will happen to the couple's new daughter? It is
       likely that the stimulating environment will improve her intellectual outcomes over the course of her life. But
       what happens if this experiment is reversed? If a child with an extremely strong genetic background is placed
       in an environment that does not stimulate him: What happens? Interestingly, according to a longitudinal study
       of highly gifted individuals, it was found that "the two extremes of optimal and pathological experience are
       both represented disproportionately in the backgrounds of creative individuals"; however, those who
       experienced supportive family environments were more likely to report being happy (Csikszentmihalyi &
       Csikszentmihalyi, 1993, p. 187).

       Another challenge to determining origins of high intelligence is the confounding nature of our human social
       structures. It is troubling to note that some ethnic groups perform better on IQ tests than others--and it is
       likely that the results do not have much to do with the quality of each ethnic group's intellect. The same is true
       for socioeconomic status. Children who live in poverty experience more pervasive, daily stress than children
       who do not worry about the basic needs of safety, shelter, and food. These worries can negatively affect how the
       brain functions and develops, causing a dip in IQ scores. Mark Kishiyama and his colleagues determined that
       children living in poverty demonstrated reduced prefrontal brain functioning comparable to children with
       damage to the lateral prefrontal cortex (Kishiyama, Boyce, Jimenez, Perry, & Knight, 2009).

       The debate around the foundations and influences on intelligence exploded in 1969, when an educational
       psychologist named Arthur Jensen published the article "How Much Can We Boost I.Q. and Achievement" in
       the Harvard Educational Review. Jensen had administered IQ tests to diverse groups of students, and his
       results led him to the conclusion that IQ is determined by genetics. He also posited that intelligence was made
       up of two types of abilities: Level I and Level II. In his theory, Level I is responsible for rote memorization,
       whereas Level II is responsible for conceptual and analytical abilities. According to his findings, Level I
       remained consistent among the human race. Level II, however, exhibited differences among ethnic groups
       (Modgil & Routledge, 1987). Jensen's most controversial conclusion was that Level II intelligence is prevalent
       among Asian people, then White people, then Black people. Robert Williams was among those who called out
       racial bias in Jensen's results (Williams, 1970).

       Obviously, Jensen's interpretation of his own data caused an intense response in a nation that continued to
       grapple with the effects of racism (Fox, 2012). While even some who took issue with Jensen's findings
       indicated that they did not detect overt racism in his work, Jensen himself made a number of racist statements
       during an interview with a White nationalist publication, American Renaissance. He indicated his belief that
       many Black people were not "educable up to a level for which there's any economic demand," while also having
       a higher birth rate than other groups, which would lead to a shift in population and a deterioration of the
       nation (Taylor, 1992). However, Jensen's ideas were not solitary or unique; rather, they represented one of
       many examples of psychologists asserting racial differences in IQ and cognitive ability. In fact, Rushton and
       Jensen (2005) reviewed three decades worth of research on the relationship between race and cognitive ability.
       Jensen's belief in the inherited nature of intelligence and the validity of the IQ test to be the truest measure of

intelligence are at the core of his conclusions.

In a related story, parents of African American students filed a case against the State of California in 1979,
because they believed that the testing method used to identify students with learning disabilities was
culturally unfair as the tests were normed and standardized using White children (Larry P. v. Riles). The testing
method used by the state disproportionately identified African American children as "mentally retarded,"
which resulted in many students being incorrectly classified. According to a summary of the case, Larry P. v.
Riles:

      In violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Education
      for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, defendants have utilized standardized intelligence tests
      that are racially and culturally biased, have a discriminatory impact against Black children, and have
      not been validated for the purpose of essentially permanent placements of Black children into
      educationally dead-end, isolated, and stigmatizing classes for the so-called educable mentally
      retarded. Further, these federal laws have been violated by defendants' general use of placement
      mechanisms that, taken together, have not been validated and result in a large over-representation of
     Black children in the special E.M.R. classes. (Larry P. v. Riles, par. 6)

Once again, the limitations of intelligence testing were revealed.

What are Learning Disabilities?

Learning disabilities are cognitive disorders that affect different areas of cognition, particularly language or
reading. It should be pointed out that learning disabilities are not the same thing as intellectual disabilities.
Learning disabilities are considered specific neurological impairments rather than global intellectual or
developmental disabilities. A person with a language disability has difficulty understanding or using spoken
language, whereas someone with a reading disability, such as dyslexia, has difficulty processing what they are
reading.

Often, learning disabilities are not recognized until a child reaches school age. One confounding aspect of
learning disabilities is that they most often affect children with average to above-average intelligence. In other
words, the disability is specific to a particular area and not a measure of overall intellectual ability. At the same
time, learning disabilities tend to exhibit comorbidity with other disorders, like attention-deficit hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD). Anywhere between 30-70% of individuals with diagnosed cases of ADHD also have some sort
of learning disability (Riccio, Gonzales, & Hynd, 1994). Let's take a look at three examples of common learning
disabilities: dysgraphia, dyslexia, and dyscalculia.

Dysgraphia

Children with dysgraphia have a learning disability that results in a struggle to write legibly. The physical task
of writing with a pen and paper is extremely challenging for the person. These children often have extreme
difficulty putting their thoughts down on paper (Smits-Engelsman & Van Galen, 1997). This difficulty is
inconsistent with a person's IQ. That is, based on the child's IQ and/or abilities in other areas, a child with
dysgraphia should be able to write, but can't. Children with dysgraphia may also have problems with spatial
abilities.

Students with dysgraphia need academic accommodations to help them succeed in school. These
accommodations can provide students with alternative assessment opportunities to demonstrate what they
know (Barton, 2003). For example, a student with dysgraphia might be permitted to take an oral exam rather
than a traditional paper-and-pencil test. Treatment is usually provided by an occupational therapist, although
there is some question as to how effective such treatment is (Zwicker, 2005).

Dyslexia

Dyslexia is the most common learning disability in children. An individual with dyslexia exhibits an inability
to correctly process letters. The neurological mechanism for sound processing does not work properly in
240 7 · Thinking and Intelligence

       someone with dyslexia. As a result, dyslexic children may not understand sound-letter correspondence. A
       child with dyslexia may mix up letters within words and sentences--letter reversals, such as those shown in
       Figure 7.17, are a hallmark of this learning disability--or skip whole words while reading. A dyslexic child may
       have difficulty spelling words correctly while writing. Because of the disordered way that the brain processes
       letters and sound, learning to read is a frustrating experience. Some dyslexic individuals cope by memorizing
       the shapes of most words, but they never actually learn to read (Berninger, 2008).

           FIGURE 7.17 These written words show variations of the word "teapot" as written by individuals with dyslexia.
       Dyscalculia
       Dyscalculia is difficulty in learning or comprehending arithmetic. This learning disability is often first evident
       when children exhibit difficulty discerning how many objects are in a small group without counting them.
       Other symptoms may include struggling to memorize math facts, organize numbers, or fully differentiate

Summary

7.1 What Is Cognition?

In this section, you were introduced to cognitive psychology, which is the study of cognition, or the brain's
ability to think, perceive, plan, analyze, and remember. Concepts and their corresponding prototypes help us
quickly organize our thinking by creating categories into which we can sort new information. We also develop
schemata, which are clusters of related concepts. Some schemata involve routines of thought and behavior,
and these help us function properly in various situations without having to "think twice" about them.
Schemata show up in social situations and routines of daily behavior.

7.2 Language

Language is a communication system that has both a lexicon and a system of grammar. Language acquisition
occurs naturally and effortlessly during the early stages of life, and this acquisition occurs in a predictable
sequence for individuals around the world. Language has a strong influence on thought, and the concept of
how language may influence cognition remains an area of study and debate in psychology.

7.3 Problem Solving

Many different strategies exist for solving problems. Typical strategies include trial and error, applying
algorithms, and using heuristics. To solve a large, complicated problem, it often helps to break the problem
into smaller steps that can be accomplished individually, leading to an overall solution. Roadblocks to problem
solving include a mental set, functional fixedness, and various biases that can cloud decision making skills.

7.4 What Are Intelligence and Creativity?

Intelligence is a complex characteristic of cognition. Many theories have been developed to explain what
intelligence is and how it works. Sternberg generated his triarchic theory of intelligence, whereas Gardner
posits that intelligence is comprised of many factors. Still others focus on the importance of emotional
intelligence. Finally, creativity seems to be a facet of intelligence, but it is extremely difficult to measure
objectively.

7.5 Measures of Intelligence

In this section, we learned about the history of intelligence testing and some of the challenges regarding
intelligence testing. Intelligence tests began in earnest with Binet; Wechsler later developed intelligence tests
that are still in use today: the WAIS-IV and WISC-V. The Bell curve shows the range of scores that encompass
average intelligence as well as standard deviations.

7.6 The Source of Intelligence

Genetics and environment affect intelligence and the challenges of certain learning disabilities. The
intelligence levels of all individuals seem to benefit from rich stimulation in their early environments. Highly
intelligent individuals, however, may have a built-in resiliency that allows them to overcome difficult obstacles
in their upbringing. Learning disabilities can cause major challenges for children who are learning to read and
write. Unlike developmental disabilities, learning disabilities are strictly neurological in nature and are not
related to intelligence levels. Students with dyslexia, for example, may have extreme difficulty learning to read,
but their intelligence levels are typically average or above average.

INTRODUCTION We may be top-notch learners, but if we don't have a way to store what we've learned, what
good is the knowledge we've gained?
Take a few minutes to imagine what your day might be like if you could not remember anything you had
learned. You would have to figure out how to get dressed. What clothing should you wear, and how do buttons
and zippers work? You would need someone to teach you how to brush your teeth and tie your shoes. Who
would you ask for help with these tasks, since you wouldn't recognize the faces of these people in your house?
Wait . . . is this even your house? Uh oh, your stomach begins to rumble and you feel hungry. You'd like
something to eat, but you don't know where the food is kept or even how to prepare it. Oh dear, this is getting
confusing. Maybe it would be best just go back to bed. A bed . . . what is a bed?
We have an amazing capacity for memory, but how, exactly, do we process and store information? Are there
different kinds of memory, and if so, what characterizes the different types? How, exactly, do we retrieve our
memories? And why do we forget? This chapter will explore these questions as we learn about memory.

     8.1 How Memory Functions

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Discuss the three basic functions of memory
         · Describe the three stages of memory storage
         · Describe and distinguish between procedural and declarative memory and semantic and episodic memory
       Memory is an information processing system; therefore, we often compare it to a computer. Memory is the set
       of processes used to encode, store, and retrieve information over different periods of time (Figure 8.2).

       FIGURE 8.2 Encoding involves the input of information into the memory system. Storage is the retention of the
       encoded information. Retrieval, or getting the information out of memory and back into awareness, is the third
       function.

           LINK TO LEARNING

       Watch this video about the neuroscience of memory (http://openstax.org/l/unexpectfact) to learn more.

      Encoding

       We get information into our brains through a process called encoding, which is the input of information into
       the memory system. Once we receive sensory information from the environment, our brains label or code it.
       We organize the information with other similar information and connect new concepts to existing concepts.
       Encoding information occurs through automatic processing and effortful processing.
       If someone asks you what you ate for lunch today, more than likely you could recall this information quite
       easily. This is known as automatic processing, or the encoding of details like time, space, frequency, and the
       meaning of words. Automatic processing is usually done without any conscious awareness. Recalling the last
       time you studied for a test is another example of automatic processing. But what about the actual test material
       you studied? It probably required a lot of work and attention on your part in order to encode that information.
       This is known as effortful processing (Figure 8.3).

       FIGURE 8.3 When you first learn new skills such as driving a car, you have to put forth effort and attention to
       encode information about how to start a car, how to brake, how to handle a turn, and so on. Once you know how to
       drive, you can encode additional information about this skill automatically. (credit: Robert Couse-Baker)
       What are the most effective ways to ensure that important memories are well encoded? Even a simple
       sentence is easier to recall when it is meaningful (Anderson, 1984). Read the following sentences (Bransford &

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                                                    8.1 · How Memory Functions 249

McCarrell, 1974), then look away and count backwards from 30 by threes to zero, and then try to write down
the sentences (no peeking back at this page!).

1. The notes were sour because the seams split.
2. The voyage wasn't delayed because the bottle shattered.
3. The haystack was important because the cloth ripped.

How well did you do? By themselves, the statements that you wrote down were most likely confusing and
difficult for you to recall. Now, try writing them again, using the following prompts: bagpipe, ship christening,
and parachutist. Next count backwards from 40 by fours, then check yourself to see how well you recalled the
sentences this time. You can see that the sentences are now much more memorable because each of the
sentences was placed in context. Material is far better encoded when you make it meaningful.

There are three types of encoding. The encoding of words and their meaning is known as semantic encoding.
It was first demonstrated by William Bousfield (1935) in an experiment in which he asked people to memorize
words. The 60 words were actually divided into 4 categories of meaning, although the participants did not
know this because the words were randomly presented. When they were asked to remember the words, they
tended to recall them in categories, showing that they paid attention to the meanings of the words as they
learned them.

Visual encoding is the encoding of images, and acoustic encoding is the encoding of sounds, words in
particular. To see how visual encoding works, read over this list of words: car, level, dog, truth, book, value. If
you were asked later to recall the words from this list, which ones do you think you'd most likely remember?
You would probably have an easier time recalling the words car, dog, and book, and a more difficult time
recalling the words level, truth, and value. Why is this? Because you can recall images (mental pictures) more
easily than words alone. When you read the words car, dog, and book you created images of these things in
your mind. These are concrete, high-imagery words. On the other hand, abstract words like level, truth, and
value are low-imagery words. High-imagery words are encoded both visually and semantically (Paivio, 1986),
thus building a stronger memory.

Now let's turn our attention to acoustic encoding. You are driving in your car and a song comes on the radio
that you haven't heard in at least 10 years, but you sing along, recalling every word. In the United States,
children often learn the alphabet through song, and they learn the number of days in each month through
rhyme: "Thirty days hath September, / April, June, and November; / All the rest have thirty-one, / Save
February, with twenty-eight days clear, / And twenty-nine each leap year." These lessons are easy to remember
because of acoustic encoding. We encode the sounds the words make. This is one of the reasons why much of
what we teach young children is done through song, rhyme, and rhythm.

Which of the three types of encoding do you think would give you the best memory of verbal information?
Some years ago, psychologists Fergus Craik and Endel Tulving (1975) conducted a series of experiments to
find out. Participants were given words along with questions about them. The questions required the
participants to process the words at one of the three levels. The visual processing questions included such
things as asking the participants about the font of the letters. The acoustic processing questions asked the
participants about the sound or rhyming of the words, and the semantic processing questions asked the
participants about the meaning of the words. After participants were presented with the words and questions,
they were given an unexpected recall or recognition task.

Words that had been encoded semantically were better remembered than those encoded visually or
acoustically. Semantic encoding involves a deeper level of processing than the shallower visual or acoustic
encoding. Craik and Tulving concluded that we process verbal information best through semantic encoding,
especially if we apply what is called the self-reference effect. The self-reference effect is the tendency for an
individual to have better memory for information that relates to oneself in comparison to material that has less
personal relevance (Rogers, Kuiper, & Kirker, 1977). Could semantic encoding be beneficial to you as you

       attempt to memorize the concepts in this chapter?

      Storage

       Once the information has been encoded, we have to somehow retain it. Our brains take the encoded
       information and place it in storage. Storage is the creation of a permanent record of information.
       In order for a memory to go into storage (i.e., long-term memory), it has to pass through three distinct stages:
       Sensory Memory, Short-Term Memory, and finally Long-Term Memory. These stages were first proposed by
       Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin (1968). Their model of human memory (Figure 8.4), called Atkinson
       and Shiffrin's model, is based on the belief that we process memories in the same way that a computer
       processes information.

       FIGURE 8.4 According to the Atkinson-Shiffrin model of memory, information passes through three distinct stages
       in order for it to be stored in long-term memory.
       Atkinson and Shiffrin's model is not the only model of memory. Baddeley and Hitch (1974) proposed a working
       memory model in which short-term memory has different forms. In their model, storing memories in short-
       term memory is like opening different files on a computer and adding information. The working memory files
       hold a limited amount of information. The type of short-term memory (or computer file) depends on the type
       of information received. There are memories in visual-spatial form, as well as memories of spoken or written
       material, and they are stored in three short-term systems: a visuospatial sketchpad, an episodic buffer
       (Baddeley, 2000), and a phonological loop. According to Baddeley and Hitch, a central executive part of
       memory supervises or controls the flow of information to and from the three short-term systems, and the
       central executive is responsible for moving information into long-term memory.
       Sensory Memory
       In the Atkinson-Shiffrin model, stimuli from the environment are processed first in sensory memory: storage
       of brief sensory events, such as sights, sounds, and tastes. It is very brief storage--up to a couple of seconds. We
       are constantly bombarded with sensory information. We cannot absorb all of it, or even most of it. And most of
       it has no impact on our lives. For example, what was your professor wearing the last class period? As long as
       the professor was dressed appropriately, it does not really matter what she was wearing. Sensory information
       about sights, sounds, smells, and even textures, which we do not view as valuable information, we discard. If
       we view something as valuable, the information will move into our short-term memory system.
       Short-Term Memory
       Short-term memory (STM) is a temporary storage system that processes incoming sensory memory. The
       terms short-term and working memory are sometimes used interchangeably, but they are not exactly the
       same. Short-term memory is more accurately described as a component of working memory. Short-term
       memory takes information from sensory memory and sometimes connects that memory to something already

                                                                                                                                                    8.1 · How Memory Functions 251

in long-term memory. Short-term memory storage lasts 15 to 30 seconds. Think of it as the information you
have displayed on your computer screen, such as a document, spreadsheet, or website. Then, information in
STM goes to long-term memory (you save it to your hard drive), or it is discarded (you delete a document or
close a web browser).

Rehearsal moves information from short-term memory to long-term memory. Active rehearsal is a way of
attending to information to move it from short-term to long-term memory. During active rehearsal, you repeat
(practice) the information to be remembered. If you repeat it enough, it may be moved into long-term memory.
For example, this type of active rehearsal is the way many children learn their ABCs by singing the alphabet
song. Alternatively, elaborative rehearsal is the act of linking new information you are trying to learn to
existing information that you already know. For example, if you meet someone at a party and your phone is
dead but you want to remember his phone number, which starts with area code 203, you might remember that
your uncle Abdul lives in Connecticut and has a 203 area code. This way, when you try to remember the phone
number of your new prospective friend, you will easily remember the area code. Craik and Lockhart (1972)
proposed the levels of processing hypothesis that states the deeper you think about something, the better you
remember it.

You may find yourself asking, "How much information can our memory handle at once?" To explore the
capacity and duration of your short-term memory, have a partner read the strings of random numbers (Figure
8.5) out loud to you, beginning each string by saying, "Ready?" and ending each by saying, "Recall," at which
point you should try to write down the string of numbers from memory.

FIGURE 8.5 Work through this series of numbers using the recall exercise explained above to determine the longest
string of digits that you can store.

Note the longest string at which you got the series correct. For most people, the capacity will probably be close
to 7 plus or minus 2. In 1956, George Miller reviewed most of the research on the capacity of short-term
memory and found that people can retain between 5 and 9 items, so he reported the capacity of short-term
memory was the "magic number" 7 plus or minus 2. However, more contemporary research has found
working memory capacity is 4 plus or minus 1 (Cowan, 2010). Generally, recall is somewhat better for random
numbers than for random letters (Jacobs, 1887) and also often slightly better for information we hear (acoustic
encoding) rather than information we see (visual encoding) (Anderson, 1969).

Memory trace decay and interference are two factors that affect short-term memory retention. Peterson and
Peterson (1959) investigated short-term memory using the three letter sequences called trigrams (e.g., CLS)
that had to be recalled after various time intervals between 3 and 18 seconds. Participants remembered about
80% of the trigrams after a 3-second delay, but only 10% after a delay of 18 seconds, which caused them to
conclude that short-term memory decayed in 18 seconds. During decay, the memory trace becomes less
activated over time, and the information is forgotten. However, Keppel and Underwood (1962) examined only
the first trials of the trigram task and found that proactive interference also affected short-term memory
retention. During proactive interference, previously learned information interferes with the ability to learn
new information. Both memory trace decay and proactive interference affect short-term memory. Once the
information reaches long-term memory, it has to be consolidated at both the synaptic level, which takes a few
hours, and into the memory system, which can take weeks or longer.

Long-term Memory

Long-term memory (LTM) is the continuous storage of information. Unlike short-term memory, long-term
memory storage capacity is believed to be unlimited. It encompasses all the things you can remember that
happened more than just a few minutes ago. One cannot really consider long-term memory without thinking
about the way it is organized. Really quickly, what is the first word that comes to mind when you hear "peanut
252 8 · Memory

       butter"? Did you think of jelly? If you did, you probably have associated peanut butter and jelly in your mind. It
       is generally accepted that memories are organized in semantic (or associative) networks (Collins & Loftus,
       1975). A semantic network consists of concepts, and as you may recall from what you've learned about
       memory, concepts are categories or groupings of linguistic information, images, ideas, or memories, such as
       life experiences. Although individual experiences and expertise can affect concept arrangement, concepts are
       believed to be arranged hierarchically in the mind (Anderson & Reder, 1999; Johnson & Mervis, 1997, 1998;
       Palmer, Jones, Hennessy, Unze, & Pick, 1989; Rosch, Mervis, Gray, Johnson, & Boyes-Braem, 1976; Tanaka &
       Taylor, 1991). Related concepts are linked, and the strength of the link depends on how often two concepts
       have been associated.

       Semantic networks differ depending on personal experiences. Importantly for memory, activating any part of a
       semantic network also activates the concepts linked to that part to a lesser degree. The process is known as
       spreading activation (Collins & Loftus, 1975). If one part of a network is activated, it is easier to access the
       associated concepts because they are already partially activated. When you remember or recall something,
       you activate a concept, and the related concepts are more easily remembered because they are partially
       activated. However, the activations do not spread in just one direction. When you remember something, you
       usually have several routes to get the information you are trying to access, and the more links you have to a
       concept, the better your chances of remembering.

       There are two types of long-term memory: explicit and implicit (Figure 8.6). Understanding the difference
       between explicit memory and implicit memory is important because aging, particular types of brain trauma,
       and certain disorders can impact explicit and implicit memory in different ways. Explicit memories are those
       we consciously try to remember, recall, and report. For example, if you are studying for your chemistry exam,
       the material you are learning will be part of your explicit memory. In keeping with the computer analogy, some
       information in your long-term memory would be like the information you have saved on the hard drive. It is
       not there on your desktop (your short-term memory), but most of the time you can pull up this information
       when you want it. Not all long-term memories are strong memories, and some memories can only be recalled
       using prompts. For example, you might easily recall a fact, such as the capital of the United States, but you
       might struggle to recall the name of the restaurant at which you had dinner when you visited a nearby city last
       summer. A prompt, such as that the restaurant was named after its owner, might help you recall the name of
       the restaurant. Explicit memory is sometimes referred to as declarative memory, because it can be put into
       words. Explicit memory is divided into episodic memory and semantic memory.

       about how memories are stored and retrieved.

       Episodic memory is information about events we have personally experienced (i.e., an episode). For instance,
       the memory of your last birthday is an episodic memory. Usually, episodic memory is reported as a story. The
       concept of episodic memory was first proposed about in the 1970s (Tulving, 1972). Since then, Tulving and
       others have reformulated the theory, and currently scientists believe that episodic memory is memory about
       happenings in particular places at particular times--the what, where, and when of an event (Tulving, 2002). It
       involves recollection of visual imagery as well as the feeling of familiarity (Hassabis & Maguire, 2007).
       Semantic memory is knowledge about words, concepts, and language-based knowledge and facts. Semantic
       memory is typically reported as facts. Semantic means having to do with language and knowledge about
       language. For example, answers to the following questions like "what is the definition of psychology" and "who
       was the first African American president of the United States" are stored in your semantic memory.

       Implicit memories are long-term memories that are not part of our consciousness. Although implicit
       memories are learned outside of our awareness and cannot be consciously recalled, implicit memory is
       demonstrated in the performance of some task (Roediger, 1990; Schacter, 1987). Implicit memory has been

studied with cognitive demand tasks, such as performance on artificial grammars (Reber, 1976), word memory
(Jacoby, 1983; Jacoby & Witherspoon, 1982), and learning unspoken and unwritten contingencies and rules
(Greenspoon, 1955; Giddan & Eriksen, 1959; Krieckhaus & Eriksen, 1960). Returning to the computer
metaphor, implicit memories are like a program running in the background, and you are not aware of their
influence. Implicit memories can influence observable behaviors as well as cognitive tasks. In either case, you
usually cannot put the memory into words that adequately describe the task. There are several types of
implicit memories, including procedural, priming, and emotional conditioning.

FIGURE 8.6 There are two components of long-term memory: explicit and implicit. Explicit memory includes
episodic and semantic memory. Implicit memory includes procedural memory and things learned through
conditioning.
Implicit procedural memory is often studied using observable behaviors (Adams, 1957; Lacey & Smith, 1954;
Lazarus & McCleary, 1951). Implicit procedural memory stores information about the way to do something,
and it is the memory for skilled actions, such as brushing your teeth, riding a bicycle, or driving a car. You were
probably not that good at riding a bicycle or driving a car the first time you tried, but you were much better
after doing those things for a year. Your improved bicycle riding was due to learning balancing abilities. You
likely thought about staying upright in the beginning, but now you just do it. Moreover, you probably are good
at staying balanced, but cannot tell someone the exact way you do it. Similarly, when you first learned to drive,
you probably thought about a lot of things that you just do now without much thought. When you first learned
to do these tasks, someone may have told you how to do them, but everything you learned since those
instructions that you cannot readily explain to someone else as the way to do it is implicit memory.
Implicit priming is another type of implicit memory (Schacter, 1992). During priming exposure to a stimulus
affects the response to a later stimulus. Stimuli can vary and may include words, pictures, and other stimuli to
elicit a response or increase recognition. For instance, some people really enjoy picnics. They love going into
nature, spreading a blanket on the ground, and eating a delicious meal. Now, unscramble the following letters
to make a word.

What word did you come up with? Chances are good that it was "plate."
Had you read, "Some people really enjoy growing flowers. They love going outside to their garden, fertilizing
their plants, and watering their flowers," you probably would have come up with the word "petal" instead of
254 8 · Memory

       plate.
       Do you recall the earlier discussion of semantic networks? The reason people are more likely to come up with
       "plate" after reading about a picnic is that plate is associated (linked) with picnic. Plate was primed by
       activating the semantic network. Similarly, "petal" is linked to flower and is primed by flower. Priming is also
       the reason you probably said jelly in response to peanut butter.
       Implicit emotional conditioning is the type of memory involved in classically conditioned emotion responses
       (Olson & Fazio, 2001). These emotional relationships cannot be reported or recalled but can be associated with
       different stimuli. For example, specific smells can cause specific emotional responses for some people. If there
       is a smell that makes you feel positive and nostalgic, and you don't know where that response comes from, it is
       an implicit emotional response. Similarly, most people have a song that causes a specific emotional response.
       That song's effect could be an implicit emotional memory (Yang, Xu, Du, Shi, & Fang, 2011).

                                                                                             EVERYDAY CONNECTION

        Can You Remember Everything You Ever Did or Said?

         Episodic memories are also called autobiographical memories. Let's quickly test your autobiographical memory.
         What were you wearing exactly five years ago today? What did you eat for lunch on April 10, 2009? You probably
         find it difficult, if not impossible, to answer these questions. Can you remember every event you have
         experienced over the course of your life--meals, conversations, clothing choices, weather conditions, and so on?
         Most likely none of us could even come close to answering these questions; however, American actress Marilu
         Henner, best known for the television show Taxi, can remember. She has an amazing and highly superior
         autobiographical memory (Figure 8.7).

         FIGURE 8.7 Marilu Henner's super autobiographical memory is known as hyperthymesia. (credit: Mark
         Richardson)
         Very few people can recall events in this way; right now, fewer than 20 have been identified as having this ability,
         and only a few have been studied (Parker, Cahill & McGaugh 2006). And although hyperthymesia normally
         appears in adolescence, two children in the United States appear to have memories from well before their tenth
         birthdays.

      Retrieval

       So you have worked hard to encode (via effortful processing) and store some important information for your
       upcoming final exam. How do you get that information back out of storage when you need it? The act of getting
       information out of memory storage and back into conscious awareness is known as retrieval. This would be

similar to finding and opening a paper you had previously saved on your computer's hard drive. Now it's back
on your desktop, and you can work with it again. Our ability to retrieve information from long-term memory is
vital to our everyday functioning. You must be able to retrieve information from memory in order to do
everything from knowing how to brush your hair and teeth, to driving to work, to knowing how to perform your
job once you get there.

There are three ways you can retrieve information out of your long-term memory storage system: recall,
recognition, and relearning. Recall is what we most often think about when we talk about memory retrieval: it
means you can access information without cues. For example, you would use recall for an essay test.
Recognition happens when you identify information that you have previously learned after encountering it
again. It involves a process of comparison. When you take a multiple-choice test, you are relying on
recognition to help you choose the correct answer. Here is another example. Let's say you graduated from high
school 10 years ago, and you have returned to your hometown for your 10-year reunion. You may not be able to
recall all of your classmates, but you recognize many of them based on their yearbook photos.

The third form of retrieval is relearning, and it's just what it sounds like. It involves learning information that
you previously learned. Whitney took Spanish in high school, but after high school she did not have the
opportunity to speak Spanish. Whitney is now 31, and her company has offered her an opportunity to work in
their Mexico City office. In order to prepare herself, she enrolls in a Spanish course at the local community
center. She's surprised at how quickly she's able to pick up the language after not speaking it for 13 years; this
is an example of relearning.

8.2 Parts of the Brain Involved with Memory

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Explain the brain functions involved in memory
  · Recognize the roles of the hippocampus, amygdala, and cerebellum

Are memories stored in just one part of the brain, or are they stored in many different parts of the brain? Karl
Lashley began exploring this problem, about 100 years ago, by making lesions in the brains of animals such as
rats and monkeys. He was searching for evidence of the engram: the group of neurons that serve as the
"physical representation of memory" (Josselyn, 2010). First, Lashley (1950) trained rats to find their way
through a maze. Then, he used the tools available at the time--in this case a soldering iron--to create lesions in
the rats' brains, specifically in the cerebral cortex. He did this because he was trying to erase the engram, or
the original memory trace that the rats had of the maze.

Lashley did not find evidence of the engram, and the rats were still able to find their way through the maze,
regardless of the size or location of the lesion. Based on his creation of lesions and the animals' reaction, he
formulated the equipotentiality hypothesis: if part of one area of the brain involved in memory is damaged,
another part of the same area can take over that memory function (Lashley, 1950). Although Lashley's early
work did not confirm the existence of the engram, modern psychologists are making progress locating it. For
example, Eric Kandel has spent decades studying the synapse and its role in controlling the flow of information
through neural circuits needed to store memories (Mayford, Siegelbaum, & Kandel, 2012).

Many scientists believe that the entire brain is involved with memory. However, since Lashley's research, other
scientists have been able to look more closely at the brain and memory. They have argued that memory is
located in specific parts of the brain, and specific neurons can be recognized for their involvement in forming
memories. The main parts of the brain involved with memory are the amygdala, the hippocampus, the
cerebellum, and the prefrontal cortex (Figure 8.8).
256 8 · Memory

       FIGURE 8.8 The amygdala is involved in fear and fear memories. The hippocampus is associated with declarative
       and episodic memory as well as recognition memory. The cerebellum plays a role in processing procedural
       memories, such as how to play the piano. The prefrontal cortex appears to be involved in remembering semantic
       tasks.

      The Amygdala

       First, let's look at the role of the amygdala in memory formation. The main job of the amygdala is to regulate
       emotions, such as fear and aggression (Figure 8.8). The amygdala plays a part in how memories are stored
       because storage is influenced by stress hormones. For example, one researcher experimented with rats and
       the fear response (Josselyn, 2010). Using Pavlovian conditioning, a neutral tone was paired with a foot shock to
       the rats. This produced a fear memory in the rats. After being conditioned, each time they heard the tone, they
       would freeze (a defense response in rats), indicating a memory for the impending shock. Then the researchers
       induced cell death in neurons in the lateral amygdala, which is the specific area of the brain responsible for
       fear memories. They found the fear memory faded (became extinct). Because of its role in processing
       emotional information, the amygdala is also involved in memory consolidation: the process of transferring
       new learning into long-term memory. The amygdala seems to facilitate encoding memories at a deeper level
       when the event is emotionally arousing.

           LINK TO LEARNING

       In this TED Talk called "A Mouse. A Laser Beam. A Manipulated Memory," (http://openstax.org/l/mousebeam)
       Steve Ramirez and Xu Liu from MIT talk about using laser beams to manipulate fear memory in rats. Find out
       why their work caused a media frenzy once it was published in Science.

      The Hippocampus

       Another group of researchers also experimented with rats to learn how the hippocampus functions in memory
       processing (Figure 8.8). They created lesions in the hippocampi of the rats, and found that the rats
       demonstrated memory impairment on various tasks, such as object recognition and maze running. They
       concluded that the hippocampus is involved in memory, specifically normal recognition memory as well as
       spatial memory (when the memory tasks are like recall tests) (Clark, Zola, & Squire, 2000). Another job of the
       hippocampus is to project information to cortical regions that give memories meaning and connect them with
       other memories. It also plays a part in memory consolidation: the process of transferring new learning into
       long-term memory.
       Injury to this area leaves us unable to process new declarative memories. One famous patient, known for years

only as H. M., had both his left and right temporal lobes (hippocampi) removed in an attempt to help control
the seizures he had been suffering from for years (Corkin, Amaral, González, Johnson, & Hyman, 1997). As a
result, his declarative memory was significantly affected, and he could not form new semantic knowledge. He
lost the ability to form new memories, yet he could still remember information and events that had occurred
prior to the surgery.

The Cerebellum and Prefrontal Cortex

Although the hippocampus seems to be more of a processing area for explicit memories, you could still lose it
and be able to create implicit memories (procedural memory, motor learning, and classical conditioning),
thanks to your cerebellum (Figure 8.8). For example, one classical conditioning experiment is to accustom
subjects to blink when they are given a puff of air to the eyes. When researchers damaged the cerebellums of
rabbits, they discovered that the rabbits were not able to learn the conditioned eye-blink response (Steinmetz,
1999; Green & Woodruff-Pak, 2000).

Other researchers have used brain scans, including positron emission tomography (PET) scans, to learn how
people process and retain information. From these studies, it seems the prefrontal cortex is involved. In one
study, participants had to complete two different tasks: either looking for the letter a in words (considered a
perceptual task) or categorizing a noun as either living or non-living (considered a semantic task) (Kapur et al.,
1994). Participants were then asked which words they had previously seen. Recall was much better for the
semantic task than for the perceptual task. According to PET scans, there was much more activation in the left
inferior prefrontal cortex in the semantic task. In another study, encoding was associated with left frontal
activity, while retrieval of information was associated with the right frontal region (Craik et al., 1999).

Neurotransmitters

There also appear to be specific neurotransmitters involved with the process of memory, such as epinephrine,
dopamine, serotonin, glutamate, and acetylcholine (Myhrer, 2003). There continues to be discussion and
debate among researchers as to which neurotransmitter plays which specific role (Blockland, 1996). Although
we don't yet know which role each neurotransmitter plays in memory, we do know that communication among
neurons via neurotransmitters is critical for developing new memories. Repeated activity by neurons leads to
increased neurotransmitters in the synapses and more efficient and more synaptic connections. This is how
memory consolidation occurs.

It is also believed that strong emotions trigger the formation of strong memories, and weaker emotional
experiences form weaker memories; this is called arousal theory (Christianson, 1992). For example, strong
emotional experiences can trigger the release of neurotransmitters, as well as hormones, which strengthen
memory; therefore, our memory for an emotional event is usually better than our memory for a non-emotional
event. When humans and animals are stressed, the brain secretes more of the neurotransmitter glutamate,
which helps them remember the stressful event (McGaugh, 2003). This is clearly evidenced by what is known
as the flashbulb memory phenomenon.

A flashbulb memory is an exceptionally clear recollection of an important event (Figure 8.9). Many people
who have lived through historic and momentous events can recall exactly where they were and how they heard
about them. For example, a Pew Research Center (2011) survey found that for those Americans who were age 8
or older at the time of 9/11 terrorist attacks, 97% can recall the moment they learned of this event, even a
decade after it happened. Many widely discussed examples of flashbulb memories pertain to national or global
events, but according to their initial definition by researchers Brown and Kulik (1977) as well as additional
work by more recent researchers, such a widely shared event is not required (Hirst & Phelps, 2016). Family
members might always remember how they heard about an important event in their lives, or people in a
school may recall nearly everything about the way they experienced a major event in that setting. And
although most studies (and many conversations) involve negative memories, positive events can also elicit
flashbulb memories.
258 8 · Memory

       FIGURE 8.9 Most people can remember where they were when they first heard about the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
       This is an example of a flashbulb memory: a record of an atypical and unusual event that has very strong emotional
       associations. (credit: Michael Foran)

                                                                                                                   DIG DEEPER
        Inaccurate and False Memories

         Even flashbulb memories for important events can have decreased accuracy with the passage of time. For
         example, on at least three occasions, when asked how he heard about the terrorist attacks of 9/11, President
         George W. Bush responded inaccurately. In January 2002, less than 4 months after the attacks, the then sitting
         President Bush was asked how he heard about the attacks. He responded:

               I was sitting there, and my Chief of Staff--well, first of all, when we walked into the classroom, I had
               seen this plane fly into the first building. There was a TV set on. And you know, I thought it was pilot
               error and I was amazed that anybody could make such a terrible mistake. (Greenberg, 2004, p. 2)
         Contrary to what President Bush stated, no one saw the first plane hit, except people on the ground near the twin
         towers. Video footage of the first plane was not recorded because it was a normal Tuesday morning, until the first
         plane hit.
         Memory is not like a video recording. Human memory, even flashbulb memories, can be frail. Different parts of
         them, such as the time, visual elements, and smells, are stored in different places. When something is
         remembered, these components have to be put back together for the complete memory, which is known as
         memory reconstruction. Each component creates a chance for an error to occur. False memory is remembering
         something that did not happen. Research participants have recalled hearing a word, even though they never
         heard the word (Roediger & McDermott, 2000).
         Do you remember where you were when you heard about a historic or perhaps a tragic event? Who were you with
         and what were you doing? What did you talk about? Can you contact those people you were with? Do they have
         the same memories as you or do they have different memories?

However, all of us have at times felt frustrated, and even embarrassed, when our memories have failed us.
There are several reasons why this happens.

Amnesia

Amnesia is the loss of long-term memory that occurs as the result of disease, physical trauma, or
psychological trauma. Endel Tulving (2002) and his colleagues at the University of Toronto studied K. C. for
years. K. C. suffered a traumatic head injury in a motorcycle accident and then had severe amnesia. Tulving
writes,

      the outstanding fact about K.C.'s mental make-up is his utter inability to remember any events,
      circumstances, or situations from his own life. His episodic amnesia covers his whole life, from birth
      to the present. The only exception is the experiences that, at any time, he has had in the last minute or
      two. (Tulving, 2002, p. 14)

Anterograde Amnesia

There are two common types of amnesia: anterograde amnesia and retrograde amnesia (Figure 8.10).
Anterograde amnesia is commonly caused by brain trauma, such as a blow to the head. With anterograde
amnesia, you cannot remember new information, although you can remember information and events that
happened prior to your injury. The hippocampus is usually affected (McLeod, 2011). This suggests that
damage to the brain has resulted in the inability to transfer information from short-term to long-term
memory; that is, the inability to consolidate memories.

Many people with this form of amnesia are unable to form new episodic or semantic memories, but are still
able to form new procedural memories (Bayley & Squire, 2002). This was true of H. M., which was discussed
earlier. The brain damage caused by his surgery resulted in anterograde amnesia. H. M. would read the same
magazine over and over, having no memory of ever reading it--it was always new to him. He also could not
remember people he had met after his surgery. If you were introduced to H. M. and then you left the room for a
few minutes, he would not know you upon your return and would introduce himself to you again. However,
when presented the same puzzle several days in a row, although he did not remember having seen the puzzle
before, his speed at solving it became faster each day (because of relearning) (Corkin, 1965, 1968).

FIGURE 8.10 This diagram illustrates the timeline of retrograde and anterograde amnesia. Memory problems that
extend back in time before the injury and prevent retrieval of information previously stored in long-term memory are
known as retrograde amnesia. Conversely, memory problems that extend forward in time from the point of injury
and prevent the formation of new memories are called anterograde amnesia.

       Retrograde Amnesia

       Retrograde amnesia is loss of memory for events that occurred prior to the trauma. People with retrograde
       amnesia cannot remember some or even all of their past. They have difficulty remembering episodic
       memories. What if you woke up in the hospital one day and there were people surrounding your bed claiming
       to be your spouse, your children, and your parents? The trouble is you don't recognize any of them. You were in
       a car accident, suffered a head injury, and now have retrograde amnesia. You don't remember anything about
       your life prior to waking up in the hospital. This may sound like the stuff of Hollywood movies, and Hollywood
       has been fascinated with the amnesia plot for nearly a century, going all the way back to the film Garden of Lies
       from 1915 to more recent movies such as the Jason Bourne spy thrillers. However, for real-life sufferers of
       retrograde amnesia, like former NFL football player Scott Bolzan, the story is not a Hollywood movie. Bolzan
       fell, hit his head, and deleted 46 years of his life in an instant. He is now living with one of the most extreme
       cases of retrograde amnesia on record.

      Memory Construction and Reconstruction

       The formulation of new memories is sometimes called construction, and the process of bringing up old
       memories is called reconstruction. Yet as we retrieve our memories, we also tend to alter and modify them. A
       memory pulled from long-term storage into short-term memory is flexible. New events can be added and we
       can change what we think we remember about past events, resulting in inaccuracies and distortions. People
       may not intend to distort facts, but it can happen in the process of retrieving old memories and combining
       them with new memories (Roediger & DeSoto, 2015).

       Suggestibility

       When someone witnesses a crime, that person's memory of the details of the crime is very important in
       catching the suspect. Because memory is so fragile, witnesses can be easily (and often accidentally) misled due
       to the problem of suggestibility. Suggestibility describes the effects of misinformation from external sources
       that leads to the creation of false memories. In the fall of 2002, a sniper in the DC area shot people at a gas
       station, leaving Home Depot, and walking down the street. These attacks went on in a variety of places for over
       three weeks and resulted in the deaths of ten people. During this time, as you can imagine, people were
       terrified to leave their homes, go shopping, or even walk through their neighborhoods. Police officers and the
       FBI worked frantically to solve the crimes, and a tip hotline was set up. Law enforcement received over 140,000
       tips, which resulted in approximately 35,000 possible suspects (Newseum, n.d.).

       Most of the tips were dead ends, until a white van was spotted at the site of one of the shootings. The police
       chief went on national television with a picture of the white van. After the news conference, several other
       eyewitnesses called to say that they too had seen a white van fleeing from the scene of the shooting. At the
       time, there were more than 70,000 white vans in the area. Police officers, as well as the general public, focused
       almost exclusively on white vans because they believed the eyewitnesses. Other tips were ignored. When the
       suspects were finally caught, they were driving a blue sedan.

       As illustrated by this example, we are vulnerable to the power of suggestion, simply based on something we see
       on the news. Or we can claim to remember something that in fact is only a suggestion someone made. It is the
       suggestion that is the cause of the false memory.

       Eyewitness Misidentification

       Even though memory and the process of reconstruction can be fragile, police officers, prosecutors, and the

courts often rely on eyewitness identification and testimony in the prosecution of criminals. However, faulty
eyewitness identification and testimony can lead to wrongful convictions (Figure 8.11).

FIGURE 8.11 In studying cases where DNA evidence has exonerated people from crimes, the Innocence Project
discovered that eyewitness misidentification is the leading cause of wrongful convictions (Benjamin N. Cardozo
School of Law, Yeshiva University, 2009).
How does this happen? In 1984, Jennifer Thompson, then a 22-year-old college student in North Carolina, was
brutally raped at knifepoint. As she was being raped, she tried to memorize every detail of her rapist's face and
physical characteristics, vowing that if she survived, she would help get him convicted. After the police were
contacted, a composite sketch was made of the suspect, and Jennifer was shown six photos. She chose two, one
of which was of Ronald Cotton. After looking at the photos for 4-5 minutes, she said, "Yeah. This is the one,"
and then she added, "I think this is the guy." When questioned about this by the detective who asked, "You're
sure? Positive?" She said that it was him. Then she asked the detective if she did OK, and he reinforced her
choice by telling her she did great. These kinds of unintended cues and suggestions by police officers can lead
witnesses to identify the wrong suspect. The district attorney was concerned about her lack of certainty the
first time, so she viewed a lineup of seven men. She said she was trying to decide between numbers 4 and 5,
finally deciding that Cotton, number 5, "Looks most like him." He was 22 years old.
By the time the trial began, Jennifer Thompson had absolutely no doubt that she was raped by Ronald Cotton.
She testified at the court hearing, and her testimony was compelling enough that it helped convict him. How
did she go from, "I think it's the guy" and it "Looks most like him," to such certainty? Gary Wells and Deah
Quinlivan (2009) assert it's suggestive police identification procedures, such as stacking lineups to make the
defendant stand out, telling the witness which person to identify, and confirming witnesses choices by telling
them "Good choice," or "You picked the guy."
After Cotton was convicted of the rape, he was sent to prison for life plus 50 years. After 4 years in prison, he
was able to get a new trial. Jennifer Thompson once again testified against him. This time Ronald Cotton was
given two life sentences. After serving 11 years in prison, DNA evidence finally demonstrated that Ronald
Cotton did not commit the rape, was innocent, and had served over a decade in prison for a crime he did not
commit.

        Preserving Eyewitness Memory: The Elizabeth Smart Case

         Contrast the Cotton case with what happened in the Elizabeth Smart case. When Elizabeth was 14 years old and
         fast asleep in her bed at home, she was abducted at knifepoint. Her nine-year-old sister, Mary Katherine, was
         sleeping in the same bed and watched, terrified, as her beloved older sister was abducted. Mary Katherine was
         the sole eyewitness to this crime and was very fearful. In the following weeks, the Salt Lake City police and the
         FBI proceeded with caution with Mary Katherine. They did not want to implant any false memories or mislead her
         in any way. They did not show her police line-ups or push her to do a composite sketch of the abductor. They
         knew if they corrupted her memory, Elizabeth might never be found. For several months, there was little or no
         progress on the case. Then, about 4 months after the kidnapping, Mary Katherine first recalled that she had
         heard the abductor's voice prior to that night (he had worked exactly one day as a handyman at the family's
         home) and then she was able to name the person whose voice it was. The family contacted the press and others
         recognized him--after a total of nine months, the suspect was caught and Elizabeth Smart was returned to her
         family.

       The Misinformation Effect
       Cognitive psychologist Elizabeth Loftus has conducted extensive research on memory. She has studied false
       memories as well as recovered memories of childhood sexual abuse. Loftus also developed the
       misinformation effect paradigm, which holds that after exposure to additional and possibly inaccurate
       information, a person may misremember the original event.
       According to Loftus, an eyewitness's memory of an event is very flexible due to the misinformation effect. To
       test this theory, Loftus and John Palmer (1974) asked 45 U.S. college students to estimate the speed of cars
       using different forms of questions (Figure 8.12). The participants were shown films of car accidents and were
       asked to play the role of the eyewitness and describe what happened. They were asked, "About how fast were
       the cars going when they (smashed, collided, bumped, hit, contacted) each other?" The participants estimated
       the speed of the cars based on the verb used.
       Participants who heard the word "smashed" estimated that the cars were traveling at a much higher speed
       than participants who heard the word "contacted." The implied information about speed, based on the verb
       they heard, had an effect on the participants' memory of the accident. In a follow-up one week later,
       participants were asked if they saw any broken glass (none was shown in the accident pictures). Participants
       who had been in the "smashed" group were more than twice as likely to indicate that they did remember
       seeing glass. Loftus and Palmer demonstrated that a leading question encouraged them to not only remember
       the cars were going faster, but to also falsely remember that they saw broken glass.

Controversies over Repressed and Recovered Memories
Other researchers have described how whole events, not just words, can be falsely recalled, even when they did
not happen. The idea that memories of traumatic events could be repressed has been a theme in the field of
psychology, beginning with Sigmund Freud, and the controversy surrounding the idea continues today.
Recall of false autobiographical memories is called false memory syndrome. This syndrome has received a lot
of publicity, particularly as it relates to memories of events that do not have independent witnesses--often the
only witnesses to the abuse are the perpetrator and the victim (e.g., sexual abuse).
On one side of the debate are those who have recovered memories of childhood abuse years after it occurred.
These researchers argue that some children's experiences have been so traumatizing and distressing that they
must lock those memories away in order to lead some semblance of a normal life. They believe that repressed
memories can be locked away for decades and later recalled intact through hypnosis and guided imagery
techniques (Devilly, 2007).
Research suggests that having no memory of childhood sexual abuse is quite common in adults. For instance,
one large-scale study conducted by John Briere and Jon Conte (1993) revealed that 59% of 450 men and
women who were receiving treatment for sexual abuse that had occurred before age 18 had forgotten their
experiences. Ross Cheit (2007) suggested that repressing these memories created psychological distress in
adulthood. The Recovered Memory Project was created so that victims of childhood sexual abuse can recall
these memories and allow the healing process to begin (Cheit, 2007; Devilly, 2007).
On the other side, Loftus has challenged the idea that individuals can repress memories of traumatic events
from childhood, including sexual abuse, and then recover those memories years later through therapeutic
techniques such as hypnosis, guided visualization, and age regression.
Loftus is not saying that childhood sexual abuse doesn't happen, but she does question whether or not those
memories are accurate, and she is skeptical of the questioning process used to access these memories, given
that even the slightest suggestion from the therapist can lead to misinformation effects. For example,
researchers Stephen Ceci and Maggie Brucks (1993, 1995) asked three-year-old children to use an
anatomically correct doll to show where their pediatricians had touched them during an exam. Fifty-five
percent of the children pointed to the genital/anal area on the dolls, even when they had not received any form
of genital exam.
264 8 · Memory

       Ever since Loftus published her first studies on the suggestibility of eyewitness testimony in the 1970s, social
       scientists, police officers, therapists, and legal practitioners have been aware of the flaws in interview
       practices. Consequently, steps have been taken to decrease suggestibility of witnesses. One way is to modify
       how witnesses are questioned. When interviewers use neutral and less leading language, children more
       accurately recall what happened and who was involved (Goodman, 2006; Pipe, 1996; Pipe, Lamb, Orbach, &
       Esplin, 2004). Another change is in how police lineups are conducted. It's recommended that a blind photo
       lineup be used. This way the person administering the lineup doesn't know which photo belongs to the
       suspect, minimizing the possibility of giving leading cues. Additionally, judges in some states now inform
       jurors about the possibility of misidentification. Judges can also suppress eyewitness testimony if they deem it
       unreliable.

      Forgetting

       "I've a grand memory for forgetting," quipped Robert Louis Stevenson. Forgetting refers to loss of information
       from long-term memory. We all forget things, like a loved one's birthday, someone's name, or where we put our
       car keys. As you've come to see, memory is fragile, and forgetting can be frustrating and even embarrassing.
       But why do we forget? To answer this question, we will look at several perspectives on forgetting.
       Encoding Failure
       Sometimes memory loss happens before the actual memory process begins, which is encoding failure. We
       can't remember something if we never stored it in our memory in the first place. This would be like trying to
       find a book on your e-reader that you never actually purchased and downloaded. Often, in order to remember
       something, we must pay attention to the details and actively work to process the information (effortful
       encoding). Lots of times we don't do this. For instance, think of how many times in your life you've seen a
       penny. Can you accurately recall what the front of a U.S. penny looks like? When researchers Raymond
       Nickerson and Marilyn Adams (1979) asked this question, they found that most Americans don't know which
       one it is. The reason is most likely encoding failure. Most of us never encode the details of the penny. We only
       encode enough information to be able to distinguish it from other coins. If we don't encode the information,
       then it's not in our long-term memory, so we will not be able to remember it.

       FIGURE 8.13 Can you tell which coin, (a), (b), (c), or (d) is the accurate depiction of a US nickel? The correct answer
       is (c).
       Memory Errors
       Psychologist Daniel Schacter (2001), a well-known memory researcher, offers seven ways our memories fail us.
       He calls them the seven sins of memory and categorizes them into three groups: forgetting, distortion, and
       intrusion (Table 8.1).

TABLE 8.1

Let's look at the first sin of the forgetting errors: transience, which means that memories can fade over time.
Here's an example of how this happens. Nathan's English teacher has assigned his students to read the novel
To Kill a Mockingbird. Nathan comes home from school and tells his mom he has to read this book for class.
"Oh, I loved that book!" she says. Nathan asks her what the book is about, and after some hesitation she says,
"Well . . . I know I read the book in high school, and I remember that one of the main characters is named
Scout, and her father is an attorney, but I honestly don't remember anything else." Nathan wonders if his
mother actually read the book, and his mother is surprised she can't recall the plot. What is going on here is
storage decay: unused information tends to fade with the passage of time.

In 1885, German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus analyzed the process of memorization. First, he
memorized lists of nonsense syllables. Then he measured how much he learned (retained) when he attempted
to relearn each list. He tested himself over different periods of time from 20 minutes later to 30 days later. The
result is his famous forgetting curve (Figure 8.14). Due to storage decay, an average person will lose 50% of the
memorized information after 20 minutes and 70% of the information after 24 hours (Ebbinghaus, 1885/1964).
Your memory for new information decays quickly and then eventually levels out.
266 8 · Memory

                FIGURE 8.14 The Ebbinghaus forgetting curve shows how quickly memory for new information decays.
       Are you constantly losing your cell phone? Have you ever driven back home to make sure you turned off the
       stove? Have you ever walked into a room for something, but forgotten what it was? You probably answered yes
       to at least one, if not all, of these examples--but don't worry, you are not alone. We are all prone to committing
       the memory error known as absentmindedness, which describes lapses in memory caused by breaks in
       attention or our focus being somewhere else.
       Cynthia, a psychologist, recalls a time when she recently committed the memory error of absentmindedness.

             When I was completing court-ordered psychological evaluations, each time I went to the court, I was
             issued a temporary identification card with a magnetic strip which would open otherwise locked
             doors. As you can imagine, in a courtroom, this identification is valuable and important and no one
             wanted it to be lost or be picked up by a criminal. At the end of the day, I would hand in my temporary
             identification. One day, when I was almost done with an evaluation, my daughter's day care called and
             said she was sick and needed to be picked up. It was flu season, I didn't know how sick she was, and I
             was concerned. I finished up the evaluation in the next ten minutes, packed up my briefcase, and
             rushed to drive to my daughter's day care. After I picked up my daughter, I could not remember if I had
             handed back my identification or if I had left it sitting out on a table. I immediately called the court to
             check. It turned out that I had handed back my identification. Why could I not remember that?
             (personal communication, September 5, 2013)
       When have you experienced absentmindedness?
       "I just streamed this movie called Oblivion, and it had that famous actor in it. Oh, what's his name? He's been
       in all of those movies, like The Shawshank Redemption and The Dark Knight trilogy. I think he's even won an
       Oscar. Oh gosh, I can picture his face in my mind, and hear his distinctive voice, but I just can't think of his
       name! This is going to bug me until I can remember it!" This particular error can be so frustrating because you
       have the information right on the tip of your tongue. Have you ever experienced this? If so, you've committed
       the error known as blocking: you can't access stored information (Figure 8.15).

Now let's take a look at the three errors of distortion: misattribution, suggestibility, and bias. Misattribution
happens when you confuse the source of your information. Let's say Alejandra was dating Lucia and they saw
the first Hobbit movie together. Then they broke up and Alejandra saw the second Hobbit movie with someone
else. Later that year, Alejandra and Lucia get back together. One day, they are discussing how the Hobbit books
and movies are different and Alejandra says to Lucia, "I loved watching the second movie with you and seeing
you jump out of your seat during that super scary part." When Lucia responded with a puzzled and then angry
look, Alejandra realized she'd committed the error of misattribution.
What if someone is a victim of rape shortly after watching a television program? Is it possible that the victim
could actually blame the rape on the person she saw on television because of misattribution? This is exactly
what happened to Donald Thomson.

      Australian eyewitness expert Donald Thomson appeared on a live TV discussion about the
      unreliability of eyewitness memory. He was later arrested, placed in a lineup and identified by a victim
      as the man who had raped her. The police charged Thomson although the rape had occurred at the
      time he was on TV. They dismissed his alibi that he was in plain view of a TV audience and in the
      company of the other discussants, including an assistant commissioner of police. . . . Eventually, the
      investigators discovered that the rapist had attacked the woman as she was watching TV--the very
      program on which Thomson had appeared. Authorities eventually cleared Thomson. The woman had
      confused the rapist's face with the face that she had seen on TV. (Baddeley, 2004, p. 133)
The second distortion error is suggestibility. Suggestibility is similar to misattribution, since it also involves
false memories, but it's different. With misattribution you create the false memory entirely on your own, which
is what the victim did in the Donald Thomson case above. With suggestibility, it comes from someone else,
such as a therapist or police interviewer asking leading questions of a witness during an interview.
Memories can also be affected by bias, which is the final distortion error. Schacter (2001) says that your
feelings and view of the world can actually distort your memory of past events. There are several types of bias:
268 8 · Memory

         · Stereotypical bias involves racial and gender biases. For example, when Asian American and European
             American research participants were presented with a list of names, they more frequently incorrectly
             remembered typical African American names such as Jamal and Tyrone to be associated with the
             occupation basketball player, and they more frequently incorrectly remembered typical White names such
             as Greg and Howard to be associated with the occupation of politician (Payne, Jacoby, & Lambert, 2004).

         · Egocentric bias involves enhancing our memories of the past (Payne et al., 2004). Did you really score the
             winning goal in that big soccer match, or did you just assist?

         · Hindsight bias happens when we think an outcome was inevitable after the fact. This is the "I knew it all
             along" phenomenon. The reconstructive nature of memory contributes to hindsight bias (Carli, 1999). We
             remember untrue events that seem to confirm that we knew the outcome all along.

       Have you ever had a song play over and over in your head? How about a memory of a traumatic event,
       something you really do not want to think about? When you keep remembering something, to the point where
       you can't "get it out of your head" and it interferes with your ability to concentrate on other things, it is called
       persistence. It's Schacter's seventh and last memory error. It's actually a failure of our memory system
       because we involuntarily recall unwanted memories, particularly unpleasant ones (Figure 8.16). For instance,
       you witness a horrific car accident on the way to work one morning, and you can't concentrate on work
       because you keep remembering the scene.

       Interference
       Sometimes information is stored in our memory, but for some reason it is inaccessible. This is known as
       interference, and there are two types: proactive interference and retroactive interference (Figure 8.17). Have
       you ever gotten a new phone number or moved to a new address, but right after you tell people the old (and
       wrong) phone number or address? When the new year starts, do you find you accidentally write the previous
       year? These are examples of proactive interference: when old information hinders the recall of newly learned
       information. Retroactive interference happens when information learned more recently hinders the recall of
       older information. For example, this week you are studying about memory and learn about the Ebbinghaus
       forgetting curve. Next week you study lifespan development and learn about Erikson's theory of psychosocial
       development, but thereafter have trouble remembering Ebbinghaus's work because you can only remember
       Erickson's theory.

8.4 Ways to Enhance Memory

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Recognize and apply memory-enhancing strategies
  · Recognize and apply effective study techniques
Most of us suffer from memory failures of one kind or another, and most of us would like to improve our
memories so that we don't forget where we put the car keys or, more importantly, the material we need to know
for an exam. In this section, we'll look at some ways to help you remember better, and at some strategies for
more effective studying.

Memory-Enhancing Strategies

What are some everyday ways we can improve our memory, including recall? To help make sure information
goes from short-term memory to long-term memory, you can use memory-enhancing strategies. One
strategy is rehearsal, or the conscious repetition of information to be remembered (Craik & Watkins, 1973).
Think about how you learned your multiplication tables as a child. You may recall that 6 x 6 = 36, 6 x 7 = 42,
and 6 x 8 = 48. Memorizing these facts is rehearsal.
Another strategy is chunking: you organize information into manageable bits or chunks (Bodie, Powers, &
Fitch-Hauser, 2006). Chunking is useful when trying to remember information like dates and phone numbers.
Instead of trying to remember 5205550467, you remember the number as 520-555-0467. So, if you met an
interesting person at a party and you wanted to remember his phone number, you would naturally chunk it,
and you could repeat the number over and over, which is the rehearsal strategy.

     LINK TO LEARNING

Try this fun activity that employs a memory-enhancing strategy (http://openstax.org/l/memgame) to learn
more.

You could also enhance memory by using elaborative rehearsal: a technique in which you think about the
meaning of new information and its relation to knowledge already stored in your memory (Tigner, 1999).
Elaborative rehearsal involves both linking the information to knowledge already stored and repeating the
information. For example, in this case, you could remember that 520 is an area code for Arizona and the
person you met is from Arizona. This would help you better remember the 520 prefix. If the information is
270 8 · Memory

       retained, it goes into long-term memory.
       Mnemonic devices are memory aids that help us organize information for encoding (Figure 8.18). They are
       especially useful when we want to recall larger bits of information such as steps, stages, phases, and parts of a
       system (Bellezza, 1981). Brian needs to learn the order of the planets in the solar system, but he's having a
       hard time remembering the correct order. His friend Kelly suggests a mnemonic device that can help him
       remember. Kelly tells Brian to simply remember the name Mr. VEM J. SUN, and he can easily recall the correct
       order of the planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. You might use a
       mnemonic device to help you remember someone's name, a mathematical formula, or the order of
       mathematical operations.

       FIGURE 8.18 This is a knuckle mnemonic to help you remember the number of days in each month. Months with 31
       days are represented by the protruding knuckles and shorter months fall in the spots between knuckles. (credit:
       modification of work by Cory Zanker)
       If you have ever watched the television show Modern Family, you might have seen Phil Dunphy explain how he
       remembers names:

             The other day I met this guy named Carl. Now, I might forget that name, but he was wearing a Grateful
             Dead t-shirt. What's a band like the Grateful Dead? Phish. Where do fish live? The ocean. What else
             lives in the ocean? Coral. Hello, Co-arl. (Wrubel & Spiller, 2010)
       It seems the more vivid or unusual the mnemonic, the easier it is to remember. The key to using any
       mnemonic successfully is to find a strategy that works for you.

       Joshua Foer is a science writer who "accidentally" won the U.S. Memory Championships. Watch his TEDTalk,
       titled "Feats of Memory Anyone Can Do," in which he explains a mnemonic device called the memory palace
       (http://openstax.org/l/foer) to learn more.

       Some other strategies that are used to improve memory include expressive writing and saying words aloud.
       Expressive writing helps boost your short-term memory, particularly if you write about a traumatic experience
       in your life. Masao Yogo and Shuji Fujihara (2008) had participants write for 20-minute intervals several times
       per month. The participants were instructed to write about a traumatic experience, their best possible future
       selves, or a trivial topic. The researchers found that this simple writing task increased short-term memory
       capacity after five weeks, but only for the participants who wrote about traumatic experiences. Psychologists

can't explain why this writing task works, but it does.
What if you want to remember items you need to pick up at the store? Simply say them out loud to yourself. A
series of studies (MacLeod, Gopie, Hourihan, Neary, & Ozubko, 2010) found that saying a word out loud
improves your memory for the word because it increases the word's distinctiveness. Feel silly, saying random
grocery items aloud? This technique works equally well if you just mouth the words. Using these techniques
increased participants' memory for the words by more than 10%. These techniques can also be used to help
you study.

How to Study Effectively

Based on the information presented in this chapter, here are some strategies and suggestions to help you hone
your study techniques (Figure 8.19). The key with any of these strategies is to figure out what works best for
you.

             FIGURE 8.19 Memory techniques can be useful when studying for class. (credit: Barry Pousman)
  · Use elaborative rehearsal: In a famous article, Fergus Craik and Robert Lockhart (1972) discussed their

      belief that information we process more deeply goes into long-term memory. Their theory is called levels
      of processing. If we want to remember a piece of information, we should think about it more deeply and
      link it to other information and memories to make it more meaningful. For example, if we are trying to
      remember that the hippocampus is involved with memory processing, we might envision a hippopotamus
      with excellent memory and then we could better remember the hippocampus.
  · Apply the self-reference effect: As you go through the process of elaborative rehearsal, it would be even
      more beneficial to make the material you are trying to memorize personally meaningful to you. In other
      words, make use of the self-reference effect. Write notes in your own words. Write definitions from the
      text, and then rewrite them in your own words. Relate the material to something you have already learned
      for another class, or think how you can apply the concepts to your own life. When you do this, you are
      building a web of retrieval cues that will help you access the material when you want to remember it.
  · Use distributed practice: Study across time in short durations rather than trying to cram it all in at once.
      Memory consolidation takes time, and studying across time allows time for memories to consolidate. In
      addition, cramming can cause the links between concepts to become so active that you get stuck in a link,
      and it prevents you from accessing the rest of the information that you learned.
  · Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse: Review the material over time, in spaced and organized study sessions.
      Organize and study your notes, and take practice quizzes/exams. Link the new information to other
      information you already know well.
  · Study efficiently: Students are great highlighters, but highlighting is not very efficient because students
      spend too much time studying the things they already learned. Instead of highlighting, use index cards.
      Write the question on one side and the answer on the other side. When you study, separate your cards into
272 8 · Memory

             those you got right and those you got wrong. Study the ones you got wrong and keep sorting. Eventually, all
             your cards will be in the pile you answered correctly.
         · Be aware of interference: To reduce the likelihood of interference, study during a quiet time without
             interruptions or distractions (like television or music).
         · Keep moving: Of course you already know that exercise is good for your body, but did you also know it's
             also good for your mind? Research suggests that regular aerobic exercise (anything that gets your heart
             rate elevated) is beneficial for memory (van Praag, 2008). Aerobic exercise promotes neurogenesis: the
             growth of new brain cells in the hippocampus, an area of the brain known to play a role in memory and
             learning.
         · Get enough sleep: While you are sleeping, your brain is still at work. During sleep the brain organizes and
             consolidates information to be stored in long-term memory (Abel & Bäuml, 2013).
         · Make use of mnemonic devices: As you learned earlier in this chapter, mnemonic devices often help us to
             remember and recall information. There are different types of mnemonic devices, such as the acronym.
             An acronym is a word formed by the first letter of each of the words you want to remember. For example,
             even if you live near one, you might have difficulty recalling the names of all five Great Lakes. What if I told
             you to think of the word Homes? HOMES is an acronym that represents Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie,
             and Superior: the five Great Lakes. Another type of mnemonic device is an acrostic: you make a phrase of
             all the first letters of the words. For example, if you are taking a math test and you are having difficulty
             remembering the order of operations, recalling the following sentence will help you: "Please Excuse My
             Dear Aunt Sally," because the order of mathematical operations is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication,
             Division, Addition, Subtraction. There also are jingles, which are rhyming tunes that contain key words
             related to the concept, such as i before e, except after c.

Summary

8.1 How Memory Functions

Memory is a system or process that stores what we learn for future use.

Our memory has three basic functions: encoding, storing, and retrieving information. Encoding is the act of
getting information into our memory system through automatic or effortful processing. Storage is retention of
the information, and retrieval is the act of getting information out of storage and into conscious awareness
through recall, recognition, and relearning. The idea that information is processed through three memory
systems is called the Atkinson-Shiffrin model of memory. First, environmental stimuli enter our sensory
memory for a period of less than a second to a few seconds. Those stimuli that we notice and pay attention to
then move into short-term memory. According to the Atkinson-Shiffrin model, if we rehearse this information,
then it moves into long-term memory for permanent storage. Other models like that of Baddeley and Hitch
suggest there is more of a feedback loop between short-term memory and long-term memory. Long-term
memory has a practically limitless storage capacity and is divided into implicit and explicit memory.

8.2 Parts of the Brain Involved with Memory

Beginning with Karl Lashley, researchers and psychologists have been searching for the engram, which is the
physical trace of memory. Lashley did not find the engram, but he did suggest that memories are distributed
throughout the entire brain rather than stored in one specific area. Now we know that three brain areas do play
significant roles in the processing and storage of different types of memories: cerebellum, hippocampus, and
amygdala. The cerebellum's job is to process procedural memories; the hippocampus is where new memories
are encoded; the amygdala helps determine what memories to store, and it plays a part in determining where
the memories are stored based on whether we have a strong or weak emotional response to the event. Strong
emotional experiences can trigger the release of neurotransmitters, as well as hormones, which strengthen
memory, so that memory for an emotional event is usually stronger than memory for a non-emotional event.
This is shown by what is known as the flashbulb memory phenomenon: our ability to remember significant life
events. However, our memory for life events (autobiographical memory) is not always accurate.

8.3 Problems with Memory

All of us at times have felt dismayed, frustrated, and even embarrassed when our memories have failed us. Our
memory is flexible and prone to many errors, which is why eyewitness testimony has been found to be largely
unreliable. There are several reasons why forgetting occurs. In cases of brain trauma or disease, forgetting may
be due to amnesia. Another reason we forget is due to encoding failure. We can't remember something if we
never stored it in our memory in the first place. Schacter presents seven memory errors that also contribute to
forgetting. Sometimes, information is actually stored in our memory, but we cannot access it due to
interference. Proactive interference happens when old information hinders the recall of newly learned
information. Retroactive interference happens when information learned more recently hinders the recall of
older information.

8.4 Ways to Enhance Memory

There are many ways to combat the inevitable failures of our memory system. Some common strategies that
can be used in everyday situations include mnemonic devices, rehearsal, self-referencing, and adequate sleep.
These same strategies also can help you to study more effectively.

have grown and developed into the person you are today. We also look at some ideas about who you will grow
into tomorrow. Yours is a story of lifespan development (Figure 9.1), from the start of life to the end.
The process of human growth and development is more obvious in infancy and childhood, yet your
development is happening this moment and will continue, minute by minute, for the rest of your life. Who you
are today and who you will be in the future depends on a blend of genetics, environment, culture,
relationships, and more, as you continue through each phase of life. You have experienced firsthand much of
what is discussed in this chapter. Now consider what psychological science has to say about your physical,
cognitive, and psychosocial development, from the womb to the tomb.

       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Define and distinguish between the three domains of development: physical, cognitive and psychosocial
         · Discuss the normative approach to development
         · Understand the three major issues in development: continuity and discontinuity, one common course of

             development or many unique courses of development, and nature versus nurture

             My heart leaps up when I behold
             A rainbow in the sky:
             So was it when my life began;
             So is it now I am a man;
             So be it when I shall grow old,
             Or let me die!
             The Child is father of the Man;
             I could wish my days to be
             Bound each to each by natural piety. (Wordsworth, 1802)

       In this poem, William Wordsworth writes, "the child is father of the man." What does this seemingly
       incongruous statement mean, and what does it have to do with lifespan development? Wordsworth might be
       suggesting that the person he is as an adult depends largely on the experiences he had in childhood. Consider
       the following questions: To what extent is the adult you are today influenced by the child you once were? To
       what extent is a child fundamentally different from the adult he grows up to be?

       These are the types of questions developmental psychologists try to answer, by studying how humans change
       and grow from conception through childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and death. They view development as a
       lifelong process that can be studied scientifically across three developmental domains--physical, cognitive,
       and psychosocial development. Physical development involves growth and changes in the body and brain, the
       senses, motor skills, and health and wellness. Cognitive development involves learning, attention, memory,
       language, thinking, reasoning, and creativity. Psychosocial development involves emotions, personality, and
       social relationships. We refer to these domains throughout the chapter.

                CONNECT THE CONCEPTS

      Research Methods in Developmental Psychology

       You've learned about a variety of research methods used by psychologists. Developmental psychologists use many
       of these approaches in order to better understand how individuals change mentally and physically over time. These
       methods include naturalistic observations, case studies, surveys, and experiments, among others.

       Naturalistic observations involve observing behavior in its natural context. A developmental psychologist might
       observe how children behave on a playground, at a daycare center, or in the child's own home. While this research
       approach provides a glimpse into how children behave in their natural settings, researchers have very little control
       over the types and/or frequencies of displayed behavior.

       In a case study, developmental psychologists collect a great deal of information from one individual in order to
       better understand physical and psychological changes over the lifespan. This particular approach is an excellent way
       to better understand individuals, who are exceptional in some way, but it is especially prone to researcher bias in
       interpretation, and it is difficult to generalize conclusions to the larger population.

       In one classic example of this research method being applied to a study of lifespan development Sigmund Freud
       analyzed the development of a child known as "Little Hans" (Freud, 1909/1949). Freud's findings helped inform his
       theories of psychosexual development in children, which you will learn about later in this chapter. Little Genie, the

subject of a case study discussed in the chapter on thinking and intelligence, provides another example of how
psychologists examine developmental milestones through detailed research on a single individual. In Genie's case,
her neglectful and abusive upbringing led to her being unable to speak until, at age 13, she was removed from that
harmful environment. As she learned to use language, psychologists were able to compare how her language
acquisition abilities differed when occurring in her late-stage development compared to the typical acquisition of
those skills during the ages of infancy through early childhood (Fromkin, Krashen, Curtiss, Rigler, & Rigler, 1974;
Curtiss, 1981).

The survey method asks individuals to self-report important information about their thoughts, experiences, and
beliefs. This particular method can provide large amounts of information in relatively short amounts of time;
however, validity of data collected in this way relies on honest self-reporting, and the data is relatively shallow when
compared to the depth of information collected in a case study. An example of comprehensive survey was the
research done by Ruth W. Howard. In 1934, she obtained her doctorate by surveying 229 sets of triplets, the most
comprehensive research of triplets completed at the time. This pioneering woman was also the first African-
American woman to earn a PhD in psychology (American Psychological Association, 2019).

Experiments involve significant control over extraneous variables and manipulation of the independent variable. As
such, experimental research allows developmental psychologists to make causal statements about certain variables
that are important for the developmental process. Because experimental research must occur in a controlled
environment, researchers must be cautious about whether behaviors observed in the laboratory translate to an
individual's natural environment.

Later in this chapter, you will learn about several experiments in which toddlers and young children observe scenes
or actions so that researchers can determine at what age specific cognitive abilities develop. For example, children
may observe a quantity of liquid poured from a short, fat glass into a tall, skinny glass. As the experimenters
question the children about what occurred, the subjects' answers help psychologists understand at what age a child
begins to comprehend that the volume of liquid remained the same although the shapes of the containers differs.

Across these three domains--physical, cognitive, and psychosocial--the normative approach to development
is also discussed. This approach asks, "What is normal development?" In the early decades of the 20th century,
normative psychologists studied large numbers of children at various ages to determine norms (i.e., average
ages) of when most children reach specific developmental milestones in each of the three domains (Gesell,
1933, 1939, 1940; Gesell & Ilg, 1946; Hall, 1904). Although children develop at slightly different rates, we can
use these age-related averages as general guidelines to compare children with same-age peers to determine
the approximate ages they should reach specific normative events called developmental milestones (e.g.,
crawling, walking, writing, dressing, naming colors, speaking in sentences, and starting puberty).

Not all normative events are universal, meaning they are not experienced by all individuals across all cultures.
Biological milestones, such as puberty, tend to be universal, but social milestones, such as the age when
children begin formal schooling, are not necessarily universal; instead, they affect most individuals in a
particular culture (Gesell & Ilg, 1946). For example, in developed countries children begin school around 5 or 6
years old, but in developing countries, like Nigeria, children often enter school at an advanced age, if at all
(Huebler, 2005; United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization [UNESCO], 2013).

To better understand the normative approach, imagine two new mothers, Louisa and Kimberly, who are close
friends and have children around the same age. Louisa's daughter is 14 months old, and Kimberly's son is 12
months old. According to the normative approach, the average age a child starts to walk is 12 months.
However, at 14 months Louisa's daughter still isn't walking. She tells Kimberly she is worried that something
might be wrong with her baby. Kimberly is surprised because her son started walking when he was only 10
months old. Should Louisa be worried? Should she be concerned if her daughter is not walking by 15 months
or 18 months?

      Issues in Developmental Psychology

       There are many different theoretical approaches regarding human development. As we evaluate them in this
       chapter, recall that developmental psychology focuses on how people change, and keep in mind that all the
       approaches that we present in this chapter address questions of change: Is the change smooth or uneven
       (continuous versus discontinuous)? Is this pattern of change the same for everyone, or are there many
       different patterns of change (one course of development versus many courses)? How do genetics and
       environment interact to influence development (nature versus nurture)?
       Is Development Continuous or Discontinuous?
       Continuous development views development as a cumulative process, gradually improving on existing skills
       (Figure 9.2). With this type of development, there is gradual change. Consider, for example, a child's physical
       growth: adding inches to height year by year. In contrast, theorists who view development as discontinuous
       believe that development takes place in unique stages: It occurs at specific times or ages. With this type of
       development, the change is more sudden, such as an infant's ability to conceive object permanence.

       FIGURE 9.2 The concept of continuous development can be visualized as a smooth slope of progression, whereas
       discontinuous development sees growth in more discrete stages.
       Is There One Course of Development or Many?
       Is development essentially the same, or universal, for all children (i.e., there is one course of development) or
       does development follow a different course for each child, depending on the child's specific genetics and
       environment (i.e., there are many courses of development)? Do people across the world share more similarities
       or more differences in their development? How much do culture and genetics influence a child's behavior?
       Stage theories hold that the sequence of development is universal. For example, in cross-cultural studies of
       language development, children from around the world reach language milestones in a similar sequence
       (Gleitman & Newport, 1995). Infants in all cultures coo before they babble. They begin babbling at about the
       same age and utter their first word around 12 months old. Yet we live in diverse contexts that have a unique
       effect on each of us. For example, researchers once believed that motor development follows one course for all
       children regardless of culture. However, child care practices vary by culture, and different practices have been
       found to accelerate or inhibit achievement of developmental milestones such as sitting, crawling, and walking
       (Karasik, Adolph, Tamis-LeMonda, & Bornstein, 2010).
       For instance, let's look at the Aché society in Paraguay. They spend a significant amount of time foraging in

                                                                                                                                        9.1 · What Is Lifespan Development? 283

forests. While foraging, Aché mothers carry their young children, rarely putting them down in order to protect
them from getting hurt in the forest. Consequently, their children walk much later: They walk around 23-25
months old, in comparison to infants in Western cultures who begin to walk around 12 months old. However,
as Aché children become older, they are allowed more freedom to move about, and by about age 9, their motor
skills surpass those of U.S. children of the same age: Aché children are able to climb trees up to 25 feet tall and
use machetes to chop their way through the forest (Kaplan & Dove, 1987). As you can see, our development is
influenced by multiple contexts, so the timing of basic motor functions may vary across cultures. However, the
functions themselves are present in all societies (Figure 9.3).

How Do Nature and Nurture Influence Development?
Are we who we are because of nature (biology and genetics), or are we who we are because of nurture (our
environment and culture)? This longstanding question is known in psychology as the nature versus nurture
debate. It seeks to understand how our personalities and traits are the product of our genetic makeup and
biological factors, and how they are shaped by our environment, including our guardians, peers, and culture.
For instance, why do biological children sometimes act like their parents--is it because of genetics or because
of early childhood environment and what the child has learned from the parents? What about children who are
adopted--are they more like their biological families or more like their adoptive families? And how can siblings
from the same family be so different?
We are all born with specific genetic traits inherited from our parents, such as eye color, height, and certain
personality traits. Beyond our basic genotype, however, there is a deep interaction between our genes and our
environment: Our unique experiences in our environment influence whether and how particular traits are
expressed, and at the same time, our genes influence how we interact with our environment (Diamond, 2009;
Lobo, 2008). This chapter will show that there is a reciprocal interaction between nature and nurture as they
both shape who we become, but the debate continues as to the relative contributions of each.

                                                                                                             DIG DEEPER

 The Achievement Gap: How Does Socioeconomic Status Affect Development?

  The achievement gap refers to the persistent difference in grades, test scores, and graduation rates that exist
  among students of different ethnicities, races, and--in certain subjects--genders (Winerman, 2011). Research
  suggests that these achievement gaps are strongly influenced by differences in socioeconomic factors that exist
  among the families of these children. While the researchers acknowledge that programs aimed at reducing such
  socioeconomic discrepancies would likely aid in equalizing the aptitude and performance of children from
  different backgrounds, they recognize that such large-scale interventions would be difficult to achieve. Therefore,
  it is recommended that programs aimed at fostering aptitude and achievement among disadvantaged children
  may be the best option for dealing with issues related to academic achievement gaps (Duncan & Magnuson,
284 9 · Lifespan Development

         2005).

         Children from low-income households perform significantly more poorly than their middle- and high-income
         peers on a number of educational variables: They have significantly lower standardized test scores, graduation
         rates, and college entrance rates, and they have much higher school dropout rates. There have been attempts to
         correct the achievement gap through state and federal legislation, but what if the problems start before the
         children even enter school?

         Psychologists Betty Hart and Todd Risley (2006) spent their careers looking at early language ability and
         progression of children in various income levels. In one longitudinal study, they found that although all the
         parents in the study engaged and interacted with their children, middle- and high-income parents interacted with
         their children differently than low-income parents. After analyzing 1,300 hours of parent-child interactions, the
         researchers found that middle- and high-income parents talk to their children significantly more, starting when
         the children are infants. By 3 years old, high-income children knew almost double the number of words known by
         their low-income counterparts, and they had heard an estimated total of 30 million more words than the low-
         income counterparts (Hart & Risley, 2003). And the gaps only become more pronounced. Before entering
         kindergarten, high-income children score 60% higher on achievement tests than their low-income peers (Lee &
         Burkam, 2002).

         There are solutions to this problem. At the University of Chicago, experts are working with low-income families,
         visiting them at their homes, and encouraging them to speak more to their children on a daily and hourly basis.
         Other experts are designing preschools in which students from diverse economic backgrounds are placed in the
         same classroom. In this research, low-income children made significant gains in their language development,
         likely as a result of attending the specialized preschool (Schechter & Byeb, 2007). What other methods or
         interventions could be used to decrease the achievement gap? What types of activities could be implemented to
         help the children of your community or a neighboring community?

     9.2 Lifespan Theories

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Discuss Freud's theory of psychosexual development
         · Describe the major tasks of child and adult psychosocial development according to Erikson
         · Discuss Piaget's view of cognitive development and apply the stages to understanding childhood cognition
         · Describe Kohlberg's theory of moral development
         · Compare and contrast the strengths and weaknesses of major developmental theories

       There are many theories regarding how babies and children grow and develop into happy, healthy adults. We
       explore several of these theories in this section.

      Psychosexual Theory of Development

       Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) believed that personality develops during early childhood. For Freud, childhood
       experiences shape our personalities and behavior as adults. Freud viewed development as discontinuous; he
       believed that each of us must pass through a series of stages during childhood, and that if we lack proper
       nurturance and parenting during a stage, we may become stuck, or fixated, in that stage. Freud's stages are
       called the stages of psychosexual development. According to Freud, children's pleasure-seeking urges are
       focused on a different area of the body, called an erogenous zone, at each of the five stages of development:
       oral, anal, phallic, latency, and genital.

       While most of Freud's ideas have not found support in modern research, we cannot discount the contributions
       that Freud has made to the field of psychology. Psychologists today dispute Freud's psychosexual stages as a
       legitimate explanation for how one's personality develops, but what we can take away from Freud's theory is

that personality is shaped, in some part, by experiences we have in childhood. These stages are discussed in
detail in the chapter on personality.

Psychosocial Theory of Development

Erik Erikson (1902-1994) (Figure 9.4), another stage theorist, took Freud's theory and modified it as
psychosocial theory. Erikson's psychosocial development theory emphasizes the social nature of our
development rather than its sexual nature. While Freud believed that personality is shaped only in childhood,
Erikson proposed that personality development takes place all through the lifespan. Erikson suggested that
how we interact with others is what affects our sense of self, or what he called the ego identity.

FIGURE 9.4 Erik Erikson proposed the psychosocial theory of development. In each stage of Erikson's theory, there
is a psychosocial task that we must master in order to feel a sense of competence.
Erikson proposed that we are motivated by a need to achieve competence in certain areas of our lives.
According to psychosocial theory, we experience eight stages of development over our lifespan, from infancy
through late adulthood. At each stage there is a conflict, or task, that we need to resolve. Successful completion
of each developmental task results in a sense of competence and a healthy personality. Failure to master these
tasks leads to feelings of inadequacy.
According to Erikson (1963), trust is the basis of our development during infancy (birth to 12 months).
Therefore, the primary task of this stage is trust versus mistrust. Infants are dependent upon their caregivers,
so caregivers who are responsive and sensitive to their infant's needs help their baby to develop a sense of
trust; their baby will see the world as a safe, predictable place. Unresponsive caregivers who do not meet their
baby's needs can engender feelings of anxiety, fear, and mistrust; their baby may see the world as
unpredictable.
As toddlers (ages 1-3 years) begin to explore their world, they learn that they can control their actions and act
on the environment to get results. They begin to show clear preferences for certain elements of the
environment, such as food, toys, and clothing. A toddler's main task is to resolve the issue of autonomy versus
shame and doubt, by working to establish independence. This is the "me do it" stage. For example, we might
observe a budding sense of autonomy in a 2-year-old child who wants to choose her clothes and dress herself.
Although her outfits might not be appropriate for the situation, her input in such basic decisions has an effect
on her sense of independence. If denied the opportunity to act on her environment, she may begin to doubt her
abilities, which could lead to low self-esteem and feelings of shame.
Once children reach the preschool stage (ages 3-6 years), they are capable of initiating activities and asserting
control over their world through social interactions and play. According to Erikson, preschool children must
resolve the task of initiative versus guilt. By learning to plan and achieve goals while interacting with others,
preschool children can master this task. Those who do will develop self-confidence and feel a sense of purpose.
Those who are unsuccessful at this stage--with their initiative misfiring or stifled--may develop feelings of
guilt. How might over-controlling parents stifle a child's initiative?
286 9 · Lifespan Development

During the elementary school stage (ages 7-11), children face the task of industry versus inferiority. Children
begin to compare themselves to their peers to see how they measure up. They either develop a sense of pride
and accomplishment in their schoolwork, sports, social activities, and family life, or they feel inferior and
inadequate when they don't measure up. What are some things parents and teachers can do to help children
develop a sense of competence and a belief in themselves and their abilities?

In adolescence (ages 12-18), children face the task of identity versus role confusion. According to Erikson, an
adolescent's main task is developing a sense of self. Adolescents struggle with questions such as "Who am I?"
and "What do I want to do with my life?" Along the way, most adolescents try on many different selves to see
which ones fit. Adolescents who are successful at this stage have a strong sense of identity and are able to
remain true to their beliefs and values in the face of problems and other people's perspectives. What happens
to apathetic adolescents, who do not make a conscious search for identity, or those who are pressured to
conform to their parents' ideas for the future? These teens will have a weak sense of self and experience role
confusion. They are unsure of their identity and confused about the future.

People in early adulthood (i.e., 20s through early 40s) are concerned with intimacy versus isolation. After we
have developed a sense of self in adolescence, we are ready to share our life with others. Erikson said that we
must have a strong sense of self before developing intimate relationships with others. Adults who do not
develop a positive self-concept in adolescence may experience feelings of loneliness and emotional isolation.

When people reach their 40s, they enter the time known as middle adulthood, which extends to the mid-60s.
The social task of middle adulthood is generativity versus stagnation. Generativity involves finding your life's
work and contributing to the development of others, through activities such as volunteering, mentoring, and
raising children. Those who do not master this task may experience stagnation, having little connection with
others and little interest in productivity and self-improvement.

From the mid-60s to the end of life, we are in the period of development known as late adulthood. Erikson's
task at this stage is called integrity versus despair. He said that people in late adulthood reflect on their lives
and feel either a sense of satisfaction or a sense of failure. People who feel proud of their accomplishments feel
a sense of integrity, and they can look back on their lives with few regrets. However, people who are not
successful at this stage may feel as if their life has been wasted. They focus on what "would have," "should
have," and "could have" been. They face the end of their lives with feelings of bitterness, depression, and
despair. Table 9.1 summarizes the stages of Erikson's theory.

TABLE 9.1

Cognitive Theory of Development

Jean Piaget (1896-1980) is another stage theorist who studied childhood development (Figure 9.5). Instead of
approaching development from a psychoanalytical or psychosocial perspective, Piaget focused on children's
cognitive growth. He believed that thinking is a central aspect of development and that children are naturally
inquisitive. However, he said that children do not think and reason like adults (Piaget, 1930, 1932). His theory
of cognitive development holds that our cognitive abilities develop through specific stages, which exemplifies
the discontinuity approach to development. As we progress to a new stage, there is a distinct shift in how we
think and reason.

               FIGURE 9.5 Jean Piaget spent over 50 years studying children and how their minds develop.

Piaget said that children develop schemata to help them understand the world. Schemata are concepts
(mental models) that are used to help us categorize and interpret information. By the time children have
reached adulthood, they have created schemata for almost everything. When children learn new information,
they adjust their schemata through two processes: assimilation and accommodation. First, they assimilate new
information or experiences in terms of their current schemata: assimilation is when they take in information
that is comparable to what they already know. Accommodation describes when they change their schemata
based on new information. This process continues as children interact with their environment.

For example, 2-year-old Abdul learned the schema for dogs because his family has a Labrador retriever. When
Abdul sees other dogs in his picture books, he says, "Look mommy, dog!" Thus, he has assimilated them into
288 9 · Lifespan Development

his schema for dogs. One day, Abdul sees a sheep for the first time and says, "Look mommy, dog!" Having a
basic schema that a dog is an animal with four legs and fur, Abdul thinks all furry, four-legged creatures are
dogs. When Abdul's mom tells him that the animal he sees is a sheep, not a dog, Abdul must accommodate his
schema for dogs to include more information based on his new experiences. Abdul's schema for dog was too
broad, since not all furry, four-legged creatures are dogs. He now modifies his schema for dogs and forms a
new one for sheep.

Like Freud and Erikson, Piaget thought development unfolds in a series of stages approximately associated
with age ranges. He proposed a theory of cognitive development that unfolds in four stages: sensorimotor,
preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational (Table 9.2).

TABLE 9.2

The first stage is the sensorimotor stage, which lasts from birth to about 2 years old. During this stage,
children learn about the world through their senses and motor behavior. Young children put objects in their
mouths to see if the items are edible, and once they can grasp objects, they may shake or bang them to see if
they make sounds. Between 5 and 8 months old, the child develops object permanence, which is the
understanding that even if something is out of sight, it still exists (Bogartz, Shinskey, & Schilling, 2000).
According to Piaget, young infants do not remember an object after it has been removed from sight. Piaget
studied infants' reactions when a toy was first shown to an infant and then hidden under a blanket. Infants
who had already developed object permanence would reach for the hidden toy, indicating that they knew it still
existed, whereas infants who had not developed object permanence would appear confused.

In Piaget's view, around the same time children develop object permanence, they also begin to exhibit stranger
anxiety, which is a fear of unfamiliar people. Babies may demonstrate this by crying and turning away from a
stranger, by clinging to a caregiver, or by attempting to reach their arms toward familiar faces such as parents.
Stranger anxiety results when a child is unable to assimilate the stranger into an existing schema; therefore,

she can't predict what her experience with that stranger will be like, which results in a fear response.

Piaget's second stage is the preoperational stage, which is from approximately 2 to 7 years old. In this stage,
children can use symbols to represent words, images, and ideas, which is why children in this stage engage in
pretend play. A child's arms might become airplane wings as they zoom around the room, or a child with a
stick might become a brave knight with a sword. Children also begin to use language in the preoperational
stage, but they cannot understand adult logic or mentally manipulate information (the term operational refers
to logical manipulation of information, so children at this stage are considered to be pre-operational).
Children's logic is based on their own personal knowledge of the world so far, rather than on conventional
knowledge. For example, dad gave a slice of pizza to 10-year-old Keiko and another slice to her 3-year-old
brother, Kenny. Kenny's pizza slice was cut into five pieces, so Kenny told his sister that he got more pizza than
she did. Children in this stage cannot perform mental operations because they have not developed an
understanding of conservation, which is the idea that even if you change the appearance of something, it is
still equal in size as long as nothing has been removed or added.

During this stage, we also expect children to display egocentrism, which means that the child is not able to
take the perspective of others. A child at this stage thinks that everyone sees, thinks, and feels just as they do.
Let's look at Kenny and Keiko again. Keiko's birthday is coming up, so their mom takes Kenny to the toy store to
choose a present for his sister. He selects an Iron Man action figure for her, thinking that if he likes the toy, his
sister will too. An egocentric child is not able to infer the perspective of other people and instead attributes his
own perspective.

     LINK TO LEARNING

Piaget developed the Three-Mountain Task to determine the level of egocentrism displayed by children.
Children view a 3-dimensional mountain scene from one viewpoint, and are asked what another person at a
different viewpoint would see in the same scene. Watch this short video of the Three Mountain Task in action
(http://openstax.org/l/WonderYears) from the University of Minnesota and the Science Museum of Minnesota.

Piaget's third stage is the concrete operational stage, which occurs from about 7 to 11 years old. In this stage,
children can think logically about real (concrete) events; they have a firm grasp on the use of numbers and
start to employ memory strategies. They can perform mathematical operations and understand
transformations, such as addition is the opposite of subtraction, and multiplication is the opposite of division.
In this stage, children also master the concept of conservation: Even if something changes shape, its mass,
volume, and number stay the same. For example, if you pour water from a tall, thin glass to a short, fat glass,
you still have the same amount of water. Remember Keiko and Kenny and the pizza? How did Keiko know that
Kenny was wrong when he said that he had more pizza?

Children in the concrete operational stage also understand the principle of reversibility, which means that
objects can be changed and then returned back to their original form or condition. Take, for example, water
that you poured into the short, fat glass: You can pour water from the fat glass back to the thin glass and still
have the same amount (minus a couple of drops).

The fourth, and last, stage in Piaget's theory is the formal operational stage, which is from about age 11 to
adulthood. Whereas children in the concrete operational stage are able to think logically only about concrete
events, children in the formal operational stage can also deal with abstract ideas and hypothetical situations.
Children in this stage can use abstract thinking to problem solve, look at alternative solutions, and test these
290 9 · Lifespan Development

       solutions. In adolescence, a renewed egocentrism occurs. For example, a 15-year-old with a very small pimple
       on her face might think it is huge and incredibly visible, under the mistaken impression that others must share
       her perceptions.

       Beyond Formal Operational Thought

       As with other major contributors of theories of development, several of Piaget's ideas have come under
       criticism based on the results of further research. For example, several contemporary studies support a model
       of development that is more continuous than Piaget's discrete stages (Courage & Howe, 2002; Siegler, 2005,
       2006). Many others suggest that children reach cognitive milestones earlier than Piaget describes (Baillargeon,
       2004; de Hevia & Spelke, 2010).

       According to Piaget, the highest level of cognitive development is formal operational thought, which develops
       between 11 and 20 years old. However, many developmental psychologists disagree with Piaget, suggesting a
       fifth stage of cognitive development, known as the postformal stage (Basseches, 1984; Commons & Bresette,
       2006; Sinnott, 1998). In postformal thinking, decisions are made based on situations and circumstances, and
       logic is integrated with emotion as adults develop principles that depend on contexts. One way that we can see
       the difference between an adult in postformal thought and an adolescent in formal operations is in terms of
       how they handle emotionally charged issues.

       It seems that once we reach adulthood our problem solving abilities change: As we attempt to solve problems,
       we tend to think more deeply about many areas of our lives, such as relationships, work, and politics
       (Labouvie-Vief & Diehl, 1999). Because of this, postformal thinkers are able to draw on past experiences to help
       them solve new problems. Problem-solving strategies using postformal thought vary, depending on the
       situation. What does this mean? Adults can recognize, for example, that what seems to be an ideal solution to a
       problem at work involving a disagreement with a colleague may not be the best solution to a disagreement with
       a significant other.

                CONNECT THE CONCEPTS

      Neuroconstructivism

       The genetic environmental correlation you've learned about concerning the bidirectional influence of genes and the
       environment has been explored in more recent theories (Newcombe, 2011). One such theory, neuroconstructivism,
       suggests that neural brain development influences cognitive development. Experiences that a child encounters can
       impact or change the way that neural pathways develop in response to the environment. An individual's behavior is
       based on how one understands the world. There is interaction between neural and cognitive networks at and
       between each level, consisting of these:

         · genes
         · neurons
         · brain
         · body
         · social environment

       These interactions shape mental representations in the brain and are dependent on context that individuals actively
       explore throughout their lifetimes (Westermann, Mareschal, Johnson, Sirois, Spratling, & Thomas, 2007).

       An example of this would be a child who may be genetically predisposed to a difficult temperament. They may have
       parents who provide a social environment in which they are encouraged to express themselves in an optimal
       manner. The child's brain would form neural connections enhanced by that environment, thus influencing the brain.
       The brain gives information to the body about how it will experience the environment. Thus, neural and cognitive
       networks work together to influence genes (i.e., attenuating temperament), body (i.e., may be less prone to high
       blood pressure), and social environment (i.e., may seek people who are similar to them).

SOCIOCULTURAL THEORY OF DEVELOPMENT

Lev Vygotsky was a Russian psychologist who proposed a sociocultural theory of development. He suggested
that human development is rooted in one's culture. A child's social world, for example, forms the basis for the
formation of language and thought. The language one speaks and the ways a person thinks about things is
dependent on one's cultural background. Vygotsky also considered historical influences as key to one's
development. He was interested in the process of development and the individual's interactions with their
environment (John-Steiner & Mahn, 1996).

Moral Theory Of Development

A major task beginning in childhood and continuing into adolescence is discerning right from wrong.
Psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg (1927-1987) extended upon the foundation that Piaget built regarding
cognitive development. Kohlberg believed that moral development, like cognitive development, follows a
series of stages. To develop this theory, Kohlberg posed moral dilemmas to people of all ages, and then he
analyzed their answers to find evidence of their particular stage of moral development. Before reading about
the stages, take a minute to consider how you would answer one of Kohlberg's best-known moral dilemmas,
commonly known as the Heinz dilemma:

      In Europe, a woman was near death from a special kind of cancer. There was one drug that the doctors
      thought might save her. It was a form of radium that a druggist in the same town had recently
      discovered. The drug was expensive to make, but the druggist was charging ten times what the drug
      cost him to make. He paid $200 for the radium and charged $2,000 for a small dose of the drug. The
      sick woman's husband, Heinz, went to everyone he knew to borrow the money, but he could only get
      together about $1,000, which is half of what it cost. He told the druggist that his wife was dying and
      asked him to sell it cheaper or let him pay later. But the druggist said: "No, I discovered the drug and
      I'm going to make money from it." So Heinz got desperate and broke into the man's store to steal the
      drug for his wife. Should the husband have done that? (Kohlberg, 1969, p. 379)

How would you answer this dilemma? Kohlberg was not interested in whether you answer yes or no to the
dilemma: Instead, he was interested in the reasoning behind your answer.

After presenting people with this and various other moral dilemmas, Kohlberg reviewed people's responses
and placed them in different stages of moral reasoning (Figure 9.6). According to Kohlberg, an individual
progresses from the capacity for pre-conventional morality (before age 9) to the capacity for conventional
morality (early adolescence), and toward attaining post-conventional morality (once formal operational
thought is attained), which only a few fully achieve. Kohlberg placed in the highest stage responses that
reflected the reasoning that Heinz should steal the drug because his wife's life is more important than the
pharmacist making money. The value of a human life overrides the pharmacist's greed.
292 9 · Lifespan Development

       FIGURE 9.6 Kohlberg identified three levels of moral reasoning: pre-conventional, conventional, and post-
       conventional: Each level is associated with increasingly complex stages of moral development.
       It is important to realize that even those people who have the most sophisticated, post-conventional reasons
       for some choices may make other choices for the simplest of pre-conventional reasons. Many psychologists
       agree with Kohlberg's theory of moral development but point out that moral reasoning is very different from
       moral behavior. Sometimes what we say we would do in a situation is not what we actually do in that situation.
       In other words, we might "talk the talk," but not "walk the walk."
       How does this theory apply to people of different genders? Kohlberg (1969) felt that more men than women
       move past stage four in their moral development. He went on to note that women seem to be deficient in their
       moral reasoning abilities. These ideas were not well received by Carol Gilligan, a research assistant of
       Kohlberg, who consequently developed her own ideas of moral development. In her groundbreaking book, In a
       Different Voice: Psychological Theory and Women's Development, Gilligan (1982) criticized her former
       mentor's theory because it was based only on upper class White men and boys. She argued that women are not
       deficient in their moral reasoning--she proposed that different genders reason differently. Girls and women
       focus more on staying connected and the importance of interpersonal relationships. Therefore, in the Heinz
       dilemma, many girls and women respond that Heinz should not steal the medicine. Their reasoning is that if
       he steals the medicine, is arrested, and is put in jail, then he and his wife will be separated, and she could die
       while he is still in prison.

three areas: physical development, cognitive development, and psychosocial development. Mirroring Erikson's
stages, lifespan development is divided into different stages that are based on age. We will discuss prenatal,
infant, child, adolescent, and adult development.

Prenatal Development

How did you come to be who you are? From beginning as a one-cell structure to your birth, your prenatal
development occurred in an orderly and delicate sequence.
There are three stages of prenatal development: germinal, embryonic, and fetal. Let's take a look at what
happens to the developing baby in each of these stages.
Germinal Stage (Weeks 1-2)

In the discussion of biopsychology earlier in the book, you learned about genetics and DNA. DNA is passed on
to the child at the moment of conception. Conception occurs when sperm fertilizes an egg and forms a zygote
(Figure 9.7). A zygote begins as a one-cell structure that is created when a sperm and egg merge. The genetic
makeup and sex of the zygote are set at this point. During the first week after conception, the zygote divides
and multiplies, going from a one-cell structure to two cells, then four cells, then eight cells, and so on. This
process of cell division is called mitosis. Mitosis is a fragile process, and fewer than one-half of all zygotes
survive beyond the first two weeks (Hall, 2004). After 5 days of mitosis there are 100 cells, and after 9 months
there are billions of cells. As the cells divide, they become more specialized, forming different organs and body
parts. In the germinal stage, the mass of cells has yet to attach itself to the lining of the mother's uterus. Once it
does, the next stage begins.

                                     FIGURE 9.7 Sperm and ovum fuse at the point of conception.
Embryonic Stage (Weeks 3-8)

After the zygote divides for about 7-10 days and has 150 cells, it travels down the fallopian tubes and implants
itself in the lining of the uterus. Upon implantation, this multi-cellular organism is called an embryo. Now
blood vessels grow, forming the placenta. The placenta is a structure connected to the uterus that provides
nourishment and oxygen from the mother to the developing embryo via the umbilical cord. Basic structures of
the embryo start to develop into areas that will become the head, chest, and abdomen. During the embryonic
stage, the heart begins to beat and organs form and begin to function. The neural tube forms along the back of
the embryo, developing into the spinal cord and brain.
Fetal Stage (Weeks 9-40)

When the organism is about nine weeks old, the embryo is called a fetus. At this stage, the fetus is about the
size of a kidney bean and begins to take on the recognizable form of a human being as the "tail" begins to
disappear.
From 9-12 weeks, the sex organs begin to differentiate. At about 16 weeks, the fetus is approximately 4.5
inches long. Fingers and toes are fully developed, and fingerprints are visible. By the time the fetus reaches the
sixth month of development (24 weeks), it weighs up to 1.4 pounds. Hearing has developed, so the fetus can
respond to sounds. The internal organs, such as the lungs, heart, stomach, and intestines, have formed enough
that a fetus born prematurely at this point has a chance to survive outside of the mother's womb. Throughout
the fetal stage the brain continues to grow and develop, nearly doubling in size from weeks 16 to 28. Around 36
294 9 · Lifespan Development

       weeks, the fetus is almost ready for birth. It weighs about 6 pounds and is about 18.5 inches long, and by week
       37 all of the fetus's organ systems are developed enough that it could survive outside the uterus without many
       of the risks associated with premature birth. The fetus continues to gain weight and grow in length until
       approximately 40 weeks. By then, the fetus has very little room to move around and birth becomes imminent.
       The progression through the stages is shown in Figure 9.8.

       FIGURE 9.8 During the fetal stage, the baby's brain develops and the body adds size and weight, until the fetus
       reaches full-term development.

       Prenatal Influences
       During each prenatal stage, genetic and environmental factors can affect development. The developing fetus is
       completely dependent on the mother for life. It is important that the mother takes good care of herself and
       receives prenatal care, which is medical care during pregnancy that monitors the health of both the mother
       and the fetus (Figure 9.9). According to the National Institutes of Health ([NIH], 2013), routine prenatal care is
       important because it can reduce the risk of complications to the mother and fetus during pregnancy. In fact,
       women who are trying to become pregnant or who may become pregnant should discuss pregnancy planning
       with their doctor. They may be advised, for example, to take a vitamin containing folic acid, which helps
       prevent certain birth defects, or to monitor aspects of their diet or exercise routines.

Recall that when the zygote attaches to the wall of the mother's uterus, the placenta is formed. The placenta
provides nourishment and oxygen to the fetus. Most everything the mother ingests, including food, liquid, and
even medication, travels through the placenta to the fetus, hence the common phrase "eating for two."
Anything the mother is exposed to in the environment affects the fetus; if the mother is exposed to something
harmful, the child can show life-long effects.

A teratogen is any environmental agent--biological, chemical, or physical--that causes damage to the
developing embryo or fetus. There are different types of teratogens. Alcohol and most drugs cross the placenta
and affect the fetus. Alcohol is not safe to drink in any amount during pregnancy. Alcohol use during
pregnancy has been found to be the leading preventable cause of intellectual disabilities in children in the
United States (Maier & West, 2001). Excessive maternal drinking while pregnant can cause fetal alcohol
spectrum disorders with life-long consequences for the child ranging in severity from minor to major (Table
9.3). Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are a collection of birth defects associated with heavy
consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. Physically, children with FASD may have a small head size and
abnormal facial features. Cognitively, these children may have poor judgment, poor impulse control, higher
rates of ADHD, learning issues, and lower IQ scores. These developmental problems and delays persist into
adulthood (Streissguth et al., 2004). Based on studies conducted on animals, it also has been suggested that a
parent's alcohol consumption during pregnancy may predispose their child to like alcohol (Youngentob et al.,
2007).

TABLE 9.3

Smoking is also considered a teratogen because nicotine travels through the placenta to the fetus. When the
296 9 · Lifespan Development

       mother smokes, the developing baby experiences a reduction in blood oxygen levels. According to the Centers
       for Disease Control and Prevention (2013), smoking while pregnant can result in premature birth, low-birth-
       weight infants, stillbirth, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).

       Heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine, almost all prescription medicines, and most over-the counter
       medications are also considered teratogens. Babies born with a heroin addiction need heroin just like an adult
       addict. The child will need to be gradually weaned from the heroin under medical supervision; otherwise, the
       child could have seizures and die. Other teratogens include radiation, viruses such as HIV and herpes, and
       rubella (German measles). Women in the United States are much less likely to be afflicted with rubella because
       most women received childhood immunizations or vaccinations that protect the body from disease.

       Each organ of the fetus develops during a specific period in the pregnancy, called the critical or sensitive
       period (Figure 9.8). For example, research with primate models of FASD has demonstrated that the time
       during which a developing fetus is exposed to alcohol can dramatically affect the appearance of facial
       characteristics associated with fetal alcohol syndrome. Specifically, this research suggests that alcohol
       exposure that is limited to day 19 or 20 of gestation can lead to significant facial abnormalities in the offspring
       (Ashley, Magnuson, Omnell, & Clarren, 1999). Given regions of the brain also show sensitive periods during
       which they are most susceptible to the teratogenic effects of alcohol (Tran & Kelly, 2003).

                                                                                                  WHAT DO YOU THINK?

        Should People Who Use Drugs During Pregnancy Be Arrested and Jailed?

         As you now know, people who use drugs or alcohol during pregnancy can cause serious lifelong harm to their
         child. Some have advocated mandatory screenings for pregnant people and have a history of problematic drug
         use, and if they continue using, to arrest, prosecute, and incarcerate them (Figdor & Kaeser, 1998). This policy
         was tried in Charleston, South Carolina, as recently as 20 years ago. The policy was called the Interagency Policy
         on Management of Substance Abuse During Pregnancy, and had disastrous results.

               The Interagency Policy applied to patients attending the obstetrics clinic at MUSC, which primarily
               serves patients who are indigent or on Medicaid. It did not apply to private obstetrical patients. The
               policy required patient education about the harmful effects of substance abuse during pregnancy. . . .
               [A] statement also warned patients that protection of unborn and newborn children from the harms of
               illegal drug abuse could involve the Charleston police, the Solicitor of the Ninth Judicial Court, and the
               Protective Services Division of the Department of Social Services (DSS). (Jos, Marshall, & Perlmutter,
               1995, pp. 120-121)

         This policy seemed to deter pregnant people from seeking prenatal care, deterred them from seeking other
         social services, and was applied solely to people with low incomes, resulting in lawsuits. The program was
         canceled after 5 years, during which 42 women were arrested. A federal agency later determined that the
         program involved human experimentation without the approval and oversight of an institutional review board
         (IRB). What were the flaws in the program and how would you correct them? What are the ethical implications of
         charging pregnant people with child abuse?

      Infancy Through Childhood

       The average newborn weighs approximately 7.5 pounds. Although small, newborns are not completely
       helpless because their reflexes and sensory capacities help them interact with the environment from the
       moment of birth. All healthy babies are born with newborn reflexes: inborn automatic responses to particular
       forms of stimulation. Reflexes help the newborn survive until it is capable of more complex behaviors--these
       reflexes are crucial to survival. They are present in babies whose brains are developing normally and usually
       disappear around 4-5 months old. Let's take a look at some of these newborn reflexes. The rooting reflex is the

newborn's response to anything that touches their cheek: When you stroke a baby's cheek, the baby naturally
turns the head in that direction and begins to suck. The sucking reflex is the automatic, unlearned, sucking
motions that infants do with their mouths. Several other interesting newborn reflexes can be observed. For
instance, if you put your finger into a newborn's hand, you will witness the grasping reflex, in which a baby
automatically grasps anything that touches the palms. The Moro reflex is the newborn's response to the
sensation of falling. The baby spreads the arms, pulls them back in, and then (usually) cries. How do you think
these reflexes promote survival in the first months of life?

What can young infants see, hear, and smell? Newborn infants' sensory abilities are significant, but their
senses are not yet fully developed. Many of a newborn's innate preferences facilitate interaction with
caregivers and other humans. Although vision is their least developed sense, newborns already show a
preference for faces. Babies who are just a few days old also prefer human voices, they will listen to voices
longer than sounds that do not involve speech (Vouloumanos & Werker, 2004), and they seem to prefer their
mother's voice over a stranger's voice (Mills & Melhuish, 1974). In an interesting experiment, 3-week-old
babies were given pacifiers that played a recording of the infant's mother's voice and of a stranger's voice.
When the infants heard their mother's voice, they sucked more strongly at the pacifier (Mills & Melhuish,
1974). Newborns also have a strong sense of smell. For instance, newborn babies can distinguish the smell of
their own mother from that of others. In a study by MacFarlane (1978), 1-week-old babies who were being
breastfed were placed between two gauze pads. One gauze pad was from the bra of a nursing mother who was a
stranger, and the other gauze pad was from the bra of the infant's own mother. More than two-thirds of the
week-old babies turned toward the gauze pad with their mother's scent.
Physical Development
In infancy, toddlerhood, and early childhood, the body's physical development is rapid (Figure 9.10). On
average, newborns weigh between 5 and 10 pounds, and a newborn's weight typically doubles in six months
and triples in one year. By 2 years old the weight will have quadrupled, so we can expect that a 2 year old
should weigh between 20 and 40 pounds. The average length of a newborn is 19.5 inches, increasing to 29.5
inches by 12 months and 34.4 inches by 2 years old (WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study Group, 2006).

During infancy and childhood, growth does not occur at a steady rate (Carel, Lahlou, Roger, & Chaussain,
2004). Growth slows between 4 and 6 years old: During this time children gain 5-7 pounds and grow about 2-3
inches per year. Once females reach 8-9 years old, their growth rate outpaces that of males due to a pubertal
growth spurt. This growth spurt continues until around 12 years old, coinciding with the start of the menstrual
298 9 · Lifespan Development

cycle. By 10 years old, the average female weighs 88 pounds, and the average male weighs 85 pounds.

It was previously believed that we are born with all of the brain cells we will ever have. More recent research
suggests that neurogenesis (the formation of neurons) can continue through adulthood. However, the vast
majority of neural connections and pathways occur during the first few years of a child's life (National Institute
of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, 2019). This period of rapid neural growth is called blooming. Neural
pathways continue to develop through puberty. The blooming period of neural growth is then followed by a
period of pruning, where neural connections are reduced. It is thought that pruning causes the brain to
function more efficiently, allowing for mastery of more complex skills (Hutchinson, 2011). Blooming occurs
during the first few years of life, and pruning continues through childhood and into adolescence in various
areas of the brain.

The size of our brains increases rapidly. For example, the brain of a 2-year-old is 55% of its adult size, and by 6
years old the brain is about 90% of its adult size (Tanner, 1978). During early childhood (ages 3-6), the frontal
lobes grow rapidly. Recalling our discussion of the 4 lobes of the brain earlier in this book, the frontal lobes are
associated with planning, reasoning, memory, and impulse control. Therefore, by the time children reach
school age, they are developmentally capable of controlling their attention and behavior. Through the
elementary school years, the frontal, temporal, occipital, and parietal lobes all grow in size. The brain growth
spurts experienced in childhood tend to follow Piaget's sequence of cognitive development, so that significant
changes in neural functioning account for cognitive advances (Kolb & Whishaw, 2009; Overman, Bachevalier,
Turner, & Peuster, 1992).

Motor development occurs in an orderly sequence as infants move from reflexive reactions (e.g., sucking and
rooting) to more advanced motor functioning. For instance, babies first learn to hold their heads up, then to sit
with assistance, and then to sit unassisted, followed later by crawling and then walking.

Motor skills refer to our ability to move our bodies and manipulate objects. Fine motor skills focus on the
muscles in our fingers, toes, and eyes, and enable coordination of small actions (e.g., grasping a toy, writing
with a pencil, and using a spoon). Gross motor skills focus on large muscle groups that control our arms and
legs and involve larger movements (e.g., balancing, running, and jumping).

As motor skills develop, there are certain developmental milestones that young children should achieve (Table
9.4). For each milestone there is an average age, as well as a range of ages in which the milestone should be
reached. An example of a developmental milestone is sitting. On average, most babies sit alone at 7 months
old. Sitting involves both coordination and muscle strength, and 90% of babies achieve this milestone between
5 and 9 months old. In another example, babies on average are able to hold up their head at 6 weeks old, and
90% of babies achieve this between 3 weeks and 4 months old. If a baby is not holding up their head by 4
months old, they are showing a delay. If the child is displaying delays on several milestones, that is reason for
concern, and the parent or caregiver should discuss this with the child's pediatrician. Some developmental
delays can be identified and addressed through early intervention.

Cognitive Development

In addition to rapid physical growth, young children also exhibit significant development of their cognitive
abilities. Piaget thought that children's ability to understand objects--such as learning that a rattle makes a
noise when shaken--was a cognitive skill that develops slowly as a child matures and interacts with the
environment. Today, developmental psychologists think Piaget was incorrect. Researchers have found that
even very young children understand objects and how they work long before they have experience with those
objects (Baillargeon, 1987; Baillargeon, Li, Gertner, & Wu, 2011). For example, children as young as 3 months
old demonstrated knowledge of the properties of objects that they had only viewed and did not have prior
experience with them. In one study, 3-month-old infants were shown a truck rolling down a track and behind a
screen. The box, which appeared solid but was actually hollow, was placed next to the track. The truck rolled
past the box as would be expected. Then the box was placed on the track to block the path of the truck. When
the truck was rolled down the track this time, it continued unimpeded. The infants spent significantly more
time looking at this impossible event (Figure 9.11). Baillargeon (1987) concluded that they knew solid objects
cannot pass through each other. Baillargeon's findings suggest that very young children have an understanding
of objects and how they work, which Piaget (1954) would have said is beyond their cognitive abilities due to
their limited experiences in the world.

FIGURE 9.11 In Baillargeon's study, infants observed a truck (a) roll down an unobstructed track, (b) roll down an
unobstructed track with an obstruction (box) beside it, and (c) roll down and pass through what appeared to be an
obstruction.

Just as there are physical milestones that we expect children to reach, there are also cognitive milestones. It is
helpful to be aware of these milestones as children gain new abilities to think, problem solve, and
communicate. For example, infants shake their head "no" around 6-9 months, and they respond to verbal
requests to do things like "wave bye-bye" or "blow a kiss" around 9-12 months. Remember Piaget's ideas
about object permanence? We can expect children to grasp the concept that objects continue to exist even
when they are not in sight by around 8 months old. Because toddlers (i.e., 12-24 months old) have mastered
300 9 · Lifespan Development

       object permanence, they enjoy games like hide and seek, and they realize that when someone leaves the room
       they will come back (Loop, 2013). Toddlers also point to pictures in books and look in appropriate places when
       you ask them to find objects.
       Preschool-age children (i.e., 3-5 years old) also make steady progress in cognitive development. Not only can
       they count, name colors, and tell you their name and age, but they can also make some decisions on their own,
       such as choosing an outfit to wear. Preschool-age children understand basic time concepts and sequencing
       (e.g., before and after), and they can predict what will happen next in a story. They also begin to enjoy the use
       of humor in stories. Because they can think symbolically, they enjoy pretend play and inventing elaborate
       characters and scenarios. One of the most common examples of their cognitive growth is their blossoming
       curiosity. Preschool-age children love to ask "Why?"
       An important cognitive change occurs in children this age. Recall that Piaget described 2-3 year olds as
       egocentric, meaning that they do not have an awareness of others' points of view. Between 3 and 5 years old,
       children come to understand that people have thoughts, feelings, and beliefs that are different from their own.
       This is known as theory-of-mind (TOM). Children can use this skill to tease others, persuade their parents to
       purchase a candy bar, or understand why a sibling might be angry. When children develop TOM, they can
       recognize that others have false beliefs (Dennett, 1987; Callaghan et al., 2005).

           LINK TO LEARNING

       False-belief tasks are useful in determining a child's acquisition of theory-of-mind (TOM). Take a look at this
       video clip that shows a false belief task involving a box of crayons (http://openstax.org/l/crayons) to learn more.

       Cognitive skills continue to expand in middle and late childhood (6-11 years old). Thought processes become
       more logical and organized when dealing with concrete information (Figure 9.12). Children at this age
       understand concepts such as the past, present, and future, giving them the ability to plan and work toward
       goals. Additionally, they can process complex ideas such as addition and subtraction and cause-and-effect
       relationships. However, children's attention spans tend to be very limited until they are around 11 years old.
       After that point, it begins to improve through adulthood.

       FIGURE 9.12 Because they understand luck and fairness, children in middle and late childhood (6-11 years old)
       are able to follow rules for games. (credit: Edwin Martinez)
       One well-researched aspect of cognitive development is language acquisition. As mentioned earlier, the order
       in which children learn language structures is consistent across children and cultures (Hatch, 1983). You've
       also learned that some psychological researchers have proposed that children possess a biological
       predisposition for language acquisition.
       Starting before birth, babies begin to develop language and communication skills. At birth, babies apparently
       recognize their mother's voice and can discriminate between the language(s) spoken by their mothers and
       foreign languages, and they show preferences for faces that are moving in synchrony with audible language
       (Blossom & Morgan, 2006; Pickens, 1994; Spelke & Cortelyou, 1981).
       Children communicate information through gesturing long before they speak, and there is some evidence that

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                                                    9.3 · Stages of Development 301

gesture usage predicts subsequent language development (Iverson & Goldin-Meadow, 2005). In terms of
producing spoken language, babies begin to coo almost immediately. Cooing is a one-syllable combination of a
consonant and a vowel sound (e.g., coo or ba). Interestingly, babies replicate sounds from their own languages.
A baby whose parents speak French will coo in a different tone than a baby whose parents speak Spanish or
Urdu. After cooing, the baby starts to babble. Babbling begins with repeating a syllable, such as ma-ma, da-da,
or ba-ba. When babies are about 12 months old, we expect them to say their first word for meaning, and to
start combining words for meaning at about 18 months.

At about 2 years old, a toddler uses between 50 and 200 words; by 3 years old they have a vocabulary of up to
1,000 words and can speak in sentences. During the early childhood years, children's vocabulary increases at a
rapid pace. This is sometimes referred to as the "vocabulary spurt" and has been claimed to involve an
expansion in vocabulary at a rate of 10-20 new words per week. Recent research may indicate that while some
children experience these spurts, it is far from universal (as discussed in Ganger & Brent, 2004). It has been
estimated that, 5 year olds understand about 6,000 words, speak 2,000 words, and can define words and
question their meanings. They can rhyme and name the days of the week. Seven year olds speak fluently and
use slang and clichés (Stork & Widdowson, 1974).

What accounts for such dramatic language learning by children? Behaviorist B. F. Skinner thought that we
learn language in response to reinforcement or feedback, such as through parental approval or through being
understood. For example, when a two-year-old child asks for juice, he might say, "me juice," to which his
mother might respond by giving him a cup of apple juice. Noam Chomsky (1957) criticized Skinner's theory
and proposed that we are all born with an innate capacity to learn language. Chomsky called this mechanism a
language acquisition device (LAD). Who is correct? Both Chomsky and Skinner are right. Remember that we
are a product of both nature and nurture. Researchers now believe that language acquisition is partially inborn
and partially learned through our interactions with our linguistic environment (Gleitman & Newport, 1995;
Stork & Widdowson, 1974).

Attachment

Psychosocial development occurs as children form relationships, interact with others, and understand and
manage their feelings. In social and emotional development, forming healthy attachments is very important
and is the major social milestone of infancy. Attachment is a long-standing connection or bond with others.
Developmental psychologists are interested in how infants reach this milestone. They ask such questions as:
How do parent and infant attachment bonds form? How does neglect affect these bonds? What accounts for
children's attachment differences?

Researchers Harry Harlow, John Bowlby, and Mary Ainsworth conducted studies designed to answer these
questions. In the 1950s, Harlow conducted a series of experiments on monkeys. He separated newborn
monkeys from their mothers. Each monkey was presented with two surrogate mothers. One surrogate monkey
was made out of wire mesh, and she could dispense milk. The other monkey was softer and made from cloth:
This monkey did not dispense milk. Research shows that the monkeys preferred the soft, cuddly cloth monkey,
even though she did not provide any nourishment. The baby monkeys spent their time clinging to the cloth
monkey and only went to the wire monkey when they needed to be fed. Prior to this study, the medical and
scientific communities generally thought that babies become attached to the people who provide their
nourishment. However, Harlow (1958) concluded that there was more to the mother-child bond than
nourishment. Feelings of comfort and security are the critical components to maternal-infant bonding, which
leads to healthy psychosocial development.

     LINK TO LEARNING

Harlow's studies of monkeys were performed before modern ethics guidelines were in place, and today his
experiments are widely considered to be unethical and even cruel. Watch this video of actual footage of
Harlow's monkey studies (http://openstax.org/l/monkeystudy) to learn more.
302 9 · Lifespan Development

       Building on the work of Harlow and others, John Bowlby developed the concept of attachment theory. He
       defined attachment as the affectional bond or tie that an infant forms with the mother (Bowlby, 1969). An
       infant must form this bond with a primary caregiver in order to have normal social and emotional
       development. In addition, Bowlby proposed that this attachment bond is very powerful and continues
       throughout life. He used the concept of secure base to define a healthy attachment between parent and child
       (1988). A secure base is a parental presence that gives the child a sense of safety as he explores his
       surroundings. Bowlby said that two things are needed for a healthy attachment: The caregiver must be
       responsive to the child's physical, social, and emotional needs; and the caregiver and child must engage in
       mutually enjoyable interactions (Bowlby, 1969) (Figure 9.13).

       FIGURE 9.13 Mutually enjoyable interactions promote the parent-infant bond. (credit:
       "balouriarajesh_Pixabay"/Pixabay)
       While Bowlby thought attachment was an all-or-nothing process, Mary Ainsworth's (1970) research showed
       otherwise. Ainsworth wanted to know if children differ in the ways they bond, and if so, why. To find the
       answers, she used the Strange Situation procedure to study attachment between mothers and their infants
       (1970). In the Strange Situation, the mother (or primary caregiver) and the infant (age 12-18 months) are
       placed in a room together. There are toys in the room, and the caregiver and child spend some time alone in
       the room. After the child has had time to explore her surroundings, a stranger enters the room. The mother
       then leaves her baby with the stranger. After a few minutes, she returns to comfort her child.
       Based on how the infants/toddlers responded to the separation and reunion, Ainsworth identified three types
       of parent-child attachments: secure, avoidant, and resistant (Ainsworth & Bell, 1970). A fourth style, known as
       disorganized attachment, was later described (Main & Solomon, 1990). The most common type of
       attachment--also considered the healthiest--is called secure attachment (Figure 9.14). In this type of
       attachment, the toddler prefers his parent over a stranger. The attachment figure is used as a secure base to
       explore the environment and is sought out in times of stress. Securely attached children were distressed when
       their caregivers left the room in the Strange Situation experiment, but when their caregivers returned, the
       securely attached children were happy to see them. Securely attached children have caregivers who are
       sensitive and responsive to their needs.

FIGURE 9.14 In secure attachment, the parent provides a secure base for the toddler, allowing him to securely
explore his environment. (credit: Kerry Ceszyk)
With avoidant attachment, the child is unresponsive to the parent, does not use the parent as a secure base,
and does not care if the parent leaves. The toddler reacts to the parent the same way she reacts to a stranger.
When the parent does return, the child is slow to show a positive reaction. Ainsworth theorized that these
children were most likely to have a caregiver who was insensitive and inattentive to their needs (Ainsworth,
Blehar, Waters, & Wall, 1978).
In cases of resistant attachment, children tend to show clingy behavior, but then they reject the attachment
figure's attempts to interact with them (Ainsworth & Bell, 1970). These children do not explore the toys in the
room, as they are too fearful. During separation in the Strange Situation, they became extremely disturbed and
angry with the parent. When the parent returns, the children are difficult to comfort. Resistant attachment is
the result of the caregivers' inconsistent level of response to their child.
Finally, children with disorganized attachment behaved oddly in the Strange Situation. They freeze, run
around the room in an erratic manner, or try to run away when the caregiver returns (Main & Solomon, 1990).
This type of attachment is seen most often in kids who have been abused. Research has shown that abuse
disrupts a child's ability to regulate their emotions.
While Ainsworth's research has found support in subsequent studies, it has also met criticism. Some
researchers have pointed out that a child's temperament may have a strong influence on attachment (Gervai,
2009; Harris, 2009), and others have noted that attachment varies from culture to culture, a factor not
accounted for in Ainsworth's research (Rothbaum, Weisz, Pott, Miyake, & Morelli, 2000; van Ijzendoorn & Sagi-
Schwartz, 2008).

Self-Concept
Just as attachment is the main psychosocial milestone of infancy, the primary psychosocial milestone of
childhood is the development of a positive sense of self. How does self-awareness develop? Infants don't have a
self-concept, which is an understanding of who they are. If you place a baby in front of a mirror, they will reach
out to touch their image, thinking it is another baby. However, by about 18 months a toddler will recognize that
the person in the mirror is themself. How do we know this? In a well-known experiment, a researcher placed a
red dot of paint on children's noses before putting them in front of a mirror (Amsterdam, 1972). Commonly
known as the mirror test, this behavior is demonstrated by humans and a few other species and is considered
304 9 · Lifespan Development

       evidence of self-recognition (Archer, 1992). At 18 months old they would touch their own noses when they saw
       the paint, surprised to see a spot on their faces. By 24-36 months old children can name and/or point to
       themselves in pictures, clearly indicating self-recognition.

       Children from 2-4 years old display a great increase in social behavior once they have established a self-
       concept. They enjoy playing with other children, but they have difficulty sharing their possessions. Also,
       through play children explore and come to understand their gender roles and can label themselves as a girl or
       boy (Chick, Heilman-Houser, & Hunter, 2002). By 4 years old, children can cooperate with other children, share
       when asked, and separate from parents with little anxiety. Children at this age also exhibit autonomy, initiate
       tasks, and carry out plans. Success in these areas contributes to a positive sense of self. Once children reach 6
       years old, they can identify themselves in terms of group memberships: "I'm a first grader!" School-age
       children compare themselves to their peers and discover that they are competent in some areas and less so in
       others (recall Erikson's task of industry versus inferiority). At this age, children recognize their own personality
       traits as well as some other traits they would like to have. For example, 10-year-old Layla says, "I'm kind of shy.
       I wish I could be more talkative like my friend Alexa."

       Development of a positive self-concept is important to healthy development. Children with a positive self-
       concept tend to be more confident, do better in school, act more independently, and are more willing to try
       new activities (Maccoby, 1980; Ferrer & Fugate, 2003). Formation of a positive self-concept begins in Erikson's
       toddlerhood stage, when children establish autonomy and become confident in their abilities. Development of
       self-concept continues in elementary school, when children compare themselves to others. When the
       comparison is favorable, children feel a sense of competence and are motivated to work harder and
       accomplish more. Self-concept is re-evaluated in Erikson's adolescence stage, as teens form an identity. They
       internalize the messages they have received regarding their strengths and weaknesses, keeping some
       messages and rejecting others. Adolescents who have achieved identity formation are capable of contributing
       positively to society (Erikson, 1968).

                                                                                                                   DIG DEEPER

        Phenomenological Variant of Ecological Systems Theory (PVEST)

         Kenneth and Mamie Clark were pioneering psychologists responsible for the first psychological study used in a
         Supreme Court case. Their research with African American children and doll choices was used to highlight the
         harmful effects of segregation and provided support for the Browns and the NAACP in their lawsuit against the
         Board of Education. The finding that African American children were more likely to choose a White doll over a
         Black doll, in both northern and southern states, led them to theorize that the children did not have a healthy
         concept of themselves (Clark & Clark, 1950).

         The Clarks' research differed from that of Inez Beverly Prosser, who also studied African American children in
         segregated and integrated schools in Cincinnati. Parents could choose either environment for their children
         during the 1930s. She found, among other factors, that the self-concept of children at segregated schools was
         more positive versus those in integrated schools, partly due to teachers' low expectations. Prosser also noted
         that the child's personality should be considered when choosing a segregated school or an integrated school
         (Benjamin, Henry, & McMahon, 2005).

         Later researchers suggested that African American children choosing a doll that did not look like them was not an
         indication of their self-esteem or their self-image. For instance, Rogers and Meltzoff (2017) found that gender
         identity was more important than race in their study of diverse children whose average age was about 10 years
         old. Thus, for children that young, the meaning of race is an evolving process, as opposed to adolescents' search
         for identity. The ethnic minority children in the study did view racial identity as important, compared to their
         White counterparts.

  For teenagers who are members of ethnic minority groups, racial/ethnic/cultural identity can be paramount,
  depending on the family's processes. Racial socialization involves teaching them the positive aspects of their in-
  group, usually by caregivers. Most of the students in a study by Neblett, Smalls, Ford, Nguyen, and Sellers (2009)
  reported having received such messages but a few received no racial socialization messages. They found that
  these messages played a role in how they felt about their in-group.

  Some theories have been developed to explain the behaviors of ethnic minority youth. One such theory is the
  Phenomenological Variant of Ecological Systems Theory (PVEST), put forth by Margaret Beale Spencer. It is a
  merging of phenomenology and Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory. A phenomenological approach is
  based on how a person makes meaning of their experiences. For example, young African American boys have
  different experiences in educational settings compared to African American girls. Consequently, the meaning
  they assign to those experiences differs. Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory suggests that development
  occurs based on interactions among environments such as school, family, and community (Bronfenbrenner,
  1977).

  The research that Spencer, Dupree, and Hartmann (1997) conducted with African American adolescent boys and
  girls was explained by PVEST. They found that negative learning attitudes were predicted by unpopularity with
  peers for girls and boys. Additionally, for boys, more stress predicted a less negative attitude toward learning,
  possibly due to focus on the school environment instead of on personal issues. This occurred along with
  perceiving that teachers had positive expectations of African American boys. The researchers surmised that
  PVEST accounted for how others' perceptions and their subsequent attitudes were related and worked both
  ways.

What can parents do to nurture a healthy self-concept? Diana Baumrind (1971, 1991) thinks parenting style
may be a factor. The way we parent is an important factor in a child's socioemotional growth. Baumrind
developed and refined a theory describing four parenting styles: authoritative, authoritarian, permissive, and
uninvolved. With the authoritative style, the parent gives reasonable demands and consistent limits,
expresses warmth and affection, and listens to the child's point of view. Parents set rules and explain the
reasons behind them. They are also flexible and willing to make exceptions to the rules in certain cases--for
example, temporarily relaxing bedtime rules to allow for a nighttime swim during a family vacation. Of the four
parenting styles, the authoritative style is the one that is most encouraged in modern American society.
American children raised by authoritative parents tend to have high self-esteem and social skills. However,
effective parenting styles vary as a function of culture and, as Small (1999) points out, the authoritative style is
not necessarily preferred or appropriate in all cultures.

In authoritarian style, the parent places high value on conformity and obedience. The parents are often strict,
tightly monitor their children, and express little warmth. In contrast to the authoritative style, authoritarian
parents probably would not relax bedtime rules during a vacation because they consider the rules to be set,
and they expect obedience. This style can create anxious, withdrawn, and unhappy kids. However, it is
important to point out that authoritarian parenting is as beneficial as the authoritative style in some ethnic
groups (Russell, Crockett, & Chao, 2010). For instance, first-generation Chinese American children raised by
authoritarian parents did just as well in school as their peers who were raised by authoritative parents (Russell
et al., 2010).

For parents who employ the permissive style of parenting, the kids run the show and anything goes.
Permissive parents make few demands and rarely use punishment. They tend to be very nurturing and loving,
and may play the role of friend rather than parent. In terms of our example of vacation bedtimes, permissive
parents might not have bedtime rules at all--instead they allow the child to choose their bedtime whether on
vacation or not. Not surprisingly, children raised by permissive parents tend to lack self-discipline, and the
permissive parenting style is negatively associated with grades (Dornbusch, Ritter, Leiderman, Roberts, &
306 9 · Lifespan Development

       Fraleigh, 1987). The permissive style may also contribute to other risky behaviors such as alcohol abuse (Bahr
       & Hoffman, 2010), risky sexual behavior especially among female children (Donenberg, Wilson, Emerson, &
       Bryant, 2002), and increased display of disruptive behaviors by male children (Parent et al., 2011). However,
       there are some positive outcomes associated with children raised by permissive parents. They tend to have
       higher self-esteem, better social skills, and report lower levels of depression (Darling, 1999).

       With the uninvolved style of parenting, the parents are indifferent, uninvolved, and sometimes referred to as
       neglectful. They don't respond to the child's needs and make relatively few demands. This could be because of
       severe depression or substance abuse, or other factors such as the parents' extreme focus on work. These
       parents may provide for the child's basic needs, but little else. The children raised in this parenting style are
       usually emotionally withdrawn, fearful, anxious, perform poorly in school, and are at an increased risk of
       substance abuse (Darling, 1999).

       As you can see, parenting styles influence childhood adjustment, but could a child's temperament likewise
       influence parenting? Temperament refers to innate traits that influence how one thinks, behaves, and reacts
       with the environment. Children with easy temperaments demonstrate positive emotions, adapt well to change,
       and are capable of regulating their emotions. Conversely, children with difficult temperaments demonstrate
       negative emotions and have difficulty adapting to change and regulating their emotions. Difficult children are
       much more likely to challenge parents, teachers, and other caregivers (Thomas, 1984). Therefore, it's possible
       that easy children (i.e., social, adaptable, and easy to soothe) tend to elicit warm and responsive parenting,
       while demanding, irritable, withdrawn children evoke irritation in their parents or cause their parents to
       withdraw (Sanson & Rothbart, 1995).

                                                                                             EVERYDAY CONNECTION

        The Importance of Play and Recess

         According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (2007), unstructured play is an integral part of a child's
         development. It builds creativity, problem solving skills, and social relationships. Play also allows children to
         develop a theory-of-mind as they imaginatively take on the perspective of others.

         Outdoor play allows children the opportunity to directly experience and sense the world around them. While
         doing so, they may collect objects that they come across and develop lifelong interests and hobbies. They also
         benefit from increased exercise, and engaging in outdoor play can actually increase how much they enjoy
         physical activity. This helps support the development of a healthy heart and brain. Unfortunately, research
         suggests that today's children are engaging in less and less outdoor play (Clements, 2004). Perhaps, it is no
         surprise to learn that lowered levels of physical activity in conjunction with easy access to calorie-dense foods
         with little nutritional value are contributing to alarming levels of childhood obesity (Karnik & Kanekar, 2012).

         Despite the adverse consequences associated with reduced play, some children are over scheduled and have
         little free time to engage in unstructured play. In addition, some schools have taken away recess time for children
         in a push for students to do better on standardized tests, and many schools commonly use loss of recess as a
         form of punishment. Do you agree with these practices? Why or why not?

      Adolescence

       Adolescence is a socially constructed concept. In pre-industrial society, children were considered adults when
       they reached physical maturity, but today we have an extended time between childhood and adulthood called
       adolescence. Adolescence is the period of development that begins at puberty and ends at emerging
       adulthood, which is discussed later. In the United States, adolescence is seen as a time to develop
       independence from parents while remaining connected to them (Figure 9.15). The typical age range of
       adolescence is from 12 to 18 years, and this stage of development also has some predictable physical,

cognitive, and psychosocial milestones.

Physical Development

As noted above, adolescence begins with puberty. While the sequence of physical changes in puberty is
predictable, the onset and pace of puberty vary widely. Several physical changes occur during puberty, such as
adrenarche and gonadarche, the maturing of the adrenal glands and sex glands, respectively. Also during this
time, primary and secondary sexual characteristics develop and mature. Primary sexual characteristics are
organs specifically needed for reproduction, like the uterus and ovaries in females and testes in males.
Secondary sexual characteristics are physical signs of sexual maturation that do not directly involve sex
organs, such as development of breasts and hips in females, and development of facial hair and a deepened
voice in males. Females experience menarche, the beginning of menstrual periods, usually around 12-13
years old, and males experience spermarche, the first ejaculation, around 13-14 years old.

During puberty, people experience a rapid increase in height (i.e., growth spurt). For females this begins
between 8 and 13 years old, with adult height reached between 10 and 16 years old. Males begin their growth
spurt slightly later, usually between 10 and 16 years old, and reach their adult height between 13 and 17 years
old. Both nature (i.e., genes) and nurture (e.g., nutrition, medications, and medical conditions) can influence
height.

Because rates of physical development vary so widely among teenagers, puberty can be a source of pride or
embarrassment. Early maturing boys tend to be stronger, taller, and more athletic than their later maturing
peers. They are usually more popular, confident, and independent, but they are also at a greater risk for
substance abuse and early sexual activity (Flannery, Rowe, & Gulley, 1993; Kaltiala-Heino, Rimpela, Rissanen,
& Rantanen, 2001). Early maturing girls may be teased or overtly admired, which can cause them to feel self-
conscious about their developing bodies. These girls are at a higher risk for depression, substance abuse, and
eating disorders (Ge, Conger, & Elder, 2001; Graber, Lewinsohn, Seeley, & Brooks-Gunn, 1997; Striegel-Moore &
Cachelin, 1999). Late blooming boys and girls (i.e., they develop more slowly than their peers) may feel self-
conscious about their lack of physical development. Negative feelings are particularly a problem for late
maturing boys, who are at a higher risk for depression and conflict with parents (Graber et al., 1997) and more
likely to be bullied (Pollack & Shuster, 2000).

Psychologists and clinicians also study the impact of gender identity and the impacts of puberty on
transgender and gender-nonconforming youth. This is a relatively recent area of study, and the impacts should
not be over-generalized. However, the research seems to indicate that transgender and gender-nonconforming
youth who are supported in their identity do not have significantly higher incidences of depression or anxiety
symptoms when compared to control groups, while those who are not supported exhibit more symptoms and
risk factors (Olson, Durwood, & McLaughlin, 2016). Expression and exploration of gender identity can take
many forms and manifest at different times depending on a wide array of factors.

The adolescent brain also remains under development. Up until puberty, brain cells continue to bloom in the
frontal region. Adolescents engage in increased risk-taking behaviors and emotional outbursts possibly
because the frontal lobes of their brains are still developing (Figure 9.16). Recall that this area is responsible
for judgment, impulse control, and planning, and it is still maturing into early adulthood (Casey, Tottenham,
308 9 · Lifespan Development

       Liston, & Durston, 2005).

       FIGURE 9.16 Brain growth continues into the early 20s. The development of the frontal lobe, in particular, is
       important during this stage.

           LINK TO LEARNING

       According to neuroscientist Jay Giedd in the Frontline video "Inside the Teenage Brain" (2013), "It's sort of
       unfair to expect [teens] to have adult levels of organizational skills or decision-making before their brains are
       finished being built." Watch this segment on "The Wiring of the Adolescent Brain" (http://openstax.org/l/
       wiringbrain) to find out more about the developing brain during adolescence.
       Cognitive Development
       More complex thinking abilities emerge during adolescence. Some researchers suggest this is due to increases
       in processing speed and efficiency rather than as the result of an increase in mental capacity--in other words,
       due to improvements in existing skills rather than development of new ones (Bjorkland, 1987; Case, 1985).
       During adolescence, teenagers move beyond concrete thinking and become capable of abstract thought. Recall
       that Piaget refers to this stage as formal operational thought. Teen thinking is also characterized by the ability
       to consider multiple points of view, imagine hypothetical situations, debate ideas and opinions (e.g., politics,
       religion, and justice), and form new ideas (Figure 9.17). In addition, it's not uncommon for adolescents to
       question authority or challenge established societal norms.
       Cognitive empathy, also known as theory-of-mind (which we discussed earlier with regard to egocentrism),
       relates to the ability to take the perspective of others and feel concern for others (Shamay-Tsoory, Tomer, &
       Aharon-Peretz, 2005). Cognitive empathy begins to increase in adolescence and is an important component of
       social problem solving and conflict avoidance. According to one longitudinal study, levels of cognitive empathy
       begin rising in girls around 13 years old, and around 15 years old in boys (Van der Graaff et al., 2013). Teens
       who reported having supportive fathers with whom they could discuss their worries were found to be better
       able to take the perspective of others (Miklikowska, Duriez, & Soenens, 2011).

such as how to design, plan, and build a structure. (credit: U.S. Army RDECOM)
Psychosocial Development

Adolescents continue to refine their sense of self as they relate to others. Erikson referred to the task of the
adolescent as one of identity versus role confusion. Thus, in Erikson's view, an adolescent's main questions are
"Who am I?" and "Who do I want to be?" Some adolescents adopt the values and roles that their parents expect
for them. Other teens develop identities that are in opposition to their parents but align with a peer group. This
is common as peer relationships become a central focus in adolescents' lives.
As adolescents work to form their identities, they pull away from their parents, and the peer group becomes
very important (Shanahan, McHale, Osgood, & Crouter, 2007). Despite spending less time with their parents,
most teens report positive feelings toward them (Moore, Guzman, Hair, Lippman, & Garrett, 2004). Warm and
healthy parent-child relationships have been associated with positive child outcomes, such as better grades
and fewer school behavior problems, in the United States as well as in other countries (Hair et al., 2005).
It appears that most teens don't experience adolescent storm and stress to the degree once famously suggested
by G. Stanley Hall, a pioneer in the study of adolescent development. Only small numbers of teens have major
conflicts with their parents (Steinberg & Morris, 2001), and most disagreements are minor. For example, in a
study of over 1,800 parents of adolescents from various cultural and ethnic groups, Barber (1994) found that
conflicts occurred over day-to-day issues such as homework, money, curfews, clothing, chores, and friends.
These types of arguments tend to decrease as teens develop (Galambos & Almeida, 1992). There is emerging
research on the adolescent brain. Galvan, Hare, Voss, Glover and Casey (2007) examined its role in risk-taking
behavior. They used fMRI to assess the readings' relationship to risk-taking, risk perception, and impulsivity.
The researchers found that there was no correlation between brain activity in the neural reward center and
impulsivity and risk perception. However, activity in that part of the brain was correlated to risk taking. In
other words, risk-taking adolescents experienced brain activity in the reward center. The idea that adolescents,
however, are more impulsive than other demographics was challenged in their research, which included
children and adults.
Emerging Adulthood

The next stage of development is emerging adulthood. This is a relatively newly defined period of lifespan
development spanning from 18 years old to the mid-20s, characterized as an in-between time where identity
exploration is focused on work and love.
When does a person become an adult? There are many ways to answer this question. In the United States, you
are legally considered an adult at 18 years old. But other definitions of adulthood vary widely; in sociology, for
example, a person may be considered an adult when they become self-supporting, choose a career, get
married, or start a family. The ages at which we achieve these milestones vary from person to person as well as
from culture to culture. For example, in the African country of Malawi, 15-year-old Njemile was married at 14
years old and had her first child at 15 years old. In her culture she is considered an adult. Children in Malawi
take on adult responsibilities such as marriage and work (e.g., carrying water, tending babies, and working
fields) as early as 10 years old. In stark contrast, independence in Western cultures is taking longer and longer,
310 9 · Lifespan Development

       effectively delaying the onset of adult life.
       What factors are leading to these changes regarding financial and familial independence? It seems that
       emerging adulthood is a product of both Western culture and our current times (Arnett, 2000). People in
       higher income and more industrialized countries are living longer, allowing the freedom to take an extra
       decade to start a career and family. Changes in the workforce also play a role. For example, 50 years ago, a
       young adult with a high school diploma could immediately enter the work force and climb the economic
       ladder. That is no longer the case. Bachelor's and even graduate degrees are required more and more
       often--even for entry-level jobs (Arnett, 2000). In addition, many students are taking longer (five or six years)
       to complete a college degree as a result of working and going to school at the same time. After graduation,
       many young adults return to the family home because they have difficulty finding a job. The term Boomerang
       Generation describes recent college graduates for whom lack of adequate employment upon college
       graduation often leads to a return to the parental home (Davidson, 2014). Changing cultural expectations may
       be the most important reason for the delay in entering adult roles. Young people are spending more time
       exploring their options, so they are delaying marriage and work as they change majors and jobs multiple
       times, putting them on a much later timetable than their parents (Arnett, 2000).

      Adulthood

       Adulthood begins around 20 years old and has three distinct stages: early, middle, and late. Each stage brings
       its own set of rewards and challenges.
       Physical Development
       By the time we reach early adulthood (20 to early 40s), our physical maturation is complete, although our
       height and weight may increase slightly. In young adulthood, our physical abilities are at their peak, including
       muscle strength, reaction time, sensory abilities, and cardiac functioning. Most professional athletes are at the
       top of their game during this stage. Many women have children in the young adulthood years, so they may see
       additional weight gain and breast changes.
       Middle adulthood extends from the 40s to the 60s (Figure 9.18). Physical decline is gradual. The skin loses
       some elasticity, and wrinkles are among the first signs of aging. Visual acuity decreases during this time.
       Women experience a gradual decline in fertility as they approach the onset of menopause, the end of the
       menstrual cycle, around 50 years old. Both men and women tend to gain weight: in the abdominal area for
       men and in the hips and thighs for women. Hair begins to thin and turn gray.

       FIGURE 9.18 Physical declines of middle and late adulthood can be minimized with proper exercise, nutrition, and
       an active lifestyle. (credit: modification of work by Peter Stevens)
       Late adulthood is considered to extend from the 60s on. This is the last stage of physical change. The skin
       continues to lose elasticity, reaction time slows further, and muscle strength diminishes. Smell, taste, hearing,
       and vision, so sharp in our twenties, decline significantly. The brain may also no longer function at optimal
       levels, leading to problems like memory loss, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease in later years.

Cognitive Development
Because we spend so many years in adulthood (more than any other stage), cognitive changes are numerous.
In fact, research suggests that adult cognitive development is a complex, ever changing process that may be
even more active than cognitive development in infancy and early childhood (Fischer, Yan, & Stewart, 2003).

There is good news for the middle age brain. View this brief video about the middle age brain
(http://openstax.org/l/oldbrain) to find out what it is.

Unlike our physical abilities, which peak in our mid-20s and then begin a slow decline, our cognitive abilities
remain steady throughout early and middle adulthood. Our crystallized intelligence (information, skills, and
strategies we have gathered through a lifetime of experience) tends to hold steady as we age--it may even
improve. For example, adults show relatively stable to increasing scores on intelligence tests until their
mid-30s to mid-50s (Bayley & Oden, 1955). However, in late adulthood we begin to experience a decline in
another area of our cognitive abilities--fluid intelligence (information processing abilities, reasoning, and
memory). These processes become slower. How can we delay the onset of cognitive decline? Mental and
physical activity seems to play a part (Figure 9.19). Research has found adults who engage in mentally and
physically stimulating activities experience less cognitive decline and have a reduced incidence of mild
cognitive impairment and dementia (Hertzog, Kramer, Wilson, & Lindenberger, 2009; Larson et al., 2006;
Podewils et al., 2005).

Researchers have examined the aging brain by comparing it to brain functioning in younger people.
Forstmann and colleagues (2011) compared elderly participants to younger participants, who in the study
were asked to report the direction of movement of a set of dots. They were given feedback regarding speed and
accuracy. The researchers found that older participants made more errors and were slower due to
degeneration of corticostriatal connections. In other words, the decreased ability typically assigned to elderly
people may be due to circumstances in the brain beyond their control. Interestingly, other researchers have
found similarities in spatial representations when comparing children aged 6-7 to those over the age of 80.
Ruggiero, D'Errico, and Iachini (2016) reported that this is due to neurodegeneration in older adults and
immature neurology in young children.
Many elderly people experience dementia, changes in the brain that negatively affect cognition. Alzheimer's
disease is one type of dementia, initially studied by medical researcher Solomon Carter Fuller. Alzheimer's

       disease has a genetic basis. Plaques in the brain are due to cell death, which then causes those affected with
       the disease severe forgetfulness. A person can forget how to walk, talk, and eventually eat. The disease can be
       mitigated by assessing environmental factors (exposure to lead, iron, and zinc increase risk) and nutritional
       factors (the Mediterranean diet lowers risk) (Arora, Mittal, & Kakkar, 2015). Although there is no cure, there is
       hope. Cognitive rehabilitation can offset mild cognitive impairment, as it can evolve into dementia. Garcia-
       Betances, Jimenez-Mixco, Arredondo, and Cabrera-Umpierrez (2015) examined the use of virtual reality as a
       possible cognitive rehabilitative method. They suggested that virtual reality technology should involve daily
       living activities, memory, and language, among other considerations.
       Psychosocial Development
       There are many theories about the social and emotional aspects of aging. Some aspects of healthy aging
       include activities, social connectedness, and the role of a person's culture. According to many theorists,
       including George Vaillant (2002), who studied and analyzed over 50 years of data, we need to have and
       continue to find meaning throughout our lives. For those in early and middle adulthood, meaning is found
       through work (Sterns & Huyck, 2001) and family life (Markus, Ryff, Curan, & Palmersheim, 2004). These areas
       relate to the tasks that Erikson referred to as generativity and intimacy. As mentioned previously, adults tend
       to define themselves by what they do--their careers. Earnings peak during this time, yet job satisfaction is
       more closely tied to work that involves contact with other people, is interesting, provides opportunities for
       advancement, and allows some independence (Mohr & Zoghi, 2006) than it is to salary (Iyengar, Wells, &
       Schwartz, 2006). How might being unemployed or being in a dead-end job challenge adult well-being?
       Positive relationships with significant others in our adult years have been found to contribute to a state of well-
       being (Ryff & Singer, 2009). Most adults in the United States identify themselves through their relationships
       with family--particularly with spouses, children, and parents (Markus et al., 2004). While raising children can
       be stressful, especially when they are young, research suggests that parents reap the rewards down the road,
       as adult children tend to have a positive effect on parental well-being (Umberson, Pudrovska, & Reczek, 2010).
       Having a stable marriage has also been found to contribute to well-being throughout adulthood (Vaillant,
       2002).
       Another aspect of positive aging is believed to be social connectedness and social support. As we get older,
       socioemotional selectivity theory suggests that our social support and friendships dwindle in number, but
       remain as close, if not more close than in our earlier years (Carstensen, 1992) (Figure 9.20).

9.4 Death and Dying

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Discuss hospice care
  · Describe the five stages of grief
  · Critique issues regarding living wills, Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) orders, and hospice care
Every story has an ending. Death marks the end of your life story (Figure 9.21). Our culture and individual
backgrounds influence how we view death. In some cultures, death is accepted as a natural part of life and is
embraced. In contrast, until about 50 years ago in the United States, a doctor might not inform someone that
they were dying, and the majority of deaths occurred in hospitals. In 1967 that reality began to change with
Cicely Saunders, who created the first modern hospice in England. The aim of hospice is to help provide a
death with dignity and pain management in a humane and comfortable environment, which is usually outside
of a hospital setting. In 1974, Florence Wald founded the first hospice in the United States. Today, hospice
provides care for 1.65 million Americans and their families. Because of hospice care, many terminally ill
people are able to spend their last days at home.

FIGURE 9.21 Different cultures, societies, and religions have varying practices surrounding death. For example,
people's bodies may be (a) buried in a cemetery, (b) cremated and buried at sea as in this U.S. Navy ceremony, or (c)
cremated such as in this Hindu ceremony in Bali. (credit a: modification of work by Christina Rutz; credit b:

Research has indicated that hospice care is beneficial for the patient (Brumley, Enquidanos, & Cherin, 2003;
Brumley et al., 2007; Godkin, Krant, & Doster, 1984) and for the patient's family (Rhodes, Mitchell, Miller,
Connor, & Teno, 2008; Godkin et al., 1984). Hospice patients report high levels of satisfaction with hospice care
because they are able to remain at home and are not completely dependent on strangers for care (Brumley et
al., 2007). In addition, hospice patients tend to live longer than non-hospice patients (Connor, Pyenson, Fitch,
Spence, & Iwasaki, 2007; Temel et al., 2010). Family members receive emotional support and are regularly
informed of their loved one's treatment and condition. The family member's burden of care is also reduced
(McMillan et al., 2006). Both the patient and the patient's family members report increased family support,
increased social support, and improved coping while receiving hospice services (Godkin et al., 1984).
How do you think you might react if you were diagnosed with a terminal illness like cancer? Elizabeth Kübler-
Ross (1969), who worked with the founders of hospice care, described the process of an individual accepting
his own death. She proposed five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Most
individuals experience these stages, but the stages may occur in different orders, depending on the individual.
In addition, not all people experience all of the stages. It is also important to note that some psychologists
believe that the more a dying person fights death, the more likely they are to remain stuck in the denial phase.
314 9 · Lifespan Development

       This could make it difficult for the dying person to face death with dignity. However, other psychologists
       believe that not facing death until the very end is an adaptive coping mechanism for some people.
       Whether due to illness or old age, not everyone facing death or the loss of a loved one experiences the negative
       emotions outlined in the Kübler-Ross model (Nolen-Hoeksema & Larson, 1999). For example, research
       suggests that people with religious or spiritual beliefs are better able to cope with death because of their hope
       in an afterlife and because of social support from religious or spiritual associations (Hood, Spilka, Hunsberger,
       & Corsuch, 1996; McIntosh, Silver, & Wortman, 1993; Paloutzian, 1996; Samarel, 1991; Wortman & Park,
       2008).
       A prominent example of a person creating meaning through death is Randy Pausch, who was a well-loved and
       respected professor at Carnegie Mellon University. Diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer in his mid-40s
       and given only 3-6 months to live, Pausch focused on living in a fulfilling way in the time he had left. Instead of
       becoming angry and depressed, he presented his now famous last lecture called "Really Achieving Your
       Childhood Dreams." In his moving, yet humorous talk, he shares his insights on seeing the good in others,
       overcoming obstacles, and experiencing zero gravity, among many other things. Despite his terminal
       diagnosis, Pausch lived the final year of his life with joy and hope, showing us that our plans for the future still
       matter, even if we know that we are dying.

       As individuals become more knowledgeable about medical procedures and practices, some people want to
       ensure that their wishes and desires are known in advance. This ensures that if the person ever becomes
       incapacitated or can no longer express themselves, their loved ones will know what they want. For this reason,
       a person might write a living will or advance directive, which is a written legal document that details specific
       interventions a person wants. For example, a person in the last stages of a terminal illness may not want to
       receive life-extending treatments. A person may also include a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) Order, which they
       would share this with family and close friends. A DNR Order states that if a person stops breathing or their
       heart stops beating, medical personnel such as doctors and nurses are not to take steps to revive or resuscitate
       the patient. A living will can also include a health care proxy, which appoints a specific person to make
       medical decisions for you if you are unable to speak for yourself. People's desire for living wills and DNRs are
       often influenced by their religion, culture, and upbringing.

studied by developmental psychologists. They view development as a lifelong process that can be studied
scientifically across three developmental domains: physical, cognitive development, and psychosocial. There
are several theories of development that focus on the following issues: whether development is continuous or
discontinuous, whether development follows one course or many, and the relative influence of nature versus
nurture on development.

9.2 Lifespan Theories

There are many theories regarding how babies and children grow and develop into happy, healthy adults.
Sigmund Freud suggested that we pass through a series of psychosexual stages in which our energy is focused
on certain erogenous zones on the body. Eric Erikson modified Freud's ideas and suggested a theory of
psychosocial development. Erikson said that our social interactions and successful completion of social tasks
shape our sense of self. Jean Piaget proposed a theory of cognitive development that explains how children
think and reason as they move through various stages. Finally, Lawrence Kohlberg turned his attention to
moral development. He said that we pass through three levels of moral thinking that build on our cognitive
development.

9.3 Stages of Development

At conception the egg and sperm cell are united to form a zygote, which will begin to divide rapidly. This marks
the beginning of the first stage of prenatal development (germinal stage), which lasts about two weeks. Then
the zygote implants itself into the lining of the uterus, marking the beginning of the second stage of prenatal
development (embryonic stage), which lasts about six weeks. The embryo begins to develop body and organ
structures, and the neural tube forms, which will later become the brain and spinal cord. The third phase of
prenatal development (fetal stage) begins at 9 weeks and lasts until birth. The body, brain, and organs grow
rapidly during this stage. During all stages of pregnancy it is important that the parent receive prenatal care to
reduce health risks to themself and to the developing baby.

Newborn infants weigh about 7.5 pounds. Doctors assess a newborn's reflexes, such as the sucking, rooting,
and Moro reflexes. Our physical, cognitive, and psychosocial skills grow and change as we move through
developmental stages from infancy through late adulthood. Attachment in infancy is a critical component of
healthy development. Parenting styles have been found to have an effect on childhood outcomes of well-being.
The transition from adolescence to adulthood can be challenging due to the timing of puberty, and due to the
extended amount of time spent in emerging adulthood. Although physical decline begins in middle adulthood,
cognitive decline does not begin until later. Activities that keep the body and mind active can help maintain
good physical and cognitive health as we age. Social supports through family and friends remain important as
we age.

9.4 Death and Dying

Death marks the endpoint of our lifespan. There are many ways that we might react when facing death. Kübler-
Ross developed a five-stage model of grief as a way to explain this process. Many people facing death choose
hospice care, which allows their last days to be spent at home in a comfortable, supportive environment.

CHAPTER OUTLINE

10.1 Motivation
10.2 Hunger and Eating
10.3 Sexual Behavior
10.4 Emotion

INTRODUCTION What makes us behave as we do? What drives us to eat? What drives us toward sex? Is there a
biological basis to explain the feelings we experience? How universal are emotions?

In this chapter, we will explore issues relating to both motivation and emotion. We will begin with a discussion
of several theories that have been proposed to explain motivation and why we engage in a given behavior. You
will learn about the physiological needs that drive some human behaviors, as well as the importance of our
social experiences in influencing our actions.

Next, we will consider both eating and having sex as examples of motivated behaviors. What are the
physiological mechanisms of hunger and satiety? What understanding do scientists have of why obesity
occurs, and what treatments exist for obesity and eating disorders? How has research into human sex and
sexuality evolved over the past century? How do psychologists understand and study the human experience of
sexual orientation and gender identity? These questions--and more--will be explored.

This chapter will close with a discussion of emotion. You will learn about several theories that have been
proposed to explain how emotion occurs, the biological underpinnings of emotion, and the universality of
emotions.

     10.1 Motivation

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Define intrinsic and extrinsic motivation
         · Understand that instincts, drive reduction, self-efficacy, and social motives have all been proposed as theories

             of motivation
         · Explain the basic concepts associated with Maslow's hierarchy of needs
       Why do we do the things we do? What motivations underlie our behaviors? Motivation describes the wants or
       needs that direct behavior toward a goal. In addition to biological motives, motivations can be intrinsic
       (arising from internal factors) or extrinsic (arising from external factors) (Figure 10.2). Intrinsically motivated
       behaviors are performed because of the sense of personal satisfaction that they bring, while extrinsically
       motivated behaviors are performed in order to receive something from others.

       FIGURE 10.2 Intrinsic motivation comes from within the individual, while extrinsic motivation comes from outside
       the individual.
       Think about why you are pursuing an education. Are you here because you enjoy learning and want to pursue
       an education to make yourself a more well-rounded individual? If so, then you are intrinsically motivated.
       However, if you are here because you want to get a college degree to make yourself more marketable for a high-
       paying career or to satisfy the demands of your parents, then your motivation is more extrinsic in nature.
       In reality, our motivations are often a mix of both intrinsic and extrinsic factors, but the nature of the mix of
       these factors might change over time (often in ways that seem counter-intuitive). There is an old adage:
       "Choose a job that you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life," meaning that if you enjoy your
       occupation, work doesn't seem like . . . well, work. Some research suggests that this isn't necessarily the case
       (Daniel & Esser, 1980; Deci, 1972; Deci, Koestner, & Ryan, 1999). According to this research, receiving some
       sort of extrinsic reinforcement (i.e., getting paid) for engaging in behaviors that we enjoy leads to those
       behaviors being thought of as work no longer providing that same enjoyment. As a result, we might spend less
       time engaging in these reclassified behaviors in the absence of any extrinsic reinforcement. For example,
       Odessa loves baking, so in her free time, she bakes for fun. Oftentimes, after stocking shelves at her grocery
       store job, she often whips up pastries in the evenings because she enjoys baking. When a coworker in the
       store's bakery department leaves his job, Odessa applies for his position and gets transferred to the bakery
       department. Although she enjoys what she does in her new job, after a few months, she no longer has much
       desire to concoct tasty treats in her free time. Baking has become work in a way that changes her motivation to
       do it (Figure 10.3). What Odessa has experienced is called the overjustification effect--intrinsic motivation is
       diminished when extrinsic motivation is given. This can lead to extinguishing the intrinsic motivation and
       creating a dependence on extrinsic rewards for continued performance (Deci et al., 1999).

FIGURE 10.3 Research suggests that when something we love to do, like icing cakes, becomes our job, our intrinsic
and extrinsic motivations to do it may change. (credit: Agustín Ruiz)
Other studies suggest that intrinsic motivation may not be so vulnerable to the effects of extrinsic
reinforcements, and in fact, reinforcements such as verbal praise might actually increase intrinsic motivation
(Arnold, 1976; Cameron & Pierce, 1994). In that case, Odessa's motivation to bake in her free time might
remain high if, for example, customers regularly compliment her baking or cake decorating skills.
These apparent discrepancies in the researchers' findings may be understood by considering several factors.
For one, physical reinforcement (such as money) and verbal reinforcement (such as praise) may affect an
individual in very different ways. In fact, tangible rewards (i.e., money) tend to have more negative effects on
intrinsic motivation than do intangible rewards (i.e., praise). Furthermore, the expectation of the extrinsic
motivator by an individual is crucial: If the person expects to receive an extrinsic reward, then intrinsic
motivation for the task tends to be reduced. If, however, there is no such expectation, and the extrinsic
motivation is presented as a surprise, then intrinsic motivation for the task tends to persist (Deci et al., 1999).
In addition, culture may influence motivation. For example, in collectivistic cultures, it is common to do things
for your family members because the emphasis is on the group and what is best for the entire group, rather
than what is best for any one individual (Nisbett, Peng, Choi, & Norenzayan, 2001). This focus on others
provides a broader perspective that takes into account both situational and cultural influences on behavior;
thus, a more nuanced explanation of the causes of others' behavior becomes more likely. (You will learn more
about collectivistic and individualistic cultures when you learn about social psychology.)
In educational settings, students are more likely to experience intrinsic motivation to learn when they feel a
sense of belonging and respect in the classroom. This internalization can be enhanced if the evaluative aspects
of the classroom are de-emphasized and if students feel that they exercise some control over the learning
environment. Furthermore, providing students with activities that are challenging, yet doable, along with a
rationale for engaging in various learning activities can enhance intrinsic motivation for those tasks (Niemiec
& Ryan, 2009). Consider Hakim, a first-year law student with two courses this semester: Family Law and
Criminal Law. The Family Law professor has a rather intimidating classroom: He likes to put students on the
spot with tough questions, which often leaves students feeling belittled or embarrassed. Grades are based
exclusively on quizzes and exams, and the instructor posts results of each test on the classroom door. In
contrast, the Criminal Law professor facilitates classroom discussions and respectful debates in small groups.
The majority of the course grade is not exam-based, but centers on a student-designed research project on a
crime issue of the student's choice. Research suggests that Hakim will be less intrinsically motivated in his
Family Law course, where students are intimidated in the classroom setting, and there is an emphasis on
teacher-driven evaluations. Hakim is likely to experience a higher level of intrinsic motivation in his Criminal
Law course, where the class setting encourages inclusive collaboration and a respect for ideas, and where
students have more influence over their learning activities.

Theories About Motivation

William James (1842-1910) was an important contributor to early research into motivation, and he is often
referred to as the father of psychology in the United States. James theorized that behavior was driven by a
number of instincts, which aid survival (Figure 10.4). From a biological perspective, an instinct is a species-
324 10 · Emotion and Motivation

       specific pattern of behavior that is not learned. There was, however, considerable controversy among James
       and his contemporaries over the exact definition of instinct. James proposed several dozen special human
       instincts, but many of his contemporaries had their own lists that differed. A mother's protection of her baby,
       the urge to lick sugar, and hunting prey were among the human behaviors proposed as true instincts during
       James's era. This view--that human behavior is driven by instincts--received a fair amount of criticism
       because of the undeniable role of learning in shaping all sorts of human behavior. In fact, as early as the 1900s,
       some instinctive behaviors were experimentally demonstrated to result from associative learning (recall when
       you learned about Watson's conditioning of fear response in "Little Albert") (Faris, 1921).

       FIGURE 10.4 (a) William James proposed the instinct theory of motivation, asserting that behavior is driven by
       instincts. (b) In humans, instincts may include behaviors such as an infant's rooting for a nipple and sucking. (credit
       b: modification of work by "Mothering Touch"/Flickr)
       Another early theory of motivation proposed that the maintenance of homeostasis is particularly important in
       directing behavior. You may recall from your earlier reading that homeostasis is the tendency to maintain a
       balance, or optimal level, within a biological system. In a body system, a control center (which is often part of
       the brain) receives input from receptors (which are often complexes of neurons). The control center directs
       effectors (which may be other neurons) to correct any imbalance detected by the control center.
       According to the drive theory of motivation, deviations from homeostasis create physiological needs. These
       needs result in psychological drive states that direct behavior to meet the need and, ultimately, bring the
       system back to homeostasis. For example, if it's been a while since you ate, your blood sugar levels will drop
       below normal. This low blood sugar will induce a physiological need and a corresponding drive state (i.e.,
       hunger) that will direct you to seek out and consume food (Figure 10.5). Eating will eliminate the hunger, and,
       ultimately, your blood sugar levels will return to normal. Interestingly, drive theory also emphasizes the role
       that habits play in the type of behavioral response in which we engage. A habit is a pattern of behavior in which
       we regularly engage. Once we have engaged in a behavior that successfully reduces a drive, we are more likely
       to engage in that behavior whenever faced with that drive in the future (Graham & Weiner, 1996).

Extensions of drive theory take into account levels of arousal as potential motivators. As you recall from your
study of learning, these theories assert that there is an optimal level of arousal that we all try to maintain
(Figure 10.6). If we are underaroused, we become bored and will seek out some sort of stimulation. On the
other hand, if we are overaroused, we will engage in behaviors to reduce our arousal (Berlyne, 1960). Most
students have experienced this need to maintain optimal levels of arousal over the course of their academic
career. Think about how much stress students experience toward the end of spring semester. They feel
overwhelmed with seemingly endless exams, papers, and major assignments that must be completed on time.
They probably yearn for the rest and relaxation that awaits them over the extended summer break. However,
once they finish the semester, it doesn't take too long before they begin to feel bored. Generally, by the time the
next semester is beginning in the fall, many students are quite happy to return to school. This is an example of
how arousal theory works.

FIGURE 10.6 The concept of optimal arousal in relation to performance on a task is depicted here. Performance is
maximized at the optimal level of arousal, and it tapers off during under- and overarousal.
So what is the optimal level of arousal? What level leads to the best performance? Research shows that
moderate arousal is generally best; when arousal is very high or very low, performance tends to suffer (Yerkes
& Dodson, 1908). Think of your arousal level regarding taking an exam for this class. If your level is very low,
such as boredom and apathy, your performance will likely suffer. Similarly, a very high level, such as extreme
anxiety, can be paralyzing and hinder performance. Consider the example of a softball team facing a
tournament. They are favored to win their first game by a large margin, so they go into the game with a lower
level of arousal and get beat by a less skilled team.
But optimal arousal level is more complex than a simple answer that the middle level is always best.
Researchers Robert Yerkes (pronounced "Yerk-EES") and John Dodson discovered that the optimal arousal
level depends on the complexity and difficulty of the task to be performed (Figure 10.7). This relationship is
known as Yerkes-Dodson law, which holds that a simple task is performed best when arousal levels are
relatively high and complex tasks are best performed when arousal levels are lower.
326 10 · Emotion and Motivation

       FIGURE 10.7 Task performance is best when arousal levels are in a middle range, with difficult tasks best
       performed under lower levels of arousal and simple tasks best performed under higher levels of arousal.
       Self-efficacy and Social Motives
       Self-efficacy is an individual's belief in their own capability to complete a task, which may include a previous
       successful completion of the exact task or a similar task. Albert Bandura (1994) theorized that an individual's
       sense of self-efficacy plays a pivotal role in motivating behavior. Bandura argues that motivation derives from
       expectations that we have about the consequences of our behaviors, and ultimately, it is the appreciation of our
       capacity to engage in a given behavior that will determine what we do and the future goals that we set for
       ourselves. For example, if you have a sincere belief in your ability to achieve at the highest level, you are more
       likely to take on challenging tasks and to not let setbacks dissuade you from seeing the task through to the end.
       A number of theorists have focused their research on understanding social motives (McAdams & Constantian,
       1983; McClelland & Liberman, 1949; Murray et al., 1938). Among the motives they describe are needs for
       achievement, affiliation, and intimacy. It is the need for achievement that drives accomplishment and
       performance. The need for affiliation encourages positive interactions with others, and the need for intimacy
       causes us to seek deep, meaningful relationships. Henry Murray et al. (1938) categorized these needs into
       domains. For example, the need for achievement and recognition falls under the domain of ambition.
       Dominance and aggression were recognized as needs under the domain of human power, and play was a
       recognized need in the domain of interpersonal affection.
       Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs
       While the theories of motivation described earlier relate to basic biological drives, individual characteristics,
       or social contexts, Abraham Maslow (1943) proposed a hierarchy of needs that spans the spectrum of motives
       ranging from the biological to the individual to the social. These needs are often depicted as a pyramid (Figure
       10.8).

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                                                                    10.1 · Motivation 327

FIGURE 10.8 Maslow's hierarchy of needs is illustrated here. In some versions of the pyramid, cognitive and
aesthetic needs are also included between esteem and self-actualization. Others include another tier at the top of
the pyramid for self-transcendence.
At the base of the pyramid are all of the physiological needs that are necessary for survival. These are followed
by basic needs for security and safety, the need to be loved and to have a sense of belonging, and the need to
have self-worth and confidence. The top tier of the pyramid is self-actualization, which is a need that
essentially equates to achieving one's full potential, and it can only be realized when needs lower on the
pyramid have been met. To Maslow and humanistic theorists, self-actualization reflects the humanistic
emphasis on positive aspects of human nature. Maslow suggested that this is an ongoing, life-long process and
that only a small percentage of people actually achieve a self-actualized state (Francis & Kritsonis, 2006;
Maslow, 1943).
According to Maslow (1943), one must satisfy lower-level needs before addressing those needs that occur
higher in the pyramid. So, for example, if someone is struggling to find enough food to meet their nutritional
requirements, it is quite unlikely that they would spend an inordinate amount of time thinking about whether
others viewed them as a good person or not. Instead, all of their energies would be geared toward finding
something to eat. However, it should be pointed out that Maslow's theory has been criticized for its subjective
nature and its inability to account for phenomena that occur in the real world (Leonard, 1982). Other research
has more recently addressed that late in life, Maslow proposed a self-transcendence level above self-
actualization--to represent striving for meaning and purpose beyond the concerns of oneself (Koltko-Rivera,
2006). For example, people sometimes make self-sacrifices in order to make a political statement or in an
attempt to improve the conditions of others. Mohandas K. Gandhi, a world-renowned advocate for
independence through nonviolent protest, on several occasions went on hunger strikes to protest a particular
situation. People may starve themselves or otherwise put themselves in danger displaying higher-level
motives beyond their own needs.

     10.2 Hunger and Eating

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe how hunger and eating are regulated
         · Differentiate between levels of overweight and obesity and the associated health consequences
         · Explain the health consequences resulting from anorexia and bulimia nervosa
       Eating is essential for survival, and it is no surprise that a drive like hunger exists to ensure that we seek out
       sustenance. While this chapter will focus primarily on the physiological mechanisms that regulate hunger and
       eating, powerful social, cultural, and economic influences also play important roles. This section will explain
       the regulation of hunger, eating, and body weight, and we will discuss the adverse consequences of disordered
       eating.

      Physiological Mechanisms

       There are a number of physiological mechanisms that serve as the basis for hunger. When our stomachs are
       empty, they contract. Typically, a person then experiences hunger pangs. Chemical messages travel to the
       brain, and serve as a signal to initiate feeding behavior. When our blood glucose levels drop, the pancreas and
       liver generate a number of chemical signals that induce hunger (Konturek et al., 2003; Novin, Robinson,
       Culbreth, & Tordoff, 1985) and thus initiate feeding behavior.
       For most people, once they have eaten, they feel satiation, or fullness and satisfaction, and their eating
       behavior stops. Like the initiation of eating, satiation is also regulated by several physiological mechanisms. As
       blood glucose levels increase, the pancreas and liver send signals to shut off hunger and eating (Drazen &
       Woods, 2003; Druce, Small, & Bloom, 2004; Greary, 1990). The food's passage through the gastrointestinal
       tract also provides important satiety signals to the brain (Woods, 2004), and fat cells release leptin, a satiety
       hormone.
       The various hunger and satiety signals that are involved in the regulation of eating are integrated in the brain.
       Research suggests that several areas of the hypothalamus and hindbrain are especially important sites where
       this integration occurs (Ahima & Antwi, 2008; Woods & D'Alessio, 2008). Ultimately, activity in the brain
       determines whether or not we engage in feeding behavior (Figure 10.9).

FIGURE 10.9 Hunger and eating are regulated by a complex interplay of hunger and satiety signals that are
integrated in the brain.

Metabolism and Body Weight

Our body weight is affected by a number of factors, including gene-environment interactions, and the number
of calories we consume versus the number of calories we burn in daily activity. If our caloric intake exceeds
our caloric use, our bodies store excess energy in the form of fat. If we consume fewer calories than we burn
off, then stored fat will be converted to energy. Our energy expenditure is obviously affected by our levels of
activity, but our body's metabolic rate also comes into play. A person's metabolic rate is the amount of energy
that is expended in a given period of time, and there is tremendous individual variability in our metabolic
rates. People with high rates of metabolism are able to burn off calories more easily than those with lower rates
of metabolism.
We all experience fluctuations in our weight from time to time, but generally, most people's weights fluctuate
within a narrow margin, in the absence of extreme changes in diet and/or physical activity. This observation
led some to propose a set-point theory of body weight regulation. The set-point theory asserts that each
individual has an ideal body weight, or set point, which is resistant to change. This set-point is genetically
predetermined and efforts to move our weight significantly from the set-point are resisted by compensatory
changes in energy intake and/or expenditure (Speakman et al., 2011).
Some of the predictions generated from this particular theory have not received empirical support. For
example, there are no changes in metabolic rate between individuals who had recently lost significant
amounts of weight and a control group (Weinsier et al., 2000). In addition, the set-point theory fails to account
for the influence of social and environmental factors in the regulation of body weight (Martin-Gronert &
Ozanne, 2013; Speakman et al., 2011). Despite these limitations, set-point theory is still often used as a simple,
intuitive explanation of how body weight is regulated. See Psychological Disorders for further discussion about
eating disorders.

Obesity

When someone weighs more than what is generally accepted as healthy for a given height, they are considered
overweight or obese. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an adult with a body
330 10 · Emotion and Motivation

       mass index (BMI) between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight (Figure 10.10). An adult with a BMI of 30 or
       higher is considered obese (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2012). People who are so
       overweight that they are at risk for death are classified as morbidly obese. Morbid obesity is defined as having
       a BMI over 40. Note that although BMI has been used as a healthy weight indicator by the World Health
       Organization (WHO), the CDC, and other groups, its value as an assessment tool has been questioned. The BMI
       is most useful for studying populations, which is the work of these organizations. It is less useful in assessing
       an individual since height and weight measurements fail to account for important factors like fitness level. An
       athlete, for example, may have a high BMI because the tool doesn't distinguish between the body's percentage
       of fat and muscle in a person's weight.

       FIGURE 10.10 This chart shows how adult BMI is calculated. Individuals find their height on the y-axis and their
       weight on the x-axis to determine their BMI.
       Being extremely overweight or obese is a risk factor for several negative health consequences. These include,
       but are not limited to, an increased risk for cardiovascular disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes, liver disease, sleep
       apnea, colon cancer, breast cancer, infertility, and arthritis. Given that it is estimated that in the United States
       around forty percent of the adult population is obese and that nearly three-quarters of adults and one in six
       children qualify as overweight (CDC, 2018), there is substantial interest in trying to understand how to combat
       this important public health concern.
       What causes someone to be overweight or obese? You have already read that both genes and environment are
       important factors for determining body weight, and if more calories are consumed than expended, excess
       energy is stored as fat. However, socioeconomic status and the physical environment must also be considered
       as contributing factors (CDC, 2012). For example, an individual who lives in a neighborhood with high crime
       rates and few food options may never feel comfortable walking or biking to work or to the local market. This
       might limit the amount of physical activity in which they engage. Similarly, some people may not be able to
       afford healthy food options from their market, or these options may be unavailable (especially in urban areas
       or poorer neighborhoods); therefore, some people must rely primarily on available, inexpensive, high fat, and
       high calorie fast food as their primary source of nutrition.

Generally, people are encouraged to try to maintain and improve health through a combination of both diet
and exercise. While some people are very successful with these approaches, many are not. In cases in which a
person has had no success with repeated attempts to reduce weight or is at risk for death because of obesity,
bariatric surgery may be recommended. Bariatric surgery is a type of surgery specifically aimed at weight
reduction, and it involves modifying the gastrointestinal system to reduce the amount of food that can be eaten
and/or limiting how much of the digested food can be absorbed (Figure 10.11) (Mayo Clinic, 2013). A recent
meta-analysis suggests that bariatric surgery is more effective than non-surgical treatment for obesity in the
two-years immediately following the procedure, but to date, no long-term studies yet exist (Gloy et al., 2013).

 Prader-Willi Syndrome

  Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder that results in persistent feelings of intense hunger and
  reduced rates of metabolism. Typically, affected children have to be supervised around the clock to ensure that
  they do not engage in excessive eating. Currently, PWS is the leading genetic cause of morbid obesity in children,
  and it is associated with a number of cognitive deficits and emotional problems (Figure 10.12).
332 10 · Emotion and Motivation

         FIGURE 10.12 Eugenia Martínez Vallejo, depicted in this 1680 painting, may have had Prader-Willi syndrome. At
         just eight years old, she weighed approximately 120 pounds, and she was nicknamed "La Monstrua" (the
         monster).
         While genetic testing can be used to make a diagnosis, there are a number of behavioral diagnostic criteria
         associated with PWS. From birth to 2 years of age, lack of muscle tone and poor sucking behavior may serve as
         early signs of PWS. Developmental delays are seen between the ages of 6 and 12, and excessive eating and
         cognitive deficits associated with PWS usually onset a little later.
         While the exact mechanisms of PWS are not fully understood, there is evidence that affected individuals have
         hypothalamic abnormalities. This is not surprising, given the hypothalamus's role in regulating hunger and eating.
         However, as you will learn in the next section of this chapter, the hypothalamus is also involved in the regulation
         of sexual behavior. Consequently, many individuals suffering from PWS fail to reach sexual maturity during
         adolescence.
         There is no current treatment or cure for PWS. However, if weight can be controlled in these individuals, then
         their life expectancies are significantly increased (historically, sufferers of PWS often died in adolescence or early
         adulthood). Advances in the use of various psychoactive medications and growth hormones continue to enhance
         the quality of life for individuals with PWS (Cassidy & Driscoll, 2009; Prader-Willi Syndrome Association, 2012).

      Eating Disorders

       While nearly two out of three US adults struggle with issues related to being overweight, a smaller, but
       significant, portion of the population has eating disorders that typically result in being normal weight or
       underweight. Often, these individuals are fearful of gaining weight. Individuals who have bulimia nervosa and
       anorexia nervosa face many adverse health consequences (Mayo Clinic, 2012a, 2012b).
       People suffering from bulimia nervosa engage in binge eating behavior that is followed by an attempt to
       compensate for the large amount of food consumed. Purging the food by inducing vomiting or through the use
       of laxatives are two common compensatory behaviors. Some affected individuals engage in excessive amounts
       of exercise to compensate for their binges. Bulimia is associated with many adverse health consequences that
       can include kidney failure, heart failure, and tooth decay. In addition, these individuals often suffer from
       anxiety and depression, and they are at an increased risk for substance abuse (Mayo Clinic, 2012b). The

lifetime prevalence rate for bulimia nervosa is estimated at around 1% for women and less than 0.5% for men
(Smink, van Hoeken, & Hoek, 2012).
As of the 2013 release of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, fifth edition, Binge eating disorder is a
disorder recognized by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). Unlike with bulimia, eating binges are not
followed by inappropriate behavior, such as purging, but they are followed by distress, including feelings of
guilt and embarrassment. The resulting psychological distress distinguishes binge eating disorder from
overeating (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013).
Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by the maintenance of a body weight well below average
through starvation and/or excessive exercise. Individuals with anorexia nervosa often have a distorted body
image, referenced in literature as a type of body dysmorphia, meaning that they view themselves as
overweight even though they are not. Like bulimia nervosa, anorexia nervosa is associated with a number of
significant negative health outcomes: bone loss, heart failure, kidney failure, amenorrhea (cessation of the
menstrual period), reduced function of the gonads, and in extreme cases, death. Furthermore, there is an
increased risk for a number of psychological problems, which include anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and
substance abuse (Mayo Clinic, 2012a). Estimates of the prevalence of anorexia nervosa vary from study to
study but generally range from just under one percent to just over four percent in women. Generally,
prevalence rates are considerably lower for men (Smink et al., 2012).

While both anorexia and bulimia nervosa occur in people from many different cultures, White females from
Western societies tend to be the most at-risk population. Recent research indicates that females between the
ages of 15 and 19 are most at risk, and it has long been suspected that these eating disorders are culturally-
bound phenomena that are related to messages of a thin ideal often portrayed in popular media and the
fashion world (Figure 10.13) (Smink et al., 2012). While social factors play an important role in the
development of eating disorders, there is also evidence that genetic factors may predispose people to these
disorders (Collier & Treasure, 2004).

     10.3 Sexual Behavior

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Understand basic biological mechanisms regulating sexual behavior and motivation
         · Appreciate the importance of Alfred Kinsey's research on human sexuality
         · Recognize the contributions that William Masters and Virginia Johnson's research made to our understanding of

             the sexual response cycle
         · Define sexual orientation and gender identity
       Like food, sex is an important part of many people's lives. From an evolutionary perspective, the reason is
       obvious--perpetuation of the species. Sexual behavior in humans, however, involves much more than
       reproduction. This section provides an overview of research that has been conducted on human sexual
       behavior and motivation. This section will close with a discussion of issues related to gender identity and
       expression and sexual orientation.

      Physiological Mechanisms of Sexual Behavior and Motivation

       Much of what we know about the physiological mechanisms that underlie sexual behavior and motivation
       comes from animal research. As you've learned, the hypothalamus plays an important role in motivated
       behaviors, and sex is no exception. In fact, lesions to an area of the hypothalamus called the medial preoptic
       area completely disrupt a male rat's ability to engage in sexual behavior. Surprisingly, medial preoptic lesions
       do not change how hard a male rat is willing to work to gain access to a sexually receptive female (Figure
       10.14). This suggests that the ability to engage in sexual behavior and the motivation to do so may be mediated
       by neural systems distinct from one another.

       FIGURE 10.14 A male rat that cannot engage in sexual behavior still seeks receptive females, suggesting that the
       ability to engage in sexual behavior and the motivation to do so are mediated by different systems in the brain.
       (credit: Jason Snyder)
       Animal research suggests that limbic system structures such as the amygdala and nucleus accumbens are
       especially important for sexual motivation. Damage to these areas results in a decreased motivation to engage
       in sexual behavior, while leaving the ability to do so intact (Figure 10.15) (Everett, 1990). Similar dissociations
       of sexual motivation and sexual ability have also been observed in the female rat (Becker, Rudick, & Jenkins,
       2001; Jenkins & Becker, 2001).

FIGURE 10.15 The medial preoptic area, an area of the hypothalamus, is involved in the ability to engage in sexual
behavior, but it does not affect sexual motivation. In contrast, the amygdala and nucleus accumbens are involved in
motivation for sexual behavior, but they do not affect the ability to engage in it.
Although human sexual behavior is much more complex than that seen in rats, some parallels between
animals and humans can be drawn from this research. The worldwide popularity of drugs used to treat erectile
dysfunction (Conrad, 2005) speaks to the fact that sexual motivation and the ability to engage in sexual
behavior can also be dissociated in humans. Moreover, disorders that involve abnormal hypothalamic function
are often associated with hypogonadism (reduced function of the gonads) and reduced sexual function (e.g.,
Prader-Willi syndrome). Given the hypothalamus's role in endocrine function, it is not surprising that
hormones secreted by the endocrine system also play important roles in sexual motivation and behavior. For
example, many animals show no sign of sexual motivation in the absence of the appropriate combination of
sex hormones from their gonads. While this is not the case for humans, there is considerable evidence that
sexual motivation for all genders varies as a function of circulating testosterone levels (Bhasin, Enzlin,
Coviello, & Basson, 2007; Carter, 1992; Sherwin, 1988).

Kinsey's Research

Before the late 1940s, access to reliable, empirically-based information on sex was limited. Physicians were
considered authorities on all issues related to sex, despite the fact that they had little to no training in these
issues, and it is likely that most of what people knew about sex had been learned either through their own
experiences or by talking with their peers. Convinced that people would benefit from a more open dialogue on
issues related to human sexuality, Dr. Alfred Kinsey of Indiana University initiated large-scale survey research
on the topic (Figure 10.16). The results of some of these efforts were published in two books--Sexual Behavior
in the Human Male and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female--which were published in 1948 and 1953,
respectively (Bullough, 1998).

FIGURE 10.16 In 1947, Alfred Kinsey established The Kinsey Institute for Research, Sex, Gender and Reproduction
at Indiana University, shown here in 2011. The Kinsey Institute has continued as a research site of important
336 10 · Emotion and Motivation

       psychological studies for decades.

       At the time, the Kinsey reports were quite sensational. Never before had the American public seen its private
       sexual behavior become the focus of scientific scrutiny on such a large scale. The books, which were filled with
       statistics and scientific lingo, sold remarkably well to the general public, and people began to engage in open
       conversations about human sexuality. As you might imagine, not everyone was happy that this information
       was being published. In fact, these books were banned in some countries. Ultimately, the controversy resulted
       in Kinsey losing funding that he had secured from the Rockefeller Foundation to continue his research efforts
       (Bancroft, 2004).

       Although Kinsey's research has been widely criticized as being riddled with sampling and statistical errors
       (Jenkins, 2010), there is little doubt that this research was very influential in shaping future research on
       human sexual behavior and motivation. Kinsey described a remarkably diverse range of sexual behaviors and
       experiences reported by the volunteers participating in his research. Behaviors that had once been considered
       exceedingly rare or problematic were demonstrated to be much more common and innocuous than previously
       imagined (Bancroft, 2004; Bullough, 1998).

       Kinsey) to learn more.

       Among the results of Kinsey's research were the findings that women are as interested and experienced in sex
       as men, that both males and females masturbate without adverse health consequences, and that relationships
       and sexual acts between people of the same sex and/or the same gender are fairly common (Bancroft, 2004).
       Kinsey also developed a continuum known as the Kinsey scale that is still commonly used today to categorize
       an individual's sexual orientation, which is an individual's emotional, romantic, and erotic attractions to other
       people or no people (Jenkins, 2010).

      Masters and Johnson's Research

       In 1966, William Masters and Virginia Johnson published a book detailing the results of their observations of
       nearly 700 people who agreed to participate in their study of physiological responses during sexual behavior.
       Unlike Kinsey, who used personal interviews and surveys to collect data, Masters and Johnson observed
       people having intercourse in a variety of positions, and they observed people masturbating, manually or with
       the aid of a device. While this was occurring, researchers recorded measurements of physiological variables,
       such as blood pressure and respiration rate, as well as measurements of sexual arousal, such as vaginal
       lubrication and penile tumescence (swelling associated with an erection). In total, Masters and Johnson
       observed nearly 10,000 sexual acts as a part of their research (Hock, 2008).

       Based on these observations, Masters and Johnson divided the sexual response cycle into four phases that are
       fairly similar in men and women: excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution (Figure 10.17). The excitement
       phase is the arousal phase of the sexual response cycle, and it is marked by erection of the penis or clitoris and
       lubrication and expansion of the vaginal canal. During plateau, the vagina swells further and blood flow to the
       labia minora increases, and the penis becomes fully erect and may exhibit pre-ejaculatory fluid. People
       experience increases in muscle tone during this time. Orgasm is marked in females by rhythmic contractions
       of the pelvis and uterus along with increased muscle tension. In males, pelvic contractions are accompanied
       by a buildup of seminal fluid near the urethra that is ultimately forced out by contractions of genital muscles,
       (i.e., ejaculation). Resolution is the relatively rapid return to an unaroused state accompanied by a decrease in
       blood pressure and muscular relaxation. The refractory period is a period of time that follows an orgasm
       during which an individual is incapable of experiencing another orgasm. The duration of the refractory period
       can vary dramatically from individual to individual with some refractory periods as short as several minutes
       and others as long as a day. As people age, their refractory periods tend to span longer periods of time.

FIGURE 10.17 This graph illustrates the different phases of the sexual response cycle as described by Masters and
Johnson.
In addition to the insights that their research provided with regards to the sexual response cycle and the multi-
orgasmic potential of females, Masters and Johnson also collected important information about reproductive
anatomy. Their research demonstrated the oft-cited statistic of the average size of a flaccid and an erect penis
(3 and 6 inches, respectively) as well as dispelling long-held beliefs about relationships between the size of an
erect penis and its ability to provide sexual pleasure to a partner. Furthermore, they determined that the
vagina is a very elastic structure that can conform to penises of various sizes (Hock, 2008). In a similar manner
to Kinsey's work and other studies, Masters and Johnson's research has been criticized, built on, and in some
cases proven wrong. The research represents an important element of the history of sexual research, and is
not viewed as entirely accurate today.

Sexual Orientation

As mentioned earlier, a person's sexual orientation is their emotional, romantic, and erotic attraction toward
other people or no people. While the majority of people identify as heterosexual, there is a sizable population
of people within the United States who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual, asexual, or other non-
hetero sexualities. Bisexual people are attracted to people of their own gender and another gender; pansexual
people experience attraction without regard to sex, gender identity or gender expression; asexual people do
not experience sexual attraction or have little or no interest in sexual activity. Queer is an umbrella term used
to describe sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. Other descriptive terms may not refer to
a sexual attraction, but rather a romantic one. For example, an aromantic person does not experience
romantic attraction; this is different from asexuality, which refers to a lack of sexual attraction. And some
sexual orientations do not refer to gender in their description (PFLAG, 2021). It is important to acknowledge
and understand that many of these orientations exist on on a spectrum, and there may be no specific term to
describe how an individual feels.
Some of these terms have been associated in abbreviations such as LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender,
and queer or questioning). In some cases, people and organizations may add "I" to represent intersex people
(described below), and "A" for asexual or aromantic people (or sometimes for "allies"), as well as one "P" to
describe pansexual people and sometimes another "P" to describe polysexual people. Finally, some people and
organizations add a plus sign (+) to represent other possible identities or orientations. Sexuality and gender
terminology are constantly changing, and may mean different things to different people; they are not
universal, and each individual defines them for themselves (UC Davis LGBTQIA Resource Center 2020).

             FIGURE 10.18 Between 3% and 10% of the adult population identifies as gay or lesbian. (credit: Till Krech)
       Issues of sexual orientation have long fascinated scientists interested in determining what causes one
       individual to be straight while another is gay. For many years, people believed that these differences arose
       because of different socialization and familial experiences. However, research has consistently demonstrated
       that the family backgrounds and experiences are very similar among straight people and LGBTQ people (Bell,
       Weinberg, & Hammersmith, 1981; Ross & Arrindell, 1988).
       Genetic and biological mechanisms have also been proposed, and the balance of research evidence suggests
       that sexual orientation has an underlying biological component. For instance, over the past 25 years, research
       has demonstrated gene-level contributions to sexual orientation (Bailey & Pillard, 1991; Hamer, Hu,
       Magnuson, Hu, & Pattatucci, 1993; Rodriguez-Larralde & Paradisi, 2009), with some researchers estimating
       that genes account for at least half of the variability seen in human sexual orientation (Pillard & Bailey, 1998).
       Other studies report differences in brain structure and function among those with different sexual
       orientations (Allen & Gorski, 1992; Byne et al., 2001; Hu et al., 2008; LeVay, 1991; Ponseti et al., 2006; Rahman
       & Wilson, 2003a; Swaab & Hofman, 1990), and even differences in basic body structure and function have
       been observed (Hall & Kimura, 1994; Lippa, 2003; Loehlin & McFadden, 2003; McFadden & Champlin, 2000;
       McFadden & Pasanen, 1998; Rahman & Wilson, 2003b). In aggregate, the data suggest that to a significant
       extent, sexual orientations are something with which we are born.
       Misunderstandings About Sexual Orientation
       Regardless of how sexual orientation is determined, research has made clear that sexual orientation is not a
       choice, but rather it is a relatively stable characteristic of a person that cannot be changed. Claims of effective
       conversion therapy have received wide criticism from the research community due to significant concerns
       with research design, recruitment of experimental participants, and interpretation of data. As such, there is no
       credible scientific evidence to suggest that individuals can change their sexual orientation (Jenkins, 2010).
       Dr. Robert Spitzer, the author of one of the most widely-cited examples of conversion therapy, apologized to
       both the scientific community and the LGBTQ community for his mistakes, and he publically recanted his own
       paper in a public letter addressed to the editor of Archives of Sexual Behavior in the spring of 2012 (Carey,
       2012). In this letter, Spitzer wrote,

             I was considering writing something that would acknowledge that I now judge the major critiques of
             the study as largely correct. . . . I believe I owe the gay community an apology for my study making

      unproven claims of the efficacy of reparative therapy. I also apologize to any gay person who wasted
      time or energy undergoing some form of reparative therapy because they believed that I had proven
      that reparative therapy works with some "highly motivated" individuals. (Becker, 2012, pars. 2, 5)

Citing research that suggests not only that conversion therapy is ineffective, but also potentially harmful,
legislative efforts to make such therapy illegal have either been enacted or are underway across the United
States, and many professional organizations have issued statements against this practice (Human Rights
Campaign, n.d.)

Gender Identity

Many people conflate sexual orientation with gender identity because of misconceptions and attitudes that
exist about sexuality. In reality, these are two related, but different, aspects of who we are. Gender identity
refers to one's sense of being male, female, neither of these, both of these, or another gender. Generally, our
gender identities correspond to our chromosomal and phenotypic sex, but this is not always the case.
Transgender people's gender identity differs from the sex they were assigned at birth. Transgender people
may use a range of terms to describe themselves, including abbreviations (e.g. trans) or terms such as non-
binary.

When individuals do not feel comfortable identifying with the gender associated with their biological sex, then
they may experience gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is a diagnostic category in the fifth edition of the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) that describes individuals who do not identify
as the gender that most people would assume they are. This dysphoria must persist for at least six months and
result in significant distress or dysfunction to meet DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. In order for children to be
assigned this diagnostic category, they must verbalize their desire to become the other gender. It is important
to note that not all transgender people experience gender dysphoria, and that its diagnostic categorization is
not universally accepted. For example, in 2019, the World Health Organization reclassified "gender identity
disorder" as "gender incongruence," and categorized it under sexual health rather than a mental disorder.
However, health and mental health professionals indicate that the presence of the diagnostic category does
assist in supporting those who need treatment or help.

Some transgender individuals may undertake a process of transition, in which they move from living in a way
that is more aligned with the sex assigned at birth to living in a way that is aligned with their gender identity.
Transitioning may take the form of social, legal, or medical aspects of someone's life, but not everyone
undertakes any or all types of transition. Social transition may involve the person's presentation, name,
pronouns, and relationships. Legal transition can include changing their gender on government or other
official documents, changing their legal name, and so on. Some people may undergo a physical or medical
transition, in which they change their outward, physical, or sexual characteristics in order for their physical
being to better align with their gender identity (UCSF Transgender Care 2019). Not all transgender individuals
choose to alter their bodies: many will maintain their original anatomy but may present themselves to society
as another gender. This is typically done by adopting the dress, hairstyle, mannerisms, or other characteristics
typically assigned to another gender. It is important to note that people who cross-dress, or wear clothing that
is traditionally assigned to a gender different from their biological sex, are not necessarily transgender. Cross-
dressing is typically a form of self-expression or personal style, and it does not indicate a person's gender
identity or that they are transgender (TSER 2021).

Intersex is a general term used to describe people whose sex traits, reproductive anatomy, hormones, or
chromosomes are different from the usual two ways human bodies develop. Some intersex traits are
recognized at birth, while others are not recognizable until puberty or later in life (interACT 2021). Intersex
340 10 · Emotion and Motivation

       and transgender are not interchangeable terms; many transgender people have no intersex traits, and many
       intersex people do not consider themselves transgender.
       Those who identify with the sex they were assigned at birth are often referred to as cisgender, utilizing the
       Latin prefix "cis," which means "on the same side." (The prefix "trans" means "across.") Many cisgender people
       do not self-identify as such. As with transgender people, the term or usage of cisgender does not indicate a
       person's sexual orientation, gender, or gender expression (TSER 2021).
       Our scientific knowledge and general understanding about gender identity continue to evolve, and young
       people today have more opportunity to explore and openly express different ideas about what gender means
       than previous generations. Recent studies indicate that the majority of millennials (those ages 18-34) regard
       gender as a spectrum instead of a strict male/female binary, and that 12% identify as transgender or gender
       non-conforming. Additionally, more people know others who use gender-neutral pronouns (such as they/
       them) (Kennedy, 2017). This change in language may indicate that millennials and Generation Z people
       understand the experience of gender itself differently. As young people lead this change, other changes are
       emerging in a range of spheres, from public bathroom policies to retail organizations. For example, some
       retailers are starting to change traditional gender-based marketing of products, such as removing "pink and
       blue" clothing and toy aisles. Even with these changes, those who exist outside of traditional gender norms face
       difficult challenges. Even people who vary slightly from traditional norms are often the target of discrimination
       and violence.

      Cultural Factors in Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity

       Issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity are very much influenced by sociocultural factors.
       Even the ways in which we define sexual orientation and gender vary from one culture to the next. While in the
       United States heterosexuality has historically been viewed as the norm (making it a heteronormative society),
       there are societies that have different attitudes regarding LGBTQ people. In fact, in some instances, periods of

exclusively same-sex sexual behavior are socially prescribed as a part of normal development and maturation.
For example, in parts of New Guinea, young boys are expected to engage in sexual behavior with other boys for
a given period of time because it is believed that doing so is necessary for these boys to become men (Baldwin
& Baldwin, 1989).

There has historically been a two-gendered culture in the United States. We have tended to classify an
individual as either male or female according to the sex they were assigned at birth, leading the United States
to be considered a cisnormative society. However, in some cultures there are additional gender variants
resulting in more than two gender categories. For example, in Thailand, you can be male, female, or kathoey. A
kathoey is an individual who would be described as intersex or transgender in the United States
(Tangmunkongvorakul, Banwell, Carmichael, Utomo, & Sleigh, 2010).

 The Case of David Reimer

  In August of 1965, Janet and Ronald Reimer of Winnipeg, Canada, welcomed the birth of their twin sons, Bruce
  and Brian. Within a few months, the twins were experiencing urinary problems; doctors recommended the
  problems could be alleviated by having the boys circumcised. A malfunction of the medical equipment used to
  perform the circumcision resulted in Bruce's penis being irreparably damaged. Distraught, Janet and Ronald
  looked to expert advice on what to do with their baby boy. By happenstance, the couple became aware of Dr.
  John Money at Johns Hopkins University and his theory of psychosexual neutrality (Colapinto, 2000).

  Dr. Money had spent a considerable amount of time researching transgender individuals and individuals born
  with ambiguous genitalia. As a result of this work, he developed a theory of psychosexual neutrality. His theory
  asserted that we are essentially neutral at birth with regard to our gender identity and that we don't assume a
  concrete gender identity until we begin to master language. Furthermore, Dr. Money believed that the way in
  which we are socialized in early life is ultimately much more important than our biology in determining our
  gender identity (Money, 1962).

  Dr. Money encouraged Janet and Ronald to bring the twins to Johns Hopkins University, and he convinced them
  that they should raise Bruce as a girl. Left with few other options at the time, Janet and Ronald agreed to have
  Bruce's testicles removed and to raise him as a girl. When they returned home to Canada, they brought with them
  Brian and his "sister," Brenda, along with specific instructions to never reveal to Brenda that she had been born a
  boy (Colapinto, 2000).

  Early on, Dr. Money shared with the scientific community the great success of this natural experiment that
  seemed to fully support his theory of psychosexual neutrality (Money, 1975). Indeed, in early interviews with the
  children it appeared that Brenda was a typical little girl who liked to play with "girly" toys and do "girly" things.

  However, Dr. Money was less than forthcoming with information that seemed to argue against the success of the
  case. In reality, Brenda's parents were constantly concerned that their little girl wasn't really behaving as most
  girls did, and by the time Brenda was nearing adolescence, it was painfully obvious to the family that she was
  really having a hard time identifying as a female. In addition, Brenda was becoming increasingly reluctant to
  continue her visits with Dr. Money to the point that she threatened suicide if her parents made her go back to see
  him again.

  At that point, Janet and Ronald disclosed the true nature of Brenda's early childhood to their daughter. While
  initially shocked, Brenda reported that things made sense to her now, and ultimately, by the time she was an
  adolescent, Brenda had decided to identify as a male. Thus, she became David Reimer.

  David was quite comfortable in his masculine role. He made new friends and began to think about his future.
  Although his castration had left him infertile, he still wanted to be a father. In 1990, David married a single
342 10 · Emotion and Motivation

         mother and loved his new role as a husband and father. In 1997, David was made aware that Dr. Money was
         continuing to publicize his case as a success supporting his theory of psychosexual neutrality. This prompted
         David and his brother to go public with their experiences in attempt to discredit the doctor's publications. While
         this revelation created a firestorm in the scientific community for Dr. Money, it also triggered a series of
         unfortunate events that ultimately led to David dying by suicide in 2004 (O'Connell, 2004).

         This sad story speaks to the complexities involved in gender identity. While the Reimer case had earlier been
         paraded as a hallmark of how socialization trumped biology in terms of gender identity, the truth of the story
         made the scientific and medical communities more cautious in dealing with cases that involve intersex children
         and how to deal with their unique circumstances. In fact, stories like this one have prompted measures to
         prevent unnecessary harm and suffering to children who might have issues with gender identity. For example, in
         2013, a law took effect in Germany allowing parents of intersex children to classify their children as
         indeterminate so that children can self-assign the appropriate gender once they have fully developed their own
         gender identities (Paramaguru, 2013).

     10.4 Emotion

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain the major theories of emotion
         · Describe the role that limbic structures play in emotional processing
         · Understand the ubiquitous nature of producing and recognizing emotional expression

       As we move through our daily lives, we experience a variety of emotions. An emotion is a subjective state of
       being that we often describe as our feelings. Emotions result from the combination of subjective experience,
       expression, cognitive appraisal, and physiological responses (Levenson, Carstensen, Friesen, & Ekman, 1991).
       However, as discussed later in the chapter, the exact order in which the components occur is not clear, and
       some parts may happen at the same time. An emotion often begins with a subjective (individual) experience,
       which is a stimulus. Often the stimulus is external, but it does not have to be from the outside world. For
       example, it might be that one thinks about war and becomes sad, even though they never experienced war.
       Emotional expression refers to the way one displays an emotion and includes nonverbal and verbal behaviors
       (Gross, 1999). One also performs a cognitive appraisal in which a person tries to determine the way they will be
       impacted by a situation (Roseman & Smith, 2001). In addition, emotions include physiological responses, such
       as possible changes in heart rate, sweating, etc. (Soussignan, 2002).

       The words emotion and mood are sometimes used interchangeably, but psychologists use these words to refer
       to two different things. Typically, the word emotion indicates a subjective, affective state that is relatively
       intense and that occurs in response to something we experience (Figure 10.20). Emotions are often thought to
       be consciously experienced and intentional. Mood, on the other hand, refers to a prolonged, less intense,
       affective state that does not occur in response to something we experience. Mood states may not be
       consciously recognized and do not carry the intentionality that is associated with emotion (Beedie, Terry, Lane,
       & Devonport, 2011). Here we will focus on emotion, and you will learn more about mood in the chapter that
       covers psychological disorders.

We can be at the heights of joy or in the depths of despair. We might feel angry when we are betrayed, fear
when we are threatened, and surprised when something unexpected happens. This section will outline some
of the most well-known theories explaining our emotional experience and provide insight into the biological
bases of emotion. This section closes with a discussion of the ubiquitous nature of facial expressions of
emotion and our abilities to recognize those expressions in others.

Theories of Emotion

Our emotional states are combinations of physiological arousal, psychological appraisal, and subjective
experiences. Together, these are the components of emotion, and our experiences, backgrounds, and cultures
inform our emotions. Therefore, different people may have different emotional experiences even when faced
with similar circumstances. Over time, several different theories of emotion, shown in Figure 10.21, have been
proposed to explain how the various components of emotion interact with one another.

       FIGURE 10.21 This figure illustrates the major assertions of the James-Lange, Cannon-Bard, and Schachter-Singer
       two-factor theories of emotion. (credit "snake": modification of work by "tableatny"/Flickr; credit "face":
       modification of work by Cory Zanker)
       The James-Lange theory of emotion asserts that emotions arise from physiological arousal. Recall what you
       have learned about the sympathetic nervous system and our fight or flight response when threatened. If you
       were to encounter some threat in your environment, like a venomous snake in your backyard, your
       sympathetic nervous system would initiate significant physiological arousal, which would make your heart
       race and increase your respiration rate. According to the James-Lange theory of emotion, you would only
       experience a feeling of fear after this physiological arousal had taken place. Furthermore, different arousal
       patterns would be associated with different feelings.
       Other theorists, however, doubted that the physiological arousal that occurs with different types of emotions is

                                                                                                                                                                        10.4 · Emotion 345

distinct enough to result in the wide variety of emotions that we experience. Thus, the Cannon-Bard theory of
emotion was developed. According to this view, physiological arousal and emotional experience occur
simultaneously, yet independently (Lang, 1994). So, when you see the venomous snake, you feel fear at exactly
the same time that your body mounts its fight or flight response. This emotional reaction would be separate
and independent of the physiological arousal, even though they co-occur.

Does smiling make you happy? Alternatively, does being happy make you smile? The facial feedback
hypothesis proposes that your facial expression can actually affect your emotional experience (Adelman &
Zajonc, 1989; Boiger & Mesquita, 2012; Buck, 1980; Capella, 1993; Soussignan, 2001). Research investigating
the facial feedback hypothesis suggested that suppression of facial expression of emotion lowered the
intensity of some emotions experienced by participants (Davis, Senghas, & Ochsner, 2009). Havas, Glenberg,
Gutowski, Lucarelli, and Davidson (2010) used Botox injections to paralyze facial muscles and limit facial
expressions, including frowning, and they found that depressed people reported less depression after their
frowning muscles were paralyzed. Other research found that the intensities of facial expressions affected the
emotional reactions (Soussignan, 2002). In other words, if something insignificant occurs and you smile as if
you just won lottery, you will actually be happier about the little thing than you would be if you only had a tiny
smile. Conversely, if you walk around frowning all the time, it might cause you to have less positive emotions
than you would if you had smiled. Interestingly, Soussignan (2002) also reported physiological arousal
differences associated with the intensities of one type of smile.

G. Marañon Posadillo was a Spanish physician who studied the psychological effects of adrenaline to create a
model for the experience of emotion. Marañon's model preceded Schachter's two-factor or arousal-cognition
theory of emotion (Cornelius, 1991). The Schachter-Singer two-factor theory of emotion is another variation
on theories of emotions that takes into account both physiological arousal and the emotional experience.
According to this theory, emotions are composed of two factors: physiological and cognitive. In other words,
physiological arousal is interpreted in context to produce the emotional experience. In revisiting our example
involving the venomous snake in your backyard, the two-factor theory maintains that the snake elicits
sympathetic nervous system activation that is labeled as fear given the context, and our experience is that of
fear. If you had labeled your sympathetic nervous system activation as joy, you would have experienced joy.
The Schachter-Singer two-factor theory depends on labeling the physiological experience, which is a type of
cognitive appraisal.

Magda Arnold was the first theorist to offer an exploration of the meaning of appraisal, and to present an
outline of what the appraisal process might be and how it relates to emotion (Roseman & Smith, 2001). The key
idea of appraisal theory is that you have thoughts (a cognitive appraisal) before you experience an emotion,
and the emotion you experience depends on the thoughts you had (Frijda, 1988; Lazarus, 1991). If you think
something is positive, you will have more positive emotions about it than if your appraisal was negative, and
the opposite is true. Appraisal theory explains the way two people can have two completely different emotions
regarding the same event. For example, suppose your psychology instructor selected you to lecture on
emotion; you might see that as positive, because it represents an opportunity to be the center of attention, and
you would experience happiness. However, if you dislike speaking in public, you could have a negative
appraisal and experience discomfort.

Schachter and Singer believed that physiological arousal is very similar across the different types of emotions
that we experience, and therefore, the cognitive appraisal of the situation is critical to the actual emotion
experienced. In fact, it might be possible to misattribute arousal to an emotional experience if the
circumstances were right (Schachter & Singer, 1962). They performed a clever experiment to test their idea. A
group of men participating in the experiment were randomly assigned to one of several groups. Some of the
participants received injections of epinephrine that caused bodily changes that mimicked the fight-or-flight
response of the sympathetic nervous system; however, only some of these men were told to expect these
reactions as side effects of the injection. The other men that received injections of epinephrine were told either
that the injection would have no side effects or that it would result in a side effect unrelated to a sympathetic
346 10 · Emotion and Motivation

       response, such as itching feet or headache. After receiving these injections, participants waited in a room with
       someone else they thought was another subject in the research project. In reality, the other person was a
       confederate (someone working on behalf of) of the researcher. The confederate engaged in scripted displays of
       euphoric or angry behavior (Schachter & Singer, 1962).

       When those participants who were told that they should expect to feel symptoms of physiological arousal were
       asked about any emotional changes that they had experienced related to either euphoria or anger (depending
       on the way the confederate behaved), they reported none. However, the men who weren't expecting
       physiological arousal as a function of the injection were more likely to report that they experienced euphoria
       or anger as a function of their assigned confederate's behavior. While everyone who received an injection of
       epinephrine experienced the same physiological arousal, only those who were not expecting the arousal used
       context to interpret the arousal as a change in emotional state (Schachter & Singer, 1962).

       Strong emotional responses are associated with strong physiological arousal, which caused some theorists to
       suggest that the signs of physiological arousal, including increased heart rate, respiration rate, and sweating,
       might be used to determine whether someone is telling the truth or not. The assumption is that most of us
       would show signs of physiological arousal if we were being dishonest with someone. A polygraph, or lie
       detector test, measures the physiological arousal of an individual responding to a series of questions. Someone
       trained in reading these tests would look for answers to questions that are associated with increased levels of
       arousal as potential signs that the respondent may have been dishonest on those answers. While polygraphs
       are still commonly used, their validity and accuracy are highly questionable because there is no evidence that
       lying is associated with any particular pattern of physiological arousal (Saxe & Ben-Shakhar, 1999).

       The relationship between our experiencing of emotions and our cognitive processing of them, and the order in
       which these occur, remains a topic of research and debate. Lazarus (1991) developed the cognitive-
       mediational theory that asserts our emotions are determined by our appraisal of the stimulus. This appraisal
       mediates between the stimulus and the emotional response, and it is immediate and often unconscious. In
       contrast to the Schachter-Singer model, the appraisal precedes a cognitive label. You will learn more about
       Lazarus's appraisal concept when you study stress, health, and lifestyle. However, there are other views of
       emotions that also emphasize the cognitive processes.

       Return to the example of being asked to lecture by your professor. Even if you do not enjoy speaking in public,
       you probably could manage to do it. You would purposefully control your emotions, which would allow you to
       speak, but we constantly regulate our emotions, and much of our emotion regulation occurs without us
       actively thinking about it. Mauss and her colleagues studied automatic emotion regulation (AER), which refers
       to the non-deliberate control of emotions. It is simply not reacting with your emotions, and AER can affect all
       aspects of emotional processes. AER can influence the things you attend to, your appraisal, your choice to
       engage in an emotional experience, and your behaviors after an emotion is experienced (Mauss, Bunge, &
       Gross, 2007; Mauss, Levenson, McCarter, Wilhelm, & Gross, 2005). AER is similar to other automatic cognitive
       processes in which sensations activate knowledge structures that affect functioning. These knowledge
       structures can include concepts, schemas, or scripts.

       The idea of AER is that people develop an automatic process that works like a script or schema, and the
       process does not require deliberate thought to regulate emotions. AER works like riding a bicycle. Once you
       develop the process, you just do it without thinking about it. AER can be adaptive or maladaptive and has
       important health implications (Hopp, Troy, & Mauss, 2011). Adaptive AER leads to better health outcomes than
       maladaptive AER, primarily due to experiencing or mitigating stressors better than people with maladaptive
       AERs (Hopp, Troy, & Mauss, 2011). Alternatively, maladaptive AERs may be critical for maintaining some
       psychological disorders (Hopp, Troy, & Mauss, 2011). Mauss and her colleagues found that strategies could
       reduce negative emotions, which in turn should increase psychological health (Mauss, Cook, Cheng, & Gross,
       2007; Mauss, Cook, & Gross, 2007; Shallcross, Troy, Boland, & Mauss, 2010; Troy, Shallcross, & Mauss, 2013;
       Troy, Wilhelm, Shallcross, & Mauss, 2010). Mauss has also suggested there are problems with the way

emotions are measured, but she believes most of the aspects of emotions that are typically measured are
useful (Mauss, et al., 2005; Mauss & Robinson, 2009). However, another way of considering emotions
challenges our entire understanding of emotions.

After about three decades of interdisciplinary research, Barrett argued that we do not understand emotions.
She proposed that emotions were not built into your brain at birth, but rather they were constructed based on
your experiences. Emotions in the constructivist theory are predictions that construct your experience of the
world. In chapter 7 you learned that concepts are categories or groupings of linguistic information, images,
ideas, or memories, such as life experiences. Barrett extended that to include emotions as concepts that are
predictions (Barrett, 2017). Two identical physiological states can result in different emotional states
depending on your predictions. For example, your brain predicting a churning stomach in a bakery could lead
to you constructing hunger. However, your brain predicting a churning stomach while you were waiting for
medical test results could lead your brain to construct worry. Thus, you can construct two different emotions
from the same physiological sensations. Rather than emotions being something over which you have no
control, you can control and influence your emotions.

Two other prominent views arise from the work of Robert Zajonc and Joseph LeDoux. Zajonc asserted that
some emotions occur separately from or prior to our cognitive interpretation of them, such as feeling fear in
response to an unexpected loud sound (Zajonc, 1998). He also believed in what we might casually refer to as a
gut feeling--that we can experience an instantaneous and unexplainable like or dislike for someone or
something (Zajonc, 1980). LeDoux also views some emotions as requiring no cognition: some emotions
completely bypass contextual interpretation. His research into the neuroscience of emotion has demonstrated
the amygdala's primary role in fear (Cunha, Monfils, & LeDoux, 2010; LeDoux 1996, 2002). A fear stimulus is
processed by the brain through one of two paths: from the thalamus (where it is perceived) directly to the
amygdala or from the thalamus through the cortex and then to the amygdala. The first path is quick, while the
second enables more processing about details of the stimulus. In the following section, we will look more
closely at the neuroscience of emotional response.

The Biology of Emotions

Earlier, you learned about the limbic system, which is the area of the brain involved in emotion and memory
(Figure 10.22). The limbic system includes the hypothalamus, thalamus, amygdala, and the hippocampus. The
hypothalamus plays a role in the activation of the sympathetic nervous system that is a part of any given
emotional reaction. The thalamus serves as a sensory relay center whose neurons project to both the amygdala
and the higher cortical regions for further processing. The amygdala plays a role in processing emotional
information and sending that information on (Fossati, 2012).The hippocampus integrates emotional
experience with cognition (Femenía, Gómez-Galán, Lindskog, & Magara, 2012).

       Amygdala
       The amygdala has received a great deal of attention from researchers interested in understanding the
       biological basis for emotions, especially fear and anxiety (Blackford & Pine, 2012; Goosens & Maren, 2002;
       Maren, Phan, & Liberzon, 2013). The amygdala is composed of various subnuclei, including the basolateral
       complex and the central nucleus (Figure 10.23). The basolateral complex has dense connections with a
       variety of sensory areas of the brain. It is critical for classical conditioning and for attaching emotional value to
       learning processes and memory. The central nucleus plays a role in attention, and it has connections with the
       hypothalamus and various brainstem areas to regulate the autonomic nervous and endocrine systems' activity
       (Pessoa, 2010).

odor cues paired with electrical shock when their mother is absent. This leads to an aversion to the odor cue
that suggests the rats learned to fear the odor cue. Interestingly, when the mother was present, the rats actually
showed a preference for the odor cue despite its association with an electrical shock. This preference was
associated with no increases in amygdala activation. This suggests a differential effect on the amygdala by the
context (the presence or absence of the mother) determined whether the pups learned to fear the odor or to be
attracted to it (Moriceau & Sullivan, 2006).
Raineki, Cortés, Belnoue, and Sullivan (2012) demonstrated that, in rats, negative early life experiences could
alter the function of the amygdala and result in adolescent patterns of behavior that mimic human mood
disorders. In this study, rat pups received either abusive or normal treatment during postnatal days 8-12.
There were two forms of abusive treatment. The first form of abusive treatment had an insufficient bedding
condition. The mother rat had insufficient bedding material in her cage to build a proper nest that resulted in
her spending more time away from her pups trying to construct a nest and less times nursing her pups. The
second form of abusive treatment had an associative learning task that involved pairing odors and an electrical
stimulus in the absence of the mother, as described above. The control group was in a cage with sufficient
bedding and was left undisturbed with their mothers during the same time period. The rat pups that
experienced abuse were much more likely to exhibit depressive-like symptoms during adolescence when
compared to controls. These depressive-like behaviors were associated with increased activation of the
amygdala.
Human research also suggests a relationship between the amygdala and psychological disorders of mood or
anxiety. Changes in amygdala structure and function have been demonstrated in adolescents who are either
at-risk or have been diagnosed with various mood and/or anxiety disorders (Miguel-Hidalgo, 2013; Qin et al.,
2013). It has also been suggested that functional differences in the amygdala could serve as a biomarker to
differentiate individuals suffering from bipolar disorder from those suffering from major depressive disorder
(Fournier, Keener, Almeida, Kronhaus, & Phillips, 2013).
Hippocampus
As mentioned earlier, the hippocampus is also involved in emotional processing. Like the amygdala, research
350 10 · Emotion and Motivation

       has demonstrated that hippocampal structure and function are linked to a variety of mood and anxiety
       disorders. Individuals suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) show marked reductions in the
       volume of several parts of the hippocampus, which may result from decreased levels of neurogenesis and
       dendritic branching (the generation of new neurons and the generation of new dendrites in existing neurons,
       respectively) (Wang et al., 2010). While it is impossible to make a causal claim with correlational research like
       this, studies have demonstrated behavioral improvements and hippocampal volume increases following either
       pharmacological or cognitive-behavioral therapy in individuals suffering from PTSD (Bremner & Vermetten,
       2004; Levy-Gigi, Szabó, Kelemen, & Kéri, 2013).

      Facial Expression and Recognition of Emotions

       Culture can impact the way in which people display emotion. A cultural display rule is one of a collection of
       culturally specific standards that govern the types and frequencies of displays of emotions that are acceptable
       (Malatesta & Haviland, 1982). Therefore, people from varying cultural backgrounds can have very different
       cultural display rules of emotion. For example, research has shown that individuals from the United States
       express negative emotions like fear, anger, and disgust both alone and in the presence of others, while
       Japanese individuals only do so while alone (Matsumoto, 1990). Furthermore, individuals from cultures that
       tend to emphasize social cohesion are more likely to engage in suppression of emotional reaction so they can
       evaluate which response is most appropriate in a given context (Matsumoto, Yoo, & Nakagawa, 2008).
       Other distinct cultural characteristics might be involved in emotionality. For instance, there may be gender
       differences involved in emotional processing. While research into gender differences in emotional display is
       equivocal, there is some evidence that people of different genders may differ in regulation of emotions (McRae,
       Ochsner, Mauss, Gabrieli, & Gross, 2008).
       Paul Ekman (1972) researched a New Guinea man who was living in a preliterate culture using stone
       implements, and which was isolated and had never seen any outsiders before. Ekman asked the man to show
       what his facial expression would be if: (1) friends visited, (2) his child had just died, (3) he was about to fight,
       (4) he stepped on a smelly dead pig. After Ekman's return from New Guinea, he researched facial expressions
       for more than four decades. Despite different emotional display rules, our ability to recognize and produce
       facial expressions of emotion appears to be universal. In fact, even congenitally blind individuals produce the
       same facial expression of emotions, despite their never having the opportunity to observe these facial displays
       of emotion in other people. This would seem to suggest that the pattern of activity in facial muscles involved in
       generating emotional expressions is universal, and indeed, this idea was suggested in the late 19th century in
       Charles Darwin's book The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals (1872). In fact, there is substantial
       evidence for seven universal emotions that are each associated with distinct facial expressions. These include:
       happiness, surprise, sadness, fright, disgust, contempt, and anger (Figure 10.24) (Ekman & Keltner, 1997).

Of course, emotion is not only displayed through facial expression. We also use the tone of our voices, various
behaviors, and body language to communicate information about our emotional states. Body language is the
expression of emotion in terms of body position or movement. Research suggests that we are quite sensitive to
the emotional information communicated through body language, even if we're not consciously aware of it (de
Gelder, 2006; Tamietto et al., 2009).

Emotional Expression and Emotion Regulation

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a set of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by repetitive behaviors and
communication and social problems. Children who have autism spectrum disorders have difficulty recognizing the
emotional states of others, and research has shown that this may stem from an inability to distinguish various
nonverbal expressions of emotion (i.e., facial expressions) from one another (Hobson, 1986). In addition, there is
evidence to suggest that autistic individuals also have difficulty expressing emotion through tone of voice and by
producing facial expressions (Macdonald et al., 1989). Difficulties with emotional recognition and expression may
contribute to the behaviors that characterize autism; therefore, various therapeutic approaches have been explored
to address these difficulties. Various educational curricula, cognitive-behavioral therapies, and pharmacological
therapies have shown some promise in helping autistic individuals process emotionally relevant information
(Bauminger, 2002; Golan & Baron-Cohen, 2006; Guastella et al., 2010).
Emotion regulation describes how people respond to situations and experiences by modifying their emotional
352 10 · Emotion and Motivation

       experiences and expressions. Covert emotion regulation strategies are those that occur within the individual, while
       overt strategies involve others or actions (such as seeking advice or consuming alcohol). Aldao and Dixon (2014)
       studied the relationship between overt emotional regulation strategies and psychopathology. They researched how
       218 undergraduate students reported their use of covert and overt strategies and their reported symptoms
       associated with selected mental disorders, and found that overt emotional regulation strategies were better
       predictors of psychopathology than covert strategies. Another study examined the relationship between pregaming
       (the act of drinking heavily before a social event) and two emotion regulation strategies to understand how these
       might contribute to alcohol-related problems; results suggested a relationship but a complicated one (Pederson,
       2016). Further research is needed in these areas to better understand patterns of adaptive and maladaptive
       emotion regulation (Aldao & Dixon-Gordon, 2014).

Summary

10.1 Motivation

Motivation to engage in a given behavior can come from internal and/or external factors. Multiple theories
have been put forward regarding motivation. More biologically oriented theories deal with the ways that
instincts and the need to maintain bodily homeostasis motivate behavior. Bandura postulated that our sense of
self-efficacy motivates behaviors, and there are a number of theories that focus on a variety of social motives.
Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a model that shows the relationship among multiple motives that
range from lower-level physiological needs to the very high level of self-actualization.

10.2 Hunger and Eating

Hunger and satiety are highly regulated processes that result in a person maintaining a fairly stable weight
that is resistant to change. When more calories are consumed than expended, a person will store excess
energy as fat. Being significantly overweight adds substantially to a person's health risks and problems,
including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, and other medical issues. Sociocultural
factors that emphasize thinness as a beauty ideal and a genetic predisposition contribute to the development
of eating disorders in many young females, though eating disorders span ages and genders.

10.3 Sexual Behavior

The hypothalamus and structures of the limbic system are important in sexual behavior and motivation. There
is evidence to suggest that our motivation to engage in sexual behavior and our ability to do so are related, but
separate, processes. Alfred Kinsey conducted large-scale survey research that demonstrated the incredible
diversity of human sexuality. William Masters and Virginia Johnson observed individuals engaging in sexual
behavior in developing their concept of the sexual response cycle. While often interchanged, sexual orientation
and gender identity are related, but distinct, concepts.

10.4 Emotion

Emotions are subjective experiences that consist of physiological arousal and cognitive appraisal. Various
theories have been put forward to explain our emotional experiences. The James-Lange theory asserts that
emotions arise as a function of physiological arousal. The Cannon-Bard theory maintains that emotional
experience occurs simultaneous to and independent of physiological arousal. The Schachter-Singer two-factor
theory suggests that physiological arousal receives cognitive labels as a function of the relevant context and
that these two factors together result in an emotional experience.

The limbic system is the brain's emotional circuit, which includes the amygdala and the hippocampus. Both of
these structures are implicated in playing a role in normal emotional processing as well as in psychological
mood and anxiety disorders. Increased amygdala activity is associated with learning to fear, and it is seen in
individuals who are at risk for or suffering from mood disorders. The volume of the hippocampus has been

shown to be reduced in individuals suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder.

The ability to produce and recognize facial expressions of emotions seems to be universal regardless of
cultural background. However, there are cultural display rules which influence how often and under what
circumstances various emotions can be expressed. Tone of voice and body language also serve as a means by
which we communicate information about our emotional states.

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Define personality
         · Describe early theories about personality development
       Personality refers to the long-standing traits and patterns that propel individuals to consistently think, feel,
       and behave in specific ways. Our personality is what makes us unique individuals. Each person has an
       idiosyncratic pattern of enduring, long-term characteristics and a manner in which they interact with other
       individuals and the world around them. Our personalities are thought to be long term, stable, and not easily
       changed. The word personality comes from the Latin word persona. In the ancient world, a persona was a
       mask worn by an actor. While we tend to think of a mask as being worn to conceal one's identity, the theatrical
       mask was originally used to either represent or project a specific personality trait of a character (Figure 11.2).

         FIGURE 11.2 Happy, sad, impatient, shy, fearful, curious, helpful. What characteristics describe your personality?

      Historical Perspectives

       The concept of personality has been studied for at least 2,000 years, beginning with Hippocrates in 370 BCE
       (Fazeli, 2012). Hippocrates theorized that personality traits and human behaviors are based on four separate
       temperaments associated with four fluids ("humors") of the body: choleric temperament (yellow bile from the
       liver), melancholic temperament (black bile from the kidneys), sanguine temperament (red blood from the
       heart), and phlegmatic temperament (white phlegm from the lungs) (Clark & Watson, 2008; Eysenck &
       Eysenck, 1985; Lecci & Magnavita, 2013; Noga, 2007). Centuries later, the influential Greek physician and
       philosopher Galen built on Hippocrates's theory, suggesting that both diseases and personality differences
       could be explained by imbalances in the humors and that each person exhibits one of the four temperaments.
       For example, the choleric person is passionate, ambitious, and bold; the melancholic person is reserved,
       anxious, and unhappy; the sanguine person is joyful, eager, and optimistic; and the phlegmatic person is calm,
       reliable, and thoughtful (Clark & Watson, 2008; Stelmack & Stalikas, 1991). Galen's theory was prevalent for
       over 1,000 years and continued to be popular through the Middle Ages.
       In 1780, Franz Gall, a German physician, proposed that the distances between bumps on the skull reveal a
       person's personality traits, character, and mental abilities (Figure 11.3). According to Gall, measuring these
       distances revealed the sizes of the brain areas underneath, providing information that could be used to
       determine whether a person was friendly, prideful, murderous, kind, good with languages, and so on. Initially,
       phrenology was very popular; however, it was soon discredited for lack of empirical support and has long been
       relegated to the status of pseudoscience (Fancher, 1979).

In the centuries after Galen, other researchers contributed to the development of his four primary
temperament types, most prominently Immanuel Kant (in the 18th century) and psychologist Wilhelm Wundt
(in the 19th century) (Eysenck, 2009; Stelmack & Stalikas, 1991; Wundt, 1874/1886) (Figure 11.4). Kant agreed
with Galen that everyone could be sorted into one of the four temperaments and that there was no overlap
between the four categories (Eysenck, 2009). He developed a list of traits that could be used to describe the
personality of a person from each of the four temperaments. However, Wundt suggested that a better
description of personality could be achieved using two major axes: emotional/nonemotional and changeable/
unchangeable. The first axis separated strong from weak emotions (the melancholic and choleric
temperaments from the phlegmatic and sanguine). The second axis divided the changeable temperaments
(choleric and sanguine) from the unchangeable ones (melancholic and phlegmatic) (Eysenck, 2009).

       FIGURE 11.4 Developed from Galen's theory of the four temperaments, Kant proposed trait words to describe each
       temperament. Wundt later suggested the arrangement of the traits on two major axes.
       Sigmund Freud's psychodynamic perspective of personality was the first comprehensive theory of personality,
       explaining a wide variety of both normal and abnormal behaviors. According to Freud, unconscious drives
       influenced by sex and aggression, along with childhood sexuality, are the forces that influence our personality.
       Freud attracted many followers who modified his ideas to create new theories about personality. These
       theorists, referred to as neo-Freudians, generally agreed with Freud that childhood experiences matter, but
       they reduced the emphasis on sex and focused more on the social environment and effects of culture on
       personality. The perspective of personality proposed by Freud and his followers was the dominant theory of
       personality for the first half of the 20th century.
       Other major theories then emerged, including the learning, humanistic, biological, evolutionary, trait, and
       cultural perspectives. In this chapter, we will explore these various perspectives on personality in depth.

       Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) is probably the most controversial and misunderstood psychological theorist.
       When reading Freud's theories, it is important to remember that he was a medical doctor, not a psychologist.
       There was no such thing as a degree in psychology at the time that he received his education, which can help

us understand some of the controversy over his theories today. However, Freud was the first to systematically
study and theorize the workings of the unconscious mind in the manner that we associate with modern
psychology.
In the early years of his career, Freud worked with Josef Breuer, a Viennese physician. During this time, Freud
became intrigued by the story of one of Breuer's patients, Bertha Pappenheim, who was referred to by the
pseudonym Anna O. (Launer, 2005). Anna O. had been caring for her dying father when she began to
experience symptoms such as partial paralysis, headaches, blurred vision, amnesia, and hallucinations
(Launer, 2005). In Freud's day, these symptoms were commonly referred to as hysteria. Anna O. turned to
Breuer for help. He spent 2 years (1880-1882) treating Anna O. and discovered that allowing her to talk about
her experiences seemed to bring some relief of her symptoms. Anna O. called his treatment the "talking cure"
(Launer, 2005). Despite the fact that Freud never met Anna O., her story served as the basis for the 1895 book,
Studies on Hysteria, which he co-authored with Breuer. Based on Breuer's description of Anna O.'s treatment,
Freud concluded that hysteria was the result of sexual abuse in childhood and that these traumatic
experiences had been hidden from consciousness. Breuer disagreed with Freud, which soon ended their work
together. However, Freud continued to work to refine talk therapy and build his theory on personality.

Levels of Consciousness

To explain the concept of conscious versus unconscious experience, Freud compared the mind to an iceberg
(Figure 11.5). He said that only about one-tenth of our mind is conscious, and the rest of our mind is
unconscious. Our unconscious refers to that mental activity of which we are unaware and are unable to access
(Freud, 1923). According to Freud, unacceptable urges and desires are kept in our unconscious through a
process called repression. For example, we sometimes say things that we don't intend to say by unintentionally
substituting another word for the one we meant. You've probably heard of a Freudian slip, the term used to
describe this. Freud suggested that slips of the tongue are actually sexual or aggressive urges, accidentally
slipping out of our unconscious. Speech errors such as this are quite common. Seeing them as a reflection of
unconscious desires, linguists today have found that slips of the tongue tend to occur when we are tired,
nervous, or not at our optimal level of cognitive functioning (Motley, 2002).

FIGURE 11.5 Freud believed that we are only aware of a small amount of our mind's activities and that most of it
364 11 · Personality

       remains hidden from us in our unconscious. The information in our unconscious affects our behavior, although we
       are unaware of it.
       According to Freud, our personality develops from a conflict between two forces: our biological aggressive and
       pleasure-seeking drives versus our internal (socialized) control over these drives. Our personality is the result
       of our efforts to balance these two competing forces. Freud suggested that we can understand this by
       imagining three interacting systems within our minds. He called them the id, ego, and superego (Figure 11.6).

       FIGURE 11.6 The job of the ego, or self, is to balance the aggressive/pleasure-seeking drives of the id with the
       moral control of the superego.
       The unconscious id contains our most primitive drives or urges, and is present from birth. It directs impulses
       for hunger, thirst, and sex. Freud believed that the id operates on what he called the "pleasure principle," in
       which the id seeks immediate gratification. Through social interactions with parents and others in a child's
       environment, the ego and superego develop to help control the id. The superego develops as a child interacts
       with others, learning the social rules for right and wrong. The superego acts as our conscience; it is our moral
       compass that tells us how we should behave. It strives for perfection and judges our behavior, leading to
       feelings of pride or--when we fall short of the ideal--feelings of guilt. In contrast to the instinctual id and the
       rule-based superego, the ego is the rational part of our personality. It's what Freud considered to be the self,
       and it is the part of our personality that is seen by others. Its job is to balance the demands of the id and
       superego in the context of reality; thus, it operates on what Freud called the "reality principle." The ego helps
       the id satisfy its desires in a realistic way.
       The id and superego are in constant conflict, because the id wants instant gratification regardless of the
       consequences, but the superego tells us that we must behave in socially acceptable ways. Thus, the ego's job is
       to find the middle ground. It helps satisfy the id's desires in a rational way that will not lead us to feelings of
       guilt. According to Freud, a person who has a strong ego, which can balance the demands of the id and the
       superego, has a healthy personality. Freud maintained that imbalances in the system can lead to neurosis (a
       tendency to experience negative emotions), anxiety disorders, or unhealthy behaviors. For example, a person
       who is dominated by their id might be narcissistic and impulsive. A person with a dominant superego might be
       controlled by feelings of guilt and deny themselves even socially acceptable pleasures; conversely, if the
       superego is weak or absent, a person might become a psychopath. An overly dominant superego might be seen
       in an over-controlled individual whose rational grasp on reality is so strong that they are unaware of their
       emotional needs, or, in a neurotic who is overly defensive (overusing ego defense mechanisms).

      Defense Mechanisms

       Freud believed that feelings of anxiety result from the ego's inability to mediate the conflict between the id and
       superego. When this happens, Freud believed that the ego seeks to restore balance through various protective
       measures known as defense mechanisms (Figure 11.7). When certain events, feelings, or yearnings cause an
       individual anxiety, the individual wishes to reduce that anxiety. To do that, the individual's unconscious mind
       uses ego defense mechanisms, unconscious protective behaviors that aim to reduce anxiety. The ego, usually

conscious, resorts to unconscious strivings to protect the ego from being overwhelmed by anxiety. When we
use defense mechanisms, we are unaware that we are using them. Further, they operate in various ways that
distort reality. According to Freud, we all use ego defense mechanisms.

         FIGURE 11.7 Defense mechanisms are unconscious protective behaviors that work to reduce anxiety.
While everyone uses defense mechanisms, Freud believed that overuse of them may be problematic. For
example, let's say Joe is a high school football player. Deep down, Joe feels sexually attracted to males. His
conscious belief is that being gay is immoral and that if he were gay, his family would disown him and he would
be ostracized by his peers. Therefore, there is a conflict between his conscious beliefs (being gay is wrong and
366 11 · Personality

will result in being ostracized) and his unconscious urges (attraction to males). The idea that he might be gay
causes Joe to have feelings of anxiety. How can he decrease his anxiety? Joe may find himself acting very
"macho," making gay jokes, and picking on a school peer who is gay. This way, Joe's unconscious impulses are
further submerged.

There are several different types of defense mechanisms. For instance, in repression, anxiety-causing
memories from consciousness are blocked. As an analogy, let's say your car is making a strange noise, but
because you do not have the money to get it fixed, you just turn up the radio so that you no longer hear the
strange noise. Eventually you forget about it. Similarly, in the human psyche, if a memory is too overwhelming
to deal with, it might be repressed and thus removed from conscious awareness (Freud, 1920). This repressed
memory might cause symptoms in other areas.

Another defense mechanism is reaction formation, in which someone expresses feelings, thoughts, and
behaviors opposite to their inclinations. In the above example, Joe made fun of a gay peer while himself being
attracted to males. In regression, an individual acts much younger than their age. For example, a four-year-old
child who resents the arrival of a newborn sibling may act like a baby and revert to drinking out of a bottle. In
projection, a person refuses to acknowledge her own unconscious feelings and instead sees those feelings in
someone else. Other defense mechanisms include rationalization, displacement, and sublimation.

Stages of Psychosexual Development

Freud believed that personality develops during early childhood: Childhood experiences shape our
personalities as well as our behavior as adults. He asserted that we develop via a series of stages during
childhood. Each of us must pass through these childhood stages, and if we do not have the proper nurturing
and parenting during a stage, we will be stuck, or fixated, in that stage, even as adults.

In each psychosexual stage of development, the child's pleasure-seeking urges, coming from the id, are
focused on a different area of the body, called an erogenous zone. The stages are oral, anal, phallic, latency, and
genital (Table 11.1).

Freud's psychosexual development theory is quite controversial. To understand the origins of the theory, it is
helpful to be familiar with the political, social, and cultural influences of Freud's day in Vienna at the turn of
the 20th century. During this era, a climate of sexual repression, combined with limited understanding and
education surrounding human sexuality, heavily influenced Freud's perspective. Given that sex was a taboo
topic, Freud assumed that negative emotional states (neuroses) stemmed from suppression of unconscious
sexual and aggressive urges. For Freud, his own recollections and interpretations of patients' experiences and
dreams were sufficient proof that psychosexual stages were universal events in early childhood.

Genital 12+  Genitals             None

TABLE 11.1

Oral Stage

In the oral stage (birth to 1 year), pleasure is focused on the mouth. Eating and the pleasure derived from
sucking (nipples, pacifiers, and thumbs) play a large part in a baby's first year of life. At around 1 year of age,
babies are weaned from the bottle or breast, and this process can create conflict if not handled properly by
caregivers. According to Freud, an adult who smokes, drinks, overeats, or bites her nails is fixated in the oral
stage of her psychosexual development; she may have been weaned too early or too late, resulting in these
fixation tendencies, all of which seek to ease anxiety.

Anal Stage

After passing through the oral stage, children enter what Freud termed the anal stage (1-3 years). In this stage,
children experience pleasure in their bowel and bladder movements, so it makes sense that the conflict in this
stage is over toilet training. During this stage of development, children work to master control of themselves.
Freud suggested that success at the anal stage depended on how parents handled toilet training. Parents who
offer praise and rewards encourage positive results and can help children feel competent. Parents who are
harsh in toilet training can cause a child to become so fearful of soiling that they over-control and become
fixated at the anal stage, leading to the development of an anal-retentive personality. The anal-retentive
personality is stingy and stubborn, has a compulsive need for order and neatness, and might be considered a
perfectionist. If parents are too lenient in toilet training, the child may fail to develop sufficient self-control,
become fixated at this stage, and develop an anal-expulsive personality. The anal-expulsive personality is
messy, careless, disorganized, and prone to emotional outbursts.

Phallic Stage

Freud's third stage of psychosexual development is the phallic stage (3-6 years), corresponding to the age
when children become aware of their bodies and recognize the differences between boys and girls. The
erogenous zone in this stage is the genitals. Conflict arises when the child feels a desire for the opposite-sex
parent, and jealousy and hatred toward the same-sex parent. For boys, this is called the Oedipus complex,
involving a boy's desire for his mother and his urge to replace his father who is seen as a rival for the mother's
attention. At the same time, the boy is afraid his father will punish him for his feelings, so he experiences
castration anxiety. The Oedipus complex is successfully resolved when the boy begins to identify with his
father as an indirect way to have the mother. Failure to resolve the Oedipus complex may result in fixation and
development of a personality that might be described as vain and overly ambitious.

Girls experience a comparable conflict in the phallic stage--the Electra complex. The Electra complex, while
often attributed to Freud, was actually proposed by Freud's protégé, Carl Jung (Jung & Kerenyi, 1963). A girl
desires the attention of her father and wishes to take her mother's place. Jung also said that girls are angry
with the mother for not providing them with a penis--which he termed penis envy. While Freud initially
embraced the Electra complex as a parallel to the Oedipus complex, he later rejected it, yet it remains as a
cornerstone of Freudian theory, thanks in part to academics in the field (Freud, 1931/1968; Scott, 2005).

Latency Period

Following the phallic stage of psychosexual development is a period known as the latency period (6 years to
puberty). This period is not considered a stage, because sexual feelings are dormant as children focus on other
pursuits, such as school, friendships, hobbies, and sports. Children generally engage in activities with peers of
the same sex, which serves to consolidate a child's gender-role identity.
368 11 · Personality

       Genital Stage
       The final stage is the genital stage (from puberty on). In this stage, there is a sexual reawakening as the
       incestuous urges resurface. The young person redirects these urges to other, more socially acceptable partners
       (who often resemble the other-sex parent). People in this stage have mature sexual interests, which for Freud
       meant a strong desire for the opposite sex. Individuals who successfully completed the previous stages,
       reaching the genital stage with no fixations, are said to be well-balanced, healthy adults.
       While most of Freud's ideas have not found support in modern research, and several contemporary
       researchers rejected his premises, we cannot discount the contributions that Freud has made to the field of
       psychology. It was Freud who pointed out that a large part of our mental life is influenced by the experiences of
       early childhood and takes place outside of our conscious awareness; his theories paved the way for others.
       While Freud's focus on biological drives led him to emphasize the impact of sociocultural factors on
       personality development, his followers quickly realized that biology alone could not account for the diversity
       they encountered as the practice of psychoanalysis spread during the time of the Nazi Holocaust. The
       antisemitism which was prevalent during this period of time may have led mainstream psychoanalysts to
       focus primarily on the universality of the psychological structures of the mind.

     11.3 Neo-Freudians: Adler, Erikson, Jung, and Horney

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Discuss the concept of the inferiority complex
         · Discuss the core differences between Erikson's and Freud's views on personality
         · Discuss Jung's ideas of the collective unconscious and archetypes
         · Discuss the work of Karen Horney, including her revision of Freud's "penis envy"
       Freud attracted many followers who modified his ideas to create new theories about personality. These
       theorists, referred to as neo-Freudians, generally agreed with Freud that childhood experiences matter, but
       deemphasized sex, focusing more on the social environment and effects of culture on personality. Four notable
       neo-Freudians include Alfred Adler, Erik Erikson, Carl Jung (pronounced "Yoong"), and Karen Horney
       (pronounced "HORN-eye").

      Alfred Adler

       Alfred Adler, a colleague of Freud's and the first president of the Vienna Psychoanalytical Society (Freud's
       inner circle of colleagues), was the first major theorist to break away from Freud (Figure 11.8). He
       subsequently founded a school of psychology called individual psychology, which focuses on our drive to
       compensate for feelings of inferiority. Adler (1937, 1956) proposed the concept of the inferiority complex. An
       inferiority complex refers to a person's feelings that they lack worth and don't measure up to the standards of
       others or of society. Adler's ideas about inferiority represent a major difference between his thinking and
       Freud's. Freud believed that we are motivated by sexual and aggressive urges, but Adler (1930, 1961) believed
       that feelings of inferiority in childhood are what drive people to attempt to gain superiority and that this
       striving is the force behind all of our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.

                           FIGURE 11.8 Alfred Adler proposed the concept of the inferiority complex.
Adler also believed in the importance of social connections, seeing childhood development emerging through
social development rather than the sexual stages Freud outlined. Adler noted the inter-relatedness of
humanity and the need to work together for the betterment of all. He said, "The happiness of mankind lies in
working together, in living as if each individual had set himself the task of contributing to the common welfare"
(Adler, 1964, p. 255) with the main goal of psychology being "to recognize the equal rights and equality of
others" (Adler, 1961, p. 691).
With these ideas, Adler identified three fundamental social tasks that all of us must experience: occupational
tasks (careers), societal tasks (friendship), and love tasks (finding an intimate partner for a long-term
relationship). Rather than focus on sexual or aggressive motives for behavior as Freud did, Adler focused on
social motives. He also emphasized conscious rather than unconscious motivation, since he believed that the
three fundamental social tasks are explicitly known and pursued. That is not to say that Adler did not also
believe in unconscious processes--he did--but he felt that conscious processes were more important.
One of Adler's major contributions to personality psychology was the idea that our birth order shapes our
personality. He proposed that older siblings, who start out as the focus of their parents' attention but must
share that attention once a new child joins the family, compensate by becoming overachievers. The youngest
children, according to Adler, may be spoiled, leaving the middle child with the opportunity to minimize the
negative dynamics of the youngest and oldest children. Despite popular attention, research has not
conclusively confirmed Adler's hypotheses about birth order.

Erik Erikson

As an art school dropout with an uncertain future, young Erik Erikson met Freud's daughter, Anna Freud, while
he was tutoring the children of an American couple undergoing psychoanalysis in Vienna. It was Anna Freud
who encouraged Erikson to study psychoanalysis. Erikson received his diploma from the Vienna
Psychoanalytic Institute in 1933, and as Nazism spread across Europe, he fled the country and immigrated to
the United States that same year. As you learned when you studied lifespan development, Erikson later
proposed a psychosocial theory of development, suggesting that an individual's personality develops
throughout the lifespan--a departure from Freud's view that personality is fixed in early life. In his theory,
Erikson emphasized the social relationships that are important at each stage of personality development, in
contrast to Freud's emphasis on sex. Erikson identified eight stages, each of which represents a conflict or
developmental task (Table 11.2). The development of a healthy personality and a sense of competence depend
on the successful completion of each task.

Carl Jung

Carl Jung (Figure 11.9) was a Swiss psychiatrist and protégé of Freud, who later split off from Freud and
developed his own theory, which he called analytical psychology. The focus of analytical psychology is on
working to balance opposing forces of conscious and unconscious thought, and experience within one's
personality. According to Jung, this work is a continuous learning process--mainly occurring in the second half
of life--of becoming aware of unconscious elements and integrating them into consciousness.

                         FIGURE 11.9 Carl Jung was interested in exploring the collective unconscious.

Jung's split from Freud was based on two major disagreements. First, Jung, like Adler and Erikson, did not
accept that sexual drive was the primary motivator in a person's mental life. Second, although Jung agreed
with Freud's concept of a personal unconscious, he thought it to be incomplete. In addition to the personal
unconscious, Jung focused on the collective unconscious.

The collective unconscious is a universal version of the personal unconscious, holding mental patterns, or
memory traces, which are common to all of us (Jung, 1928). These ancestral memories, which Jung called
archetypes, are represented by universal themes in various cultures, as expressed through literature, art, and
dreams (Jung). Jung said that these themes reflect common experiences of people the world over, such as
facing death, becoming independent, and striving for mastery. Jung (1964) believed that through biology, each
person is handed down the same themes and that the same types of symbols--such as the hero, the maiden,
the sage, and the trickster--are present in the folklore and fairy tales of every culture. In Jung's view, the task of
integrating these unconscious archetypal aspects of the self is part of the self-realization process in the second
half of life. With this orientation toward self-realization, Jung parted ways with Freud's belief that personality is
determined solely by past events and anticipated the humanistic movement with its emphasis on self-
actualization and orientation toward the future.

Jung also proposed two attitudes or approaches toward life: extroversion and introversion (Jung, 1923) (Table
11.3). These ideas are considered Jung's most important contributions to the field of personality psychology,
as almost all models of personality now include these concepts. If you are an extrovert, then you are a person
who is energized by being outgoing and socially oriented: You derive your energy from being around others. If
you are an introvert, then you are a person who may be quiet and reserved, or you may be social, but your
energy is derived from your inner psychic activity. Jung believed a balance between extroversion and
introversion best served the goal of self-realization.

                      TABLE 11.3

Another concept proposed by Jung was the persona, which he referred to as a mask that we adopt. According
to Jung, we consciously create this persona; however, it is derived from both our conscious experiences and
our collective unconscious. What is the purpose of the persona? Jung believed that it is a compromise between
who we really are (our true self) and what society expects us to be. We hide those parts of ourselves that are not
aligned with society's expectations.

     LINK TO LEARNING

Jung's view of extroverted and introverted types serves as a basis of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI).

intuition versus sensation, and judging versus perceiving. Take this modified questionnaire based on the MBTI

         CONNECT THE CONCEPTS

Are Archetypes Genetically Based?

Jung proposed that human responses to archetypes are similar to instinctual responses in animals. One criticism of
Jung is that there is no evidence that archetypes are biologically based or similar to animal instincts (Roesler, 2012).
Jung formulated his ideas about 100 years ago, and great advances have been made in the field of genetics since
that time. We've found that human babies are born with certain capacities, including the ability to acquire language.
However, we've also found that symbolic information (such as archetypes) is not encoded on the genome and that
babies cannot decode symbolism, refuting the idea of a biological basis to archetypes. Rather than being seen as
purely biological, more recent research suggests that archetypes emerge directly from our experiences and are
reflections of linguistic or cultural characteristics (Young-Eisendrath, 1995). Today, most Jungian scholars believe
that the collective unconscious and archetypes are based on both innate and environmental influences, with the
differences being in the role and degree of each (Sotirova-Kohli et al., 2013).

Karen Horney

Karen Horney was one of the first women trained as a Freudian psychoanalyst. During the Great Depression,
Horney moved from Germany to the United States, and subsequently moved away from Freud's teachings. Like
Jung, Horney believed that each individual has the potential for self-realization and that the goal of
psychoanalysis should be moving toward a healthy self rather than exploring early childhood patterns of

dysfunction. Horney also disagreed with the Freudian idea that girls have penis envy and are jealous of male
biological features. According to Horney, any jealousy is most likely culturally based, due to the greater
privileges that men often have, meaning that the differences between men's and women's personalities are
culturally based, not biologically based. She further suggested that men have womb envy, because they cannot
give birth.

Horney's theories focused on the role of unconscious anxiety. She suggested that normal growth can be
blocked by basic anxiety stemming from needs not being met, such as childhood experiences of loneliness
and/or isolation. How do children learn to handle this anxiety? Horney suggested three styles of coping (Table
11.4). The first coping style, moving toward people, relies on affiliation and dependence. These children
become dependent on their parents and other caregivers in an effort to receive attention and affection, which
provides relief from anxiety (Burger, 2008). When these children grow up, they tend to use this same coping
strategy to deal with relationships, expressing an intense need for love and acceptance (Burger, 2008). The
second coping style, moving against people, relies on aggression and assertiveness. Children with this coping
style find that fighting is the best way to deal with an unhappy home situation, and they deal with their feelings
of insecurity by bullying other children (Burger, 2008). As adults, people with this coping style tend to lash out
with hurtful comments and exploit others (Burger, 2008). The third coping style, moving away from people,
centers on detachment and isolation. These children handle their anxiety by withdrawing from the world. They
need privacy and tend to be self-sufficient. When these children are adults, they continue to avoid such things
as love and friendship, and they also tend to gravitate toward careers that require little interaction with others
(Burger, 2008).

Horney believed these three styles are ways in which people typically cope with day-to-day problems; however,
the three coping styles can become neurotic strategies if they are used rigidly and compulsively, leading a
person to become alienated from others.

11.4 Learning Approaches

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Describe the behaviorist perspective on personality
  · Describe the cognitive perspective on personality
  · Describe the social cognitive perspective on personality

In contrast to the psychodynamic approaches of Freud and the neo-Freudians, which relate personality to
inner (and hidden) processes, the learning approaches focus only on observable behavior. This illustrates one
significant advantage of the learning approaches over psychodynamics: Because learning approaches involve
observable, measurable phenomena, they can be scientifically tested.
374 11 · Personality

      The Behavioral Perspective

       Behaviorists do not believe in biological determinism: They do not see personality traits as inborn. Instead,
       they view personality as significantly shaped by the reinforcements and consequences outside of the
       organism. In other words, people behave in a consistent manner based on prior learning. B. F. Skinner, a strict
       behaviorist, believed that environment was solely responsible for all behavior, including the enduring,
       consistent behavior patterns studied by personality theorists.
       As you may recall from your study on the psychology of learning, Skinner proposed that we demonstrate
       consistent behavior patterns because we have developed certain response tendencies (Skinner, 1953). In other
       words, we learn to behave in particular ways. We increase the behaviors that lead to positive consequences,
       and we decrease the behaviors that lead to negative consequences. Skinner disagreed with Freud's idea that
       personality is fixed in childhood. He argued that personality develops over our entire life, not only in the first
       few years. Our responses can change as we come across new situations; therefore, we can expect more
       variability over time in personality than Freud would anticipate. For example, consider a young woman, Greta,
       a risk taker. She drives fast and participates in dangerous sports such as hang gliding and kiteboarding. But
       after she gets married and has children, the system of reinforcements and punishments in her environment
       changes. Speeding and extreme sports are no longer reinforced, so she no longer engages in those behaviors.
       In fact, Greta now describes herself as a cautious person.

      The Social-Cognitive Perspective

       Albert Bandura agreed with Skinner that personality develops through learning. He disagreed, however, with
       Skinner's strict behaviorist approach to personality development, because he felt that thinking and reasoning
       are important components of learning. He presented a social-cognitive theory of personality that emphasizes
       both learning and cognition as sources of individual differences in personality. In social-cognitive theory, the
       concepts of reciprocal determinism, observational learning, and self-efficacy all play a part in personality
       development.
       Reciprocal Determinism
       In contrast to Skinner's idea that the environment alone determines behavior, Bandura (1990) proposed the
       concept of reciprocal determinism, in which cognitive processes, behavior, and context all interact, each
       factor influencing and being influenced by the others simultaneously (Figure 11.10). Cognitive processes refer
       to all characteristics previously learned, including beliefs, expectations, and personality characteristics.
       Behavior refers to anything that we do that may be rewarded or punished. Finally, the context in which the
       behavior occurs refers to the environment or situation, which includes rewarding/punishing stimuli.

       FIGURE 11.10 Bandura proposed the idea of reciprocal determinism: Our behavior, cognitive processes, and
       situational context all influence each other.
       Consider, for example, that you're at a festival and one of the attractions is bungee jumping from a bridge. Do
       you do it? In this example, the behavior is bungee jumping. Cognitive factors that might influence this behavior

include your beliefs and values, and your past experiences with similar behaviors. Finally, context refers to the
reward structure for the behavior. According to reciprocal determinism, all of these factors are in play.

Observational Learning

Bandura's key contribution to learning theory was the idea that much learning is vicarious. We learn by
observing someone else's behavior and its consequences, which Bandura called observational learning. He felt
that this type of learning also plays a part in the development of our personality. Just as we learn individual
behaviors, we learn new behavior patterns when we see them performed by other people or models. Drawing
on the behaviorists' ideas about reinforcement, Bandura suggested that whether we choose to imitate a
model's behavior depends on whether we see the model reinforced or punished. Through observational
learning, we come to learn what behaviors are acceptable and rewarded in our culture, and we also learn to
inhibit deviant or socially unacceptable behaviors by seeing what behaviors are punished.

We can see the principles of reciprocal determinism at work in observational learning. For example, personal
factors determine which behaviors in the environment a person chooses to imitate, and those environmental
events in turn are processed cognitively according to other personal factors. One person may experience
receiving attention as reinforcing, and that person may be more inclined to imitate behaviors such as boasting
when a model has been reinforced. For others, boasting may be viewed negatively, despite the attention that
might result--or receiving heightened attention may be perceived as being scrutinized. In either case, the
person may be less likely to imitate those behaviors even though the reasons for not doing so would be
different.

Self-Efficacy

Bandura (1977, 1995) has studied a number of cognitive and personal factors that affect learning and
personality development, and most recently has focused on the concept of self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is our
level of confidence in our own abilities, developed through our social experiences. Self-efficacy affects how we
approach challenges and reach goals. In observational learning, self-efficacy is a cognitive factor that affects
which behaviors we choose to imitate as well as our success in performing those behaviors.

People who have high self-efficacy believe that their goals are within reach, have a positive view of challenges
seeing them as tasks to be mastered, develop a deep interest in and strong commitment to the activities in
which they are involved, and quickly recover from setbacks. Conversely, people with low self-efficacy avoid
challenging tasks because they doubt their ability to be successful, tend to focus on failure and negative
outcomes, and lose confidence in their abilities if they experience setbacks. Feelings of self-efficacy can be
specific to certain situations. For instance, a student might feel confident in her ability in English class but
much less so in math class.

Julian Rotter and Locus of Control

Julian Rotter (1966) proposed the concept of locus of control, another cognitive factor that affects learning and
personality development. Distinct from self-efficacy, which involves our belief in our own abilities, locus of
control refers to our beliefs about the power we have over our lives. In Rotter's view, people possess either an
internal or an external locus of control (Figure 11.11). Those of us with an internal locus of control ("internals")
tend to believe that most of our outcomes are the direct result of our efforts. Those of us with an external locus
of control ("externals") tend to believe that our outcomes are outside of our control. Externals see their lives as
being controlled by other people, luck, or chance. For example, say you didn't spend much time studying for
your psychology test and went out to dinner with friends instead. When you receive your test score, you see
that you earned a D. If you possess an internal locus of control, you would most likely admit that you failed
because you didn't spend enough time studying and decide to study more for the next test. On the other hand,
if you possess an external locus of control, you might conclude that the test was too hard and not bother
studying for the next test, because you figure you will fail it anyway. Researchers have found that people with
an internal locus of control perform better academically, achieve more in their careers, are more independent,
376 11 · Personality

       are healthier, are better able to cope, and are less depressed than people who have an external locus of control
       (Benassi, Sweeney, & Durfour, 1988; Lefcourt, 1982; Maltby, Day, & Macaskill, 2007; Whyte, 1977, 1978, 1980).

      Walter Mischel and the Person-Situation Debate

       Walter Mischel was a student of Julian Rotter and taught for years at Stanford, where he was a colleague of
       Albert Bandura. Mischel surveyed several decades of empirical psychological literature regarding trait
       prediction of behavior, and his conclusion shook the foundations of personality psychology. Mischel found that
       the data did not support the central principle of the field--that a person's personality traits are consistent
       across situations. His report triggered a decades-long period of self-examination, known as the person-
       situation debate, among personality psychologists.
       Mischel suggested that perhaps we were looking for consistency in the wrong places. He found that although
       behavior was inconsistent across different situations, it was much more consistent within situations--so that a
       person's behavior in one situation would likely be repeated in a similar one. And as you will see next regarding
       his famous "marshmallow test," Mischel also found that behavior is consistent in equivalent situations across
       time.
       One of Mischel's most notable contributions to personality psychology was his ideas on self-regulation.
       According to Lecci & Magnavita (2013), "Self-regulation is the process of identifying a goal or set of goals and,
       in pursuing these goals, using both internal (e.g., thoughts and affect) and external (e.g., responses of anything
       or anyone in the environment) feedback to maximize goal attainment" (p. 6.3). Self-regulation is also known as
       will power. When we talk about will power, we tend to think of it as the ability to delay gratification. For
       example, Bettina's teenage son made strawberry cupcakes, and they looked delicious. However, Bettina
       forfeited the pleasure of eating one, because she is training for a 5K race and wants to be fit and do well in the
       race. Would you be able to resist getting a small reward now in order to get a larger reward later? This is the
       question Mischel investigated in his now-classic marshmallow test.
       Mischel designed a study to assess self-regulation in young children. In the marshmallow study, Mischel and
       his colleagues placed a preschool child in a room with one marshmallow on the table. The children were told
       they could either eat the marshmallow now, or wait until the researcher returned to the room, and then they
       could have two marshmallows (Mischel, Ebbesen & Raskoff, 1972). This was repeated with hundreds of
       preschoolers. What Mischel and his team found was that young children differ in their degree of self-control.
       Mischel and his colleagues continued to follow this group of preschoolers through high school, and what do
       you think they discovered? The children who had more self-control in preschool (the ones who waited for the
       bigger reward) were more successful in high school. They had higher SAT scores, had positive peer
       relationships, and were less likely to have substance abuse issues; as adults, they also had more stable
       marriages (Mischel, Shoda, & Rodriguez, 1989; Mischel et al., 2010). On the other hand, those children who had
       poor self-control in preschool (the ones who grabbed the one marshmallow) were not as successful in high
       school, and they were found to have academic and behavioral problems. A more recent study using a larger
       and more representative sample found associations between early delay of gratification (Watts, Duncan, &

Quan, 2018) and measures of achievement in adolescence. However, researchers also found that the
associations were not as strong as those reported during Mischel's initial experiment and were quite sensitive
to situational factors such as early measures of cognitive capacity, family background, and home environment.
This research suggests that consideration of situational factors is important to better understand behavior.

Watch Joachim de Posada's TEDTalk about the marshmallow test (http://openstax.org/l/TEDPosada) to learn
more and to see the test given to children in Colombia.

Today, the debate is mostly resolved, and most psychologists consider both the situation and personal factors
in understanding behavior. For Mischel (1993), people are situation processors. The children in the
marshmallow test each processed, or interpreted, the rewards structure of that situation in their own way.
Mischel's approach to personality stresses the importance of both the situation and the way the person
perceives the situation. Instead of behavior being determined by the situation, people use cognitive processes
to interpret the situation and then behave in accordance with that interpretation.

11.5 Humanistic Approaches

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Discuss the contributions of Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers to personality development

As the "third force" in psychology, humanism is touted as a reaction both to the pessimistic determinism of
psychoanalysis, with its emphasis on psychological disturbance, and to the behaviorists' view of humans
passively reacting to the environment, which has been criticized as making people out to be personality-less
robots. It does not suggest that psychoanalytic, behaviorist, and other points of view are incorrect but argues
that these perspectives do not recognize the depth and meaning of human experience, and fail to recognize the
innate capacity for self-directed change and transforming personal experiences. This perspective focuses on
how healthy people develop. One pioneering humanist, Abraham Maslow, studied people who he considered to
be healthy, creative, and productive, including Albert Einstein, Eleanor Roosevelt, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham
Lincoln, and others. Maslow (1950, 1970) found that such people share similar characteristics, such as being
open, creative, loving, spontaneous, compassionate, concerned for others, and accepting of themselves. When
you studied motivation, you learned about one of the best-known humanistic theories, Maslow's hierarchy of
needs theory, in which Maslow proposes that human beings have certain needs in common and that these
needs must be met in a certain order. The highest need is the need for self-actualization, which is the
achievement of our fullest potential. Maslow differentiated between needs that motivate us to fulfill something
that is missing and needs that inspire us to grow. He believed that many emotional and behavioral concerns
arise as a result of failing to meet these hierarchical needs.

Another humanistic theorist was Carl Rogers. One of Rogers's main ideas about personality regards self-
concept, our thoughts and feelings about ourselves. How would you respond to the question, "Who am I?" Your
answer can show how you see yourself. If your response is primarily positive, then you tend to feel good about
who you are, and you see the world as a safe and positive place. If your response is mainly negative, then you
may feel unhappy with who you are. Rogers further divided the self into two categories: the ideal self and the
real self. The ideal self is the person that you would like to be; the real self is the person you actually are.
Rogers focused on the idea that we need to achieve consistency between these two selves. We experience
congruence when our thoughts about our real self and ideal self are very similar--in other words, when our
self-concept is accurate. High congruence leads to a greater sense of self-worth and a healthy, productive life.
Parents can help their children achieve this by giving them unconditional positive regard, or unconditional
love. According to Rogers (1980), "As persons are accepted and prized, they tend to develop a more caring
attitude towards themselves" (p. 116). Conversely, when there is a great discrepancy between our ideal and
378 11 · Personality

       actual selves, we experience a state Rogers called incongruence, which can lead to maladjustment. Both
       Rogers's and Maslow's theories focus on individual choices and do not believe that biology is deterministic.

     11.6 Biological Approaches

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Discuss the findings of the Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart as they relate to personality and genetics
         · Discuss temperament and describe the three infant temperaments identified by Thomas and Chess
         · Discuss the evolutionary perspective on personality development

       How much of our personality is in-born and biological, and how much is influenced by the environment and
       culture we are raised in? Psychologists who favor the biological approach believe that inherited
       predispositions as well as physiological processes can be used to explain differences in our personalities
       (Burger, 2008).

       Evolutionary psychology relative to personality development looks at personality traits that are universal, as
       well as differences across individuals. In this view, adaptive differences have evolved and then provide a
       survival and reproductive advantage. Individual differences are important from an evolutionary viewpoint for
       several reasons. Certain individual differences, and the heritability of these characteristics, have been well
       documented. David Buss has identified several theories to explore this relationship between personality traits
       and evolution, such as life-history theory, which looks at how people expend their time and energy (such as on
       bodily growth and maintenance, reproduction, or parenting). Another example is costly signaling theory,
       which examines the honesty and deception in the signals people send one another about their quality as a
       mate or friend (Buss, 2009).

       In the field of behavioral genetics, the Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart--a well-known study of the
       genetic basis for personality--conducted research with twins from 1979 to 1999. In studying 350 pairs of
       twins, including pairs of identical and fraternal twins reared together and apart, researchers found that
       identical twins, whether raised together or apart, have very similar personalities (Bouchard, 1994; Bouchard,
       Lykken, McGue, Segal, & Tellegen, 1990; Segal, 2012). These findings suggest the heritability of some
       personality traits. Heritability refers to the proportion of difference among people that is attributed to
       genetics. Some of the traits that the study reported as having more than a 0.50 heritability ratio include
       leadership, obedience to authority, a sense of well-being, alienation, resistance to stress, and fearfulness. The
       implication is that some aspects of our personalities are largely controlled by genetics; however, it's important
       to point out that traits are not determined by a single gene, but by a combination of many genes, as well as by
       epigenetic factors that control whether the genes are expressed.

       Other research that has examined the link between personality and other factors has identified and studied
       Type A and Type B personalities, which you will learn more about in the chapter on Stress, Health, and
       Lifestyle.

      Temperament

       Most contemporary psychologists believe temperament has a biological basis due to its appearance very early
       in our lives (Rothbart, 2011). As you learned when you studied lifespan development, Thomas and Chess
       (1977) found that babies could be categorized into one of three temperaments: easy, difficult, or slow to warm
       up. However, environmental factors (family interactions, for example) and maturation can affect the ways in

Research suggests that there are two dimensions of our temperament that are important parts of our adult
personality--reactivity and self-regulation (Rothbart, Ahadi, & Evans, 2000). Reactivity refers to how we
respond to new or challenging environmental stimuli; self-regulation refers to our ability to control that
response (Rothbart & Derryberry, 1981; Rothbart, Sheese, Rueda, & Posner, 2011). For example, one person
may immediately respond to new stimuli with a high level of anxiety, while another barely notices it.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Discuss early trait theories of Cattell and Eysenck
  · Discuss the Big Five factors and describe someone who is high and low on each of the five factors

Trait theorists believe personality can be understood via the approach that all people have certain traits, or
characteristic ways of behaving. Do you tend to be sociable or shy? Passive or aggressive? Optimistic or
pessimistic? Moody or even-tempered? Early trait theorists tried to describe all human personality traits. For
example, one trait theorist, Gordon Allport (Allport & Odbert, 1936), found 4,500 words in the English language
that could describe people. He organized these personality traits into three categories: cardinal traits, central
traits, and secondary traits. A cardinal trait is one that dominates your entire personality, and hence your
life--such as Ebenezer Scrooge's greed and Mother Theresa's altruism. Cardinal traits are not very common:
Few people have personalities dominated by a single trait. Instead, our personalities typically are composed of
multiple traits. Central traits are those that make up our personalities (such as loyal, kind, agreeable, friendly,
sneaky, wild, and grouchy). Secondary traits are those that are not quite as obvious or as consistent as central
traits. They are present under specific circumstances and include preferences and attitudes. For example, one
person gets angry when people try to tickle him; another can only sleep on the left side of the bed; and yet
another always orders her salad dressing on the side. And you--although not normally an anxious person--feel
nervous before making a speech in front of your English class.

In an effort to make the list of traits more manageable, Raymond Cattell (1946, 1957) narrowed down the list to
about 171 traits. However, saying that a trait is either present or absent does not accurately reflect a person's
uniqueness, because all of our personalities are actually made up of the same traits; we differ only in the
degree to which each trait is expressed. Cattell (1957) identified 16 factors or dimensions of personality:
warmth, reasoning, emotional stability, dominance, liveliness, rule-consciousness, social boldness, sensitivity,
vigilance, abstractedness, privateness, apprehension, openness to change, self-reliance, perfectionism, and
tension (Table 11.5). He developed a personality assessment based on these 16 factors, called the 16PF.
Instead of a trait being present or absent, each dimension is scored over a continuum, from high to low. For
example, your level of warmth describes how warm, caring, and nice to others you are. If you score low on this
index, you tend to be more distant and cold. A high score on this index signifies you are supportive and
comforting.

Psychologists Hans and Sybil Eysenck were personality theorists (Figure 11.12) who focused on temperament,
the inborn, genetically based personality differences that you studied earlier in the chapter. They believed
personality is largely governed by biology. The Eysencks (Eysenck, 1990, 1992; Eysenck & Eysenck, 1963)
viewed people as having two specific personality dimensions: extroversion/introversion and neuroticism/
stability.

According to their theory, people high on the trait of extroversion are sociable and outgoing, and readily
connect with others, whereas people high on the trait of introversion have a higher need to be alone, engage in
solitary behaviors, and limit their interactions with others. In the neuroticism/stability dimension, people high
on neuroticism tend to be anxious; they tend to have an overactive sympathetic nervous system and, even with
low stress, their bodies and emotional state tend to go into a flight-or-fight reaction. In contrast, people high on
stability tend to need more stimulation to activate their flight-or-fight reaction and are considered more
emotionally stable. Based on these two dimensions, the Eysencks' theory divides people into four quadrants.
These quadrants are sometimes compared with the four temperaments described by the Greeks: melancholic,
choleric, phlegmatic, and sanguine (Figure 11.13).
382 11 · Personality

       FIGURE 11.13 The Eysencks described two factors to account for variations in our personalities: extroversion/
       introversion and emotional stability/instability.
       Later, the Eysencks added a third dimension: psychoticism versus superego control (Eysenck, Eysenck &
       Barrett, 1985). In this dimension, people who are high on psychoticism tend to be independent thinkers, cold,
       nonconformists, impulsive, antisocial, and hostile, whereas people who are high on superego control tend to
       have high impulse control--they are more altruistic, empathetic, cooperative, and conventional (Eysenck,
       Eysenck & Barrett, 1985).
       While Cattell's 16 factors may be too broad, the Eysenck's two-factor system has been criticized for being too
       narrow. Another personality theory, called the Five Factor Model, effectively hits a middle ground, with its five
       factors referred to as the Big Five personality factors. It is the most popular theory in personality psychology
       today and the most accurate approximation of the basic personality dimensions (Funder, 2001). The five
       factors are openness to experience, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism (Figure
       11.14). A helpful way to remember the factors is by using the mnemonic OCEAN.
       In the Five Factor Model, each person has each factor, but they occur along a spectrum. Openness to
       experience is characterized by imagination, feelings, actions, and ideas. People who score high on this factor
       tend to be curious and have a wide range of interests. Conscientiousness is characterized by competence, self-
       discipline, thoughtfulness, and achievement-striving (goal-directed behavior). People who score high on this
       factor are hardworking and dependable. Numerous studies have found a positive correlation between
       conscientiousness and academic success (Akomolafe, 2013; Chamorro-Premuzic & Furnham, 2008; Conrad &
       Patry, 2012; Noftle & Robins, 2007; Wagerman & Funder, 2007). Extroversion is characterized by sociability,
       assertiveness, excitement-seeking, and emotional expression. People who score high on this factor are usually
       described as outgoing and warm. Not surprisingly, people who score high on both extroversion and openness
       are more likely to participate in adventure and risky sports due to their curious and excitement-seeking nature
       (Tok, 2011). The fourth factor is agreeableness, which is the tendency to be pleasant, cooperative, trustworthy,
       and good-natured. People who score low on agreeableness tend to be described as rude and uncooperative, yet
       one recent study reported that men who scored low on this factor actually earned more money than men who
       were considered more agreeable (Judge, Livingston, & Hurst, 2012). The last of the Big Five factors is

neuroticism, which is the tendency to experience negative emotions. People high on neuroticism tend to
experience emotional instability and are characterized as angry, impulsive, and hostile. Watson and Clark
(1984) found that people reporting high levels of neuroticism also tend to report feeling anxious and unhappy.
In contrast, people who score low in neuroticism tend to be calm and even-tempered.

FIGURE 11.14 In the Five Factor Model, each person has five factors, each scored on a continuum from high to low.
In the center column, notice that the first letter of each factor spells the mnemonic OCEAN.
The Big Five personality factors each represent a range between two extremes. In reality, most of us tend to lie
somewhere midway along the continuum of each factor, rather than at polar ends. It's important to note that
the Big Five factors are relatively stable over our lifespan, with some tendency for the factors to increase or
decrease slightly. Researchers have found that conscientiousness increases through young adulthood into
middle age, as we become better able to manage our personal relationships and careers (Donnellan & Lucas,
2008). Agreeableness also increases with age, peaking between 50 to 70 years (Terracciano, McCrae, Brant, &
Costa, 2005). Neuroticism and extroversion tend to decline slightly with age (Donnellan & Lucas; Terracciano
et al.). Additionally, The Big Five factors have been shown to exist across ethnicities, cultures, and ages, and
may have substantial biological and genetic components (Jang, Livesley, & Vernon, 1996; Jang et al., 2006;
McCrae & Costa, 1997; Schmitt et al., 2007).
Another model of personality traits is the HEXACO model. HEXACO is an acronym for six broad traits: honesty-
humility, emotionality, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience (Anglim &
O'Connor, 2018). Table 11.6 provides a brief overview of each trait.

11.8 Cultural Understandings of Personality

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section you should be able to:

  · Discuss personality differences of people from collectivist and individualist cultures
  · Discuss the three approaches to studying personality in a cultural context

As you have learned in this chapter, personality is shaped by both genetic and environmental factors. The
culture in which you live is one of the most important environmental factors that shapes your personality
(Triandis & Suh, 2002). The term culture refers to all of the beliefs, customs, art, and traditions of a particular
society. Culture is transmitted to people through language as well as through the modeling of culturally
acceptable and nonacceptable behaviors that are either rewarded or punished (Triandis & Suh, 2002). With
these ideas in mind, personality psychologists have become interested in the role of culture in understanding
personality. They ask whether personality traits are the same across cultures or if there are variations. It
appears that there are both universal and culture-specific aspects that account for variation in people's
personalities.

Why might it be important to consider cultural influences on personality? Western ideas about personality
may not be applicable to other cultures (Benet-Martinez & Oishi, 2008). In fact, there is evidence that the
strength of personality traits varies across cultures. Let's take a look at some of the Big Five factors
(conscientiousness, neuroticism, openness, and extroversion) across cultures. As you will learn when you
study social psychology, Asian cultures are more collectivist, and people in these cultures tend to be less
extroverted. People in Central and South American cultures tend to score higher on openness to experience,
whereas Europeans score higher on neuroticism (Benet-Martinez & Karakitapoglu-Aygun, 2003).

According to a study by Rentfrow and colleagues, there also seem to be regional personality differences within
the United States (Figure 11.15). Researchers analyzed responses from over 1.5 million individuals in the
United States and found that there are three distinct regional personality clusters: Cluster 1, which is in the
Upper Midwest and Deep South, is dominated by people who fall into the "friendly and conventional"
personality; Cluster 2, which includes the West, is dominated by people who are more relaxed, emotionally

                                                                                                                            11.8 · Cultural Understandings of Personality 385

stable, calm, and creative; and Cluster 3, which includes the Northeast, has more people who are stressed,
irritable, and depressed. People who live in Clusters 2 and 3 are also generally more open (Rentfrow et al.,
2013).

FIGURE 11.15 Researchers found three distinct regional personality clusters in the United States. People tend to be
friendly and conventional in the Upper Midwest and Deep South; relaxed, emotionally stable, and creative in the
West; and stressed, irritable, and depressed in the Northeast (Rentfrow et al., 2013).
One explanation for the regional differences is selective migration (Rentfrow et al., 2013). Selective migration
is the concept that people choose to move to places that are compatible with their personalities and needs. For
example, a person high on the agreeable scale would likely want to live near family and friends, and would
choose to settle or remain in such an area. In contrast, someone high on openness would prefer to settle in a
place that is recognized as diverse and innovative (such as California). Further, Rentfrow, Jost, Gosling, & Potter
(2009) noted an overlap between geographical regions and personality characteristics that goes beyond the
often-used explanations of religion, racial diversity, and education. Their research suggests that the
psychological profile of a region is closely related to that of its residents. They found that levels of openness
and conscientiousness in a state may predict voting patterns, indicating that there are correlations between
geographic regions and personality differences between liberals and conservatives relating to political views,
levels of economic vitality, and entrepreneurial rates.

Personality in Individualist and Collectivist Cultures

Individualist cultures and collectivist cultures place emphasis on different basic values. People who live in
individualist cultures tend to believe that independence, competition, and personal achievement are
important. Individuals in Western nations such as the United States, England, and Australia score high on
386 11 · Personality

       individualism (Oyserman, Coon, & Kemmelmier, 2002). People who live in collectivist cultures value social
       harmony, respectfulness, and group needs over individual needs. Individuals who live in countries in Asia,
       Africa, and South America score high on collectivism (Hofstede, 2001; Triandis, 1995). These values influence
       personality. For example, Yang (2006) found that people in individualist cultures displayed more personally
       oriented personality traits, whereas people in collectivist cultures displayed more socially oriented personality
       traits. Frewer and Bleus (1991) conducted a study of the Eysenk Personality Inventory in a collectivist culture
       using Papua New Guinean university students. They found that the results of the personality inventory were
       only relevant when analyzed within the context of a collectivist society. Similarly, Dana (1986) suggested that
       personality assessment services for Native Americans are often provided without a proper recognition of
       culture-specific responses and a tribe-specific frame of reference. Assessors need to have more than a general
       knowledge of history, tribal differences, contemporary culture on reservations, and levels of acculturation in
       order to interpret psychological test responses with a minimal bias.

      Approaches to Studying Personality in a Cultural Context

       There are three approaches that can be used to study personality in a cultural context, the cultural-
       comparative approach; the indigenous approach; and the combined approach, which incorporates elements of
       both views. Since ideas about personality have a Western basis, the cultural-comparative approach seeks to
       test Western ideas about personality in other cultures to determine whether they can be generalized and if
       they have cultural validity (Cheung van de Vijver, & Leong, 2011). For example, recall from the previous section
       on the trait perspective that researchers used the cultural-comparative approach to test the universality of
       McCrae and Costa's Five Factor Model. They found applicability in numerous cultures around the world, with
       the Big Five factors being stable in many cultures (McCrae & Costa, 1997; McCrae et al., 2005). The indigenous
       approach came about in reaction to the dominance of Western approaches to the study of personality in non-
       Western settings (Cheung et al., 2011). Because Western-based personality assessments cannot fully capture
       the personality constructs of other cultures, the indigenous model has led to the development of personality
       assessment instruments that are based on constructs relevant to the culture being studied (Cheung et al.,
       2011). The third approach to cross-cultural studies of personality is the combined approach, which serves as a
       bridge between Western and indigenous psychology as a way of understanding both universal and cultural
       variations in personality (Cheung et al., 2011).

     11.9 Personality Assessment

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Discuss the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory
         · Recognize and describe common projective tests used in personality assessment

       Roberto, Mikhail, and Nat are college friends and all want to be police officers. Roberto is quiet and shy, lacks
       self-confidence, and usually follows others. He is a kind person, but lacks motivation. Mikhail is loud and
       boisterous, a leader. He works hard, but is impulsive and drinks too much on the weekends. Nat is thoughtful
       and well liked. They are trustworthy, but are very methodical and therefore have difficulty making quick
       decisions. Of these three, who would make the best police officer? What qualities and personality factors make
       someone a good police officer? What makes someone a bad or dangerous police officer?

       A police officer's job is very high in stress, and law enforcement agencies want to make sure they hire the right
       people. Personality testing is often used for this purpose--to screen applicants for employment and job
       training. Personality tests are also used in criminal cases and custody battles, and to assess psychological
       disorders. This section explores the best known among the many different types of personality tests.

      Self-Report Inventories

       Self-report inventories are a kind of objective test used to assess personality. They typically use multiple-
       choice items or numbered scales, which represent a range from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                                                 11.9 · Personality Assessment 387

They often are called Likert scales after their developer, Rensis Likert (1932) (Figure 11.16). Self-report
inventories are generally easy to administer and cost effective. There is also an increased likelihood of test
takers being inclined to answer in ways that are intentionally or unintentionally more socially desirable,
exaggerated, biased, or misleading. For example, someone applying for a job will likely try to present
themselves in a positive light, perhaps as an even better candidate than they actually are.

FIGURE 11.16 If you've ever taken a survey, you are probably familiar with Likert-type scale questions. Most
personality inventories employ these types of response scales.
One of the most widely used personality inventories is the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory
(MMPI), first published in 1943, with 504 true/false questions, and updated to the MMPI-2 in 1989, with 567
questions. The original MMPI was based on a small, limited sample, composed mostly of Minnesota farmers
and psychiatric patients; the revised inventory was based on a more representative, national sample to allow
for better standardization. The MMPI-2 takes 1-2 hours to complete. Responses are scored to produce a
clinical profile composed of 10 scales: hypochondriasis, depression, hysteria, psychopathic deviance (social
deviance), masculinity versus femininity, paranoia, psychasthenia (obsessive/compulsive qualities),
schizophrenia, hypomania, and social introversion. There is also a scale to ascertain risk factors for alcohol
abuse. In 2008, the test was again revised, using more advanced methods, to the MMPI-2-RF. This version
takes about one-half the time to complete and has only 338 questions (Figure 11.17). Despite the new test's
advantages, the MMPI-2 is more established and is still more widely used. Typically, the tests are administered
by computer. Although the MMPI was originally developed to assist in the clinical diagnosis of psychological
disorders, it is now also used for occupational screening, such as in law enforcement, and in college, career,
and marital counseling (Ben-Porath & Tellegen, 2008).

        FIGURE 11.17 These true/false questions resemble the kinds of questions you would find on the MMPI.
388 11 · Personality

       In addition to clinical scales, the tests also have validity and reliability scales. (Recall the concepts of reliability
       and validity from your study of psychological research.) One of the validity scales, the Lie Scale (or "L" Scale),
       consists of 15 items and is used to ascertain whether the respondent is "faking good" (underreporting
       psychological problems to appear healthier). For example, if someone responds "yes" to a number of
       unrealistically positive items such as "I have never told a lie," they may be trying to "fake good" or appear
       better than they actually are.

       Reliability scales test an instrument's consistency over time, assuring that if you take the MMPI-2-RF today and
       then again 5 years later, your two scores will be similar. Beutler, Nussbaum, and Meredith (1988) gave the
       MMPI to newly recruited police officers and then to the same police officers 2 years later. After 2 years on the
       job, police officers' responses indicated an increased vulnerability to alcoholism, somatic symptoms (vague,
       unexplained physical complaints), and anxiety. When the test was given an additional 2 years later (4 years
       after starting on the job), the results suggested high risk for alcohol-related difficulties.

      Projective Tests

       Another method for assessment of personality is projective testing. This kind of test relies on one of the
       defense mechanisms proposed by Freud--projection--as a way to assess unconscious processes. During this
       type of testing, a series of ambiguous cards is shown to the person being tested, who then is encouraged to
       project their feelings, impulses, and desires onto the cards--by telling a story, interpreting an image, or
       completing a sentence. Many projective tests have undergone standardization procedures (for example, Exner,
       2002) and can be used to access whether someone has unusual thoughts or a high level of anxiety, or is likely
       to become volatile. Some examples of projective tests are the Rorschach Inkblot Test, the Thematic
       Apperception Test (TAT), the Contemporized-Themes Concerning Blacks test, the TEMAS (Tell-Me-A-Story),
       and the Rotter Incomplete Sentence Blank (RISB). Projective tests are less subject to intentional distortion; it is
       hard to fake "good" because it is not obvious what a "good" answer is. Projective tests are more time
       consuming for the evaluator than self-report inventories. If an evaluator scores the Rorschach using the Exner
       scoring system, the test is considered a valid and reliable measure. However, the validity of the other projective
       tests is questionable, and the results are often not usable for court cases (Goldstein, n.d.).

       The Rorschach Inkblot Test was developed in 1921 by a Swiss psychologist named Hermann Rorschach
       (pronounced "ROAR-shock"). It is a series of symmetrical inkblot cards that are presented to a client by a
       psychologist. Upon presentation of each card, the psychologist asks the client, "What might this be?" What the
       test-taker sees reveals unconscious feelings and struggles (Piotrowski, 1987; Weiner, 2003). The Rorschach
       has been standardized using the Exner system and is effective in measuring depression, psychosis, and
       anxiety.

       A second projective test is the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT), created in the 1930s by Henry Murray, an
       American psychologist, and a psychoanalyst named Christiana Morgan. A person taking the TAT is shown
       8-12 ambiguous pictures and is asked to tell a story about each picture (Figure 11.18). The stories give insight
       into their social world, revealing hopes, fears, interests, and goals. The storytelling format helps to lower a
       person's resistance divulging unconscious personal details (Cramer, 2004). The TAT has been used in clinical
       settings to evaluate psychological disorders; more recently, it has been used in counseling settings to help
       clients gain a better understanding of themselves and achieve personal growth. Standardization of test
       administration is virtually nonexistent among clinicians, and the test tends to be modest to low on validity and
       reliability (Aronow, Weiss, & Rezinkoff, 2001; Lilienfeld, Wood, & Garb, 2000). Despite these shortcomings, the
       TAT has been one of the most widely used projective tests.

A third projective test is the Rotter Incomplete Sentence Blank (RISB) developed by Julian Rotter in 1950
(recall his theory of locus of control, covered earlier in this chapter). There are three forms of this test for use
with different age groups: the school form, the college form, and the adult form. The tests include 40
incomplete sentences that people are asked to complete as quickly as possible (Figure 11.19). The average
time for completing the test is approximately 20 minutes, as responses are only 1-2 words in length. This test
is similar to a word association test, and like other types of projective tests, it is presumed that responses will
reveal desires, fears, and struggles. The RISB is used in screening college students for adjustment problems
and in career counseling (Holaday, Smith, & Sherry, 2010; Rotter & Rafferty 1950).

FIGURE 11.19 These incomplete sentences resemble the types of questions on the RISB. How would you complete
these sentences?
For many decades, these traditional projective tests have been used in cross-cultural personality assessments.
However, it was found that test bias limited their usefulness (Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-Moore, 2008). It is
difficult to assess the personalities and lifestyles of members of widely divergent ethnic/cultural groups using
personality instruments based on data from a single culture or race (Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-Moore, 2008). For
example, when the TAT was used with African-American test takers, the result was often shorter story length
and low levels of cultural identification (Duzant, 2005). Therefore, it was vital to develop other personality
assessments that explored factors such as race, language, and level of acculturation (Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-
Moore, 2008). To address this need, Robert Williams developed the first culturally specific projective test
designed to reflect the everyday life experiences of African Americans (Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-Moore, 2008).
The updated version of the instrument is the Contemporized-Themes Concerning Blacks Test (C-TCB)
(Williams, 1972). The C-TCB contains 20 color images that show scenes of African-American lifestyles. When
the C-TCB was compared with the TAT for African Americans, it was found that use of the C-TCB led to
increased story length, higher degrees of positive feelings, and stronger identification with the C-TCB (Hoy,
1997; Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-Moore, 2008).

Summary

11.1 What Is Personality?

Personality has been studied for over 2,000 years, beginning with Hippocrates. More recent theories of
personality have been proposed, including Freud's psychodynamic perspective, which holds that personality is
formed through early childhood experiences. Other perspectives then emerged in reaction to the
psychodynamic perspective, including the learning, humanistic, biological, trait, and cultural perspectives.

11.2 Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective

Sigmund Freud presented the first comprehensive theory of personality. He was also the first to recognize that
much of our mental life takes place outside of our conscious awareness. Freud also proposed three
components to our personality: the id, ego, and superego. The job of the ego is to balance the sexual and
aggressive drives of the id with the moral ideal of the superego. Freud also said that personality develops
through a series of psychosexual stages. In each stage, pleasure focuses on a specific erogenous zone. Failure
to resolve a stage can lead one to become fixated in that stage, leading to unhealthy personality traits.
Successful resolution of the stages leads to a healthy adult.

11.3 Neo-Freudians: Adler, Erikson, Jung, and Horney

The neo-Freudians were psychologists whose work followed from Freud's. They generally agreed with Freud
that childhood experiences matter, but they decreased the emphasis on sex and focused more on the social

                                                                                                                                                               11 · Summary 393

environment and effects of culture on personality. Some of the notable neo-Freudians are Alfred Adler, Carl
Jung, Erik Erikson, and Karen Horney. The neo-Freudian approaches have been criticized, because they tend
to be philosophical rather than based on sound scientific research. For example, Jung's conclusions about the
existence of the collective unconscious are based on myths, legends, dreams, and art. In addition, as with
Freud's psychoanalytic theory, the neo-Freudians based much of their theories of personality on information
from their patients.

11.4 Learning Approaches

Behavioral theorists view personality as significantly shaped and impacted by the reinforcements and
consequences outside of the organism. People behave in a consistent manner based on prior learning. B. F.
Skinner, a prominent behaviorist, said that we demonstrate consistent behavior patterns, because we have
developed certain response tendencies. Mischel focused on how personal goals play a role in the self-
regulation process. Albert Bandura said that one's environment can determine behavior, but at the same time,
people can influence the environment with both their thoughts and behaviors, which is known as reciprocal
determinism. Bandura also emphasized how we learn from watching others. He felt that this type of learning
also plays a part in the development of our personality. Bandura discussed the concept of self-efficacy, which is
our level of confidence in our own abilities. Finally, Rotter proposed the concept of locus of control, which
refers to our beliefs about the power we have over our lives. He said that people fall along a continuum between
a purely internal and a purely external locus of control.

11.5 Humanistic Approaches

Humanistic psychologists Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers focused on the growth potential of healthy
individuals. They believed that people strive to become self-actualized. Both Rogers's and Maslow's theories
greatly contributed to our understanding of the self. They emphasized free will and self-determination, with
each individual desiring to become the best person they can become.

11.6 Biological Approaches

Some aspects of our personalities are largely controlled by genetics; however, environmental factors (such as
family interactions) and maturation can affect the ways in which children's personalities are expressed.

11.7 Trait Theorists

Trait theorists attempt to explain our personality by identifying our stable characteristics and ways of
behaving. They have identified important dimensions of personality. The Five Factor Model is the most widely
accepted theory today. The five factors are openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and
neuroticism. These factors occur along a continuum.

11.8 Cultural Understandings of Personality

The culture in which you live is one of the most important environmental factors that shapes your personality.
Western ideas about personality may not be applicable to other cultures. In fact, there is evidence that the
strength of personality traits varies across cultures. Individualist cultures and collectivist cultures place
emphasis on different basic values. People who live in individualist cultures tend to believe that independence,
competition, and personal achievement are important. People who live in collectivist cultures value social
harmony, respectfulness, and group needs over individual needs. There are three approaches that can be used
to study personality in a cultural context: the cultural-comparative approach, the indigenous approach, and
the combined approach, which incorporates both elements of both views.

11.9 Personality Assessment

Personality tests are techniques designed to measure one's personality. They are used to diagnose
psychological problems as well as to screen candidates for college and employment. There are two types of
personality tests: self-report inventories and projective tests. The MMPI is one of the most common self-report
394 11 · Review Questions

inventories. It asks a series of true/false questions that are designed to provide a clinical profile of an
individual. Projective tests use ambiguous images or other ambiguous stimuli to assess an individual's
unconscious fears, desires, and challenges. The Rorschach Inkblot Test, the TAT, the RISB, and the C-TCB are
all forms of projective tests.

INTRODUCTION On the night of February 26, 2012, Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old African American high
school student, was shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer, George Zimmerman, in a predominantly White
neighborhood. Zimmerman observed the boy dressed in a hoodie and pursued Martin. Zimmerman called the
police to report a person acting suspiciously, which he had done on other occasions. According to the 911 call
transcript, Zimmerman said on the call, "[expletive] punks. These [expletive], they always get away." The 911
operator told Zimmerman not to follow the teen, as was also stated in the police neighborhood watch
guidelines that had been provided to Zimmerman. A physical altercation ended with Zimmerman fatally
shooting Martin. Zimmerman claimed that he acted in self-defense. Martin was unarmed, and after his death,
there was a nationwide outcry. A Florida jury found Zimmerman not guilty of second degree murder nor of
manslaughter.

There have also been tragic situations with deadly consequences in which police officers have shot innocent
civilians. In 2019, Atatiana Jefferson's neighbor used a non-emergency line to call the police because
Jefferson's front door was open in the late hours of the night. The police arrived and an officer went to the back
of the yard. Jefferson, not knowing that the police had been called, reached into her purse and got out her
legally owned gun. The officer perceived a threat and fired upon Jefferson, killing her. Her 8-year-old nephew

       witnessed the incident, as he was playing video games with his aunt. Why did each of these nights end so
       tragically for those involved? What dynamics contributed to the outcomes? How can these deaths be
       prevented?
       Social psychologists examine how the presence of others impacts how a person behaves and reacts, whether
       that person is an athlete playing a game, a police officer on the job, or a worshiper attending a religious service.
       Social psychologists believe that a person's behavior is influenced by who else is present in a given situation
       and the composition of social groups.

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Define social psychology
         · Describe situational versus dispositional influences on behavior
         · Describe the fundamental attribution error
         · Explain actor-observer bias
         · Describe self-serving bias
         · Explain the just-world hypothesis
       Social psychology examines how people affect one another, and it looks at the power of the situation.
       According to the American Psychological Association (n.d.), social psychologists "are interested in all aspects
       of personality and social interaction, exploring the influence of interpersonal and group relationships on
       human behavior." Throughout this chapter, we will examine how the presence of other individuals and groups
       of people impacts a person's behaviors, thoughts, and feelings. Essentially, people will change their behavior to
       align with the social situation at hand. If we are in a new situation or are unsure how to behave, we will take our
       cues from other individuals.
       The field of social psychology studies topics at both the intra- and interpersonal levels. Intrapersonal topics
       (those that pertain to the individual) include emotions and attitudes, the self, and social cognition (the ways in
       which we think about ourselves and others). Interpersonal topics (those that pertain to dyads and groups)
       include helping behavior (Figure 12.2), aggression, prejudice and discrimination, attraction and close
       relationships, and group processes and intergroup relationships.

       we connect: from moments of confrontation to moments of working together and helping others, as shown here.

       Social psychologists focus on how people conceptualize and interpret situations and how these interpretations
       influence their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors (Ross & Nisbett, 1991). Thus, social psychology studies

interpersonal processes of conformity and obedience, aggression and altruism, and, finally, love and
attraction.

Situational and Dispositional Influences on Behavior

Behavior is a product of both the situation (e.g., cultural influences, social roles, and the presence of
bystanders) and of the person (e.g., personality characteristics). Subfields of psychology tend to focus on one
influence or behavior over others. Situationism is the view that our behavior and actions are determined by
our immediate environment and surroundings. In contrast, dispositionism holds that our behavior is
determined by internal factors (Heider, 1958). An internal factor is an attribute of a person and includes
personality traits and temperament. Social psychologists have tended to take the situationist perspective,
whereas personality psychologists have promoted the dispositionist perspective. Modern approaches to social
psychology, however, take both the situation and the individual into account when studying human behavior
(Fiske, Gilbert, & Lindzey, 2010). In fact, the field of social-personality psychology has emerged to study the
complex interaction of internal and situational factors that affect human behavior (Mischel, 1977; Richard,
Bond, & Stokes-Zoota, 2003).

Fundamental Attribution Error

In the United States, the predominant culture tends to favor a dispositional approach in explaining human
behavior. Why do you think this is? We tend to think that people are in control of their own behaviors, and,
therefore, any behavior change must be due to something internal, such as their personality, habits, or
temperament. According to some social psychologists, people tend to overemphasize internal factors as
explanations--or attributions--for the behavior of other people. They tend to assume that the behavior of
another person is a trait of that person, and to underestimate the power of the situation on the behavior of
others. They tend to fail to recognize when the behavior of another is due to situational variables, and thus to
the person's state. This erroneous assumption is called the fundamental attribution error (Ross, 1977; Riggio
& Garcia, 2009). To better understand, imagine this scenario: Jamie returns home from work, and opens the
front door to a happy greeting from spouse Morgan who inquires how the day has been. Instead of returning
the spouse's kind greeting, Jamie yells, "Leave me alone!" Why did Jamie yell? How would someone
committing the fundamental attribution error explain Jamie's behavior? The most common response is that
Jamie is a mean, angry, or unfriendly person (traits). This is an internal or dispositional explanation. However,
imagine that Jamie was just laid off from work due to company downsizing. Would your explanation for Jamie's
behavior change? Your revised explanation might be that Jamie was frustrated and disappointed about being
laid off and was therefore in a bad mood (state). This is now an external or situational explanation for Jamie's
behavior.

The fundamental attribution error is so powerful that people often overlook obvious situational influences on
behavior. A classic example was demonstrated in a series of experiments known as the quizmaster study (Ross,
Amabile, & Steinmetz, 1977). Student participants were randomly assigned to play the role of a questioner (the
quizmaster) or a contestant in a quiz game. Questioners developed difficult questions to which they knew the
answers, and they presented these questions to the contestants. The contestants answered the questions
correctly only 4 out of 10 times (Figure 12.3). After the task, the questioners and contestants were asked to rate
their own general knowledge compared to the average student. Questioners did not rate their general
knowledge higher than the contestants, but the contestants rated the questioners' intelligence higher than
their own. In a second study, observers of the interaction also rated the questioner as having more general
knowledge than the contestant. The obvious influence on performance is the situation. The questioners wrote
the questions, so of course they had an advantage. Both the contestants and observers made an internal
attribution for the performance. They concluded that the questioners must be more intelligent than the
contestants.

       FIGURE 12.3 In the quizmaster study, people tended to disregard the influence of the situation and wrongly
       concluded that a questioner's knowledge was greater than their own. (credit: Steve Jurvetson)
       The halo effect refers to the tendency to let the overall impression of an individual color the way in which we
       feel about their character. For instance, we might assume that people who are physically attractive are more
       likely to be good people than less attractive individuals. Another example of how the halo effect might manifest
       would involve assuming that someone whom we perceive to be outgoing or friendly has a better moral
       character than someone who is not.
       As demonstrated in the examples above, the fundamental attribution error is considered a powerful influence
       in how we explain the behaviors of others. However, it should be noted that some researchers have suggested
       that the fundamental attribution error may not be as powerful as it is often portrayed. In fact, a recent review
       of more than 173 published studies suggests that several factors (e.g., high levels of idiosyncrasy of the
       character and how well hypothetical events are explained) play a role in determining just how influential the
       fundamental attribution error is (Malle, 2006).

      Is the Fundamental Attribution Error a Universal Phenomenon?

       You may be able to think of examples of the fundamental attribution error in your life. Do people in all cultures
       commit the fundamental attribution error? Research suggests that they do not. People from an individualistic
       culture, that is, a culture that focuses on individual achievement and autonomy, have the greatest tendency to
       commit the fundamental attribution error. Individualistic cultures, which tend to be found in western
       countries such as the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, promote a focus on the individual.
       Therefore, a person's disposition is thought to be the primary explanation for her behavior. In contrast, people
       from a collectivistic culture, that is, a culture that focuses on communal relationships with others, such as
       family, friends, and community (Figure 12.4), are less likely to commit the fundamental attribution error
       (Markus & Kitayama, 1991; Triandis, 2001).

       FIGURE 12.4 People from collectivistic cultures, such as some Asian cultures, are more likely to emphasize
       relationships with others than to focus primarily on the individual. Activities such as (a) preparing a meal, (b)
       hanging out, and (c) playing a game engage people in a group. (credit a: modification of work by Arian Zwegers;
       credit b: modification of work by "conbon33"/Flickr; credit c: modification of work by Anja Disseldorp)
       Why do you think this is the case? Collectivistic cultures, which tend to be found in east Asian countries and in
       Latin American and African countries, focus on the group more than on the individual (Nisbett, Peng, Choi, &

Norenzayan, 2001). This focus on others provides a broader perspective that takes into account both
situational and cultural influences on behavior; thus, a more nuanced explanation of the causes of others'
behavior becomes more likely. Table 12.1 summarizes compares individualistic and collectivist cultures.

TABLE 12.1

Masuda and Nisbett (2001) demonstrated that the kinds of information that people attend to when viewing
visual stimuli (e.g., an aquarium scene) can differ significantly depending on whether the observer comes from
a collectivistic versus an individualistic culture. Japanese participants were much more likely to recognize
objects that were presented when they occurred in the same context in which they were originally viewed.
Manipulating the context in which object recall occurred had no such impact on American participants. Other
researchers have shown similar differences across cultures. For example, Zhang, Fung, Stanley, Isaacowitz,
and Zhang (2014) demonstrated differences in the ways that holistic thinking might develop between Chinese
and American participants, and Ramesh and Gelfand (2010) demonstrated that job turnover rates are more
related to the fit between a person and the organization in which they work in an Indian sample, but the fit
between the person and their specific job was more predictive of turnover in an American sample.

Actor-Observer Bias

Returning to our earlier example, Jamie was laid off, but an observer would not know. So a naïve observer
would tend to attribute Jamie's hostile behavior to Jamie's disposition rather than to the true, situational cause.
Why do you think we underestimate the influence of the situation on the behaviors of others? One reason is
that we often don't have all the information we need to make a situational explanation for another person's
behavior. The only information we might have is what is observable. Due to this lack of information we have a
tendency to assume the behavior is due to a dispositional, or internal, factor. When it comes to explaining our
own behaviors, however, we have much more information available to us. If you came home from school or
work angry and yelled at your dog or a loved one, what would your explanation be? You might say you were
very tired or feeling unwell and needed quiet time--a situational explanation. The actor-observer bias is the
phenomenon of attributing other people's behavior to internal factors (fundamental attribution error) while
attributing our own behavior to situational forces (Jones & Nisbett, 1971; Nisbett, Caputo, Legant, & Marecek,
1973; Choi & Nisbett, 1998). As actors of behavior, we have more information available to explain our own
behavior. However as observers, we have less information available; therefore, we tend to default to a
dispositionist perspective.

One study on the actor-observer bias investigated reasons male participants gave for why they liked their
girlfriend (Nisbett et al., 1973). When asked why participants liked their own girlfriend, participants focused
on internal, dispositional qualities of their girlfriends (for example, her pleasant personality). The participants'
explanations rarely included causes internal to themselves, such as dispositional traits (for example, "I need
companionship."). In contrast, when speculating why a male friend likes his girlfriend, participants were
404 12 · Social Psychology

       equally likely to give dispositional and external explanations. This supports the idea that actors tend to provide
       few internal explanations but many situational explanations for their own behavior. In contrast, observers tend
       to provide more dispositional explanations for a friend's behavior (Figure 12.5).

       FIGURE 12.5 Actor-observer bias is evident when subjects explain their own reasons for liking a girlfriend versus
       their impressions of others' reasons for liking a girlfriend.

      Self-Serving Bias

       We can understand self-serving bias by digging more deeply into attribution, a belief about the cause of a
       result. One model of attribution proposes three main dimensions: locus of control (internal versus external),
       stability (stable versus unstable), and controllability (controllable versus uncontrollable). In this context,
       stability refers to the extent in which the circumstances that result in a given outcome are changeable. The
       circumstances are considered stable if they are unlikely to change. Controllability refers to the extent to which
       the circumstances that are associated with a given outcome can be controlled. Obviously, those things that we
       have the power to control would be labeled controllable (Weiner, 1979).
       Following an outcome, self-serving biases are those attributions that enable us to see ourselves in a favorable
       light (for example, making internal attributions for success and external attributions for failures). When you do
       well at a task, for example acing an exam, it is in your best interest to make a dispositional attribution for your
       behavior ("I'm smart,") instead of a situational one ("The exam was easy,"). Self-serving bias is the tendency to
       explain our successes as due to dispositional (internal) characteristics, but to explain our failures as due to
       situational (external) factors. Again, this is culture dependent. This bias serves to protect self-esteem. You can
       imagine that if people always made situational attributions for their behavior, they would never be able to take
       credit and feel good about their accomplishments.
       Consider the example of how we explain our favorite sports team's wins. Research shows that we make
       internal, stable, and controllable attributions for our team's victory (Figure 12.6) (Grove, Hanrahan, &
       McInman, 1991). For example, we might tell ourselves that our team is talented (internal), consistently works
       hard (stable), and uses effective strategies (controllable). In contrast, we are more likely to make external,
       unstable, and uncontrollable attributions when our favorite team loses. For example, we might tell ourselves
       that the other team has more experienced players or that the referees were unfair (external), the other team
       played at home (unstable), and the cold weather affected our team's performance (uncontrollable).

Just-World Hypothesis

One consequence of westerners' tendency to provide dispositional explanations for behavior is victim blame
(Jost & Major, 2001). When people experience bad fortune, others tend to assume that they somehow are
responsible for their own fate. A common ideology, or worldview, in the United States is the just-world
hypothesis. The just-world hypothesis is the belief that people get the outcomes they deserve (Lerner & Miller,
1978). In order to maintain the belief that the world is a fair place, people tend to think that good people
experience positive outcomes, and bad people experience negative outcomes (Jost, Banaji, & Nosek, 2004; Jost
& Major, 2001). The ability to think of the world as a fair place, where people get what they deserve, allows us to
feel that the world is predictable and that we have some control over our life outcomes (Jost et al., 2004; Jost &
Major, 2001). For example, if you want to experience positive outcomes, you just need to work hard to get
ahead in life.
Can you think of a negative consequence of the just-world hypothesis? One negative consequence is people's
tendency to blame poor individuals for their plight. What common explanations are given for why people live
in poverty? Have you heard statements such as, "The poor are lazy and just don't want to work" or "Poor
people just want to live off the government"? What types of explanations are these, dispositional or situational?
These dispositional explanations are clear examples of the fundamental attribution error. Blaming poor people
for their poverty ignores situational factors that impact them, such as high unemployment rates, recession,
poor educational opportunities, and the familial cycle of poverty (Figure 12.7). Other research shows that
people who hold just-world beliefs have negative attitudes toward people who are unemployed and people
living with AIDS (Sutton & Douglas, 2005). In the United States and other countries, victims of sexual assault
may find themselves blamed for their abuse. Victim advocacy groups, such as Domestic Violence Ended
(DOVE), attend court in support of victims to ensure that blame is directed at the perpetrators of sexual
violence, not the victims.

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe social roles and how they influence behavior
         · Explain what social norms are and how they influence behavior
         · Define script
         · Describe the findings and criticisms of Zimbardo's Stanford prison experiment
       As you've learned, social psychology is the study of how people affect one another's thoughts, feelings, and
       behaviors. We have discussed situational perspectives and social psychology's emphasis on the ways in which
       a person's environment, including culture and other social influences, affect behavior. In this section, we
       examine situational forces that have a strong influence on human behavior including social roles, social
       norms, and scripts. We discuss how humans use the social environment as a source of information, or cues, on
       how to behave. Situational influences on our behavior have important consequences, such as whether we will
       help a stranger in an emergency or how we would behave in an unfamiliar environment.

      Social Roles

       One major social determinant of human behavior is our social roles. A social role is a pattern of behavior that
       is expected of a person in a given setting or group (Hare, 2003). Each one of us has several social roles. You
       may be, at the same time, a student, a parent, an aspiring teacher, a son or daughter, a spouse, and a lifeguard.
       How do these social roles influence your behavior? Social roles are defined by culturally shared knowledge.
       That is, nearly everyone in a given culture knows what behavior is expected of a person in a given role. For
       example, what is the social role for a student? If you look around a college classroom you will likely see
       students engaging in studious behavior, taking notes, listening to the professor, reading the textbook, and
       sitting quietly at their desks (Figure 12.8). Of course you may see students deviating from the expected
       studious behavior such as texting on their phones or using Facebook on their laptops, but in all cases, the
       students that you observe are attending class--a part of the social role of students.

       FIGURE 12.8 Being a student is just one of the many social roles you have. (credit: modification of work by "Rural
       Institute"/Flickr)
       Social roles, and our related behavior, can vary across different settings. How do you behave when you are
       engaging in the role of a child attending a family function? Now imagine how you behave when you are
       engaged in the role of employee at your workplace. It is very likely that your behavior will be different. Perhaps
       you are more relaxed and outgoing with your family, making jokes and doing silly things. But at your workplace
       you might speak more professionally, and although you may be friendly, you are also serious and focused on
       getting the work completed. These are examples of how our social roles influence and often dictate our
       behavior to the extent that identity and personality can vary with context (that is, in different social groups)
       (Malloy, Albright, Kenny, Agatstein & Winquist, 1997).

Social Norms

As discussed previously, social roles are defined by a culture's shared knowledge of what is expected behavior
of an individual in a specific role. This shared knowledge comes from social norms. A social norm is a group's
expectation of what is appropriate and acceptable behavior for its members--how they are supposed to behave
and think (Deutsch & Gerard, 1955; Berkowitz, 2004). How are we expected to act? What are we expected to
talk about? What are we expected to wear? In our discussion of social roles we noted that colleges have social
norms for students' behavior in the role of student and workplaces have social norms for employees' behaviors
in the role of employee. Social norms are everywhere including in families, gangs, and on social media outlets.

Tweens, Teens, and Social Norms

My 11-year-old daughter, Janelle, recently told me she needed shorts and shirts for the summer, and that she
wanted me to take her to a store at the mall that is popular with preteens and teens to buy them. I have noticed that
many girls have clothes from that store, so I tried teasing her. I said, "All the shirts say `Aero' on the front. If you are
wearing a shirt like that and you have a substitute teacher, and the other girls are all wearing that type of shirt, won't
the substitute teacher think you are all named `Aero'?"
My daughter replied, in typical 11-year-old fashion, "Mom, you are not funny. Can we please go shopping?"
I tried a different tactic. I asked Janelle if having clothing from that particular store will make her popular. She
replied, "No, it will not make me popular. It is what the popular kids wear. It will make me feel happier." How can a
label or name brand make someone feel happier? Think back to what you've learned about lifespan development.
What is it about pre-teens and young teens that make them want to fit in (Figure 12.9)? Does this change over time?
Think back to your high school experience, or look around your college campus. What is the main name brand
clothing you see? What messages do we get from the media about how to fit in?

FIGURE 12.9 Young people struggle to become independent at the same time they are desperately trying to fit in
with their peers. (credit: Monica Arellano-Ongpin)

Scripts

Because of social roles, people tend to know what behavior is expected of them in specific, familiar settings. A
script is a person's knowledge about the sequence of events expected in a specific setting (Schank & Abelson,
1977). How do you act on the first day of school, when you walk into an elevator, or are at a restaurant? For
example, at a restaurant in the United States, if we want the server's attention, we try to make eye contact. In
Brazil, you would make the sound "psst" to get the server's attention. You can see the cultural differences in
scripts. To an American, saying "psst" to a server might seem rude, yet to a Brazilian, trying to make eye
contact might not seem an effective strategy. Scripts are important sources of information to guide behavior in
given situations. Can you imagine being in an unfamiliar situation and not having a script for how to behave?
This could be uncomfortable and confusing. How could you find out about social norms in an unfamiliar

      Zimbardo's Stanford Prison Experiment

       The famous Stanford prison experiment, conducted by social psychologist Philip Zimbardo and his
       colleagues at Stanford University, demonstrated the power of social roles, social norms, and scripts. In the
       summer of 1971, an advertisement was placed in a California newspaper asking for male volunteers to
       participate in a study about the psychological effects of prison life. More than 70 men volunteered, and these
       volunteers then underwent psychological testing to eliminate candidates who had underlying psychiatric
       issues, medical issues, or a history of crime or drug abuse. The pool of volunteers was whittled down to 24
       healthy male college students. Each student was paid $15 per day (equivalent to about $80 today) and was
       randomly assigned to play the role of either a prisoner or a guard in the study. Based on what you have learned
       about research methods, why is it important that participants were randomly assigned?

       A mock prison was constructed in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford. Participants assigned
       to play the role of prisoners were "arrested" at their homes by Palo Alto police officers, booked at a police
       station, and subsequently taken to the mock prison. The experiment was scheduled to run for several weeks.
       To the surprise of the researchers, both the "prisoners" and "guards" assumed their roles with zeal. On the
       second day of the experiment, the guards forced the prisoners to strip, took their beds, and isolated the
       ringleaders using solitary confinement. In a relatively short time, the guards came to harass the prisoners in
       an increasingly sadistic manner, through a complete lack of privacy, lack of basic comforts such as mattresses
       to sleep on, and through degrading chores and late-night counts.

       The prisoners, in turn, began to show signs of severe anxiety and hopelessness--they began tolerating the
       guards' abuse. Even the Stanford professor who designed the study and was the head researcher, Philip
       Zimbardo, found himself acting as if the prison was real and his role, as prison supervisor, was real as well.
       After only six days, the experiment had to be ended due to the participants' deteriorating behavior. Zimbardo
       explained,

             At this point it became clear that we had to end the study. We had created an overwhelmingly powerful
             situation--a situation in which prisoners were withdrawing and behaving in pathological ways, and in
             which some of the guards were behaving sadistically. Even the "good" guards felt helpless to
             intervene, and none of the guards quit while the study was in progress. Indeed, it should be noted that
             no guard ever came late for his shift, called in sick, left early, or demanded extra pay for overtime
             work. (Zimbardo, 2013)

       The Stanford Prison Experiment has been used as a memorable demonstration of the incredible power that
       social roles, norms, and scripts have in affecting human behavior. However, multiple aspects of the study have
       been subject to criticism since its inception. The nature of these criticisms range from ethical concerns to
       issues of generalizability (Bartels, Milovich, & Moussier, 2016; Griggs, 2014; Le Texier, 2019). One criticism is
       that the way students were recruited for the experiment may have impacted the outcome (Carnahan &
       McFarland, 2007). Another criticism questions the conclusions that can be drawn from the study. Zimbardo
       appears to have provided specific guidelines of the types of behaviors that were expected of the guards
       (Zimbardo, 2007). Subsequent research suggests that such guidelines likely created an expectation of the
       types of behavior that Zimbardo reported observing in the Stanford Prison Experiment (Bartels, 2019), and
       that given these expectations, the guards simply acted as they thought they were expected to act. It has also
       been problematic that attempts to replicate aspects of the study have not been successful. For example, when
       no guidelines were presented to the guards, researchers documented different outcomes than those observed
       by Zimbardo. (Reicher & Haslam, 2006).

       The Stanford Prison Experiment has some parallels with the abuse of prisoners of war by U.S. Army troops and
       CIA personnel at the Abu Ghraib prison in 2003 and 2004 during the Iraq War. The offenses at Abu Ghraib were
       documented by photographs of the abuse, some taken by the abusers themselves (Figure 12.10).

12.3 Attitudes and Persuasion

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Define attitude
  · Describe how people's attitudes are internally changed through cognitive dissonance
  · Explain how people's attitudes are externally changed through persuasion
  · Describe the peripheral and central routes to persuasion
Social psychologists have documented how the power of the situation can influence our behaviors. Now we
turn to how the power of the situation can influence our attitudes and beliefs. Attitude is our evaluation of a
person, an idea, or an object. We have attitudes for many things ranging from products that we might pick up
in the supermarket to people around the world to political policies. Typically, attitudes are favorable or
unfavorable: positive or negative (Eagly & Chaiken, 1993). And, they have three components: an affective
component (feelings), a behavioral component (the effect of the attitude on behavior), and a cognitive
component (belief and knowledge) (Rosenberg & Hovland, 1960).
For example, you may hold a positive attitude toward recycling. This attitude should result in positive feelings
toward recycling (such as "It makes me feel good to recycle" or "I enjoy knowing that I make a small difference
in reducing the amount of waste that ends up in landfills"). Certainly, this attitude should be reflected in our
behavior: You actually recycle as often as you can. Finally, this attitude will be reflected in favorable thoughts
(for example, "Recycling is good for the environment" or "Recycling is the responsible thing to do").
Our attitudes and beliefs are not only influenced by external forces, but also by internal influences that we
control. Like our behavior, our attitudes and thoughts are not always changed by situational pressures, but they
can be consciously changed by our own free will. In this section we discuss the conditions under which we
would want to change our own attitudes and beliefs.

What is Cognitive Dissonance?

Social psychologists have documented that feeling good about ourselves and maintaining positive self-esteem
is a powerful motivator of human behavior (Tavris & Aronson, 2008). In the United States, members of the
predominant culture typically think very highly of themselves and view themselves as good people who are
above average on many desirable traits (Ehrlinger, Gilovich, & Ross, 2005). Often, our behavior, attitudes, and
410 12 · Social Psychology

       beliefs are affected when we experience a threat to our self-esteem or positive self-image. Psychologist Leon
       Festinger (1957) defined cognitive dissonance as psychological discomfort arising from holding two or more
       inconsistent attitudes, behaviors, or cognitions (thoughts, beliefs, or opinions). Festinger's theory of cognitive
       dissonance states that when we experience a conflict in our behaviors, attitudes, or beliefs that runs counter to
       our positive self-perceptions, we experience psychological discomfort (dissonance). For example, if you believe
       smoking is bad for your health but you continue to smoke, you experience conflict between your belief and
       behavior (Figure 12.11).

       FIGURE 12.11 Cognitive dissonance is aroused by inconsistent beliefs and behaviors. Believing cigarettes are bad
       for your health, but smoking cigarettes anyway, can cause cognitive dissonance. To reduce cognitive dissonance,
       individuals can change their behavior, as in quitting smoking, or change their belief, such as discounting the
       evidence that smoking is harmful. (credit "cigarettes": modification of work by CDC/Debora Cartagena; "patch":
       modification of "RegBarc"/Wikimedia Commons; "smoking": modification of work by Tim Parkinson)
       Later research documented that only conflicting cognitions that threaten individuals' positive self-image cause
       dissonance (Greenwald & Ronis, 1978). Additional research found that dissonance is not only psychologically
       uncomfortable but also can cause physiological arousal (Croyle & Cooper, 1983) and activate regions of the
       brain important in emotions and cognitive functioning (van Veen, Krug, Schooler, & Carter, 2009). When we
       experience cognitive dissonance, we are motivated to decrease it because it is psychologically, physically, and

                                                                                                                                                12.3 · Attitudes and Persuasion 411

mentally uncomfortable. We can reduce cognitive dissonance by bringing our cognitions, attitudes, and
behaviors in line--that is, making them harmonious. This can be done in different ways, such as:

  · changing our discrepant behavior (e.g., stop smoking),
  · changing our cognitions through rationalization or denial (e.g., telling ourselves that health risks can be

      reduced by smoking filtered cigarettes),
  · adding a new cognition (e.g., "Smoking suppresses my appetite so I don't become overweight, which is

      good for my health.").
A classic example of cognitive dissonance is Joaquin, a 20-year-old who enlists in the military. During boot
camp he is awakened at 5:00 a.m., is chronically sleep deprived, yelled at, covered in sand flea bites, physically
bruised and battered, and mentally exhausted (Figure 12.12). It gets worse. Recruits that make it to week 11 of
boot camp have to do 54 hours of continuous training.

FIGURE 12.12 A person who has chosen a difficult path must deal with cognitive dissonance in addition to many
other discomforts. (credit: Tyler J. Bolken)
Not surprisingly, Joaquin is miserable. No one likes to be miserable. In this type of situation, people can
change their beliefs, their attitudes, or their behaviors. The last option, a change of behaviors, is not available
to Joaquin. He has signed on to the military for four years, and he cannot legally leave.
If Joaquin keeps thinking about how miserable he is, it is going to be a very long four years. He will be in a
constant state of cognitive dissonance. As an alternative to this misery, Joaquin can change his beliefs or
attitudes. He can tell himself, "I am becoming stronger, healthier, and sharper. I am learning discipline and
how to defend myself and my country. What I am doing is really important." If this is his belief, he will realize
that he is becoming stronger through his challenges. He then will feel better and not experience cognitive
dissonance, which is an uncomfortable state.
The Effect of Initiation
The military example demonstrates the observation that a difficult initiation into a group influences us to like
the group more. Another social psychology concept, justification of effort, suggests that we value goals and
achievements that we put a lot of effort into. According to this theory, if something is difficult for us to achieve,
we believe it is more worthwhile. For example, if you move to an apartment and spend hours assembling a
dresser you bought from Ikea, you will value that more than a fancier dresser someone else bought you. We do
not want to have wasted time and effort to join a group that we eventually leave. A classic experiment by
Aronson and Mills (1959) demonstrated this justification of effort effect. College students volunteered to join a
campus group that would meet regularly to discuss the psychology of sex. Participants were randomly
assigned to one of three conditions: no initiation, an easy initiation, and a difficult initiation into the group.
After participating in the first discussion, which was deliberately made very boring, participants rated how
much they liked the group. Participants who underwent a difficult initiation process to join the group rated the
group more favorably than did participants with an easy initiation or no initiation (Figure 12.13).
412 12 · Social Psychology

       FIGURE 12.13 Justification of effort has a distinct effect on a person liking a group. Students in the difficult
       initiation condition liked the group more than students in other conditions due to the justification of effort.
       Similar effects can be seen in a more recent study of how student effort affects course evaluations. Heckert,
       Latier, Ringwald-Burton, and Drazen (2006) surveyed 463 undergraduates enrolled in courses at a midwestern
       university about the amount of effort that their courses required of them. In addition, the students were also
       asked to evaluate various aspects of the course. Given what you've just read, it will come as no surprise that
       those courses that were associated with the highest level of effort were evaluated as being more valuable than
       those that did not. Furthermore, students indicated that they learned more in courses that required more
       effort, regardless of the grades that they received in those courses (Heckert et al., 2006).
       Besides the classic military example and group initiation, can you think of other examples of cognitive
       dissonance? Here is one: Maria and Marco live in Fairfield County, Connecticut, which is one of the wealthiest
       areas in the United States and has a very high cost of living. Maria telecommutes from home and Marco does
       not work outside of the home. They rent a very small house for more than $3000 a month. Marco shops at
       consignment stores for clothes and economizes when possible. They complain that they never have any money
       and that they cannot buy anything new. When asked why they do not move to a less expensive location, since
       Maria telecommutes, they respond that Fairfield County is beautiful, they love the beaches, and they feel
       comfortable there. How does the theory of cognitive dissonance apply to Maria and Marco's choices?

      Persuasion

       In the previous section we discussed that the motivation to reduce cognitive dissonance leads us to change our
       attitudes, behaviors, and/or cognitions to make them consonant. Persuasion is the process of changing our
       attitude toward something based on some kind of communication. Much of the persuasion we experience
       comes from outside forces. How do people convince others to change their attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors
       (Figure 12.14)? What communications do you receive that attempt to persuade you to change your attitudes,
       beliefs, and behaviors?

A subfield of social psychology studies persuasion and social influence, providing us with a plethora of
information on how humans can be persuaded by others.
Yale Attitude Change Approach
The topic of persuasion has been one of the most extensively researched areas in social psychology (Fiske et
al., 2010). During the Second World War, Carl Hovland extensively researched persuasion for the U.S. Army.
After the war, Hovland continued his exploration of persuasion at Yale University. Out of this work came a
model called the Yale attitude change approach, which describes the conditions under which people tend to
change their attitudes. Hovland demonstrated that certain features of the source of a persuasive message, the
content of the message, and the characteristics of the audience will influence the persuasiveness of a message
(Hovland, Janis, & Kelley, 1953).
Features of the source of the persuasive message include the credibility of the speaker (Hovland & Weiss,
1951) and the physical attractiveness of the speaker (Eagly & Chaiken, 1975; Petty, Wegener, & Fabrigar, 1997).
Thus, speakers who are credible, or have expertise on the topic, and who are deemed as trustworthy are more
persuasive than less credible speakers. Similarly, more attractive speakers are more persuasive than less
attractive speakers. The use of famous actors and athletes to advertise products on television and in print
relies on this principle. The immediate and long term impact of the persuasion also depends, however, on the
credibility of the messenger (Kumkale & Albarracín, 2004).
Features of the message itself that affect persuasion include subtlety (the quality of being important, but not
obvious) (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986; Walster & Festinger, 1962); sidedness (that is, having more than one side)
(Crowley & Hoyer, 1994; Igou & Bless, 2003; Lumsdaine & Janis, 1953); timing (Haugtvedt & Wegener, 1994;
Miller & Campbell, 1959), and whether both sides are presented. Messages that are more subtle are more
persuasive than direct messages. Arguments that occur first, such as in a debate, are more influential if
messages are given back-to-back. However, if there is a delay after the first message, and before the audience
needs to make a decision, the last message presented will tend to be more persuasive (Miller & Campbell,
1959).
Features of the audience that affect persuasion are attention (Albarracín & Wyer, 2001; Festinger & Maccoby,
1964), intelligence, self-esteem (Rhodes & Wood, 1992), and age (Krosnick & Alwin, 1989). In order to be
persuaded, audience members must be paying attention. People with lower intelligence are more easily
persuaded than people with higher intelligence; whereas people with moderate self-esteem are more easily
persuaded than people with higher or lower self-esteem (Rhodes & Wood, 1992). Finally, younger adults aged
18-25 are more persuadable than older adults.
414 12 · Social Psychology

       Elaboration Likelihood Model
       An especially popular model that describes the dynamics of persuasion is the elaboration likelihood model of
       persuasion (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986). The elaboration likelihood model considers the variables of the attitude
       change approach--that is, features of the source of the persuasive message, contents of the message, and
       characteristics of the audience are used to determine when attitude change will occur. According to the
       elaboration likelihood model of persuasion, there are two main routes that play a role in delivering a
       persuasive message: central and peripheral (Figure 12.15).

           FIGURE 12.15 Persuasion can take one of two paths, and the durability of the end result depends on the path.
       The central route is logic driven and uses data and facts to convince people of an argument's worthiness. For
       example, a car company seeking to persuade you to purchase their model will emphasize the car's safety
       features and fuel economy. This is a direct route to persuasion that focuses on the quality of the information. In
       order for the central route of persuasion to be effective in changing attitudes, thoughts, and behaviors, the
       argument must be strong and, if successful, will result in lasting attitude change.
       The central route to persuasion works best when the target of persuasion, or the audience, is analytical and
       willing to engage in processing of the information. From an advertiser's perspective, what products would be
       best sold using the central route to persuasion? What audience would most likely be influenced to buy the
       product? One example is buying a computer. It is likely, for example, that small business owners might be
       especially influenced by the focus on the computer's quality and features such as processing speed and
       memory capacity.
       The peripheral route is an indirect route that uses peripheral cues to associate positivity with the message
       (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986). Instead of focusing on the facts and a product's quality, the peripheral route relies on
       association with positive characteristics such as positive emotions and celebrity endorsement. For example,
       having a popular athlete advertise athletic shoes is a common method used to encourage young adults to
       purchase the shoes. This route to attitude change does not require much effort or information processing. This
       method of persuasion may promote positivity toward the message or product, but it typically results in less
       permanent attitude or behavior change. The audience does not need to be analytical or motivated to process
       the message. In fact, a peripheral route to persuasion may not even be noticed by the audience, for example in
       the strategy of product placement. Product placement refers to putting a product with a clear brand name or
       brand identity in a TV show or movie to promote the product (Gupta & Lord, 1998). For example, one season of
       the reality series American Idol prominently showed the panel of judges drinking out of cups that displayed
       the Coca-Cola logo. What other products would be best sold using the peripheral route to persuasion? Another
       example is clothing: A retailer may focus on celebrities that are wearing the same style of clothing.
       Foot-in-the-door Technique
       Researchers have tested many persuasion strategies that are effective in selling products and changing

people's attitude, ideas, and behaviors. One effective strategy is the foot-in-the-door technique (Cialdini, 2001;
Pliner, Hart, Kohl, & Saari, 1974). Using the foot-in-the-door technique, the persuader gets a person to agree
to bestow a small favor or to buy a small item, only to later request a larger favor or purchase of a bigger item.
The foot-in-the-door technique was demonstrated in a study by Freedman and Fraser (1966) in which
participants who agreed to a post small sign in their yard or sign a petition were more likely to agree to put a
large sign in their yard than people who declined the first request (Figure 12.16). Research on this technique
also illustrates the principle of consistency (Cialdini, 2001): Our past behavior often directs our future
behavior, and we have a desire to maintain consistency once we have committed to a behavior.

FIGURE 12.16 With the foot-in-the-door technique, getting someone to agree to a small request such as (a)
wearing a campaign button can make them more likely to agree to a larger request, such as (b) putting campaigns
signs in your yard. (credit a: modification of work by Joe Crawford; credit b: modification of work by
"shutterblog"/Flickr)
A common application of foot-in-the-door is when teens ask their parents for a small permission (for example,
extending curfew by a half hour) and then asking them for something larger. Having granted the smaller
request increases the likelihood that parents will acquiesce with the later, larger request.
How would a store owner use the foot-in-the-door technique to sell you an expensive product? For example,
say that you are buying the latest model smartphone, and the salesperson suggests you purchase the best data
plan. You agree to this. The salesperson then suggests a bigger purchase--the three-year extended warranty.
After agreeing to the smaller request, you are more likely to also agree to the larger request. You may have
encountered this if you have bought a car. When salespeople realize that a buyer intends to purchase a certain
model, they might try to get the customer to pay for many or most available options on the car. Another
example of the foot-in-the-door technique would be applied to an individual in the market for a used car who
decides to buy a fully loaded new car. Why? Because the salesperson convinced the buyer that they need a car
that has all of the safety features that were not available in the used car.

12.4 Conformity, Compliance, and Obedience

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Explain the Asch effect
  · Define conformity and types of social influence
  · Describe Stanley Milgram's experiment and its implications
  · Define groupthink, social facilitation, and social loafing
In this section, we discuss additional ways in which people influence others. The topics of conformity, social
influence, obedience, and group processes demonstrate the power of the social situation to change our
thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. We begin this section with a discussion of a famous social psychology
experiment that demonstrated how susceptible humans are to outside social pressures.
416 12 · Social Psychology

      Conformity

       Solomon Asch conducted several experiments in the 1950s to determine how people are affected by the
       thoughts and behaviors of other people. In one study, a group of participants was shown a series of printed line
       segments of different lengths: a, b, and c (Figure 12.17). Participants were then shown a fourth line segment: x.
       They were asked to identify which line segment from the first group (a, b, or c) most closely resembled the
       fourth line segment in length.

       FIGURE 12.17 These line segments illustrate the judgment task in Asch's conformity study. Which line on the
       right--a, b, or c--is the same length as line x on the left?
       Each group of participants had only one true, naïve subject. The remaining members of the group were
       confederates of the researcher. A confederate is a person who is aware of the experiment and works for the
       researcher. Confederates are used to manipulate social situations as part of the research design, and the true,
       naïve participants believe that confederates are, like them, uninformed participants in the experiment. In
       Asch's study, the confederates identified a line segment that was obviously shorter than the target line--a
       wrong answer. The naïve participant then had to identify aloud the line segment that best matched the target
       line segment.
       How often do you think the true participant aligned with the confederates' response? That is, how often do you
       think the group influenced the participant, and the participant gave the wrong answer? Asch (1955) found that
       76% of participants conformed to group pressure at least once by indicating the incorrect line. Conformity is
       the change in a person's behavior to go along with the group, even if he does not agree with the group. Why
       would people give the wrong answer? What factors would increase or decrease someone giving in or
       conforming to group pressure?
       The Asch effect is the influence of the group majority on an individual's judgment.
       What factors make a person more likely to yield to group pressure? Research shows that the size of the
       majority, the presence of another dissenter, and the public or relatively private nature of responses are key
       influences on conformity.

         · The size of the majority: The greater the number of people in the majority, the more likely an individual
             will conform. There is, however, an upper limit: a point where adding more members does not increase
             conformity. In Asch's study, conformity increased with the number of people in the majority--up to seven
             individuals. At numbers beyond seven, conformity leveled off and decreased slightly (Asch, 1955).

         · The presence of another dissenter: If there is at least one dissenter, conformity rates drop to near zero
             (Asch, 1955).

         · The public or private nature of the responses: When responses are made publicly (in front of others),
             conformity is more likely; however, when responses are made privately (e.g., writing down the response),
             conformity is less likely (Deutsch & Gerard, 1955).

       The finding that conformity is more likely to occur when responses are public than when they are private is the

reason government elections require voting in secret, so we are not coerced by others (Figure 12.18). The Asch
effect can be easily seen in children when they have to publicly vote for something. For example, if the teacher
asks whether the children would rather have extra recess, no homework, or candy, once a few children vote,
the rest will comply and go with the majority. In a different classroom, the majority might vote differently, and
most of the children would comply with that majority. When someone's vote changes if it is made in public
versus private, this is known as compliance. Compliance can be a form of conformity. Compliance is going
along with a request or demand, even if you do not agree with the request. In Asch's studies, the participants
complied by giving the wrong answers, but privately did not accept that the obvious wrong answers were
correct.

FIGURE 12.18 Voting for government officials in the United States is private to reduce the pressure of conformity.
(credit: Nicole Klauss)
Now that you have learned about the Asch line experiments, why do you think the participants conformed?
The correct answer to the line segment question was obvious, and it was an easy task. Researchers have
categorized the motivation to conform into two types: normative social influence and informational social
influence (Deutsch & Gerard, 1955).
In normative social influence, people conform to the group norm to fit in, to feel good, and to be accepted by
the group. However, with informational social influence, people conform because they believe the group is
competent and has the correct information, particularly when the task or situation is ambiguous. What type of
social influence was operating in the Asch conformity studies? Since the line judgment task was unambiguous,
participants did not need to rely on the group for information. Instead, participants complied to fit in and
avoid ridicule, an instance of normative social influence.
An example of informational social influence may be what to do in an emergency situation. Imagine that you
are in a movie theater watching a film and what seems to be smoke comes in the theater from under the
emergency exit door. You are not certain that it is smoke--it might be a special effect for the movie, such as a
fog machine. When you are uncertain you will tend to look at the behavior of others in the theater. If other
people show concern and get up to leave, you are likely to do the same. However, if others seem unconcerned,
you are likely to stay put and continue watching the movie (Figure 12.19).

       concert where people are dancing, singing, and possibly engaging in activities like crowd surfing. (credit a:

       How would you have behaved if you were a participant in Asch's study? Many students say they would not
       conform, that the study is outdated, and that people nowadays are more independent. To some extent this may
       be true. Research suggests that overall rates of conformity may have reduced since the time of Asch's research.
       Furthermore, efforts to replicate Asch's study have made it clear that many factors determine how likely it is
       that someone will demonstrate conformity to the group. These factors include the participant's age, gender,
       and socio-cultural background (Bond & Smith, 1996; Larsen, 1990; Walker & Andrade, 1996).

      Stanley Milgram's Experiment

       Conformity is one effect of the influence of others on our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Another form of
       social influence is obedience to authority. Obedience is the change of an individual's behavior to comply with a
       demand by an authority figure. People often comply with the request because they are concerned about a
       consequence if they do not comply. To demonstrate this phenomenon, we review another classic social
       psychology experiment.
       Stanley Milgram was a social psychology professor at Yale who was influenced by the trial of Adolf Eichmann, a
       Nazi war criminal. Eichmann's defense for the atrocities he committed was that he was "just following orders."
       Milgram (1963) wanted to test the validity of this defense, so he designed an experiment and initially recruited
       40 men for his experiment. The volunteer participants were led to believe that they were participating in a
       study to improve learning and memory. The participants were told that they were to teach other students
       (learners) correct answers to a series of test items. The participants were shown how to use a device that they
       were told delivered electric shocks of different intensities to the learners. The participants were told to shock
       the learners if they gave a wrong answer to a test item--that the shock would help them to learn. The
       participants believed they gave the learners shocks, which increased in 15-volt increments, all the way up to
       450 volts. The participants did not know that the learners were confederates and that the confederates did not
       actually receive shocks.
       In response to a string of incorrect answers from the learners, the participants obediently and repeatedly
       shocked them. The confederate learners cried out for help, begged the participant teachers to stop, and even
       complained of heart trouble. Yet, when the researcher told the participant-teachers to continue the shock, 65%
       of the participants continued the shock to the maximum voltage and to the point that the learner became
       unresponsive (Figure 12.20). What makes someone obey authority to the point of potentially causing serious
       harm to another person?

FIGURE 12.20 The Milgram experiment showed the surprising degree to which people obey authority. Two out of
three (65%) participants continued to administer shocks to an unresponsive learner.
Several variations of the original Milgram experiment were conducted to test the boundaries of obedience.
When certain features of the situation were changed, participants were less likely to continue to deliver shocks
(Milgram, 1965). For example, when the setting of the experiment was moved to an off-campus office building,
the percentage of participants who delivered the highest shock dropped to 48%. When the learner was in the
same room as the teacher, the highest shock rate dropped to 40%. When the teachers' and learners' hands
were touching, the highest shock rate dropped to 30%. When the researcher gave the orders by phone, the rate
dropped to 23%. These variations show that when the humanity of the person being shocked was increased,
obedience decreased. Similarly, when the authority of the experimenter decreased, so did obedience.
This case is still very applicable today. What does a person do if an authority figure orders something done?
What if the person believes it is incorrect, or worse, unethical? In a study by Martin and Bull (2008), midwives
privately filled out a questionnaire regarding best practices and expectations in delivering a baby. Then, a
more senior midwife and supervisor asked the junior midwives to do something they had previously stated
they were opposed to. Most of the junior midwives were obedient to authority, going against their own beliefs.
Burger (2009) partially replicated this study. He found among a multicultural sample of women and men that
their levels of obedience matched Milgram's research. Doliski et al. (2017) performed a replication of
Burger's work in Poland and controlled for the gender of both participants and learners, and once again,
results that were consistent with Milgram's original work were observed.

Groupthink

When in group settings, we are often influenced by the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of people around us.
Whether it is due to normative or informational social influence, groups have power to influence individuals.
Another phenomenon of group conformity is groupthink. Groupthink is the modification of the opinions of
members of a group to align with what they believe is the group consensus (Janis, 1972). In group situations,
the group often takes action that individuals would not perform outside the group setting because groups
make more extreme decisions than individuals do. Moreover, groupthink can hinder opposing trains of
thought. This elimination of diverse opinions contributes to faulty decision by the group.

                                                                                                             DIG DEEPER

 Groupthink in the U.S. Government

  There have been several instances of groupthink in the U.S. government. One example occurred when the United
420 12 · Social Psychology

         States led a small coalition of nations to invade Iraq in March 2003. This invasion occurred because a small
         group of advisors and former President George W. Bush were convinced that Iraq represented a significant
         terrorism threat with a large stockpile of weapons of mass destruction at its disposal. Although some of these
         individuals may have had some doubts about the credibility of the information available to them at the time, in
         the end, the group arrived at a consensus that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and represented a
         significant threat to national security. It later came to light that Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction,
         but not until the invasion was well underway. As a result, 6000 American soldiers were killed and many more
         civilians died. How did the Bush administration arrive at their conclusions? View this video of Colin Powell, 10
         years after his famous United Nations speech, discussing the information he had at the time
         (https://www.openstax.org/l/GroupThink) that his decisions were based on. ("CNN Official Interview: Colin
         Powell now regrets UN speech about WMDs," 2010).

         Do you see evidence of groupthink?

       Why does groupthink occur? There are several causes of groupthink, which makes it preventable. When the
       group is highly cohesive, or has a strong sense of connection, maintaining group harmony may become more
       important to the group than making sound decisions. If the group leader is directive and makes his opinions
       known, this may discourage group members from disagreeing with the leader. If the group is isolated from
       hearing alternative or new viewpoints, groupthink may be more likely. How do you know when groupthink is
       occurring?

       There are several symptoms of groupthink including the following:

         · perceiving the group as invulnerable or invincible--believing it can do no wrong
         · believing the group is morally correct
         · self-censorship by group members, such as withholding information to avoid disrupting the group

             consensus
         · the quashing of dissenting group members' opinions
         · the shielding of the group leader from dissenting views
         · perceiving an illusion of unanimity among group members
         · holding stereotypes or negative attitudes toward the out-group or others' with differing viewpoints (Janis,

             1972)

       Given the causes and symptoms of groupthink, how can it be avoided? There are several strategies that can
       improve group decision making including seeking outside opinions, voting in private, having the leader
       withhold position statements until all group members have voiced their views, conducting research on all
       viewpoints, weighing the costs and benefits of all options, and developing a contingency plan (Janis, 1972;
       Mitchell & Eckstein, 2009).

      Group Polarization

       Another phenomenon that occurs within group settings is group polarization. Group polarization (Teger &
       Pruitt, 1967) is the strengthening of an original group attitude after the discussion of views within a group.
       That is, if a group initially favors a viewpoint, after discussion the group consensus is likely a stronger
       endorsement of the viewpoint. Conversely, if the group was initially opposed to a viewpoint, group discussion
       would likely lead to stronger opposition. Group polarization explains many actions taken by groups that would
       not be undertaken by individuals. Group polarization can be observed at political conventions, when platforms
       of the party are supported by individuals who, when not in a group, would decline to support them. Recently,
       some theorists have argued that group polarization may be partly responsible for the extreme political
       partisanship that seems ubiquitous in modern society. Given that people can self-select media outlets that are
       most consistent with their own political views, they are less likely to encounter opposing viewpoints. Over
       time, this leads to a strengthening of their own perspective and of hostile attitudes and behaviors towards

                                                                                                                          12.4 · Conformity, Compliance, and Obedience 421

those with different political ideals. Remarkably, political polarization leads to open levels of discrimination
that are on par with, or perhaps exceed, racial discrimination (Iyengar & Westwood, 2015). A more everyday
example is a group's discussion of how attractive someone is. Does your opinion change if you find someone
attractive, but your friends do not agree? If your friends vociferously agree, might you then find this person
even more attractive?

Social traps refer to situations that arise when individuals or groups of individuals behave in ways that are not
in their best interest and that may have negative, long-term consequences. However, once established, a social
trap is very difficult to escape. For example, following World War II, the United States and the former Soviet
Union engaged in a nuclear arms race. While the presence of nuclear weapons is not in either party's best
interest, once the arms race began, each country felt the need to continue producing nuclear weapons to
protect itself from the other.

Social Loafing

Imagine you were just assigned a group project with other students whom you barely know. Everyone in your
group will get the same grade. Are you the type who will do most of the work, even though the final grade will
be shared? Or are you more likely to do less work because you know others will pick up the slack? Social
loafing involves a reduction in individual output on tasks where contributions are pooled. Because each
individual's efforts are not evaluated, individuals can become less motivated to perform well. Karau and
Williams (1993) and Simms and Nichols (2014) reviewed the research on social loafing and discerned when it
was least likely to happen. The researchers noted that social loafing could be alleviated if, among other
situations, individuals knew their work would be assessed by a manager (in a workplace setting) or instructor
(in a classroom setting), or if a manager or instructor required group members to complete self-evaluations.

The likelihood of social loafing in student work groups increases as the size of the group increases (Shepperd &
Taylor, 1999). According to Kamau and Williams (1993), college students were the population most likely to
engage in social loafing. Their study also found that women and participants from collectivistic cultures were
less likely to engage in social loafing, explaining that their group orientation may account for this.

College students could work around social loafing or "free-riding" by suggesting to their professors use of a
flocking method to form groups. Harding (2018) compared groups of students who had self-selected into
groups for class to those who had been formed by flocking, which involves assigning students to groups who
have similar schedules and motivations. Not only did she find that students reported less "free riding," but that
they also did better in the group assignments compared to those whose groups were self-selected.

Interestingly, the opposite of social loafing occurs when the task is complex and difficult (Bond & Titus, 1983;
Geen, 1989). In a group setting, such as the student work group, if your individual performance cannot be
evaluated, there is less pressure for you to do well, and thus less anxiety or physiological arousal (Latané,
Williams, & Harkens, 1979). This puts you in a relaxed state in which you can perform your best, if you choose
(Zajonc, 1965). If the task is a difficult one, many people feel motivated and believe that their group needs their
input to do well on a challenging project (Jackson & Williams, 1985).

Deindividuation

Another way that being part of a group can affect behavior is exhibited in instances in which deindividuation
occurs. Deindividuation refers to situations in which a person may feel a sense of anonymity and therefore a
reduction in accountability and sense of self when among others. Deindividuation is often pointed to in cases
in which mob or riot-like behaviors occur (Zimbardo, 1969), but research on the subject and the role that
deindividuation plays in such behaviors has resulted in inconsistent results (as discussed in Granström, Guvå,
Hylander, & Rosander, 2009).

12.5 Prejudice and Discrimination

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Define and distinguish among prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination
  · Provide examples of prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination
  · Explain why prejudice and discrimination exist

Human conflict can result in crime, war, and mass murder, such as genocide. Prejudice and discrimination
often are root causes of human conflict, which explains how strangers come to hate one another to the extreme
of causing others harm. Prejudice and discrimination affect everyone. In this section we will examine the
definitions of prejudice and discrimination, examples of these concepts, and causes of these biases.

Understanding Prejudice and Discrimination

As we discussed in the opening story of Trayvon Martin, humans are very diverse and although we share many
similarities, we also have many differences. The social groups we belong to help form our identities (Tajfel,
1974). These differences may be difficult for some people to reconcile, which may lead to prejudice toward
people who are different. Prejudice is a negative attitude and feeling toward an individual based solely on
one's membership in a particular social group (Allport, 1954; Brown, 2010). Prejudice is common against
people who are members of an unfamiliar cultural group. Thus, certain types of education, contact,
interactions, and building relationships with members of different cultural groups can reduce the tendency
toward prejudice. In fact, simply imagining interacting with members of different cultural groups might affect
prejudice. Indeed, when experimental participants were asked to imagine themselves positively interacting
with someone from a different group, this led to an increased positive attitude toward the other group and an
increase in positive traits associated with the other group. Furthermore, imagined social interaction can
reduce anxiety associated with inter-group interactions (Crisp & Turner, 2009). What are some examples of
social groups that you belong to that contribute to your identity? Social groups can include gender, race,
ethnicity, nationality, social class, religion, sexual orientation, profession, and many more. And, as is true for
social roles, you can simultaneously be a member of more than one social group. An example of prejudice is
having a negative attitude toward people who are not born in the United States. Although people holding this
prejudiced attitude do not know all people who were not born in the United States, they dislike them due to
their status as foreigners.

Can you think of a prejudiced attitude you have held toward a group of people? How did your prejudice
develop? Prejudice often begins in the form of a stereotype--that is, a specific belief or assumption about
individuals based solely on their membership in a group, regardless of their individual characteristics.
Stereotypes become overgeneralized and applied to all members of a group. For example, someone holding
prejudiced attitudes toward older adults, may believe that older adults are slow and incompetent (Cuddy,
Norton, & Fiske, 2005; Nelson, 2004). We cannot possibly know each individual person of advanced age to
know that all older adults are slow and incompetent. Therefore, this negative belief is overgeneralized to all
members of the group, even though many of the individual group members may in fact be spry and intelligent.

Another example of a well-known stereotype involves beliefs about racial differences among athletes. As
Hodge, Burden, Robinson, and Bennett (2008) point out, Black athletes are often believed to be more athletic,
yet less intelligent, than their White counterparts. These beliefs persist despite a number of high profile
examples to the contrary. Sadly, such beliefs often influence how these athletes are treated by others and how
they view themselves and their own capabilities. Whether or not you agree with a stereotype, stereotypes are
generally well-known within a given culture (Devine, 1989).

Sometimes people will act on their prejudiced attitudes toward a group of people, and this behavior is known
as discrimination. Discrimination is negative action toward an individual as a result of one's membership in a
particular group (Allport, 1954; Dovidio & Gaertner, 2004). As a result of holding negative beliefs (stereotypes)
and negative attitudes (prejudice) about a particular group, people often treat the target of prejudice poorly,
such as excluding older adults from their circle of friends. In this way, discrimination is a form of oppression.
An example of a psychologist experiencing gender discrimination is found in the life and studies of Mary
Whiton Calkins. Calkins was given special permission to attend graduate seminars at Harvard (at that time in
the late 1880s, Harvard did not accept women) and at one point was the sole student of the famous
psychologist William James. She passed all the requirements needed for a PhD and was described by
psychologist Hugo Münsterberg as "one of the strongest professors of psychology in this country." However,
Harvard refused to grant Calkins a PhD because she was a woman (Harvard University, 2019). Table 12.3

discrimination? If so, how did this negative treatment make you feel?

TABLE 12.3

So far, we've discussed stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination as negative thoughts, feelings, and
behaviors because these are typically the most problematic. However, it is important to also point out that
people can hold positive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors toward individuals based on group membership; for
example, they would show preferential treatment for people who are like themselves--that is, who share the
same gender, race, or favorite sports team.

     LINK TO LEARNING

Watch this video of a social experiment conducted in a park (http://openstax.org/l/racismexp) that
demonstrates the concepts of prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination. In the video, three people try to steal
a bike out in the open. The race and gender of the thief is varied: a White male teenager, a Black male teenager,
and a White female. Does anyone try to stop them? The treatment of the teenagers in the video demonstrates
the concept of racism.

Prejudice and Discrimination

When we meet strangers we automatically process three pieces of information about them: their race, gender,
and age (Ito & Urland, 2003). Why are these aspects of an unfamiliar person so important? Why don't we
instead notice whether their eyes are friendly, whether they are smiling, their height, the type of clothes they
are wearing? Although these secondary characteristics are important in forming a first impression of a
stranger, the social categories of race, gender, and age provide a wealth of information about an individual.
This information, however, often is based on stereotypes. We may have different expectations of strangers
depending on their race, gender, and age. What stereotypes and prejudices do you hold about people who are
from a race, gender, and age group different from your own?

Racism

Racism is prejudice and discrimination against an individual based solely on one's membership in a specific
racial group (such as toward African Americans, Asian Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, European
Americans). What are some stereotypes of various racial or ethnic groups? Research suggests cultural
stereotypes for Asian Americans include cold, sly, and intelligent; for Latinos, cold and unintelligent; for

European Americans, cold and intelligent; and for African Americans, aggressive, athletic, and more likely to
be law breakers (Devine & Elliot, 1995; Fiske, Cuddy, Glick, & Xu, 2002; Sommers & Ellsworth, 2000; Dixon &
Linz, 2000).

Racism exists for many racial and ethnic groups. For example, Black people are significantly more likely to
have their vehicles searched during traffic stops than White people, particularly when Black people are driving
in predominately White neighborhoods, a phenomenon often termed "DWB" or "driving while Black" (Rojek,
Rosenfeld, & Decker, 2012).

Mexican Americans and other Latino groups also are targets of racism from the police and other members of
the community. For example, when purchasing items with a personal check, Latino shoppers are more likely
than White shoppers to be asked to show formal identification (Dovidio et al., 2010).

In one case of alleged harassment by the police, several East Haven, Connecticut, police officers were arrested
on federal charges due to reportedly continued harassment and brutalization of Latinos. When the accusations
came out, the mayor of East Haven was asked, "What are you doing for the Latino community today?" The
Mayor responded, "I might have tacos when I go home, I'm not quite sure yet" ("East Haven Mayor," 2012). This
statement undermines the important issue of racial profiling and police harassment of Latinos, while belittling
Latino culture by emphasizing an interest in a food product stereotypically associated with Latinos.

Racism is prevalent toward many other groups in the United States including Native Americans, Arab
Americans, Jewish Americans, and Asian Americans. Have you experienced or witnessed racism toward any of
these racial or ethnic groups? Are you aware of racism in your community?

One reason modern forms of racism, and prejudice in general, are hard to detect is related to the dual attitudes
model (Wilson, Lindsey, & Schooler, 2000). Humans have two forms of attitudes: explicit attitudes, which are
conscious and controllable, and implicit attitudes, which are unconscious and uncontrollable (Devine, 1989;
Olson & Fazio, 2003). Because holding egalitarian views is socially desirable (Plant & Devine, 1998), most
people do not show extreme racial bias or other prejudices on measures of their explicit attitudes. However,
measures of implicit attitudes often show evidence of mild to strong racial bias or other prejudices (Greenwald,
McGee, & Schwartz, 1998; Olson & Fazio, 2003).

Sexism

Sexism is prejudice and discrimination toward individuals based on their sex. Typically, sexism takes the form
of men holding biases against women, but anyone can show sexism toward their own or the other sex. Like
racism, sexism may be subtle and difficult to detect. Common forms of sexism in modern society include
gender role expectations, such as expecting women to be the caretakers of the household. Sexism also includes
people's expectations for how members of a gender group should behave. For example, women are expected to
be friendly, passive, and nurturing, and when women behave in an unfriendly, assertive, or neglectful manner
they often are disliked for violating their gender role (Rudman, 1998). Research by Laurie Rudman (1998) finds
that when female job applicants self-promote, they are likely to be viewed as competent, but they may be
disliked and are less likely to be hired because they violated gender expectations for modesty. In this way,
women are sometimes blamed for wage and employment inequality, but they would be viewed negatively for
trying to overcome them, a phenomenon sometimes referred to as the double bind. Sexism can exist on a
societal level such as in hiring, employment opportunities, and education. Women are less likely to be hired or
promoted in male-dominated professions such as engineering, aviation, and construction (Figure 12.22) (Blau,
Ferber, & Winkler, 2010; Ceci & Williams, 2011). Have you ever experienced or witnessed sexism? Think about
your family members' jobs or careers. Why do you think there are differences in the jobs women and men
have, such as more women nurses but more male surgeons (Betz, 2008)?

       Ageism
       People often form judgments and hold expectations about people based on their age. These judgments and
       expectations can lead to ageism, or prejudice and discrimination toward individuals based solely on their age.
       Think of expectations you hold for older adults. How could someone's expectations influence the feelings they
       hold toward individuals from older age groups? Ageism is widespread in U.S. culture (Nosek, 2005), and a
       common ageist attitude toward older adults is that they are incompetent, physically weak, and slow
       (Greenberg, Schimel, & Martens, 2002) and some people consider older adults less attractive. Chang, Kannoth,
       Levy, Wang, Lee, and Levy (2020) reported on relationships between ageism and health outcomes over a
       40-year-plus period from countries around the world. Across 11 health domains, people over 50 were likely to
       experience ageism most often in the form of being denied access to health services and work opportunities.
       Some cultures, however, including some Asian, Latino, and African American cultures, both outside and within
       the United States afford older adults respect and honor.
       Typically, ageism occurs against older adults, but ageism also can occur toward younger adults. What
       expectations do you hold toward younger people? Does society expect younger adults to be immature and
       irresponsible? Are younger generations seen as having it too easy or having weaker characters than older
       generations? Raymer, Reed, Spiegel, and Purvanova (2017) examined ageism against younger workers. They
       found that older workers endorsed negative stereotypes of younger workers, believing that they had more work
       deficit characteristics (including perceptions of incompetence). How might these forms of ageism affect a
       younger and older adult who are applying for a sales clerk position?
       Homophobia and Transphobia
       Another form of prejudice is homophobia: an umbrella term referring to prejudice and discrimination of
       individuals based solely on their sexual orientation, which is often applied to bisexual, lesbian, gay, and other
       non-heterosexual people. Transphobia is the hatred or fear of those who are perceived to break or blur
       stereotypical gender roles, often expressed as stereotyping, discrimination, harassment and/or violence. Like
       ageism, homophobia is a widespread prejudice in U.S. society that is tolerated by many people (Herek &
       McLemore, 2013; Nosek, 2005). Negative feelings often result in discrimination, such as the exclusion of
       lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) people from social groups and the avoidance of
       LGBTQ+ neighbors and co-workers. This discrimination also extends to employers deliberately declining to
       hire qualified LGBTQ+ job applicants, a practice officially outlawed by a 2020 Surpreme Court decision but
       which remains a significant issue. Have you experienced or witnessed homophobia? If so, what stereotypes,
       prejudiced attitudes, and discrimination were evident?

 Research into Homophobia

  Some people are quite passionate in their hatred for nonheterosexuals in our society. In some cases, people
  have been tortured and/or murdered simply because they were not straight. This passionate response has led
  some researchers to question what motives might exist for homophobic people. Adams, Wright, & Lohr (1996)
  conducted a study investigating this issue and their results were quite an eye-opener.

  In this experiment, male college students were given a scale that assessed how homophobic they were; those
  with extreme scores were recruited to participate in the experiment. In the end, 64 men agreed to participate
  and were split into 2 groups: homophobic men and nonhomophobic men. Both groups of men were fitted with a
  penile plethysmograph, an instrument that measures changes in blood flow to the penis and serves as an
  objective measurement of sexual arousal.

  All men were shown segments of sexually explicit videos. One of these videos involved a sexual interaction
  between a man and a woman (straight clip). One video displayed two females engaged in a sexual interaction
  (lesbian clip), and the final video displayed two men engaged in a sexual interaction (gay clip). Changes in penile
  tumescence (a measure of physiological genital arousal) were recorded during all three clips, and a subjective
  measurement of sexual arousal was also obtained. While both groups of men became sexually aroused to the
  straight and lesbian video clips, only those men who were identified as homophobic showed sexual arousal to
  the gay male video clip. While all men reported that their erections indicated arousal for the straight and lesbian
  clips, the homophobic men indicated that they were not sexually aroused (despite their erections) to the gay
  clips. Adams et al. (1996) suggest that these findings may indicate that homophobia is related to gay arousal that
  the homophobic individuals either deny or are unaware.

Why Do Prejudice and Discrimination Exist?

Prejudice and discrimination persist in society due to social learning and conformity to social norms. Children
learn prejudiced attitudes and beliefs from society: their parents, teachers, friends, the media, and other
sources of socialization, such as social media (O'Keeffe & Clarke-Pearson, 2011). If certain types of prejudice
and discrimination are acceptable in a society, there may be normative pressures to conform and share those
prejudiced beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. For example, public and private schools are still somewhat
segregated by social class. Historically, only children from wealthy families could afford to attend private
schools, whereas children from middle- and low-income families typically attended public schools. If a child
from a low-income family received a merit scholarship to attend a private school, how might the child be
treated by classmates? Can you recall a time when you held prejudiced attitudes or beliefs or acted in a
discriminatory manner because your group of friends expected you to?

Stereotypes and Self-Fulfilling Prophecy

When we hold a stereotype about a person, we have expectations that they will fulfill that stereotype. A self-
fulfilling prophecy is an expectation held by a person that alters their behavior in a way that tends to make it
true. When we hold stereotypes about a person, we tend to treat the person according to our expectations. This
treatment can influence the person to act according to our stereotypic expectations, thus confirming our
stereotypic beliefs. Research by Rosenthal and Jacobson (1968) found that disadvantaged students whose
teachers expected them to perform well had higher grades than disadvantaged students whose teachers
expected them to do poorly.

Consider this example of cause and effect in a self-fulfilling prophecy: If an employer expects an openly gay job
applicant to be incompetent, the potential employer might treat the applicant negatively during the interview
by engaging in less conversation, making little eye contact, and generally behaving coldly toward the applicant
428 12 · Social Psychology

       (Hebl, Foster, Mannix, & Dovidio, 2002). In turn, the job applicant will perceive that the potential employer
       dislikes him, and he will respond by giving shorter responses to interview questions, making less eye contact,
       and generally disengaging from the interview. After the interview, the employer will reflect on the applicant's
       behavior, which seemed cold and distant, and the employer will conclude, based on the applicant's poor
       performance during the interview, that the applicant was in fact incompetent. Thus, the employer's
       stereotype--gay people are incompetent and do not make good employees--is reinforced. Do you think this job
       applicant is likely to be hired? Treating individuals according to stereotypic beliefs can lead to prejudice and
       discrimination.
       Another dynamic that can reinforce stereotypes is confirmation bias. When interacting with the target of our
       prejudice, we tend to pay attention to information that is consistent with our stereotypic expectations and
       ignore information that is inconsistent with our expectations. In this process, known as confirmation bias, we
       seek out information that supports our stereotypes and ignore information that is inconsistent with our
       stereotypes (Wason & Johnson-Laird, 1972). In the job interview example, the employer may not have noticed
       that the job applicant was friendly and engaging, and that he provided competent responses to the interview
       questions in the beginning of the interview. Instead, the employer focused on the job applicant's performance
       in the later part of the interview, after the applicant changed his demeanor and behavior to match the
       interviewer's negative treatment. Have you ever fallen prey to the self-fulfilling prophecy or confirmation bias,
       either as the source or target of such bias? How might we stop the cycle of the self-fulfilling prophecy?

      In-Groups and Out-Groups

       As discussed previously in this section, we all belong to a gender, race, age, and social economic group. These
       groups provide a powerful source of our identity and self-esteem (Tajfel & Turner, 1979). These groups serve as
       our in-groups. An in-group is a group that we identify with or see ourselves as belonging to. A group that we
       don't belong to, or an out-group, is a group that we view as fundamentally different from us. For example, if
       you are a woman, your gender in-group includes all women, and your gender out-group includes all men
       (Figure 12.23). People often view gender groups as being fundamentally different from each other in
       personality traits, characteristics, social roles, and interests. Because we often feel a strong sense of belonging
       and emotional connection to our in-groups, we develop in-group bias: a preference for our own group over
       other groups. This in-group bias can result in prejudice and discrimination because the out-group is
       perceived as different and is less preferred than our in-group.

       FIGURE 12.23 These children are very young, but they are already aware of their gender in-group and out-group.

       Despite the group dynamics that seem only to push groups toward conflict, there are forces that promote
       reconciliation between groups: the expression of empathy, of acknowledgment of past suffering on both sides,
       and the halt of destructive behaviors.

One function of prejudice is to help us feel good about ourselves and maintain a positive self-concept. This
need to feel good about ourselves extends to our in-groups: We want to feel good and protect our in-groups. We
seek to resolve threats individually and at the in-group level. This often happens by blaming an out-group for
the problem. Scapegoating is the act of blaming an out-group when the in-group experiences frustration or is
blocked from obtaining a goal (Allport, 1954).

12.6 Aggression

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Define aggression
  · Define cyberbullying
  · Describe the bystander effect

Throughout this chapter we have discussed how people interact and influence one another's thoughts,
feelings, and behaviors in both positive and negative ways. People can work together to achieve great things,
such as helping each other in difficult times: consider how educators and healthcare workers went to great
lengths to help others during the COVID-19 pandemic. People also can do great harm to one another, such as
conforming to group norms that are immoral and obeying authority to the point of murder: consider the mass
conformity of Nazis during WWII. In this section we will discuss a negative side of human
behavior--aggression.

A number of researchers have explored ways to reduce prejudice. One of the earliest was a study by Sherif et al.
(1961) known as the Robbers Cave experiment. They found that when two opposing groups at a camp worked
together toward a common goal, prejudicial attitudes between the groups decreased (Gaertner, Dovidio,
Banker, Houlette, Johnson, & McGlynn, 2000). Focusing on superordinate goals was the key to attitude change
in the research. Another study examined the jigsaw classroom, a technique designed by Aronson and
Bridgeman in an effort to increase success in desegregated classrooms. In this technique, students work on an
assignment in groups inclusive of various races and abilities. They are assigned tasks within their group, then
collaborate with peers from other groups who were assigned the same task, and then report back to their
original group. Walker and Crogan (1998) noted that the jigsaw classroom reduced potential for prejudice in
Australia, as diverse students worked together on projects needing all of the pieces to succeed. This research
suggests that anything that can allow individuals to work together toward common goals can decrease
prejudicial attitudes. Obviously, the application of such strategies in real-world settings would enhance
opportunities for conflict resolution.

Aggression

Humans engage in aggression when they seek to cause harm or pain to another person. Aggression takes two
forms depending on one's motives: hostile or instrumental. Hostile aggression is motivated by feelings of
anger with intent to cause pain; a fight in a bar with a stranger is an example of hostile aggression. In contrast,
instrumental aggression is motivated by achieving a goal and does not necessarily involve intent to cause
pain (Berkowitz, 1993); a contract killer who murders for hire displays instrumental aggression.

There are many different theories as to why aggression exists. Some researchers argue that aggression serves
an evolutionary function (Buss, 2004). Men are more likely than women to show aggression (Wilson & Daly,
1985). From the perspective of evolutionary psychology, human male aggression, like that in nonhuman
primates, likely serves to display dominance over other males, both to protect a mate and to perpetuate the
male's genes (Figure 12.24). Sexual jealousy is part of male aggression; males endeavor to make sure their
mates are not copulating with other males, thus ensuring their own paternity of the female's offspring.
Although aggression provides an obvious evolutionary advantage for men, women also engage in aggression.
Women typically display more indirect forms of aggression, with their aggression serving as a means to an end
(Dodge & Schwartz, 1997). For example, women may express their aggression covertly by communication that
430 12 · Social Psychology

       impairs the social standing of another person. Another theory that explains one of the functions of human
       aggression is frustration aggression theory (Dollard, Doob, Miller, Mowrer, & Sears, 1939). This theory states
       that when humans are prevented from achieving an important goal, they become frustrated and aggressive.

       FIGURE 12.24 Human males and nonhuman male primates endeavor to gain and display dominance over other
       males, as demonstrated in the behavior of these monkeys. (credit: "Arcadius"/Flickr)
       Bullying
       Another form of aggression is bullying. As you learn in your study of child development, socializing and
       playing with other children is beneficial for children's psychological development. However, as you may have
       experienced as a child, not all play behavior has positive outcomes. Some children are aggressive and want to
       play roughly. Other children are selfish and do not want to share toys. One form of negative social interactions
       among children that has become a national concern is bullying. Bullying is repeated negative treatment of
       another person, often an adolescent, over time (Olweus, 1993). A one-time incident in which one child hits
       another child on the playground would not be considered bullying: Bullying is repeated behavior. The negative
       treatment typical in bullying is the attempt to inflict harm, injury, or humiliation, and bullying can include
       physical or verbal attacks. However, bullying doesn't have to be physical or verbal, it can be psychological.
       Research finds gender differences in how girls and boys bully others (American Psychological Association,
       2010; Olweus, 1993). Boys tend to engage in direct, physical aggression such as physically harming others.
       Girls tend to engage in indirect, social forms of aggression such as spreading rumors, ignoring, or socially
       isolating others. Based on what you have learned about child development and social roles, why do you think
       boys and girls display different types of bullying behavior?
       Bullying involves three parties: the bully, the victim, and witnesses or bystanders. The act of bullying involves
       an imbalance of power with the bully holding more power--physically, emotionally, and/or socially over the
       victim. The experience of bullying can be positive for the bully, who may enjoy a boost to self-esteem. However,
       there are several negative consequences of bullying for the victim, and also for the bystanders. How do you
       think bullying negatively impacts adolescents? Being the victim of bullying is associated with decreased
       mental health, including experiencing anxiety and depression (APA, 2010). Victims of bullying may
       underperform in schoolwork (Bowen, 2011). Bullying also can result in the victim dying by suicide (APA,
       2010). How might bullying negatively affect witnesses?
       Although there is not one single personality profile for who becomes a bully and who becomes a victim of
       bullying (APA, 2010), researchers have identified some patterns in children who are at a greater risk of being
       bullied (Olweus, 1993):

         · Children who are emotionally reactive are at a greater risk for being bullied. Bullies may be attracted to
             children who get upset easily because the bully can quickly get an emotional reaction from them.

         · Children who are different from others are likely to be targeted for bullying. Children who are overweight,
             cognitively impaired, or racially or ethnically different from their peer group may be at higher risk.

         · Gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender teens are at very high risk of being bullied and hurt due to their
             sexual orientation.

Cyberbullying

With widely available mobile technology and social networking media, a new form of bullying has emerged:
cyberbullying. Cyberbullying, like bullying, is repeated behavior that is intended to cause psychological or
emotional harm to another person. What is unique about cyberbullying is that it is typically covert, concealed,
done in private, and the bully can remain anonymous. This anonymity gives the bully power, and the victim
may feel helpless, unable to escape the harassment, and unable to retaliate (Spears, Slee, Owens, & Johnson,
2009). About one in three middle and high school students report that they have experienced cyberbullying
(Patchin, 2016; Patchin, 2019), with some studies indicating that nearly three in five teens have experienced
some type of online abusive behavior such as non-repeated name-calling or being sent unsolicited links or
images (Anderson, 2018).
Cyberbullying can take many forms, including harassing a victim by spreading rumors, creating a website
defaming the victim, threatening the victim, or teasing the victim (Spears et al., 2009). Overall, LGBTQ youth
are targeted at a higher rate than heterosexual and cisgender youth, and members of minority populations
overall are more likely to be cyberbullying victims (Hinjuda & Patchin, 2020). In terms of gender, experiences
vary in terms of both the prevelance and types of cyberbullying experienced and perpetrated. In cyberbullying,
it is more common for girls to be the bullies and victims. Interestingly, girls who become cyberbullies often
have been the victims of cyberbullying at one time (Vandebosch & Van Cleemput, 2009). Girls were more likely
to say someone spread rumors about them online while boys were more likely to say that someone threatened
to hurt them online (Patchin, 2019). The effects of cyberbullying are just as harmful as traditional bullying and
include the victim feeling frustration, anger, sadness, helplessness, powerlessness, and fear. Victims will also
experience lower self-esteem (Hoff & Mitchell, 2009; Spears et al., 2009). Furthermore, recent research
suggests that both cyberbullying victims and perpetrators are more likely to experience suicidal ideation, and
they are more likely to attempt suicide than individuals who have no experience with cyberbullying (John,
2019). Cyberbullying is a form of aggression and, depending on the messages and methods, can be considered
harassment, stalking, or assault--all subject to prosecution. Finally, while much of the concern and research
regarding cyberbullying centers on adolescents, adults (particularly college students) are frequent victims and
perpetrators. What features of technology make cyberbullying easier and perhaps more accessible to young
adults? What can parents, teachers, and social networking websites do to prevent cyberbullying?

FIGURE 12.25 Cyberbullying can create a feeling of powerlessness and inescapability because victimization is not
constrained to physical locations. Many victims report being harassed across multiple platforms or formats at the
same time. (credit: Steven Depolo)

The Bystander Effect

The discussion of bullying highlights the problem of witnesses not intervening to help a victim. Researchers
Latané and Darley (1968) described a phenomenon called the bystander effect. The bystander effect is a
phenomenon in which a witness or bystander does not volunteer to help a victim or person in distress. Instead,
they just watch what is happening. Social psychologists hold that we make these decisions based on the social
situation, not our own personality variables. The impetus behind the bystander effect was the murder of a
young woman named Kitty Genovese in 1964. The story of her tragic death took on a life of its own when it was
reported that none of her neighbors helped her or called the police when she was being attacked. However,
432 12 · Social Psychology

       Kassin (2017) noted that her killer was apprehended due to neighbors who called the police when they saw
       him committing a burglary days later. Not only did bystanders indeed intervene in her murder (one man who
       shouted at the killer, a woman who said she called the police, and a friend who comforted her in her last
       moments), but other bystanders intervened in the capture of the murderer. Social psychologists claim that
       diffusion of responsibility is the likely explanation. Diffusion of responsibility is the tendency for no one in a
       group to help because the responsibility to help is spread throughout the group (Bandura, 1999). Because
       there were many witnesses to the attack on Genovese, as evidenced by the number of lit apartment windows in
       the building, individuals assumed someone else must have already called the police. The responsibility to call
       the police was diffused across the number of witnesses to the crime. Have you ever passed an accident on the
       freeway and assumed that a victim or certainly another motorist has already reported the accident? In general,
       the greater the number of bystanders, the less likely any one person will help.

     12.7 Prosocial Behavior

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe altruism
         · Describe conditions that influence the formation of relationships
         · Identify what attracts people to each other
         · Describe the triangular theory of love
         · Explain social exchange theory in relationships
       You've learned about many of the negative behaviors of social psychology, but the field also studies many
       positive social interactions and behaviors. What makes people like each other? With whom are we friends?
       Whom do we date? Researchers have documented several features of the situation that influence whether we
       form relationships with others. There are also universal traits that humans find attractive in others. In this
       section we discuss conditions that make forming relationships more likely, what we look for in friendships and
       romantic relationships, the different types of love, and a theory explaining how our relationships are formed,
       maintained, and terminated.

      Prosocial Behavior and Altruism

       Do you voluntarily help others? Voluntary behavior with the intent to help other people is called prosocial
       behavior. Why do people help other people? Is personal benefit such as feeling good about oneself the only
       reason people help one another? Research suggests there are many other reasons. Altruism is people's desire
       to help others even if the costs outweigh the benefits of helping. In fact, people acting in altruistic ways may
       disregard the personal costs associated with helping (Figure 12.26). For example, news accounts of the 9/11
       terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York reported an employee in the first tower helped his co-
       workers make it to the exit stairwell. After helping a co-worker to safety he went back in the burning building
       to help additional co-workers. In this case the costs of helping were great, and the hero lost his life in the
       destruction (Stewart, 2002).

FIGURE 12.26 The events of 9/11 unleashed an enormous show of altruism and heroism on the parts of first
responders and many ordinary people. (credit: Don Halasy)
Some researchers suggest that altruism operates on empathy. Empathy is the capacity to understand another
person's perspective, to feel what they feel. An empathetic person makes an emotional connection with others
and feels compelled to help (Batson, 1991). Other researchers argue that altruism is a form of selfless helping
that is not motivated by benefits or feeling good about oneself. Certainly, after helping, people feel good about
themselves, but some researchers argue that this is a consequence of altruism, not a cause. Other researchers
argue that helping is always self-serving because our egos are involved, and we receive benefits from helping
(Cialdini, Brown, Lewis, Luce, & Neuberg 1997). It is challenging to determine experimentally the true
motivation for helping, whether it is largely self-serving (egoism) or selfless (altruism). Thus, a debate on
whether pure altruism exists continues.

Forming Relationships

What do you think is the single most influential factor in determining with whom you become friends and
whom you form romantic relationships? You might be surprised to learn that the answer is simple: the people
with whom you have the most contact. This most important factor is proximity. You are more likely to be
friends with people you have regular contact with. For example, there are decades of research that shows that
you are more likely to become friends with people who live in your dorm, your apartment building, or your
immediate neighborhood than with people who live farther away (Festinger, Schachler, & Back, 1950). It is
simply easier to form relationships with people you see often because you have the opportunity to get to know
them.
Similarity is another factor that influences who we form relationships with. We are more likely to become
friends or lovers with someone who is similar to us in background, attitudes, and lifestyle. In fact, there is no
evidence that opposites attract. Rather, we are attracted to people who are most like us (Figure 12.27)
(McPherson, Smith-Lovin, & Cook, 2001). Why do you think we are attracted to people who are similar to us?
Sharing things in common will certainly make it easy to get along with others and form connections. When you
and another person share similar music taste, hobbies, food preferences, and so on, deciding what to do with
your time together might be easy. Homophily is the tendency for people to form social networks, including
friendships, marriage, business relationships, and many other types of relationships, with others who are
434 12 · Social Psychology

       similar (McPherson et al., 2001).

       FIGURE 12.27 People tend to be attracted to similar people. Many couples share a cultural background. This can be
       quite obvious in a ceremony such as a wedding, and more subtle (but no less significant) in the day-to-day workings
       of a relationship. (credit: modification of work by Shiraz Chanawala)
       But, homophily limits our exposure to diversity (McPherson et al., 2001). By forming relationships only with
       people who are similar to us, we will have homogenous groups and will not be exposed to different points of
       view. In other words, because we are likely to spend time with those who are most like ourselves, we will have
       limited exposure to those who are different than ourselves, including people of different races, ethnicities,
       social-economic status, and life situations.
       Once we form relationships with people, we desire reciprocity. Reciprocity is the give and take in
       relationships. We contribute to relationships, but we expect to receive benefits as well. That is, we want our
       relationships to be a two way street. We are more likely to like and engage with people who like us back. Self-
       disclosure is part of the two way street. Self-disclosure is the sharing of personal information (Laurenceau,
       Barrett, & Pietromonaco, 1998). We form more intimate connections with people with whom we disclose
       important information about ourselves. Indeed, self-disclosure is a characteristic of healthy intimate
       relationships, as long as the information disclosed is consistent with our own views (Cozby, 1973).

      Attraction

       We have discussed how proximity and similarity lead to the formation of relationships, and that reciprocity
       and self-disclosure are important for relationship maintenance. But, what features of a person do we find
       attractive? We don't form relationships with everyone that lives or works near us, so how is it that we decide
       which specific individuals we will select as friends and lovers?
       Researchers have documented several characteristics that humans find attractive. First we look for friends and
       lovers who are physically attractive. People differ in what they consider attractive, and attractiveness is
       culturally influenced. Research, however, suggests that some universally attractive features in women include
       large eyes, high cheekbones, a narrow jaw line, a slender build (Buss, 1989), and a lower waist-to-hip ratio
       (Singh, 1993). For men, attractive traits include being tall, having broad shoulders, and a narrow waist (Buss,
       1989). Both men and women with high levels of facial and body symmetry are generally considered more
       attractive than asymmetric individuals (Fink, Neave, Manning, & Grammer, 2006; Penton-Voak et al., 2001;
       Rikowski & Grammer, 1999). Social traits that people find attractive in potential female mates include warmth,
       affection, and social skills; in males, the attractive traits include achievement, leadership qualities, and job
       skills (Regan & Berscheid, 1997). Although humans want mates who are physically attractive, this does not
       mean that we look for the most attractive person possible. In fact, this observation has led some to propose
       what is known as the matching hypothesis which asserts that people tend to pick someone they view as their
       equal in physical attractiveness and social desirability (Taylor, Fiore, Mendelsohn, & Cheshire, 2011). For
       example, you and most people you know likely would say that a very attractive movie star is out of your league.

So, even if you had proximity to that person, you likely would not ask them out on a date because you believe
you likely would be rejected. People weigh a potential partner's attractiveness against the likelihood of success
with that person. If you think you are particularly unattractive (even if you are not), you likely will seek
partners that are fairly unattractive (that is, unattractive in physical appearance or in behavior).

Sternberg's Triangular Theory of Love

We typically love the people with whom we form relationships, but the type of love we have for our family,
friends, and lovers differs. Robert Sternberg (1986) proposed that there are three components of love:
intimacy, passion, and commitment. These three components form a triangle that defines multiple types of
love: this is known as Sternberg's triangular theory of love (Figure 12.28). Intimacy is the sharing of details
and intimate thoughts and emotions. Passion is the physical attraction--the flame in the fire. Commitment is
standing by the person--the "in sickness and health" part of the relationship.

FIGURE 12.28 According to Sternberg's triangular theory of love, seven types of love can be described from
combinations of three components: intimacy, passion, and commitment. (credit: modification of work by
"Lnesa"/Wikimedia Commons)
Sternberg (1986) states that a healthy relationship will have all three components of love--intimacy, passion,
and commitment--which is described as consummate love (Figure 12.29). However, different aspects of love
might be more prevalent at different life stages. Other forms of love include liking, which is defined as having
intimacy but no passion or commitment. Infatuation is the presence of passion without intimacy or
commitment. Empty love is having commitment without intimacy or passion. Companionate love, which is
characteristic of close friendships and family relationships, consists of intimacy and commitment but no
passion. Romantic love is defined by having passion and intimacy, but no commitment. Finally, fatuous love is
defined by having passion and commitment, but no intimacy, such as a long term sexual love affair. Can you
describe other examples of relationships that fit these different types of love?

      Social Exchange Theory

       We have discussed why we form relationships, what attracts us to others, and different types of love. But what
       determines whether we are satisfied with and stay in a relationship? One theory that provides an explanation
       is social exchange theory. According to social exchange theory, we act as naïve economists in keeping a tally
       of the ratio of costs and benefits of forming and maintaining a relationship with others (Figure 12.30) (Rusbult
       & Van Lange, 2003).

       FIGURE 12.30 Acting like naïve economists, people may keep track of the costs and benefits of maintaining a
       relationship. Typically, only those relationships in which the benefits outweigh the costs will be maintained.
       People are motivated to maximize the benefits of social exchanges, or relationships, and minimize the costs.
       People prefer to have more benefits than costs, or to have nearly equal costs and benefits, but most people are
       dissatisfied if their social exchanges create more costs than benefits. Let's discuss an example. If you have ever
       decided to commit to a romantic relationship, you probably considered the advantages and disadvantages of
       your decision. What are the benefits of being in a committed romantic relationship? You may have considered
       having companionship, intimacy, and passion, but also being comfortable with a person you know well. What
       are the costs of being in a committed romantic relationship? You may think that over time boredom from being
       with only one person may set in; moreover, it may be expensive to share activities such as attending movies
       and going to dinner. However, the benefits of dating your romantic partner presumably outweigh the costs, or
       you wouldn't continue the relationship.

Summary

12.1 What Is Social Psychology?

Social psychology is the subfield of psychology that studies the power of the situation to influence individuals'
thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Psychologists categorize the causes of human behavior as those due to
internal factors, such as personality, or those due to external factors, such as cultural and other social
influences. Behavior is better explained, however, by using both approaches. Lay people tend to over-rely on
dispositional explanations for behavior and ignore the power of situational influences, a perspective called the
fundamental attribution error. People from individualistic cultures are more likely to display this bias versus
people from collectivistic cultures. Our explanations for our own and others behaviors can be biased due to not
having enough information about others' motivations for behaviors and by providing explanations that bolster
our self-esteem.

12.2 Self-presentation

Human behavior is largely influenced by our social roles, norms, and scripts. In order to know how to act in a
given situation, we have shared cultural knowledge of how to behave depending on our role in society. Social
norms dictate the behavior that is appropriate or inappropriate for each role. Each social role has scripts that
help humans learn the sequence of appropriate behaviors in a given setting. The famous Stanford prison
experiment is an example of how the power of the situation can dictate the social roles, norms, and scripts we
follow in a given situation, even if this behavior is contrary to our typical behavior.

12.3 Attitudes and Persuasion

Attitudes are our evaluations or feelings toward a person, idea, or object and typically are positive or negative.
Our attitudes and beliefs are influenced not only by external forces, but also by internal influences that we
control. An internal form of attitude change is cognitive dissonance or the tension we experience when our
thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are in conflict. In order to reduce dissonance, individuals can change their
behavior, attitudes, or cognitions, or add a new cognition. External forces of persuasion include advertising;
the features of advertising that influence our behaviors include the source, message, and audience. There are
two primary routes to persuasion. The central route to persuasion uses facts and information to persuade
potential consumers. The peripheral route uses positive association with cues such as beauty, fame, and
positive emotions.

12.4 Conformity, Compliance, and Obedience

The power of the situation can lead people to conform, or go along with the group, even in the face of
inaccurate information. Conformity to group norms is driven by two motivations, the desire to fit in and be
liked and the desire to be accurate and gain information from the group. Authority figures also have influence
over our behaviors, and many people become obedient and follow orders even if the orders are contrary to
their personal values. Conformity to group pressures can also result in groupthink, or the faulty decision-
making process that results from cohesive group members trying to maintain group harmony. Group
situations can improve human behavior through facilitating performance on easy tasks, but inhibiting
performance on difficult tasks. The presence of others can also lead to social loafing when individual efforts
cannot be evaluated.

12.5 Prejudice and Discrimination

As diverse individuals, humans can experience conflict when interacting with people who are different from
each other. Prejudice, or negative feelings and evaluations, is common when people are from a different social
group (i.e., out-group). Negative attitudes toward out-groups can lead to discrimination. Prejudice and
discrimination against others can be based on gender, race, ethnicity, social class, sexual orientation, or a
variety of other social identities. In-group's who feel threatened may blame the out-groups for their plight, thus
using the out-group as a scapegoat for their frustration.

12.6 Aggression

Aggression is seeking to cause another person harm or pain. Hostile aggression is motivated by feelings of
anger with intent to cause pain, and instrumental aggression is motivated by achieving a goal and does not
necessarily involve intent to cause pain Bullying is an international public health concern that largely affects
the adolescent population. Bullying is repeated behaviors that are intended to inflict harm on the victim and
can take the form of physical, psychological, emotional, or social abuse. Bullying has negative mental health
consequences for youth including suicide. Cyberbullying is a newer form of bullying that takes place in an
online environment where bullies can remain anonymous and victims are helpless to address the harassment.
Despite the social norm of helping others in need, when there are many bystanders witnessing an emergency,
diffusion of responsibility will lead to a lower likelihood of any one person helping.

12.7 Prosocial Behavior

Altruism is a pure form of helping others out of empathy, which can be contrasted with egoistic motivations for
helping. Forming relationships with others is a necessity for social beings. We typically form relationships with
people who are close to us in proximity and people with whom we share similarities. We expect reciprocity and
self-disclosure in our relationships. We also want to form relationships with people who are physically
attractive, though standards for attractiveness vary by culture and gender. There are many types of love that
are determined by various combinations of intimacy, passion, and commitment; consummate love, which is
the ideal form of love, contains all three components. When determining satisfaction and whether to maintain
a relationship, individuals often use a social exchange approach and weigh the costs and benefits of forming
and maintaining a relationship.

Personal Application Questions

43. Provide a personal example of an experience in which your behavior was influenced by the power of the
      situation.

44. Think of an example in the media of a sports figure--player or coach--who gives a self-serving attribution
      for winning or losing. Examples might include accusing the referee of incorrect calls, in the case of losing,
      or citing their own hard work and talent, in the case of winning.

45. Try attending a religious service very different from your own and see how you feel and behave without
      knowing the appropriate script. Or, try attending an important, personal event that you have never
      attended before, such as a bar mitzvah (a coming-of-age ritual in Jewish culture), a quinceañera (in some
      Latin American cultures a party is given to a girl who is turning 15 years old), a wedding, a funeral, or a
      sporting event new to you, such as horse racing or bull riding. Observe and record your feelings and
      behaviors in this unfamiliar setting for which you lack the appropriate script. Do you silently observe the
      action, or do you ask another person for help interpreting the behaviors of people at the event? Describe in
      what ways your behavior would change if you were to attend a similar event in the future?

CHAPTER OUTLINE

13.1 What Is Industrial and Organizational Psychology?
13.2 Industrial Psychology: Selecting and Evaluating Employees
13.3 Organizational Psychology: The Social Dimension of Work
13.4 Human Factors Psychology and Workplace Design

INTRODUCTION In October 2019, Social Security Administration Commissioner Andrew Saul announced that
the Social Security Administration would end a telework program it began 6 years previous serving
approximately 12,000 of its employees. Then-Deputy Commissioner Grace Kim wrote a letter to Social Security
employees explaining the reasons the program was ending and cited an increased workload and a backlog of
cases as reasons for ending the pilot program. This change in the telework policy came on the heels of a
negotiation between the American Federal Government Employee Union and the Social Security
Administration, a negotiation that had to be brokered by the Federal Services Impasse Panel (a third-party
federal organization developed specifically to arbitrate in situations where negotiations between union
officials and federal organizations break down and progress halts between the organization and the union
representatives) (Wagner, 2019a).
The May 2019 decision by the panel gave Social Security Agency managers the ability to limit or restrict
telework for employees using their discretion to ensure that all tasks were being completed and wait times
were normal. One of the biggest reasons cited for this was that the organization was able to provide evidence
that after the implementation of a telework program, the average wait time for individuals temporarily
increased, causing a backlog of work to be completed at a later date. Although the Social Security
Administration pushed the official end date for all telework in the agency to March of 2020, the program was
officially ended. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress requested a review of the telework policy
and raised questions about whether it should be revived to serve as a preventative measure for reducing and
slowing the spread of the virus (Wagner, 2019b). Could this allow employees to continue working while not
coming to the workplace in order to help prevent the spread of illness? What were the benefits versus the costs
of implementing a telework policy again for employees as the spread of the virus continued? What did
previous research show related to the positive and negative benefits to the organization and the employees
with respect to telework?

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Understand the scope of study in the field of industrial and organizational psychology
         · Describe the history of industrial and organizational psychology
       In 2019, people who worked in the United States spent an average of about 42-54 hours per week working
       (Bureau of Labor Statistics--U.S. Department of Labor, 2019). Sleeping was the only other activity they spent
       more time on with an average of about 43-62 hours per week. The workday is a significant portion of workers'
       time and energy. It impacts their lives and their family's lives in positive and negative physical and
       psychological ways. Industrial and organizational (I-O) psychology is a branch of psychology that studies
       how human behavior and psychology affect work and how they are affected by work.
       Industrial and organizational psychologists work in four main contexts: academia, government, consulting
       firms, and business. Most I-O psychologists have a master's or doctorate degree. The field of I-O psychology can
       be divided into three broad areas (Figure 13.2 and Figure 13.3): industrial, organizational, and human factors.
       Industrial psychology is concerned with describing job requirements and assessing individuals for their
       ability to meet those requirements. In addition, once employees are hired, industrial psychology studies and
       develops ways to train, evaluate, and respond to those evaluations. As a consequence of its concern for
       candidate characteristics, industrial psychology must also consider issues of legality regarding discrimination
       in hiring. Organizational psychology is a discipline interested in how the relationships among employees
       affect those employees and the performance of a business. This includes studying worker satisfaction,
       motivation, and commitment. This field also studies management, leadership, and organizational culture, as
       well as how an organization's structures, management and leadership styles, social norms, and role
       expectations affect individual behavior. As a result of its interest in worker wellbeing and relationships,
       organizational psychology also considers the subjects of harassment, including sexual harassment, and
       workplace violence. Human factors psychology is the study of how workers interact with the tools of work and
       how to design those tools to optimize workers' productivity, safety, and health. These studies can involve
       interactions as straightforward as the fit of a desk, chair, and computer to a human having to sit on the chair at
       the desk using the computer for several hours each day. They can also include the examination of how humans
       interact with complex displays and their ability to interpret them accurately and quickly. In Europe, this field is
       referred to as ergonomics.

Occupational health psychology (OHP) deals with the stress, diseases, and disorders that can affect employees
as a result of the workplace. As such, the field is informed by research from the medical, biological,
psychological, organizational, human factors, human resources, and industrial fields. Individuals in this field
seek to examine the ways in which the organization affects the quality of work life for an employee and the
responses that employees have towards their organization or as a result of their organization's influence on
them. The responses for employees are not limited to the workplace as there may be some spillover into their
personal lives outside of work, especially if there is not good work-life balance. The ultimate goal of an
occupational health psychologist is to improve the overall health and well-being of an individual, and, as a
result, increase the overall health of the organization (Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 2020).
In 2009, the field of humanitarian work psychology (HWP) was developed as the brainchild of a small group of
I-O psychologists who met at a conference. Realizing they had a shared set of goals involving helping those who
are underserved and underprivileged, the I-O psychologists formally formed the group in 2012 and have
approximately 300 members worldwide. Although this is a small number, the group continues to expand. The
450 13 · Industrial-Organizational Psychology

group seeks to help marginalized members of society, such as people with low-income, find work. In addition,
they help to determine ways to deliver humanitarian aid during major catastrophes. The Humanitarian Work
Psychology group can also reach out to those in the local community who do not have the knowledge, skills,
and abilities (KSAs) to be able to find gainful employment that would enable them to not need to receive aid. In
both cases, humanitarian work psychologists try to help the underserved individuals develop KSAs that they
can use to improve their lives and their current situations. When ensuring these underserved individuals
receive training or education, the focus is on skills that, once learned, will never be forgotten and can serve
individuals throughout their lifetimes as they seek employment (APA, 2016). Table 13.1 summarizes the main
fields in I-O psychology, their focuses, and jobs within each field.

      The Historical Development of Industrial and Organizational Psychology

       Industrial and organizational psychology had its origins in the early 20th century. Several influential early
       psychologists studied issues that today would be categorized as industrial psychology: James Cattell
       (1860-1944), Hugo Münsterberg (1863-1916), Walter Dill Scott (1869-1955), Robert Yerkes (1876-1956),
       Walter Bingham (1880-1952), and Lillian Gilbreth (1878-1972). Cattell, Münsterberg, and Scott had been
       students of Wilhelm Wundt, the father of experimental psychology. Some of these researchers had been
       involved in work in the area of industrial psychology before World War I. Cattell's contribution to industrial
       psychology is largely reflected in his founding of a psychological consulting company, which is still operating
       today called the Psychological Corporation, and in the accomplishments of students at Columbia in the area of
       industrial psychology. In 1913, Münsterberg published Psychology and Industrial Efficiency, which covered
       topics such as employee selection, employee training, and effective advertising.

       Scott was one of the first psychologists to apply psychology to advertising, management, and personnel
       selection. In 1903, Scott published two books: The Theory of Advertising and Psychology of Advertising. They
       are the first books to describe the use of psychology in the business world. By 1911 he published two more
       books, Influencing Men in Business and Increasing Human Efficiency in Business. In 1916 a newly formed
       division in the Carnegie Institute of Technology hired Scott to conduct applied research on employee selection
       (Katzell & Austin, 1992).

       The focus of all this research was in what we now know as industrial psychology; it was only later in the
       century that the field of organizational psychology developed as an experimental science (Katzell & Austin,
       1992). In addition to their academic positions, these researchers also worked directly for businesses as
       consultants.

       When the United States entered World War I in April 1917, the work of psychologists working in this discipline
       expanded to include their contributions to military efforts. At that time Yerkes was the president of the
       25-year-old American Psychological Association (APA). The APA is a professional association in the United
       States for clinical and research psychologists. Today the APA performs a number of functions including
       holding conferences, accrediting university degree programs, and publishing scientific journals. Yerkes
       organized a group under the Surgeon General's Office (SGO) that developed methods for screening and
       selecting enlisted men. They developed the Army Alpha test to measure mental abilities. The Army Beta test
       was a non-verbal form of the test that was administered to illiterate and non-English-speaking draftees. Scott
       and Bingham organized a group under the Adjutant General's Office (AGO) with the goal to develop selection
       methods for officers. They created a catalogue of occupational needs for the Army, essentially a job-description
       system and a system of performance ratings and occupational skill tests for officers (Katzell & Austin, 1992).
       After the war, work on personnel selection continued. For example, Millicent Pond researched the selection of
       factory workers, comparing the results of pre-employment tests with various indicators of job performance
       (Vinchur & Koppes, 2014).

       From 1929 to 1932 Elton Mayo (1880-1949) and his colleagues began a series of studies at a plant near
       Chicago, Western Electric's Hawthorne Works (Figure 13.4). This long-term project took industrial psychology
       beyond just employee selection and placement to a study of more complex problems of interpersonal
       relations, motivation, and organizational dynamics. These studies mark the origin of organizational
       psychology. They began as research into the effects of the physical work environment (e.g., level of lighting in a
       factory), but the researchers found that the psychological and social factors in the factory were of more

interest than the physical factors. These studies also examined how human interaction factors, such as
supervisorial style, increased or decreased productivity.

                       FIGURE 13.4 Hawthorne Works provided the setting for several early I-O studies.
Analysis of the findings by later researchers led to the term the Hawthorne effect, which describes the
increase in performance of individuals who are aware they are being observed by researchers or supervisors
(Figure 13.5). What the original researchers found was that any change in a variable, such as lighting levels, led
to an improvement in productivity; this was true even when the change was negative, such as a return to poor
lighting. The effect faded when the attention faded (Roethlisberg & Dickson, 1939). The Hawthorne-effect
concept endures today as an important experimental consideration in many fields and a factor that has to be
controlled for in an experiment. In other words, an experimental treatment of some kind may produce an
effect simply because it involves greater attention of the researchers on the participants (McCarney et al.,
2007).

FIGURE 13.5 Researchers discovered that employees performed better when researchers or supervisors observed
and interacted with them, a dynamic termed the Hawthorne effect.

       In the 1930s, researchers began to study employees' feelings about their jobs. Kurt Lewin also conducted
       research on the effects of various leadership styles, team structure, and team dynamics (Katzell & Austin,
       1992). Lewin is considered the founder of social psychology and much of his work and that of his students
       produced results that had important influences in organizational psychology. Lewin and his students' research
       included an important early study that used children to study the effect of leadership style on aggression,
       group dynamics, and satisfaction (Lewin, Lippitt, & White, 1939). Lewin was also responsible for coining the
       term group dynamics, and he was involved in studies of group interactions, cooperation, competition, and
       communication that bear on organizational psychology.
       Parallel to these studies in industrial and organizational psychology, the field of human factors psychology was
       also developing. Frederick Taylor was an engineer who saw that if one could redesign the workplace there
       would be an increase in both output for the company and wages for the workers. In 1911 he put forward his
       theory in a book titled, The Principles of Scientific Management (Figure 13.6). His book examines management
       theories, personnel selection and training, as well as the work itself, using time and motion studies. Taylor
       argued that the principle goal of management should be to make the most money for the employer, along with
       the best outcome for the employee. He believed that the best outcome for the employee and management
       would be achieved through training and development so that each employee could provide the best work. He
       believed that by conducting time and motion studies for both the organization and the employee, the best
       interests of both were addressed. Time-motion studies were methods aimed to improve work by dividing
       different types of operations into sections that could be measured. These analyses were used to standardize
       work and to check the efficiency of people and equipment.
       Personnel selection is a process used by recruiting personnel within the company to recruit and select the best
       candidates for the job. Training may need to be conducted depending on what skills the hired candidate has.
       Often companies will hire someone with the personality that fits in with others but who may be lacking in
       skills. Skills can be taught, but personality cannot be easily changed.

       he set forth in (b) his book, The Principles of Scientific Management. (c) Taylor designed this steam hammer at the
       Midvale Steel Company. (credit c: modification of work by "Kheel Center, Cornell University"/Flickr)
       One of the examples of Taylor's theory in action involved workers handling heavy iron ingots. Taylor showed
       that the workers could be more productive by taking work rests. This method of rest increased worker
       productivity from 12.5 to 47.0 tons moved per day with less reported fatigue as well as increased wages for the
       workers who were paid by the ton. At the same time, the company's cost was reduced from 9.2 cents to 3.9
       cents per ton. Despite these increases in productivity, Taylor's theory received a great deal of criticism at the
       time because it was believed that it would exploit workers and reduce the number of workers needed. Also
       controversial was the underlying concept that only a manager could determine the most efficient method of

working, and that while at work, a worker was incapable of this. Taylor's theory was underpinned by the notion
that a worker was fundamentally lazy and the goal of Taylor's scientific management approach was to
maximize productivity without much concern for worker well-being. His approach was criticized by unions
and those sympathetic to workers (Van De Water, 1997).
Gilbreth was another influential I-O psychologist who strove to find ways to increase productivity (Figure 13.7).
Using time and motion studies, Gilbreth and her husband, Frank, worked to make workers more efficient by
reducing the number of motions required to perform a task. She not only applied these methods to industry
but also to the home, office, shops, and other areas. She investigated employee fatigue and time management
stress and found many employees were motivated by money and job satisfaction. In 1914, Gilbreth wrote the
book title, The Psychology of Management: The Function of the Mind in Determining, Teaching, and Installing
Methods of Least Waste, and she is known as the mother of modern management. Some of Gilbreth's
contributions are still in use today: you can thank her for the idea to put shelves inside on refrigerator doors,
and she also came up with the concept of using a foot pedal to operate the lid of trash can (Gilbreth, 1914,
1998; Koppes, 1997; Lancaster, 2004). Gilbreth was the first woman to join the American Society of Mechanical
Engineers in 1926, and in 1966 she was awarded the Hoover Medal of the American Society of Civil Engineers.
Taylor and Gilbreth's work improved productivity, but these innovations also improved the fit between
technology and the human using it. The study of machine-human fit is known as ergonomics or human factors
psychology.

From World War II to Today

World War II also drove the expansion of industrial psychology. Bingham was hired as the chief psychologist
for the War Department (now the Department of Defense) and developed new systems for job selection,
classification, training, ad performance review, plus methods for team development, morale change, and
attitude change (Katzell & Austin, 1992). Other countries, such as Canada and the United Kingdom, likewise
saw growth in I-O psychology during World War II (McMillan, Stevens, & Kelloway, 2009). In the years after the
war, both industrial psychology and organizational psychology became areas of significant research effort.
Concerns about the fairness of employment tests arose, and the ethnic and gender biases in various tests were
evaluated with mixed results. In addition, a great deal of research went into studying job satisfaction and
employee motivation (Katzell & Austin, 1992).
The research and work of I-O psychologists in the areas of employee selection, placement, and performance
appraisal became increasingly important in the 1960s. When Congress passed the 1964 Civil Rights Act, Title
456 13 · Industrial-Organizational Psychology

       VII covered what is known as equal employment opportunity. This law protects employees against
       discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, as well as discrimination against an
       employee for associating with an individual in one of these categories.

       Organizations had to adjust to the social, political, and legal climate of the Civil Rights movement, and these
       issues needed to be addressed by members of I/O in research and practice.

       There are many reasons for organizations to be interested in I/O so that they can better understand the
       psychology of their workers, which in turn helps them understand how their organizations can become more
       productive and competitive. For example, most large organizations are now competing on a global level, and
       they need to understand how to motivate workers in order to achieve high productivity and efficiency. Most
       companies also have a diverse workforce and need to understand the psychological complexity of the people in
       these diverse backgrounds.

       Today, I-O psychology is a diverse and deep field of research and practice, as you will learn about in the rest of
       this chapter. The Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology (SIOP), a division of the APA, lists 8,000
       members (SIOP, 2014) and the Bureau of Labor Statistics--U.S. Department of Labor (2013) has projected this
       profession will have the greatest growth of all job classifications in the 20 years following 2012. On average, a
       person with a master's degree in industrial-organizational psychology will earn over $80,000 a year, while
       someone with a doctorate will earn over $110,000 a year (Khanna, Medsker, & Ginter, 2012).

     13.2 Industrial Psychology: Selecting and Evaluating Employees

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain the aspects of employee selection
         · Describe the kinds of job training
         · Describe the approaches to and issues surrounding performance assessment

       The branch of I-O psychology known as industrial psychology focuses on identifying and matching persons to
       tasks within an organization. This involves job analysis, which means accurately describing the task or job.
       Then, organizations must identify the characteristics of applicants for a match to the job analysis. It also
       involves training employees from their first day on the job throughout their tenure within the organization,
       and appraising their performance along the way.

      Selecting Employees

       When you read job advertisements, do you ever wonder how the company comes up with the job description?
       Often, this is done with the help of I-O psychologists. There are two related but different approaches to job
       analysis--you may be familiar with the results of each as they often appear on the same job advertisement. The
       first approach is task-oriented and lists in detail the tasks that will be performed for the job. Each task is
       typically rated on scales for how frequently it is performed, how difficult it is, and how important it is to the job.
       The second approach is worker-oriented. This approach describes the characteristics required of the worker
       to successfully perform the job. This second approach has been called job specification (Dierdorff & Wilson,
       2003). For job specification, the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) that the job requires are identified.

       Observation, surveys, and interviews are used to obtain the information required for both types of job analysis.
       It is possible to observe someone who is proficient in a position and analyze what skills are apparent. Another
       approach used is to interview people presently holding that position, their peers, and their supervisors to get a
       consensus of what they believe are the requirements of the job.

       How accurate and reliable is a job analysis? Research suggests that it can depend on the nature of the
       descriptions and the source for the job analysis. For example, Dierdorff & Wilson (2003) found that job
       analyses developed from descriptions provided by people holding the job themselves were the least reliable;
       however, they did not study or speculate why this was the case.

The United States Department of Labor maintains a database of previously compiled job analyses for different
jobs and occupations. This allows the I-O psychologist to access previous analyses for nearly any type of
occupation. This system is called O*Net (accessible at www.onetonline.org). The site is open and you can see
the KSAs that are listed for your own position or one you might be curious about (Figure 13.8). Each occupation
lists the tasks, knowledge, skills, abilities, work context, work activities, education requirements, interests,
personality requirements, and work styles that are deemed necessary for success in that position. You can also
see data on average earnings and projected job growth in that industry.

FIGURE 13.8 The O*Net database from the United States Department of Labor provides information about a variety
of occupations, including the knowledge, skills, and abilities desired for the position. In this example, the search

       Candidate Analysis and Testing

       Once a company identifies potential candidates for a position, the candidates' knowledge, skills, and other
       abilities must be evaluated and compared with the job description. These evaluations can involve testing, an
       interview, and work samples or exercises. You learned about personality tests in the chapter on personality; in
       the I-O context, they are used to identify the personality characteristics of the candidate in an effort to match
       those to personality characteristics that would ensure good performance on the job. For example, a high rating
       of agreeableness might be desirable in a customer support position. However, it is not always clear how best to
       correlate personality characteristics with predictions of job performance. It might be that too high of a score on
       agreeableness is actually a hindrance in the customer support position. For example, if a customer has a
       misperception about a product or service, agreeing with their misperception will not ultimately lead to
       resolution of their complaint. Any use of personality tests should be accompanied by a verified assessment of
       what scores on the test correlate with good performance (Arthur, Woehr, & Graziano, 2001). Other types of tests
       that may be given to candidates include IQ tests, integrity tests, and physical tests, such as drug tests or
       physical fitness tests.

       To better understand the hiring process, let's consider an example case. A company determined it had an open
       position and advertised it. The human resources (HR) manager directed the hiring team to start the
       recruitment process. Imani saw the advertisement and submitted her résumé, which went into the collection
       of candidate résumés. The HR team reviewed the candidates' credentials and provided a list of the best
       potential candidates to the department manager, who reached out to them (including Imani) to set up
       individual interviews.

                                                                                                  WHAT DO YOU THINK?

        Using Cutoff Scores to Determine Job Selection

         Many positions require applicants to take tests as part of the selection process. These can include IQ tests, job-
         specific skills tests, or personality tests. The organization may set cutoff scores (i.e., a score below which a
         candidate will not move forward) for each test to determine whether the applicant moves on to the next stage.
         For example, there was a case of Robert Jordan, a 49-year-old college graduate who applied for a position with
         the police force in New London, Connecticut. As part of the selection process, Jordan took the Wonderlic
         Personnel Test (WPT), a test designed to measure cognitive ability.

         Jordan did not make it to the interview stage because his WPT score of 33, equivalent to an IQ score of 125 (100
         is the average IQ score), was too high. The New London Police department policy is to not interview anyone who
         has a WPT score over 27 (equivalent to an IQ score over 104) because they believe anyone who scores higher
         would be bored with police work. The average score for police officers nationwide is the equivalent of an IQ score
         of 104 (Jordan v. New London, 2000; ABC News, 2000).

         Jordan sued the police department alleging that his rejection was discrimination and his civil rights were violated
         because he was denied equal protection under the law. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower
         court's decision that the city of New London did not discriminate against him because the same standards were
         applied to everyone who took the exam (The New York Times, 1999).

         What do you think? When might universal cutoff points make sense in a hiring decision, and when might they
         eliminate otherwise potentially strong employees?

       Interviews

       Most jobs for mid-size to large-size businesses in the United States require a personal interview as a step in the
       selection process. Because interviews are commonly used, they have been the subject of considerable research
       by industrial psychologists. Information derived from job analysis usually forms the basis for the types of

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                               13.2 · Industrial Psychology: Selecting and Evaluating Employees 459

questions asked. Interviews can provide a more dynamic source of information about the candidate than
standard testing measures. Importantly, social factors and body language can influence the outcome of the
interview. These include influences, such as the degree of similarity of the applicant to the interviewer and
nonverbal behaviors, such as hand gestures, head nodding, and smiling (Bye, Horverak, Sandal, Sam, & Vivjer,
2014; Raki, Steffens, & Mummendey, 2011).

There are two types of interviews: unstructured and structured. In an unstructured interview, the interviewer
may ask different questions of each different candidate. One candidate might be asked about her career goals,
and another might be asked about his previous work experience. In an unstructured interview, the questions
are often, though not always, unspecified beforehand. And in an unstructured interview the responses to
questions asked are generally not scored using a standard system. In a structured interview, the interviewer
asks the same questions of every candidate, the questions are prepared in advance, and the interviewer uses a
standardized rating system for each response. With this approach, the interviewer can accurately compare two
candidates' interviews. In a meta-analysis of studies examining the effectiveness of various types of job
interviews, McDaniel, Whetzel, Schmidt & Maurer (1994) found that structured interviews were more effective
at predicting subsequent job performance of the job candidate.

Let's return to our example case. For her first interview, Imani was interviewed by a team of employees at the
company. She was one of five candidates interviewed that day for the position. Each interviewee was asked the
same list of questions, by the same people, so the interview experience was as consistent as possible across
applicants. At the end of the interviews, the HR team met and reviewed the answers given by Imani and the
other candidates. The HR team then identified a few new qualified candidates and conducted a new round of
initial interviews, while the first group of potential hires waited to hear back from the company.

                                                                                       EVERYDAY CONNECTION

 Preparing for the Job Interview

  You might be wondering if psychology research can tell you how to succeed in a job interview. As you can
  imagine, most research is concerned with the employer's interest in choosing the most appropriate candidate for
  the job, a goal that makes sense for the candidate too. But suppose you are not the only qualified candidate for
  the job; is there a way to increase your chances of being hired? A limited amount of research has addressed this
  question.

  As you might expect, nonverbal cues are important in an interview. Liden, Martin, & Parsons (1993) found that
  lack of eye contact and smiling on the part of the applicant led to lower applicant ratings. Studies of impression
  management on the part of an applicant have shown that self-promotion behaviors generally have a positive
  impact on interviewers (Gilmore & Ferris, 1989). Different personality types use different forms of impression
  management, for example extroverts use verbal self-promotion, and applicants high in agreeableness use non-
  verbal methods such as smiling and eye contact. Self-promotion was most consistently related with a positive
  outcome for the interview, particularly if it was related to the candidate's person-job fit. However, it is possible to
  overdo self-promotion with experienced interviewers (Howard & Ferris, 1996). Barrick, Swider & Stewart (2010)
  examined the effect of first impressions during the rapport building that typically occurs before an interview
  begins. They found that initial judgments by interviewers during this period were related to job offers and that the
  judgments were about the candidate's competence and not just likability. Levine and Feldman (2002) looked at
  the influence of several nonverbal behaviors in mock interviews on candidates' likability and projections of
  competence. Likability was affected positively by greater smiling behavior. Interestingly, other behaviors affected
  likability differently depending on the gender of the applicant. Men who displayed higher eye contact were less
  likable; women were more likable when they made greater eye contact. However, for this study male applicants
  were interviewed by men and female applicants were interviewed by women. In a study carried out in a real
  setting, DeGroot & Gooty (2009) found that nonverbal cues affected interviewers' assessments about
460 13 · Industrial-Organizational Psychology

         candidates. They looked at visual cues, which can often be modified by the candidate and vocal (nonverbal) cues,
         which are more difficult to modify. They found that interviewer judgment was positively affected by visual and
         vocal cues of conscientiousness, visual and vocal cues of openness to experience, and vocal cues of
         extroversion.
         What is the take home message from the limited research that has been done? Learn to be aware of your
         behavior during an interview. You can do this by practicing and soliciting feedback from mock interviews. Pay
         attention to any nonverbal cues you are projecting and work at presenting nonverbal cures that project
         confidence and positive personality traits. And finally, pay attention to the first impression you are making as it
         may also have an impact in the interview.

       Training
       Training is an important element of success and performance in many jobs. Most jobs begin with an
       orientation period during which the new employee is provided information regarding the company history,
       policies, and administrative protocols such as time tracking, benefits, and reporting requirements. An
       important goal of orientation training is to educate the new employee about the organizational culture, the
       values, visions, hierarchies, norms and ways the company's employees interact--essentially how the
       organization is run, how it operates, and how it makes decisions. There will also be training that is specific to
       the job the individual was hired to do, or training during the individual's period of employment that teaches
       aspects of new duties, or how to use new physical or software tools. Much of these kinds of training will be
       formalized for the employee; for example, orientation training is often accomplished using software
       presentations, group presentations by members of the human resources department or with people in the new
       hire's department (Figure 13.9).

       FIGURE 13.9 Training usually begins with an orientation period during which a new employee learns about
       company policies, practices, and culture. (credit: Cory Zanker)
       Mentoring is a form of informal training in which an experienced employee guides the work of a new
       employee. In some situations, mentors will be formally assigned to a new employee, while in others a
       mentoring relationship may develop informally.
       Mentoring effects on the mentor and the employee being mentored, the protégé, have been studied in recent
       years. In a review of mentoring studies, Eby, Allen, Evans, Ng, & DuBois (2008) found significant but small
       effects of mentoring on performance (i.e., behavioral outcomes), motivation and satisfaction, and actual career
       outcomes. In a more detailed review, Allen, Eby, Poteet, Lentz, & Lima (2004) found that mentoring positively
       affected a protégé's compensation and number of promotions compared with non-mentored employees. In
       addition, protégés were more satisfied with their careers and had greater job satisfaction. All of the effects
       were small but significant. Eby, Durley, Evans, & Ragins (2006) examined mentoring effects on the mentor and

found that mentoring was associated with greater job satisfaction and organizational commitment. Gentry,
Weber, & Sadri (2008) found that mentoring was positively related with performance ratings by supervisors.
Allen, Lentz, & Day (2006) found in a comparison of mentors and non-mentors that mentoring led to greater
reported salaries and promotions.

Mentoring is recognized to be particularly important to the career success of women (McKeen & Bujaki, 2007)
by creating connections to informal networks, reducing feelings of isolation, and with overcoming
discrimination in job promotions.

Researchers have worked to understand the impacts of gender, race, and ethnicity on mentoring relationships,
especially whether outcomes differ based on the gender or racial/ethnic makeup of the mentor-mentee pair.
Overall, women and members of underrepresented racial/ethnic populations do not lack access to mentors,
but they do lack access to mentors of the same gender, race, and ethnicity, because the senior roles in many
organizations are made up of White men (MLDC, 2010). Results from these studies are mixed, but generally
suggest that pairings made up of two people of the same gender or race/ethnicity have better psychosocial
outcomes, such as a feeling of more support (Koberg, Boss, & Goodman, 1998; Allen et al, 2006). On the other
hand, women and people of color typically experience greater career advancement or higher pay when
mentored by people of a different gender or race/ethnicity (Parks-Yancy, 2012).

A 2003 study by Arthur, Bennett, Edens, and Bell examined multiple other studies to determine how effective
organizational training is. Their results showed that training was effective, based on four types of
measurement: (1) the immediate response of the employee to the training effort, (2) testing at the end of
training to demonstrate that learning outcomes were met, (3) behavioral measurements of job activities by
supervisors, and (4) results such as productivity and profits. The examined studies represented diverse forms
of training including self-instruction, lecture and discussion, and computer assisted training.

Evaluating Employees

Industrial and organizational psychologists are typically involved in designing performance-appraisal systems
for organizations. These systems are designed to evaluate whether each employee is performing satisfactorily.
Industrial and organizational psychologists study, research, and implement ways to make work evaluations as
fair and positive as possible; they also work to decrease the subjectivity involved with performance ratings.
Fairly evaluated work helps employees do their jobs better, improves the likelihood of people being in the right
jobs for their talents, maintains fairness, and identifies company and individual training needs. In our
example case, Imani was offered the position and was hired with a 90-day probation period. During that time,
she met with her supervisor to discuss her performance and the expectations of the position and her growth.
At the end of the 90 days, it was determined that Imani was meeting the expectations of her employer and had
passed her probationary period. Imani was excited to now have a permanent job.

Performance appraisals are typically documented several times a year, often with a formal process and an
annual face-to-face brief meeting between an employee and their supervisor. It is important that the original
job analysis play a role in performance appraisal as well as any goals that have been set by the employee or by
the employee and supervisor. The meeting is often used for the supervisor to communicate specific concerns
about the employee's performance and to positively reinforce elements of good performance. It may also be
used to discuss specific performance rewards, such as a pay increase, or consequences of poor performance,
such as a probationary period. Part of the function of performance appraisals for the organization is to
document poor performance to bolster decisions to terminate an employee.

Performance appraisals are becoming more complex processes within organizations and are often used to
motivate employees to improve performance and expand their areas of competence, in addition to assessing
their job performance. In this capacity, performance appraisals can be used to identify opportunities for
training or whether a particular training program has been successful. One approach to performance
appraisal is called 360-degree feedback appraisal (Figure 13.10). In this system, the employee's appraisal
462 13 · Industrial-Organizational Psychology

       derives from a combination of ratings by supervisors, peers, employees supervised by the employee, and from
       the employee herself. Occasionally, outside observers may be used as well, such as customers. The purpose of
       360-degree system is to give the employee (who may be a manager) and supervisor different perspectives of
       the employee's job performance; the system should help employees make improvements through their own
       efforts or through training. The system is also used in a traditional performance-appraisal context, providing
       the supervisor with more information with which to make decisions about the employee's position and
       compensation (Tornow, 1993a).

       FIGURE 13.10 In a 360-degree performance appraisal, supervisors, customers, direct reports, peers, and the
       employee himself rate an employee's performance.
       Few studies have assessed the effectiveness of 360-degree methods, but Atkins and Wood (2002) found that
       the self and peer ratings were unreliable as an assessment of an employee's performance and that even
       supervisors tended to underrate employees that gave themselves modest feedback ratings. However, a
       different perspective sees this variability in ratings as a positive in that it provides for greater learning on the
       part of the employees as they and their supervisor discuss the reasons for the discrepancies (Tornow, 1993b).
       In theory, performance appraisals should be an asset for an organization wishing to achieve its goals, and most
       employees will actually solicit feedback regarding their jobs if it is not offered (DeNisi & Kluger, 2000).
       However, in practice, many performance evaluations are disliked by organizations, employees, or both
       (Fletcher, 2001), and few of them have been adequately tested to see if they do in fact improve performance or
       motivate employees (DeNisi & Kluger, 2000). One of the reasons evaluations fail to accomplish their purpose in
       an organization is that performance appraisal systems are often used incorrectly or are of an inappropriate
       type for an organization's particular culture (Schraeder, Becton, & Portis, 2007). An organization's culture is
       how the organization is run, how it operates, and how it makes decisions. It is based on the collective values,
       hierarchies, and how individuals within the organization interact. Examining the effectiveness of performance
       appraisal systems in particular organizations and the effectiveness of training for the implementation of the
       performance appraisal system is an active area of research in industrial psychology (Fletcher, 2001).

      Bias and Protections in Hiring

       In an ideal hiring process, an organization would generate a job analysis that accurately reflects the

                                                                                               13.2 · Industrial Psychology: Selecting and Evaluating Employees 463

requirements of the position, and it would accurately assess candidates' KSAs to determine who the best
individual is to carry out the job's requirements. For many reasons, hiring decisions in the real world are often
made based on factors other than matching a job analysis to KSAs. As mentioned earlier, interview rankings
can be influenced by other factors: similarity to the interviewer (Bye, Horverak, Sandal, Sam, & Vijver, 2014)
and the regional accent of the interviewee (Raki, Steffens, & Mummendey 2011). A study by Agerström &
Rooth (2011) examined hiring managers' decisions to invite equally qualified non-obese and obese job
applicants to an interview. The decisions of the hiring managers were based on photographs of the two
applicants. The study found that hiring managers that scored high on a test of negative associations with
overweight people displayed a bias in favor of inviting the equally qualified non-obese applicant but not
inviting the obese applicant. The association test measures automatic or subconscious associations between
an individual's negative or positive values and, in this case, the body-size attribute. A meta-analysis of
experimental studies found that physical attractiveness benefited individuals in various job-related outcomes
such as hiring, promotion, and performance review (Hosoda, Stone-Romero, & Coats, 2003). They also found
that the strength of the benefit appeared to be decreasing with time between the late 1970s and the late 1990s.
Some hiring criteria may be related to a particular group an applicant belongs to and not individual abilities.
Unless membership in that group directly affects potential job performance, a decision based on group
membership is discriminatory (Figure 13.11). To combat hiring discrimination, in the United States there are
numerous city, state, and federal laws that prevent hiring based on various group-membership criteria. For
example, did you know it is illegal for a potential employer to ask your age in an interview? Did you know that
an employer cannot ask you whether you are married, a U.S. citizen, have disabilities, or what your race or
religion is? They cannot even ask questions that might shed some light on these attributes, such as where you
were born or who you live with. These are only a few of the restrictions that are in place to prevent
discrimination in hiring. In the United States, federal anti-discrimination laws are administered by the U.S.
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).

FIGURE 13.11 (a) Pregnancy, (b) religion, and (c) age are some of the criteria on which hiring decisions cannot
legally be made. (credit a: modification of work by Sean McGrath; credit b: modification of work by Ze'ev Barkan;

The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)

The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is responsible for enforcing federal laws that
make it illegal to discriminate against a job applicant or an employee because of the person's race, color,
religion, sex (including pregnancy), sexual orientation, national origin, age (40 or older), disability, or genetic
information. Figure 13.12 provides some of the legal language from laws that have been passed to prevent
discrimination.
464 13 · Industrial-Organizational Psychology

                    FIGURE 13.12 The laws shown here protect employees in the U.S. from discriminatory practices.
       The United States has several specific laws regarding fairness and avoidance of discrimination. The Equal Pay
       Act requires that equal pay for men and women in the same workplace who are performing equal work.
       Despite the law, persistent inequities in earnings between men and women exist. Corbett & Hill (2012) studied
       one facet of the gender gap by looking at earnings in the first year after college in the United States. Just
       comparing the earnings of women to men, women earn about 82 cents for every dollar a man earns in their
       first year out of college. However, some of this difference can be explained by education, career, and life
       choices, such as choosing majors with lower earning potential or specific jobs within a field that have less
       responsibility. When these factors were corrected the study found an unexplained seven-cents-on-the-dollar
       gap in the first year after college that can be attributed to gender discrimination in pay. This approach to
       analysis of the gender pay gap, called the human capital model, has been criticized. Lips (2013) argues that the
       education, career, and life choices can, in fact, be constrained by necessities imposed by gender
       discrimination. This suggests that removing these factors entirely from the gender gap equation leads to an
       estimate of the size of the pay gap that is too small.

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes it illegal to treat individuals unfavorably because of their race or
color of their skin: An employer cannot discriminate based on skin color, hair texture, or other immutable
characteristics, which are traits of an individual that are fundamental to their identity, in hiring, benefits,
promotions, or termination of employees. The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 amends the Civil Rights
Act; it prohibits job (e.g., employment, pay, and termination) discrimination of a woman because she is
pregnant as long as she can perform the work required.

The Supreme Court ruling in Griggs v. Duke Power Co. made it illegal under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to
include educational requirements in a job description (e.g., high school diploma) that negatively impacts one
race over another if the requirement cannot be shown to be directly related to job performance. The EEOC
(2014) received more than 94,000 charges of various kinds of employment discrimination in 2013. Many of the
filings are for multiple forms of discrimination and include charges of retaliation for making a claim, which
itself is illegal. Only a small fraction of these claims become suits filed in a federal court, although the suits
may represent the claims of more than one person. In 2013, there were 148 suits filed in federal courts.

     LINK TO LEARNING

In 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court decided a case in which women plaintiffs were attempting to group together
in a class-action suit against Walmart for gender discrimination in promotion and pay. The case was important
because it was the only practical way for individual women who felt they had been discriminated against to
sustain a court battle for redress of their claims. The Court ultimately decided against the plaintiffs, and the
right to a class-action suit was denied. However, the case itself effectively publicized the issue of gender
discrimination in employment. Watch this video about the case history and issues (http://openstax.org/l/
SCOTUS1) and this PBS NewsHour video about the arguments (http://openstax.org/l/SCOTUS2) to learn more.

Based on a 2020 Supreme Court ruling regarding the application of the Civil Rights Act, federal legislation now
protects employees in the private sector from discrimination related to sexual orientation and gender identity.
These groups include lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals. There is evidence of discrimination
derived from surveys of workers, studies of complaint filings, wage comparison studies, and controlled job-
interview studies (Badgett, Sears, Lau, & Ho, 2009). Prior to the ruling, federal legislation protected federal
employees from such discrimination; the District of Columbia and 20 states have laws protecting public and
private employees from discrimination for sexual orientation (American Civil Liberties Union, n.d). Most of the
states with these laws also protect against discrimination based on gender identity. Gender identity refers to
one's sense of being male, female, neither of these, both of these, or another gender.

While the Supreme Court's Civil Rights Act interpretation is regarded as a landmark outcome for LGBTQ
people, it will be continually tested by organizations that for various reasons see a need to exclude LGBTQ
people from employment or service. The First Amendment protects religious organizations from some aspects
of anti-discrimination laws, and some recent court decisions have expanded these exceptions so that certain
ministries, schools, or other organizations could avoid employing or serving LGBTQ people.

Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 states people may not be discriminated against due to the
nature of their disability. A disability is defined as a physical or mental impairment that limits one or more
major life activities such as hearing, walking, and breathing. An employer must make reasonable
accommodations for the performance of the job of an employee with disabilities. This might include making
the work facility accessible with ramps, providing readers for blind personnel, or allowing for more frequent
breaks. The ADA has now been expanded to include individuals with alcoholism, former drug use, obesity, or
psychiatric disabilities. The premise of the law is that individuals with disabilities can contribute to an
organization and they cannot be discriminated against because of their disabilities (O'Keefe & Bruyere, 1994).

The Civil Rights Act and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act make provisions for bona fide
466 13 · Industrial-Organizational Psychology

       occupational qualifications (BFOQs), which are requirements of certain occupations for which denying an
       individual employment would otherwise violate the law. For example, there may be cases in which religion,
       national origin, age, and sex are bona fide occupational qualifications. There are no BFOQ exceptions that
       apply to race, although the first amendment protects artistic expressions, such as films, in making race a
       requirement of a role. Clearcut examples of BFOQs would be hiring someone of a specific religion for a
       leadership position in a worship facility, or for an executive position in religiously affiliated institutions, such
       as the president of a university with religious ties. Age has been determined to be a BFOQ for airline pilots;
       hence, there are mandatory retirement ages for safety reasons. Sex has been determined as a BFOQ for guards
       in male prisons.
       Sex or gender is the most common reason for invoking a BFOQ as a defense against accusing an employer of
       discrimination (Manley, 2009). Courts have established a three-part test for sex-related BFOQs that are often
       used in other types of legal cases for determining whether a BFOQ exists. The first of these is whether all or
       substantially all women would be unable to perform a job. This is the reason most physical limitations, such as
       "able to lift 30 pounds," fail as reasons to discriminate because most women are able to lift this weight. The
       second test is the "essence of the business" test, in which having to choose the other gender would undermine
       the essence of the business operation. This test was the reason the now defunct Pan American World Airways
       (i.e., Pan Am) was told it could not hire only women flight attendants. Hiring men would not have undermined
       the essense of this business. On a deeper level, this means that hiring cannot be made purely on customers' or
       others' preferences. The third and final test is whether the employer cannot make reasonable alternative
       accommodations, such as reassigning staff so that a woman does not have to work in a men-only part of a jail
       or other gender-specific facility. Privacy concerns are a major reason why discrimination based on gender is
       upheld by the courts, for example in situations such as hires for nursing or custodial staff (Manley, 2009). Most
       cases of BFOQs are decided on a case-by-case basis and these court decisions inform policy and future case
       decisions.

                                                                                                  WHAT DO YOU THINK?

        Hooters and BFOQ Laws

                FIGURE 13.13 Hooters restaurants only hire female wait staff. (credit: "BemLoira BemDavassa"/Flickr)
         The restaurant chain Hooters, which hires only women wait staff and has them dress in a sexually provocative
         manner, is commonly cited as a discriminatory employer. The chain would argue that the women employees are
         an essential part of their business in that they market through sex appeal and the wait staff attract customers.
         Men have filed discrimination charges against Hooters in the past for not hiring them as wait staff simply because
         they are men. The chain has avoided a court decision on their hiring practices by settling out of court with the
         plaintiffs in each case. Do you think their practices violate the Civil Rights Act? See if you can apply the three
         court tests to this case and make a decision about whether a case that went to trial would find in favor of the
         plaintiff or the chain.

13.3 Organizational Psychology: The Social Dimension of Work

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Define organizational psychology
  · Explain the measurement and determinants of job satisfaction
  · Describe key elements of management and leadership
  · Explain the significance of organizational culture

Organizational psychology is the second major branch of study and practice within the discipline of industrial
and organizational psychology. In organizational psychology, the focus is on social interactions and their effect
on the individual and on the functioning of the organization. In this section, you will learn about the work
organizational psychologists have done to understand job satisfaction, different styles of management,
different styles of leadership, organizational culture, and teamwork.

Job Satisfaction

Some people love their jobs, some people tolerate their jobs, and some people cannot stand their jobs. Job
satisfaction describes the degree to which individuals enjoy their job. It was described by Edwin Locke (1976)
as the state of feeling resulting from appraising one's job experiences. While job satisfaction results from both
how we think about our work (our cognition) and how we feel about our work (our affect) (Saari & Judge, 2004),
it is described in terms of affect. Job satisfaction is impacted by the work itself, our personality, and the culture
we come from and live in (Saari & Judge, 2004).

Job satisfaction is typically measured after a change in an organization, such as a shift in the management
model, to assess how the change affects employees. It may also be routinely measured by an organization to
assess one of many factors expected to affect the organization's performance. In addition, polling companies
like Gallup regularly measure job satisfaction on a national scale to gather broad information on the state of
the economy and the workforce (Saad, 2012).

Job satisfaction is measured using questionnaires that employees complete. Sometimes a single question
might be asked in a very straightforward way to which employees respond using a rating scale, such as a Likert
scale, which was discussed in the chapter on personality. A Likert scale (typically) provides five possible
answers to a statement or question that allows respondents to indicate their positive-to-negative strength of
agreement or strength of feeling regarding the question or statement. Thus the possible responses to a
question such as "How satisfied are you with your job today?" might be "Very satisfied," "Somewhat satisfied,"
"Neither satisfied, nor dissatisfied," "Somewhat dissatisfied," and "Very dissatisfied." More commonly the
survey will ask a number of questions about the employee's satisfaction to determine more precisely why they
are satisfied or dissatisfied. Sometimes these surveys are created for specific jobs; at other times, they are
designed to apply to any job. Job satisfaction can be measured at a global level, meaning how satisfied in
general the employee is with work, or at the level of specific factors intended to measure which aspects of the
job lead to satisfaction (Table 13.2).

TABLE 13.2

Research has suggested that the work-content factor, which includes variety, difficulty level, and role clarity of
the job, is the most strongly predictive factor of overall job satisfaction (Saari & Judge, 2004). In contrast, there
is only a weak correlation between pay level and job satisfaction (Judge, Piccolo, Podsakoff, Shaw, & Rich,
2010). Judge et al. (2010) suggest that individuals adjust or adapt to higher pay levels: Higher pay no longer
provides the satisfaction the individual may have initially felt when their salary increased.

Why should we care about job satisfaction? Or more specifically, why should an employer care about job
satisfaction? Measures of job satisfaction are somewhat correlated with job performance; in particular, they
appear to relate to organizational citizenship or discretionary behaviors on the part of an employee that
further the goals of the organization (Judge & Kammeyer-Mueller, 2012). Job satisfaction is related to general
life satisfaction, although there has been limited research on how the two influence each other or whether
personality and cultural factors affect both job and general life satisfaction. One carefully controlled study
suggested that the relationship is reciprocal: Job satisfaction affects life satisfaction positively, and vice versa
(Judge & Watanabe, 1993). Of course, organizations cannot control life satisfaction's influence on job
satisfaction. Job satisfaction, specifically low job satisfaction, is also related to withdrawal behaviors, such as
leaving a job or absenteeism (Judge & Kammeyer-Mueller, 2012). The relationship with turnover itself,
however, is weak (Judge & Kammeyer-Mueller, 2012). Finally, it appears that job satisfaction is related to
organizational performance, which suggests that implementing organizational changes to improve employee
job satisfaction will improve organizational performance (Judge & Kammeyer-Mueller, 2012).

There is opportunity for more research in the area of job satisfaction. For example, Weiss (2002) suggests that
the concept of job satisfaction measurements have combined both emotional and cognitive concepts, and
measurements would be more reliable and show better relationships with outcomes like performance if the
measurement of job satisfaction separated these two possible elements of job satisfaction.

 Job Satisfaction in Federal Government Agencies

  A 2013 study of job satisfaction in the U.S. federal government found indexes of job satisfaction plummeting
  compared to the private sector. The largest factor in the decline was satisfaction with pay, followed by training
  and development opportunities. The Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization, has
  conducted research on federal employee job satisfaction since 2003. Its primary goal is to improve the federal
  government's management. However, the results also provide information to those interested in obtaining

  employment with the federal government.

  Among large agencies, the highest job satisfaction ranking went to NASA, followed by the Department of
  Commerce and the intelligence community. The lowest scores went to the Department of Homeland Security.

  The data used to derive the job satisfaction score come from three questions on the Federal Employee Viewpoint
  Survey. The questions are:

  1. I recommend my organization as a good place to work.
  2. Considering everything, how satisfied are you with your job?
  3. Considering everything, how satisfied are you with your organization?

  The questions have a range of six possible answers, spanning a range of strong agreement or satisfaction to
  strong disagreement or dissatisfaction. How would you answer these questions with regard to your own job?
  Would these questions adequately assess your job satisfaction?

Job stress affects job satisfaction. Job stress, or job strain, is caused by specific stressors in an occupation.
Stress can be an ambiguous term as it is used in common language. Stress is the perception and response of
an individual to events judged as overwhelming or threatening to the individual's well-being (Gyllensten &
Palmer, 2005). The events themselves are the stressors. Stress is a result of an employee's perception that the
demands placed on them exceed their ability to meet them (Gyllensten & Palmer, 2005), such as having to fill
multiple roles in a job or life in general, workplace role ambiguity, lack of career progress, lack of job security,
lack of control over work outcomes, isolation, work overload, discrimination, harassment, and bullying
(Colligan & Higgins, 2005). The stressors are different for women than men and these differences are a
significant area of research (Gyllensten & Palmer, 2005). Job stress leads to poor employee health, job
performance, and family life (Colligan & Higgins, 2005).

As already mentioned, job insecurity contributes significantly to job stress. Two increasing threats to job
security are downsizing events and corporate mergers. Businesses typically involve I-O psychologists in
planning for, implementing, and managing these types of organizational change.

Downsizing is an increasingly common response to a business's pronounced failure to achieve profit goals,
and it involves laying off a significant percentage of the company's employees. Industrial-organizational
psychologists may be involved in all aspects of downsizing: how the news is delivered to employees (both those
being let go and those staying), how laid-off employees are supported (e.g., separation packages), and how
retained employees are supported. The latter is important for the organization because downsizing events
affect the retained employee's intent to quit, organizational commitment, and job insecurity (Ugboro, 2006).

In addition to downsizing as a way of responding to outside strains on a business, corporations often grow
larger by combining with other businesses. This can be accomplished through a merger (i.e., the joining of two
organizations of equal power and status) or an acquisition (i.e., one organization purchases the other). In an
acquisition, the purchasing organization is usually the more powerful or dominant partner. In both cases,
there is usually a duplication of services between the two companies, such as two accounting departments and
two sales forces. Both departments must be merged, which commonly involves a reduction of staff (Figure
13.14). This leads to organizational processes and stresses similar to those that occur in downsizing events.
Mergers require determining how the organizational culture will change, to which employees also must adjust
(van Knippenberg, van Knippenberg, Monden, & de Lima, 2002). There can be additional stress on workers as
they lose their connection to the old organization and try to make connections with the new combined group
(Amiot, Terry, Jimmieson, & Callan, 2006). Research in this area focuses on understanding employee reactions
470 13 · Industrial-Organizational Psychology

       and making practical recommendations for managing these organizational changes.

       FIGURE 13.14 When companies are combined through a merger (or acquisition), there are often cuts due to
       duplication of core functions, like sales and accounting, at each company.

      Work-Family Balance

       Many people juggle the demands of work life with the demands of their home life, whether it be caring for
       children or taking care of an elderly parent; this is known as work-family balance. We might commonly think
       about work interfering with family, but it is also the case that family responsibilities may conflict with work
       obligations (Carlson, Kacmar, & Williams, 2000). Greenhaus and Beutell (1985) first identified three sources of
       work-family conflicts:

         · time devoted to work makes it difficult to fulfill requirements of family, or vice versa,
         · strain from participation in work makes it difficult to fulfill requirements of family, or vice versa, and
         · specific behaviors required by work make it difficult to fulfill the requirements of family, or vice versa.
       Women often have greater responsibility for family demands, including home care, child care, and caring for
       aging parents, yet men in the United States are increasingly assuming a greater share of domestic
       responsibilities. However, research has documented that women report greater levels of stress from
       work-family conflict (Gyllensten & Palmer, 2005).
       There are many ways to decrease work-family conflict and improve people's job satisfaction (Posig & Kickul,
       2004). These include support in the home, which can take various forms: emotional (listening), practical (help
       with chores). Workplace support can include understanding supervisors, flextime, leave with pay, and
       telecommuting. Flextime usually involves a requirement of core hours spent in the workplace around which
       the employee may schedule their arrival and departure from work to meet family demands. Telecommuting
       involves employees working at home and setting their own hours, which allows them to work during different
       parts of the day, and to spend part of the day with their family; this may also be known as ecommuting,
       working remotely, flexible workspace, or simply working from home. Recall that Yahoo! had a policy of allowing
       employees to telecommute and then rescinded the policy. There are also organizations that have onsite
       daycare centers, and some companies even have onsite fitness centers and health clinics. In a study of the
       effectiveness of different coping methods, Lapierre & Allen (2006) found practical support from home more
       important than emotional support. They also found that immediate-supervisor support for a worker
       significantly reduced work-family conflict through such mechanisms as allowing an employee the flexibility

needed to fulfill family obligations. In contrast, flextime did not help with coping and telecommuting actually
made things worse, perhaps reflecting the fact that being at home intensifies the conflict between work and
family because with the employee in the home, the demands of family are more evident.

Posig & Kickul (2004) identify exemplar corporations with policies designed to reduce work-family conflict.
Examples include IBM's policy of three years of job-guaranteed leave after the birth of a child, Lucent
Technologies offer of one year's childbirth leave at half pay, and SC Johnson's program of concierge services
for daytime errands.

Management and Organizational Structure

A significant portion of I-O research focuses on management and human relations. Douglas McGregor (1960)
combined scientific management (a theory of management that analyzes and synthesizes workflows with the
main objective of improving economic efficiency, especially labor productivity) and human relations into the
notion of leadership behavior. His theory lays out two different styles called Theory X and Theory Y. In the
Theory X approach to management, managers assume that most people dislike work and are not innately self-
directed. Theory X managers perceive employees as people who prefer to be led and told which tasks to
perform and when. Their employees have to be watched carefully to be sure that they work hard enough to
fulfill the organization's goals. Theory X workplaces will often have employees punch a clock when arriving
and leaving the workplace: Tardiness is punished. Supervisors, not employees, determine whether an
employee needs to stay late, and even this decision would require someone higher up in the command chain to
approve the extra hours. Theory X supervisors will ignore employees' suggestions for improved efficiency and
reprimand employees for speaking out of order. These supervisors blame efficiency failures on individual
employees rather than the systems or policies in place. Managerial goals are achieved through a system of
punishments and threats rather than enticements and rewards. Managers are suspicious of employees'
motivations and always suspect selfish motivations for their behavior at work (e.g., being paid is their sole
motivation for working).

In the Theory Y approach, on the other hand, managers assume that most people seek inner satisfaction and
fulfillment from their work. Employees function better under leadership that allows them to participate in, and
provide input about, setting their personal and work goals. In Theory Y workplaces, employees participate in
decisions about prioritizing tasks; they may belong to teams that, once given a goal, decide themselves how it
will be accomplished. In such a workplace, employees are able to provide input on matters of efficiency and
safety. One example of Theory Y in action is the policy of Toyota production lines that allows any employee to
stop the entire line if a defect or other issue appears, so that the defect can be fixed and its cause remedied
(Toyota Motor Manufacturing, 2013). A Theory Y workplace will also meaningfully consult employees on any
changes to the work process or management system. In addition, the organization will encourage employees to
contribute their own ideas. McGregor (1960) characterized Theory X as the traditional method of management
used in the United States. He argued that a Theory Y approach was needed to improve organizational output
and the wellbeing of individuals. Table 13.3 summarizes how these two management approaches differ.

            Theory X                           Theory Y

People dislike work and avoid it.              People enjoy work and find it natural.

People avoid responsibility.                   People are more satisfied when given responsibility.

People want to be told what to do.             People want to take part in setting their own work goals.

Goals are achieved through rules and punishments. Goals are achieved through enticements and rewards.

TABLE 13.3

Another management style was described by Donald Clifton, who focused his research on how an organization
can best use an individual's strengths, an approach he called strengths-based management. He and his
colleagues interviewed 8,000 managers and concluded that it is important to focus on a person's strengths, not
their weaknesses. A strength is a particular enduring talent possessed by an individual that allows them to
provide consistent, near-perfect performance in tasks involving that talent. Clifton argued that our strengths
provide the greatest opportunity for growth (Buckingham & Clifton, 2001). An example of a strength is public
speaking or the ability to plan a successful event. The strengths-based approach is very popular although its
effect on organization performance is not well-studied. However, Kaiser & Overfield (2011) found that
managers often neglected improving their weaknesses and overused their strengths, both of which interfered
with performance.

Leadership is an important element of management. Leadership styles have been of major interest within I-O
research, and researchers have proposed numerous theories of leadership. Bass (1985) popularized and
developed the concepts of transactional leadership versus transformational leadership styles. In transactional
leadership, the focus is on supervision and organizational goals, which are achieved through a system of
rewards and punishments (i.e., transactions). Transactional leaders maintain the status quo: They are
managers. This is in contrast to the transformational leader. People who have transformational leadership
possess four attributes to varying degrees: They are charismatic (highly liked role models), inspirational
(optimistic about goal attainment), intellectually stimulating (encourage critical thinking and problem
solving), and considerate (Bass, Avolio, & Atwater, 1996).

As women increasingly take on leadership roles in corporations, questions have arisen as to whether there are
differences in leadership styles between men and women (Eagly, Johannesen-Schmidt, & van Engen, 2003).
Eagly & Johnson (1990) conducted a meta-analysis to examine gender and leadership style. They found, to a
slight but significant degree, that women tend to practice an interpersonal style of leadership (i.e., she focuses
on the morale and welfare of the employees) and men practice a task-oriented style (i.e., he focuses on
accomplishing tasks). However, the differences were less pronounced when one looked only at organizational
studies and excluded laboratory experiments or surveys that did not involve actual organizational leaders.
Larger gender-related differences were observed when leadership style was categorized as democratic or
autocratic, and these differences were consistent across all types of studies. The authors suggest that
similarities between genders in leadership styles are attributable to different genders needing to conform to
the organization's culture; additionally, they propose that gender-related differences reflect inherent
differences in the strengths each gender brings to bear on leadership practice. In another meta-analysis of
leadership style, Eagly, Johannesen-Schmidt, & van Engen (2003) found that women tended to exhibit the
characteristics of transformational leaders, while men were more likely to be transactional leaders. However,
the differences are not absolute; for example, women were found to use methods of reward for performance
more often than men, which is a component of transactional leadership. The differences they found were

                                                                                                  13.3 · Organizational Psychology: The Social Dimension of Work 473

relatively small. As Eagly, Johannesen-Schmidt, & van Engen (2003) point out, research shows that
transformational leadership approaches are more effective than transactional approaches, although individual
leaders typically exhibit elements of both approaches.

A new and emerging area of research within psychology focuses on leadership and the relationship with
leaders from the perspective of a follower. This "followership" research suggests that studies need to examine
the leader-follower relationship in both directions--instead of focusing only on leadership--to better
understand the dynamics of the relationship. Put differently, people are individuals, and because they are
different, there probably is no single best leadership-follower dynamic between leaders and followers. For
instance, think about the differences between yourself and someone you know well. Do you respond the same
way to criticism? Maybe one of you likes a lot of structure and other seems to work best with less structure.
Perhaps, one of you is ready to try a new restaurant at any time and the other prefers to go to the tried-and-true
place that you've visited so many times the servers know your order before you place it.

Some early research has discovered that the characteristics of individual followers will result in different types
of relationships with a leader depending on the leadership style. It appears that not all leadership styles work
well with all follower types. One characteristic of followers, for example, is their degree of extroversion.
Previous research suggests that individuals with a high degree of extroversion would need a larger amount of
interaction with their leaders in order to function well; however, other research suggests this may not
necessarily be the case and instead other factors may be at work (Phillips & Bedeian; Bauer et al, 2006).

Another characteristic of followers is their individual need for growth. For followers who have a strong desire
to learn and grow within their organization, a leader who provides developmental opportunities might be
better received than one who does not. In addition, for those followers who are low on growth and need
strength, leaders who push them to grow may make them less satisfied followers as they feel forced into
further development and training, possibly signaling a lower level of achievement from their supervisor.
Training for leaders in both helping employees who have a strong drive for growth and those who do not
appears to be helpful in improving the relationship between both types of followers and their leaders (Schyns,
Kroon, & Moors, 2008).

Finally, an employee's need for leadership is an important component of the leader-follower relationship.
Some individuals are significantly more autonomous than others and as a result do not respond as well to
leaders who provide a lot of structure and rigidity of processes, in turn reducing the quality of their
relationship with their leader. Other employees who are high in need for leadership have a better relationship
with their leader if they are provided with a well-structured environment with clear responsibilities and little
ambiguity in their work. These followers work best in situations where they feel they can comfortably perform
the work with little requirement to think outside of the guidelines that have been provided. For these
individuals, having a leader who is able to set a clear path forward for the employee with little need for
deviation promotes a strong positive leader-follower relationship (Felfe & Schyns, 2006).

Goals, Teamwork and Work Teams

The workplace today is rapidly changing due to a variety of factors, such as shifts in technology, economics,
foreign competition, globalization, and workplace demographics. Organizations need to respond quickly to
changes in these factors. Many companies are responding to these changes by structuring their organizations
so that work can be delegated to work teams, which bring together diverse skills, experience, and expertise.
This is in contrast to organizational structures that have individuals at their base (Naquin & Tynan, 2003). In
the team-based approach, teams are brought together and given a specific task or goal to accomplish. Despite
their burgeoning popularity, team structures do not always deliver greater productivity--the work of teams is
an active area of research (Naquin & Tynan, 2003).

Why do some teams work well while others do not? There are many contributing factors. For example, teams
can mask team members that are not working (i.e., social loafing). Teams can be inefficient due to poor
474 13 · Industrial-Organizational Psychology

       communication; they can have poor decision-making skills due to conformity effects; and, they can have
       conflict within the group. The popularity of teams may in part result from the team halo effect: Teams are
       given credit for their successes. but individuals within a team are blamed for team failures (Naquin & Tynan,
       2003). One aspect of team diversity is their gender mix. Researchers have explored whether gender mix has an
       effect on team performance. On the one hand, diversity can introduce communication and interpersonal-
       relationship problems that hinder performance, but on the other hand diversity can also increase the team's
       skill set, which may include skills that can actually improve team member interactions. Hoogendoorn,
       Oosterbeek, & van Praag (2013) studied project teams in a university business school in which the gender mix
       of the teams was manipulated. They found that gender-balanced teams performed better, as measured by
       sales and profits, than teams made up mostly by men. The study did not have enough data to determine the
       relative performance of teams with more women than men. The study was unsuccessful in identifying which
       mechanism (interpersonal relationships, learning, or skills mixes) accounted for performance improvement.

       There are three basic types of teams: problem resolution teams, creative teams, and tactical teams. Problem
       resolution teams are created for the purpose of solving a particular problem or issue; for example, the
       diagnostic teams at the Centers for Disease Control. Creative teams are used to develop innovative possibilities
       or solutions; for example, design teams for car manufacturers create new vehicle models. Tactical teams are
       used to execute a well-defined plan or objective, such as a police or FBI SWAT team handling a hostage
       situation (Larson & LaFasto, 1989). One area of active research involves a fourth kind of team--the virtual
       team; these studies examine how groups of geographically disparate people brought together using digital
       communications technology function (Powell, Piccoli, & Ives, 2004). Even before the COVID-19 pandemic,
       virtual teams were more common due to the growing globalization of organizations and the use of consulting
       and partnerships facilitated by digital communication.

      Organizational Culture

       Each company and organization has an organizational culture. Organizational culture encompasses the
       values, visions, hierarchies, norms, and interactions among its employees. It is how an organization is run,
       how it operates, and how it makes decisions--the industry in which the organization participates may have an
       influence. Different departments within one company can develop their own subculture within the
       organization's culture. Ostroff, Kinicki, and Tamkins (2003) identify three layers in organizational culture:
       observable artifacts, espoused values, and basic assumptions. Observable artifacts are the symbols, language
       (jargon, slang, and humor), narratives (stories and legends), and practices (rituals) that represent the
       underlying cultural assumptions. Espoused values are concepts or beliefs that the management or the entire
       organization endorses. They are the rules that allow employees to know which actions they should take in
       different situations and which information they should adhere to. These basic assumptions generally are
       unobservable and unquestioned. Researchers have developed survey instruments to measure organizational
       culture.

       With the workforce being a global marketplace, your company may have a supplier in Korea and another in
       Honduras and have employees in the United States, China, and South Africa. You may have coworkers of
       different religious, ethnic, or racial backgrounds than yourself. Your coworkers may be from different places
       around the globe. Many workplaces offer diversity training to help everyone involved bridge and understand
       cultural differences. Diversity training educates participants about cultural differences with the goal of
       improving teamwork. There is always the potential for prejudice between members of two groups, but the
       evidence suggests that simply working together, particularly if the conditions of work are set carefully that
       such prejudice can be reduced or eliminated. Pettigrew and Tropp (2006) conducted a meta-analysis to
       examine the question of whether contact between groups reduced prejudice between those groups. They found
       that there was a moderate but significant effect. They also found that, as previously theorized, the effect was
       enhanced when the two groups met under conditions in which they have equal standing, common goals,
       cooperation between the groups, and especially support on the part of the institution or authorities for the
       contact.

 Managing Generational Differences

  An important consideration in managing employees is age. Workers' expectations and attitudes are developed in
  part by experience in particular cultural time periods. Generational constructs are somewhat arbitrary, yet they
  may be helpful in setting broad directions to organizational management as one generation leaves the workforce
  and another enters it. The baby boomer generation (born between 1946 and 1964) is in the process of leaving
  the workforce and will continue to depart it for a decade or more. Generation X (born between the early 1960s
  and the 1980s) are now in the middle of their careers. Millennials (born from 1979 to the early 1994) began to
  come of age at the turn of the century, and are early in their careers.

  Today, as these three different generations work side by side in the workplace, employers and managers need to
  be able to identify their unique characteristics. Each generation has distinctive expectations, habits, attitudes,
  and motivations (Elmore, 2010). One of the major differences among these generations is knowledge of the use
  of technology in the workplace. Millennials are technologically sophisticated and believe their use of technology
  sets them apart from other generations. They have also been characterized as self-centered and overly self-
  confident. Their attitudinal differences have raised concerns for managers about maintaining their motivation as
  employees and their ability to integrate into organizational culture created by baby boomers (Myers &
  Sadaghiani, 2010). For example, millennials may expect to hear that they need to pay their dues in their jobs
  from baby boomers who believe they paid their dues in their time. Yet millennials may resist doing so because
  they value life outside of work to a greater degree (Myers & Sadaghiani, 2010). Meister & Willyerd (2010) suggest
  alternative approaches to training and mentoring that will engage millennials and adapt to their need for
  feedback from supervisors: reverse mentoring, in which a younger employee educates a senior employee in
  social media or other digital resources. The senior employee then has the opportunity to provide useful guidance
  within a less demanding role.

  Recruiting and retaining millennials and Generation X employees poses challenges that did not exist in previous
  generations. The concept of building a career with the company is not relatable to most Generation X employees,
  who do not expect to stay with one employer for their career. This expectation arises from of a reduced sense of
  loyalty because they do not expect their employer to be loyal to them (Gibson, Greenwood, & Murphy, 2009).
  Retaining Generation X workers thus relies on motivating them by making their work meaningful (Gibson,
  Greenwood, & Murphy, 2009). Since millennials lack an inherent loyalty to the company, retaining them also
  requires effort in the form of nurturing through frequent rewards, praise, and feedback.

  Millennials are also interested in having many choices, including options in work scheduling, choice of job duties,
  and so on. They also expect more training and education from their employers. Companies that offer the best
  benefit package and brand attract millennials (Myers & Sadaghiani, 2010).

One well-recognized negative aspect of organizational culture is a culture of harassment, including sexual
harassment. Most organizations of any size have developed sexual harassment policies that define sexual
harassment (or harassment in general) and the procedures the organization has set in place to prevent and
address it when it does occur. Thus, in most jobs you have held, you were probably made aware of the
company's sexual harassment policy and procedures, and may have received training related to the policy. The
U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (n.d.) provides the following description of sexual
harassment:

      Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a
      sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when this conduct explicitly or implicitly affects an
      individual's employment, unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance, or creates
      an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment. (par. 2)
476 13 · Industrial-Organizational Psychology

       One form of sexual harassment is called quid pro quo. Quid pro quo means you give something to get
       something, and it refers to a situation in which organizational rewards are offered in exchange for sexual
       favors. Quid pro quo harassment is often between an employee and a person with greater power in the
       organization. For example, a supervisor might request an action, such as a kiss or a touch, in exchange for a
       promotion, a positive performance review, or a pay raise. Another form of sexual harassment is the threat of
       withholding a reward if a sexual request is refused. Hostile environment sexual harassment is another type of
       workplace harassment. In this situation, an employee experiences conditions in the workplace that are
       considered hostile or intimidating. For example, a work environment that allows offensive language or jokes or
       displays sexually explicit images. Isolated occurrences of these events do not constitute harassment, but a
       pattern of repeated occurrences does. In addition to violating organizational policies against sexual
       harassment, these forms of harassment are illegal.

       Harassment does not have to be sexual; it may be related to any of the protected classes in the statutes
       regulated by the EEOC: race, national origin, religion, or age.

      Violence in the Workplace

       Workplace violence is any act or threat of physical violence, harassment, intimidation, or other threatening,
       disruptive behavior that occurs at the workplace. It ranges from threats and verbal abuse to physical assaults
       and even homicide (Occupational Safety & Health Administration, 2014).

       There are different targets of workplace violence: a person could commit violence against coworkers,
       supervisors, or property. Warning signs often precede such actions: intimidating behavior, threats, sabotaging
       equipment, or radical changes in a coworker's behavior. Often there is intimidation and then escalation that
       leads to even further escalation. It is important for employees to involve their immediate supervisor if they
       ever feel intimidated or unsafe.

       Murder is the second leading cause of death in the workplace. It is also the primary cause of death for women
       in the workplace. Every year there are nearly two million workers who are physically assaulted or threatened
       with assault. Many are murdered in domestic violence situations by boyfriends or husbands who chose the
       woman's workplace to commit their crimes.

       There are many triggers for workplace violence. A significant trigger is the feeling of being treated unfairly,
       unjustly, or disrespectfully. In a research experiment, Greenberg (1993) examined the reactions of students
       who were given pay for a task. In one group, the students were given extensive explanations for the pay rate. In
       the second group, the students were given a curt uninformative explanation. The students were made to
       believe the supervisor would not know how much money the student withdrew for payment. The rate of
       stealing (taking more pay than they were told they deserved) was higher in the group who had been given the
       limited explanation. This is a demonstration of the importance of procedural justice in organizations.
       Procedural justice refers to the fairness of the processes by which outcomes are determined in conflicts with
       or among employees.

       In another study by Greenberg & Barling (1999), they found a history of aggression and amount of alcohol
       consumed to be accurate predictors of workplace violence against a coworker. Aggression against a supervisor
       was predicted if a worker felt unfairly treated or untrusted. Job security and alcohol consumption predicted
       aggression against a subordinate. To understand and predict workplace violence, Greenberg & Barling (1999)
       emphasize the importance of considering the employee target of aggression or violence and characteristics of
       both the workplace characteristics and the aggressive or violent person.

13.4 Human Factors Psychology and Workplace Design

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Describe the field of human factors psychology
  · Explain the role of human factors psychology in safety, productivity, and job satisfaction

Human factors psychology (or ergonomics, a term that is favored in Europe) is the third subject area within
industrial and organizational psychology. This field is concerned with the integration of the human-machine
interface in the workplace, through design, and specifically with researching and designing machines that fit
human requirements. The integration may be physical or cognitive, or a combination of both. Anyone who
needs to be convinced that the field is necessary need only try to operate an unfamiliar television remote
control or use a new piece of software for the first time. Whereas the two other areas of I-O psychology focus on
the interface between the worker and team, group, or organization, human factors psychology focuses on the
individual worker's interaction with a machine, work station, information displays, and the local environment,
such as lighting. In the United States, human factors psychology has origins in both psychology and
engineering; this is reflected in the early contributions of Lillian Gilbreth (psychologist and engineer) and her
husband Frank Gilbreth (engineer).

Human factor professionals are involved in design from the beginning of a project, as is more common in
software design projects, or toward the end in testing and evaluation, as is more common in traditional
industries (Howell, 2003). Another important role of human factor professionals is in the development of
regulations and principles of best design. These regulations and principles are often related to work safety. For
example, the Three Mile Island nuclear accident lead to Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requirements
for additional instrumentation in nuclear facilities to provide operators with more critical information and
increased operator training (United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 2013). The American National
Standards Institute (ANSI, 2000), an independent developer of industrial standards, develops many standards
related to ergonomic design, such as the design of control-center workstations that are used for transportation
control or industrial process control.

Many of the concerns of human factors psychology are related to workplace safety. These concerns can be
studied to help prevent work-related injuries of individual workers or those around them. Safety protocols may
also be related to activities, such as commercial driving or flying, medical procedures, and law enforcement,
that have the potential to impact the public.

One of the methods used to reduce accidents in the workplace is a checklist. The airline industry is one
industry that uses checklists. Pilots are required to go through a detailed checklist of the different parts of the
aircraft before takeoff to ensure that all essential equipment is working correctly. Astronauts also go through
checklists before takeoff. The surgical safety checklist shown in Figure 13.15 was developed by the World
Health Organization (WHO) and serves as the basis for many checklists at medical facilities.
478 13 · Industrial-Organizational Psychology

            FIGURE 13.15 Checklists, such as the WHO surgical checklist shown here, help reduce workplace accidents.
       Safety concerns also lead to limits to how long an operator, such as a pilot or truck driver, is allowed to operate
       the equipment. Recently the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) introduced limits for how long a pilot is
       allowed to fly without an overnight break.
       Howell (2003) outlines some important areas of research and practice in the field of human factors. These are
       summarized in Table 13.4.

TABLE 13.4

As an example of research in human factors psychology Bruno & Abrahão (2012) examined the impact of the
volume of operator decisions on the accuracy of decisions made within an information security center at a
banking institution in Brazil. The study examined a total of about 45,000 decisions made by 35 operators and
4 managers over a period of 60 days. Their study found that as the number of decisions made per day by the
operators climbed, that is, as their cognitive effort increased, the operators made more mistakes in falsely
identifying incidents as real security breaches (when, in reality, they were not). Interestingly, the opposite
mistake of identifying real intrusions as false alarms did not increase with increased cognitive demand. This
appears to be good news for the bank, since false alarms are not as costly as incorrectly rejecting a genuine
threat. These kinds of studies combine research on attention, perception, teamwork, and human-computer
interactions in a field of considerable societal and business significance. This is exactly the context of the
events that led to the massive data breach for Target in the fall of 2013. Indications are that security personnel
received signals of a security breach but did not interpret them correctly, thus allowing the breach to continue
for two weeks until an outside agency, the FBI, informed the company (Riley, Elgin, Lawrence, & Matlack,
2014).

Summary

13.1 What Is Industrial and Organizational Psychology?

The field of I-O psychology had its birth in industrial psychology and the use of psychological concepts to aid in
personnel selection. However, with research such as the Hawthorne study, it was found that productivity was
affected more by human interaction and not physical factors; the field of industrial psychology expanded to
include organizational psychology. Both WWI and WWII had a strong influence on the development of an
expansion of industrial psychology in the United States and elsewhere: The tasks the psychologists were
assigned led to development of tests and research in how the psychological concepts could assist industry and
other areas. This movement aided in expanding industrial psychology to include organizational psychology.

13.2 Industrial Psychology: Selecting and Evaluating Employees

Industrial psychology studies the attributes of jobs, applicants of those jobs, and methods for assessing fit to a
job. These procedures include job analysis, applicant testing, and interviews. It also studies and puts into place
procedures for the orientation of new employees and ongoing training of employees. The process of hiring
employees can be vulnerable to bias, which is illegal, and industrial psychologists must develop methods for
adhering to the law in hiring. Performance appraisal systems are an active area of research and practice in
industrial psychology.

13.3 Organizational Psychology: The Social Dimension of Work

Organizational psychology is concerned with the effects of interactions among people in the workplace on the
employees themselves and on organizational productivity. Job satisfaction and its determinants and outcomes
are a major focus of organizational psychology research and practice. Organizational psychologists have also
studied the effects of management styles and leadership styles on productivity. In addition to the employees
and management, organizational psychology also looks at the organizational culture and how that might affect
productivity. One aspect of organization culture is the prevention and addressing of sexual and other forms of
harassment in the workplace. Sexual harassment includes language, behavior, or displays that create a hostile
environment; it also includes sexual favors requested in exchange for workplace rewards (i.e., quid pro quo).
Industrial-organizational psychology has conducted extensive research on the triggers and causes of
workplace violence and safety. This enables the organization to establish procedures that can identify these
triggers before they become a problem.

13.4 Human Factors Psychology and Workplace Design

Human factors psychology, or ergonomics, studies the interface between workers and their machines and
physical environments. Human factors psychologists specifically seek to design machines to better support
the workers using them. Psychologists may be involved in design of work tools such as software, displays, or
machines from the beginning of the design process or during the testing an already developed product.
Human factor psychologists are also involved in the development of best design recommendations and
regulations. One important aspect of human factors psychology is enhancing worker safety. Human factors
research involves efforts to understand and improve interactions between technology systems and their
human operators. Human-software interactions are a large sector of this research.

14.2  Stressors
14.3  Stress and Illness
14.4  Regulation of Stress
14.5  The Pursuit of Happiness

INTRODUCTION Few would deny that today's college students are under a lot of pressure. In addition to many
usual stresses and strains incidental to the college experience (e.g., exams and term papers), students today
are faced with increased college tuitions, burdensome debt, and difficulty finding employment after
graduation. A significant population of non-traditional college students may face additional stressors, such as
raising children or holding down a full-time job while working toward a degree.

Of course, life is filled with many additional challenges beyond those incurred in college or the workplace. We
might have concerns with financial security, difficulties with friends or neighbors, family responsibilities, and
we may not have enough time to do the things we want to do. Even minor hassles--losing things, traffic jams,
and loss of internet service--all involve pressure and demands that can make life seem like a struggle and that
can compromise our sense of well-being. That is, all can be stressful in some way.

Scientific interest in stress, including how we adapt and cope, has been longstanding in psychology; indeed,
after nearly a century of research on the topic, much has been learned and many insights have been
developed. This chapter examines stress and highlights our current understanding of the phenomenon,
including its psychological and physiological natures, its causes and consequences, and the steps we can take
to master stress rather than become its victim.

     14.1 What Is Stress?

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Differentiate between stimulus-based and response-based definitions of stress
         · Define stress as a process
         · Differentiate between good stress and bad stress
         · Describe the early contributions of Walter Cannon and Hans Selye to the stress research field
         · Understand the physiological basis of stress and describe the general adaptation syndrome

       The term stress as it relates to the human condition first emerged in scientific literature in the 1930s, but it did
       not enter the popular vernacular until the 1970s (Lyon, 2012). Today, we often use the term loosely in
       describing a variety of unpleasant feeling states; for example, we often say we are stressed out when we feel
       frustrated, angry, conflicted, overwhelmed, or fatigued. Despite the widespread use of the term, stress is a
       fairly vague concept that is difficult to define with precision.

       Researchers have had a difficult time agreeing on an acceptable definition of stress. Some have conceptualized
       stress as a demanding or threatening event or situation (e.g., a high-stress job, overcrowding, and long
       commutes to work). Such conceptualizations are known as stimulus-based definitions because they
       characterize stress as a stimulus that causes certain reactions. Stimulus-based definitions of stress are
       problematic, however, because they fail to recognize that people differ in how they view and react to
       challenging life events and situations. For example, a conscientious student who has studied diligently all
       semester would likely experience less stress during final exams week than would a less responsible,
       unprepared student.

       Others have conceptualized stress in ways that emphasize the physiological responses that occur when faced
       with demanding or threatening situations (e.g., increased arousal). These conceptualizations are referred to as
       response-based definitions because they describe stress as a response to environmental conditions. For
       example, the endocrinologist Hans Selye, a famous stress researcher, once defined stress as the "response of
       the body to any demand, whether it is caused by, or results in, pleasant or unpleasant conditions" (Selye, 1976,
       p. 74). Selye's definition of stress is response-based in that it conceptualizes stress chiefly in terms of the
       body's physiological reaction to any demand that is placed on it. Neither stimulus-based nor response-based
       definitions provide a complete definition of stress. Many of the physiological reactions that occur when faced
       with demanding situations (e.g., accelerated heart rate) can also occur in response to things that most people
       would not consider to be genuinely stressful, such as receiving unanticipated good news: an unexpected
       promotion or raise.

       A useful way to conceptualize stress is to view it as a process whereby an individual perceives and responds to
       events that they appraise as overwhelming or threatening to their well-being (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). A
       critical element of this definition is that it emphasizes the importance of how we appraise--that is,
       judge--demanding or threatening events (often referred to as stressors); these appraisals, in turn, influence
       our reactions to such events. Two kinds of appraisals of a stressor are especially important in this regard:
       primary and secondary appraisals. A primary appraisal involves judgment about the degree of potential harm
       or threat to well-being that a stressor might entail. A stressor would likely be appraised as a threat if one
       anticipates that it could lead to some kind of harm, loss, or other negative consequence; conversely, a stressor
       would likely be appraised as a challenge if one believes that it carries the potential for gain or personal growth.
       For example, an employee who is promoted to a leadership position would likely perceive the promotion as a
       much greater threat if they believed the promotion would lead to excessive work demands than if they viewed
       it as an opportunity to gain new skills and grow professionally. Similarly, a college student on the cusp of
       graduation may face the change as a threat or a challenge (Figure 14.2).

FIGURE 14.2 Graduating from college and entering the workforce can be viewed as either a threat (loss of financial
support) or a challenge (opportunity for independence and growth). (credit: Timothy Zanker)
The perception of a threat triggers a secondary appraisal: judgment of the options available to cope with a
stressor, as well as perceptions of how effective such options will be (Lyon, 2012) (Figure 14.3). As you may
recall from what you learned about self-efficacy, an individual's belief in their ability to complete a task is
important (Bandura, 1994). A threat tends to be viewed as less catastrophic if one believes something can be
done about it (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). Imagine that two middle-aged people, Robin and Madhuri, perform
breast self-examinations one morning and each notices a lump on the lower region of their left breast.
Although both view the breast lump as a potential threat (primary appraisal), their secondary appraisals differ
considerably. In considering the breast lump, some of the thoughts racing through Robin's mind are, "Oh my
God, I could have breast cancer! What if the cancer has spread to the rest of my body and I cannot recover?
What if I have to go through chemotherapy? I've heard that experience is awful! What if I have to quit my job?
My partner and I won't have enough money to pay the mortgage. Oh, this is just horrible...I can't deal with it!"
On the other hand, Madhuri thinks, "Hmm, this may not be good. Although most times these things turn out to
be benign, I need to have it checked out. If it turns out to be breast cancer, there are doctors who can take care
of it because the medical technology today is quite advanced. I'll have a lot of different options, and I'll be just
fine." Clearly, Robin and Madhuri have different outlooks on what might turn out to be a very serious situation:
Robin seems to think that little could be done about it, whereas Madhuri believes that, worst case scenario, a
number of options that are likely to be effective would be available. As such, Robin would clearly experience
greater stress than would Madhuri.

       FIGURE 14.3 When encountering a stressor, a person judges its potential threat (primary appraisal) and then
       determines if effective options are available to manage the situation. Stress is likely to result if a stressor is
       perceived as extremely threatening or threatening with few or no effective coping options available.
       To be sure, some stressors are inherently more stressful than others in that they are more threatening and
       leave less potential for variation in cognitive appraisals (e.g., objective threats to one's health or safety).
       Nevertheless, appraisal will still play a role in augmenting or diminishing our reactions to such events (Everly
       & Lating, 2002).
       If a person appraises an event as harmful and believes that the demands imposed by the event exceed the
       available resources to manage or adapt to it, the person will subjectively experience a state of stress. In
       contrast, if one does not appraise the same event as harmful or threatening, she is unlikely to experience
       stress. According to this definition, environmental events trigger stress reactions by the way they are
       interpreted and the meanings they are assigned. In short, stress is largely in the eye of the beholder: it's not so
       much what happens to you as it is how you respond (Selye, 1976).

      Good Stress?

       Although stress carries a negative connotation, at times it may be of some benefit. Stress can motivate us to do
       things in our best interests, such as study for exams, visit the doctor regularly, exercise, and perform to the
       best of our ability at work. Indeed, Selye (1974) pointed out that not all stress is harmful. He argued that stress

                                                                                                                                                             14.1 · What Is Stress? 489

can sometimes be a positive, motivating force that can improve the quality of our lives. This kind of stress,
which Selye called eustress (from the Greek eu = "good"), is a good kind of stress associated with positive
feelings, optimal health, and performance. A moderate amount of stress can be beneficial in challenging
situations. For example, athletes may be motivated and energized by pregame stress, and students may
experience similar beneficial stress before a major exam. Indeed, research shows that moderate stress can
enhance both immediate and delayed recall of educational material. Participants in one study who memorized
a scientific text passage showed improved memory of the passage immediately after exposure to a mild
stressor as well as one day following exposure to the stressor (Hupbach & Fieman, 2012).
Increasing one's level of stress will cause performance to change in a predictable way. As shown in Figure 14.4,
as stress increases, so do performance and general well-being (eustress); when stress levels reach an optimal
level (the highest point of the curve), performance reaches its peak. A person at this stress level is colloquially
at the top of their game, meaning they feel fully energized, focused, and can work with minimal effort and
maximum efficiency. But when stress exceeds this optimal level, it is no longer a positive force--it becomes
excessive and debilitating, or what Selye termed distress (from the Latin dis = "bad"). People who reach this
level of stress feel burned out; they are fatigued, exhausted, and their performance begins to decline. If the
stress remains excessive, health may begin to erode as well (Everly & Lating, 2002). A good example of distress
is severe test anxiety. When students are feeling very stressed about a test, negative emotions combined with
physical symptoms may make concentration difficult, thereby negatively affecting test scores.

FIGURE 14.4 As the stress level increases from low to moderate, so does performance (eustress). At the optimal
level (the peak of the curve), performance has reached its peak. If stress exceeds the optimal level, it will reach the
distress region, where it will become excessive and debilitating, and performance will decline (Everly & Lating,
2002).

The Prevalence of Stress

Stress is everywhere and, as shown in Figure 14.5, it has been on the rise over the last several years. Each of us
is acquainted with stress--some are more familiar than others. In many ways, stress feels like a load you just
can't carry--a feeling you experience when, for example, you have to drive somewhere in a blizzard, when you
wake up late the morning of an important job interview, when you run out of money before the next pay
period, and before taking an important exam for which you realize you are not fully prepared.
490 14 · Stress, Lifestyle, and Health

       FIGURE 14.5 Nearly half of U.S. adults indicated that their stress levels have increased over the last five years
       (Neelakantan, 2013).
       Stress is an experience that evokes a variety of responses, including those that are physiological (e.g.,
       accelerated heart rate, headaches, or gastrointestinal problems), cognitive (e.g., difficulty concentrating or
       making decisions), and behavioral (e.g., drinking alcohol, smoking, or taking actions directed at eliminating
       the cause of the stress). Although stress can be positive at times, it can have deleterious health implications,
       contributing to the onset and progression of a variety of physical illnesses and diseases (Cohen & Herbert,
       1996).
       The scientific study of how stress and other psychological factors impact health falls within the realm of health
       psychology, a subfield of psychology devoted to understanding the importance of psychological influences on
       health, illness, and how people respond when they become ill (Taylor, 1999). Health psychology emerged as a
       discipline in the 1970s, a time during which there was increasing awareness of the role behavioral and lifestyle
       factors play in the development of illnesses and diseases (Straub, 2007). In addition to studying the connection
       between stress and illness, health psychologists investigate issues such as why people make certain lifestyle
       choices (e.g., smoking or eating unhealthy food despite knowing the potential adverse health implications of
       such behaviors). Health psychologists also design and investigate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at
       changing unhealthy behaviors. Perhaps one of the more fundamental tasks of health psychologists is to
       identify which groups of people are especially at risk for negative health outcomes, based on psychological or
       behavioral factors. For example, measuring differences in stress levels among demographic groups and how
       these levels change over time can help identify populations who may have an increased risk for illness or
       disease.
       Figure 14.6 depicts the results of three national surveys in which several thousand individuals from different
       demographic groups completed a brief stress questionnaire; the surveys were administered in 1983, 2006,
       and 2009 (Cohen & Janicki-Deverts, 2012). All three surveys demonstrated higher stress in women than in
       men. Unemployed individuals reported high levels of stress in all three surveys, as did those with less
       education and income; retired persons reported the lowest stress levels. However, from 2006 to 2009 the
       greatest increase in stress levels occurred among men, Hispanic people aged 45-64, college graduates, and
       those with full-time employment. One interpretation of these findings is that concerns surrounding the
       2008-2009 economic downturn (e.g., threat of or actual job loss and substantial loss of retirement savings)
       may have been especially stressful to college-educated employed men with limited time remaining in their
       working careers.

century time span.

Early Contributions to the Study of Stress

As previously stated, scientific interest in stress goes back nearly a century. One of the early pioneers in the
study of stress was Walter Cannon, an eminent American physiologist at Harvard Medical School (Figure 14.7).
In the early part of the 20th century, Cannon was the first to identify the body's physiological reactions to
stress.
492 14 · Stress, Lifestyle, and Health

       FIGURE 14.7 Harvard physiologist Walter Cannon first articulated and named the fight-or-flight response, the
       nervous system's sympathetic response to a significant stressor.
       Cannon and the Fight-or-Flight Response
       Imagine that you are hiking in the beautiful mountains of Colorado on a warm and sunny spring day. At one
       point during your hike, a large, frightening-looking black bear appears from behind a stand of trees and sits
       about 50 yards from you. The bear notices you, sits up, and begins to lumber in your direction. In addition to
       thinking, "This is definitely not good," a constellation of physiological reactions begins to take place inside you.
       Prompted by a deluge of epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) from your adrenal
       glands, your pupils begin to dilate. Your heart starts to pound and speeds up, you begin to breathe heavily and
       perspire, you get butterflies in your stomach, and your muscles become tense, preparing you to take some kind
       of direct action. Cannon proposed that this reaction, which he called the fight-or-flight response, occurs when
       a person experiences very strong emotions--especially those associated with a perceived threat (Cannon,
       1932). During the fight-or-flight response, the body is rapidly aroused by activation of both the sympathetic
       nervous system and the endocrine system (Figure 14.8). This arousal helps prepare the person to either fight
       or flee from a perceived threat.

                                        FIGURE 14.8 Fight or flight is a physiological response to a stressor.
       According to Cannon, the fight-or-flight response is a built-in mechanism that assists in maintaining

homeostasis--an internal environment in which physiological variables such as blood pressure, respiration,
digestion, and temperature are stabilized at levels optimal for survival. Thus, Cannon viewed the fight-or-flight
response as adaptive because it enables people to adjust internally and externally to threats in their
environment, allowing them to continue to be alive and overcome the threat.
Selye and the General Adaptation Syndrome
Another important early contributor to the stress field was Hans Selye, mentioned earlier. He would eventually
become one of the world's foremost experts in the study of stress (Figure 14.9). As a young assistant in the
biochemistry department at McGill University in the 1930s, Selye was engaged in research involving sex
hormones in rats. Although he was unable to find an answer for what he was initially researching, he
incidentally discovered that when exposed to prolonged negative stimulation (stressors)--such as extreme
cold, surgical injury, excessive muscular exercise, and shock--the rats showed signs of adrenal enlargement,
thymus and lymph node shrinkage, and stomach ulceration. Selye realized that these responses were triggered
by a coordinated series of physiological reactions that unfold over time during continued exposure to a
stressor. These physiological reactions were nonspecific, which means that regardless of the type of stressor,
the same pattern of reactions would occur. What Selye discovered was the general adaptation syndrome, the
body's nonspecific physiological response to stress.

FIGURE 14.9 Hans Selye specialized in research about stress. In 2009, his native Hungary honored his work with
this stamp, released in conjunction with the 2nd annual World Conference on Stress.
The general adaptation syndrome, shown in Figure 14.10, consists of three stages: (1) alarm reaction, (2) stage
of resistance, and (3) stage of exhaustion (Selye, 1936; 1976). Alarm reaction describes the body's immediate
reaction upon facing a threatening situation or emergency, and it is roughly analogous to the fight-or-flight
response described by Cannon. During an alarm reaction, you are alerted to a stressor, and your body alarms
you with a cascade of physiological reactions that provide you with the energy to manage the situation. A
person who wakes up in the middle of the night to discover her house is on fire, for example, is experiencing an
alarm reaction.

FIGURE 14.10 The three stages of Selye's general adaptation syndrome are shown in this graph. Prolonged stress
ultimately results in exhaustion.
494 14 · Stress, Lifestyle, and Health

       If exposure to a stressor is prolonged, the organism will enter the stage of resistance. During this stage, the
       initial shock of alarm reaction has worn off and the body has adapted to the stressor. Nevertheless, the body
       also remains on alert and is prepared to respond as it did during the alarm reaction, although with less
       intensity. For example, suppose a child who went missing is still missing 72 hours later. Although the parents
       would obviously remain extremely disturbed, the magnitude of physiological reactions would likely have
       diminished over the 72 intervening hours due to some adaptation to this event.
       If exposure to a stressor continues over a longer period of time, the stage of exhaustion ensues. At this stage,
       the person is no longer able to adapt to the stressor: the body's ability to resist becomes depleted as physical
       wear takes its toll on the body's tissues and organs. As a result, illness, disease, and other permanent damage
       to the body--even death--may occur. If a missing child still remained missing after three months, the long-
       term stress associated with this situation may cause a parent to literally faint with exhaustion at some point or
       even to develop a serious and irreversible illness.
       In short, Selye's general adaptation syndrome suggests that stressors tax the body via a three-phase
       process--an initial jolt, subsequent readjustment, and a later depletion of all physical resources--that
       ultimately lays the groundwork for serious health problems and even death. It should be pointed out, however,
       that this model is a response-based conceptualization of stress, focusing exclusively on the body's physical
       responses while largely ignoring psychological factors such as appraisal and interpretation of threats.
       Nevertheless, Selye's model has had an enormous impact on the field of stress because it offers a general
       explanation for how stress can lead to physical damage and, thus, disease. As we shall discuss later, prolonged
       or repeated stress has been implicated in development of a number of disorders such as hypertension and
       coronary artery disease.

      The Physiological Basis of Stress

       What goes on inside our bodies when we experience stress? The physiological mechanisms of stress are
       extremely complex, but they generally involve the work of two systems--the sympathetic nervous system and
       the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. When a person first perceives something as stressful (Selye's
       alarm reaction), the sympathetic nervous system triggers arousal via the release of adrenaline from the
       adrenal glands. Release of these hormones activates the fight-or-flight responses to stress, such as accelerated
       heart rate and respiration. At the same time, the HPA axis, which is primarily endocrine in nature, becomes
       especially active, although it works much more slowly than the sympathetic nervous system. In response to
       stress, the hypothalamus (one of the limbic structures in the brain) releases corticotropin-releasing factor, a
       hormone that causes the pituitary gland to release adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (Figure 14.11). The
       ACTH then activates the adrenal glands to secrete a number of hormones into the bloodstream; an important
       one is cortisol, which can affect virtually every organ within the body. Cortisol is commonly known as a stress
       hormone and helps provide that boost of energy when we first encounter a stressor, preparing us to run away
       or fight. However, sustained elevated levels of cortisol weaken the immune system.

                                                                                                                                                             14.1 · What Is Stress? 495

FIGURE 14.11 This diagram shows the functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The
hypothalamus activates the pituitary gland, which in turn activates the adrenal glands, increasing their secretion of
cortisol.
In short bursts, this process can have some favorable effects, such as providing extra energy, improving
immune system functioning temporarily, and decreasing pain sensitivity. However, extended release of
cortisol--as would happen with prolonged or chronic stress--often comes at a high price. High levels of cortisol
have been shown to produce a number of harmful effects. For example, increases in cortisol can significantly
weaken our immune system (Glaser & Kiecolt-Glaser, 2005), and high levels are frequently observed among
depressed individuals (Geoffroy, Hertzman, Li, & Power, 2013). In summary, a stressful event causes a variety
of physiological reactions that activate the adrenal glands, which in turn release epinephrine, norepinephrine,
and cortisol. These hormones affect a number of bodily processes in ways that prepare the stressed person to
take direct action, but also in ways that may heighten the potential for illness.
When stress is extreme or chronic, it can have profoundly negative consequences. For example, stress often
contributes to the development of certain psychological disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder,
major depressive disorder, and other serious psychiatric conditions. Additionally, we noted earlier that stress
is linked to the development and progression of a variety of physical illnesses and diseases. For example,
researchers in one study found that people injured during the September 11, 2001, World Trade Center
disaster or who developed post-traumatic stress symptoms afterward later suffered significantly elevated rates
of heart disease (Jordan, Miller-Archie, Cone, Morabia, & Stellman, 2011). Another investigation yielded that
self-reported stress symptoms among aging and retired Finnish food industry workers were associated with
morbidity 11 years later. This study also predicted the onset of musculoskeletal, nervous system, and
endocrine and metabolic disorders (Salonen, Arola, Nygård, & Huhtala, 2008). Another study reported that
male South Korean manufacturing employees who reported high levels of work-related stress were more likely
to catch the common cold over the next several months than were those employees who reported lower work-
related stress levels (Park et al., 2011). Later, you will explore the mechanisms through which stress can
produce physical illness and disease.

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe different types of possible stressors
         · Explain the importance of life changes as potential stressors
         · Describe the Social Readjustment Rating Scale
         · Understand the concepts of job strain and job burnout
       For an individual to experience stress, they must first encounter a potential stressor. In general, stressors can
       be placed into one of two broad categories: chronic and acute. Chronic stressors include events that persist
       over an extended period of time, such as caring for a parent with dementia, long-term unemployment, or
       imprisonment. Acute stressors involve brief focal events that sometimes continue to be experienced as
       overwhelming well after the event has ended, such as falling on an icy sidewalk and breaking your leg (Cohen,
       Janicki-Deverts, & Miller, 2007). Whether chronic or acute, potential stressors come in many shapes and sizes.
       They can include major traumatic events, significant life changes, daily hassles, as well as other situations in
       which a person is regularly exposed to threat, challenge, or danger.

      Traumatic Events

       Some stressors involve traumatic events or situations in which a person is exposed to actual or threatened
       death or serious injury. Stressors in this category include exposure to military combat, threatened or actual
       physical assaults (e.g., physical attacks, sexual assault, robbery, childhood abuse), terrorist attacks, natural
       disasters (e.g., earthquakes, floods, hurricanes), and automobile accidents. Men, non-White people, and
       individuals in lower socioeconomic status (SES) groups report experiencing a greater number of traumatic
       events than do women, White people, and individuals in higher SES groups (Hatch & Dohrenwend, 2007).
       Some individuals who are exposed to stressors of extreme magnitude develop post-traumatic stress disorder
       (PTSD): a chronic stress reaction characterized by experiences and behaviors that may include intrusive and
       painful memories of the stressor event, jumpiness, persistent negative emotional states, detachment from
       others, angry outbursts, and avoidance of reminders of the event (American Psychiatric Association [APA],
       2013).

      Life Changes

       Most stressors that we encounter are not nearly as intense as the ones described above. Many potential
       stressors we face involve events or situations that require us to make changes in our ongoing lives and require
       time as we adjust to those changes. Examples include death of a close family member, marriage, divorce, and
       moving (Figure 14.12).

intentional and positive, the amount of resulting change in daily life can cause stress. (credit: "Jellaluna"/Flickr)

In the 1960s, psychiatrists Thomas Holmes and Richard Rahe wanted to examine the link between life
stressors and physical illness, based on the hypothesis that life events requiring significant changes in a
person's normal life routines are stressful, whether these events are desirable or undesirable. They developed
the Social Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS), consisting of 43 life events that require varying degrees of
personal readjustment (Holmes & Rahe, 1967). Many life events that most people would consider pleasant
(e.g., holidays, retirement, marriage) are among those listed on the SRRS; these are examples of eustress.
Holmes and Rahe also proposed that life events can add up over time, and that experiencing a cluster of
stressful events increases one's risk of developing physical illnesses.

In developing their scale, Holmes and Rahe asked 394 participants to provide a numerical estimate for each of
the 43 items; each estimate corresponded to how much readjustment participants felt each event would
require. These estimates resulted in mean value scores for each event--often called life change units (LCUs)
(Rahe, McKeen, & Arthur, 1967). The numerical scores ranged from 11 to 100, representing the perceived
magnitude of life change each event entails. Death of a spouse ranked highest on the scale with 100 LCUs, and
divorce ranked second highest with 73 LCUs. In addition, personal injury or illness, marriage, and job
termination also ranked highly on the scale with 53, 50, and 47 LCUs, respectively. Conversely, change in
residence (20 LCUs), change in eating habits (15 LCUs), and vacation (13 LCUs) ranked low on the scale (Table
14.1). Minor violations of the law ranked the lowest with 11 LCUs. To complete the scale, participants checked
yes for events experienced within the last 12 months. LCUs for each checked item are totaled for a score
quantifying the amount of life change. Agreement on the amount of adjustment required by the various life
events on the SRRS is highly consistent, even cross-culturally (Holmes & Masuda, 1974).

Extensive research has demonstrated that accumulating a high number of life change units within a brief
period of time (one or two years) is related to a wide range of physical illnesses (even accidents and athletic
injuries) and mental health problems (Monat & Lazarus, 1991; Scully, Tosi, & Banning, 2000). In an early
demonstration, researchers obtained LCU scores for U.S. and Norwegian Navy personnel who were about to
embark on a six-month voyage. A later examination of medical records revealed positive (but small)
correlations between LCU scores prior to the voyage and subsequent illness symptoms during the ensuing six-
month journey (Rahe, 1974). In addition, people tend to experience more physical symptoms, such as
backache, upset stomach, diarrhea, and acne, on specific days in which self-reported LCU values are
considerably higher than normal, such as the day of a family member's wedding (Holmes & Holmes, 1970).

The Social Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS) provides researchers a simple, easy-to-administer way of
assessing the amount of stress in people's lives, and it has been used in hundreds of studies (Thoits, 2010).
Despite its widespread use, the scale has been subject to criticism. First, many of the items on the SRRS are
vague; for example, death of a close friend could involve the death of a long-absent childhood friend that
requires little social readjustment (Dohrenwend, 2006). In addition, some have challenged its assumption that
undesirable life events are no more stressful than desirable ones (Derogatis & Coons, 1993). However, most of
the available evidence suggests that, at least as far as mental health is concerned, undesirable or negative
events are more strongly associated with poor outcomes (such as depression) than are desirable, positive
events (Hatch & Dohrenwend, 2007). Perhaps the most serious criticism is that the scale does not take into
consideration respondents' appraisals of the life events it contains. As you recall, appraisal of a stressor is a
key element in the conceptualization and overall experience of stress. Being fired from work may be
devastating to some but a welcome opportunity to obtain a better job for others. The SRRS remains one of the
most well-known instruments in the study of stress, and it is a useful tool for identifying potential stress-
related health outcomes (Scully et al., 2000).

Correlational Research

The Holmes and Rahe Social Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS) uses the correlational research method to identify
the connection between stress and health. That is, respondents' LCU scores are correlated with the number or
frequency of self-reported symptoms indicating health problems. These correlations are typically positive--as LCU
scores increase, the number of symptoms increase. Consider all the thousands of studies that have used this scale
to correlate stress and illness symptoms: If you were to assign an average correlation coefficient to this body of
research, what would be your best guess? How strong do you think the correlation coefficient would be? Why can't
the SRRS show a causal relationship between stress and illness? If it were possible to show causation, do you think
stress causes illness or illness causes stress?

Hassles

Potential stressors do not always involve major life events. Daily hassles--the minor irritations and
annoyances that are part of our everyday lives (e.g., rush hour traffic, lost keys, obnoxious coworkers,
inclement weather, arguments with friends or family)--can build on one another and leave us just as stressed
as life change events (Figure 14.13) (Kanner, Coyne, Schaefer, & Lazarus, 1981).

FIGURE 14.13 Daily commutes, whether (a) on the road or (b) via public transportation, can be hassles that
contribute to our feelings of everyday stress. (credit a: modification of work by Jeff Turner; credit b: modification of
work by "epSos.de"/Flickr)
Researchers have demonstrated that the frequency of daily hassles is actually a better predictor of both
physical and psychological health than are life change units. In a well-known study of San Francisco residents,
the frequency of daily hassles was found to be more strongly associated with physical health problems than
were life change events (DeLongis, Coyne, Dakof, Folkman, & Lazarus, 1982). In addition, daily minor hassles,
especially interpersonal conflicts, often lead to negative and distressed mood states (Bolger, DeLongis, Kessler,
& Schilling, 1989). Cyber hassles that occur on social media may represent a modern and evolving source of
stress. In one investigation, social media stress was tied to loss of sleep in adolescents, presumably because
ruminating about social media caused a physiological stress response that increased arousal (van der Schuur,
Baumgartner, & Sumter, 2018). Clearly, daily hassles can add up and take a toll on us both emotionally and
physically.

OCCUPATION-RELATED Stressors

Stressors can include situations in which one is frequently exposed to challenging and unpleasant events,
such as difficult, demanding, or unsafe working conditions. Although most jobs and occupations can at times
be demanding, some are clearly more stressful than others (Figure 14.14). For example, most people would
likely agree that a firefighter's work is inherently more stressful than that of a florist. Equally likely, most would
agree that jobs containing various unpleasant elements, such as those requiring exposure to loud noise (heavy
equipment operator), constant harassment and threats of physical violence (prison guard), perpetual
frustration (bus driver in a major city), or those mandating that an employee work alternating day and night
shifts (hotel desk clerk), are much more demanding--and thus, more stressful--than those that do not contain
such elements. Table 14.2 lists several occupations and some of the specific stressors associated with those
occupations (Sulsky & Smith, 2005).

Although the specific stressors for these occupations are diverse, they seem to share some common
denominators such as heavy workload and uncertainty about and lack of control over certain aspects of a job.
Chronic occupational stress contributes to job strain, a work situation that combines excessive job demands
and workload with little discretion in decision making or job control (Karasek & Theorell, 1990). Clearly, many
occupations other than the ones listed in Table 14.2 involve at least a moderate amount of job strain in that
they often involve heavy workloads and little job control (e.g., inability to decide when to take breaks). Such
jobs are often low-status and include those of factory workers, postal clerks, supermarket cashiers, taxi

drivers, and short-order cooks. Job strain can have adverse consequences on both physical and mental health;
it has been shown to be associated with increased risk of hypertension (Schnall & Landsbergis, 1994), heart
attacks (Theorell et al., 1998), recurrence of heart disease after a first heart attack (Aboa-Éboulé et al., 2007),
significant weight loss or gain (Kivimäki et al., 2006), and major depressive disorder (Stansfeld, Shipley, Head,
& Fuhrer, 2012). A longitudinal study of over 10,000 British civil servants reported that workers under 50 years
old who earlier had reported high job strain were 68% more likely to later develop heart disease than were
those workers under 50 years old who reported little job strain (Chandola et al., 2008).

Some people who are exposed to chronically stressful work conditions can experience job burnout, which is a
general sense of emotional exhaustion and cynicism in relation to one's job (Maslach & Jackson, 1981). Job
burnout occurs frequently among those in human service jobs (e.g., social workers, teachers, therapists, and
police officers). Job burnout consists of three dimensions. The first dimension is exhaustion--a sense that
one's emotional resources are drained or that one is at the end of their rope and has nothing more to give at a
psychological level. Second, job burnout is characterized by depersonalization: a sense of emotional
detachment between the worker and the recipients of their services, often resulting in callous, cynical, or
indifferent attitudes toward these individuals. Third, job burnout is characterized by diminished personal
accomplishment, which is the tendency to evaluate one's work negatively by, for example, experiencing
dissatisfaction with one's job-related accomplishments or feeling as though one has categorically failed to
influence others' lives through one's work.

Job strain appears to be one of the greatest risk factors leading to job burnout, which is most commonly
observed in workers who are older (ages 55-64), unmarried, and whose jobs involve manual labor. Heavy
alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, being overweight, and having a physical or lifetime mental disorder
are also associated with job burnout (Ahola, et al., 2006). In addition, depression often co-occurs with job
burnout. One large-scale study of over 3,000 Finnish employees reported that half of the participants with
severe job burnout had some form of depressive disorder (Ahola et al., 2005). Job burnout is often precipitated
by feelings of having invested considerable energy, effort, and time into one's work while receiving little in
return (e.g., little respect or support from others or low pay) (Tatris, Peeters, Le Blanc, Schreurs, & Schaufeli,
2001).

As an illustration, consider Tyre, a nursing assistant who worked in a nursing home. Tyre worked long hours
for little pay in a difficult facility. Tyre's supervisor was domineering, unpleasant, and unsupportive, as well as
disrespectful of Tyre's personal time, frequently informing them at the last minute they must work several
additional hours after their shift ended or report to work on weekends. Tyre had very little autonomy at work.
They had little input in day-to-day duties and how to perform them, and was not permitted to take breaks
unless explicitly told by their supervisor. Tyre did not feel as though their hard work was appreciated, either by
supervisory staff or by the residents of the home. Tyre was very unhappy over the low pay, and felt that many
of the residents treated them disrespectfully.

After several years, Tyre began to hate their job. Tyre dreaded going to work in the morning, and gradually
developed a callous, hostile attitude toward many of the residents. Eventually, they began to feel they could no
longer help the nursing home residents. Tyre's absenteeism from work increased, and one day they decided
that they had had enough and quit. Tyre now has a job in sales, vowing never to work in nursing again.

Finally, our close relationships with friends and family--particularly the negative aspects of these
relationships--can be a potent source of stress. Negative aspects of close relationships can include conflicts
502 14 · Stress, Lifestyle, and Health

       such as disagreements or arguments, lack of emotional support or confiding, and lack of reciprocity. All of
       these can be overwhelming, threatening to the relationship, and thus stressful. Such stressors can take a toll
       both emotionally and physically. A longitudinal investigation of over 9,000 British civil servants found that
       those who at one point had reported the highest levels of negative interactions in their closest relationship
       were 34% more likely to experience serious heart problems (fatal or nonfatal heart attacks) over a 13-15 year
       period, compared to those who experienced the lowest levels of negative interaction (De Vogli, Chandola &
       Marmot, 2007).

     14.3 Stress and Illness

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain the nature of psychophysiological disorders
         · Describe the immune system and how stress impacts its functioning
         · Describe how stress and emotional factors can lead to the development and exacerbation of cardiovascular

             disorders, asthma, and tension headaches

       In this section, we will discuss stress and illness. As stress researcher Robert Sapolsky (1998) describes,

             stress-related disease emerges, predominantly, out of the fact that we so often activate a physiological
             system that has evolved for responding to acute physical emergencies, but we turn it on for months on
             end, worrying about mortgages, relationships, and promotions. (p. 6)

       The stress response, as noted earlier, consists of a coordinated but complex system of physiological reactions
       that are called upon as needed. These reactions are beneficial at times because they prepare us to deal with
       potentially dangerous or threatening situations (for example, recall our old friend, the fearsome bear on the
       trail). However, health is affected when physiological reactions are sustained, as can happen in response to
       ongoing stress.

      Psychophysiological Disorders

       If the reactions that compose the stress response are chronic or if they frequently exceed normal ranges, they
       can lead to cumulative wear and tear on the body, in much the same way that running your air conditioner on
       full blast all summer will eventually cause wear and tear on it. For example, the high blood pressure that a
       person under considerable job strain experiences might eventually take a toll on their heart and set the stage
       for a heart attack or heart failure. Also, someone exposed to high levels of the stress hormone cortisol might
       become vulnerable to infection or disease because of weakened immune system functioning (McEwen, 1998).

       Neuroscientists Robert Sapolsky and Carol Shively have conducted extensive research on stress in non-human
       primates for over 30 years. Both have shown that position in the social hierarchy predicts stress, mental health
       status, and disease. Their research sheds light on how stress may lead to negative health outcomes for
       stigmatized or ostracized people. Here are two videos featuring Dr. Sapolsky: one is regarding killer stress
       (http://openstax.org/l/sapolsky1) and the other is an excellent in-depth documentary (http://openstax.org/l/

       Physical disorders or diseases whose symptoms are brought about or worsened by stress and emotional
       factors are called psychophysiological disorders. The physical symptoms of psychophysiological disorders
       are real and they can be produced or exacerbated by psychological factors (hence the psycho and physiological
       in psychophysiological). A list of frequently encountered psychophysiological disorders is provided in Table

Friedman and Booth-Kewley (1987) statistically reviewed 101 studies to examine the link between personality
and illness. They proposed the existence of disease-prone personality characteristics, including depression,
anger/hostility, and anxiety. Indeed, a study of over 61,000 Norwegians identified depression as a risk factor
for all major disease-related causes of death (Mykletun et al., 2007). In addition, neuroticism--a personality
trait that reflects how anxious, moody, and sad one is--has been identified as a risk factor for chronic health
problems and mortality (Ploubidis & Grundy, 2009).

Below, we discuss two kinds of psychophysiological disorders about which a great deal is known:
cardiovascular disorders and asthma. First, however, it is necessary to turn our attention to a discussion of the
immune system--one of the major pathways through which stress and emotional factors can lead to illness and
disease.

 Social Status, Stress, and Health Care

  Psychologists have long been aware that social status (e.g., wealth, privilege) is intimately tied to stress, health,
  and well-being. Some factors that contribute to high stress and poor health among people with lower social
  status include lack of control and predictability (e.g., greater unemployment) and resource inequality (e.g., less
  access to health care and other community resources) (Marmot & Sapolsky, 2014).

  In the United States, resource inequalities tied to social status often create race and gender differences in health
  care. For example, African American women have the highest rates of emergency room visits and unmet health
  care needs compared to any other group, and this disparity increased significantly from 2006 to 2014 (Manuel,
  2018). Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth often experience poor quality of care as a result of stigma,
  lack of understanding, and insensitivity among health care professionals (Hafeez, Zeshan, Tahir, Jahan, &
  Naveed, 2017). One goal of the U.S. government's Healthy People 2020 initiative is to eliminate gender and race
  disparities in health care. Their interactive dataset provides an updated snapshot of health disparities:

Stress and the Immune System

In a sense, the immune system is the body's surveillance system. It consists of a variety of structures, cells,
and mechanisms that serve to protect the body from invading microorganisms that can harm or damage the
body's tissues and organs. When the immune system is working as it should, it keeps us healthy and disease
free by eliminating harmful bacteria, viruses, and other foreign substances that have entered the body (Everly
504 14 · Stress, Lifestyle, and Health

       & Lating, 2002).

       Immune System Errors

       Sometimes, the immune system will function erroneously. For example, sometimes it can go awry by
       mistaking your body's own healthy cells for invaders and repeatedly attacking them. When this happens, the
       person is said to have an autoimmune disease, which can affect almost any part of the body. How an
       autoimmune disease affects a person depends on what part of the body is targeted. For instance, rheumatoid
       arthritis, an autoimmune disease that affects the joints, results in joint pain, stiffness, and loss of function.
       Systemic lupus erythematosus, an autoimmune disease that affects the skin, can result in rashes and swelling
       of the skin. Grave's disease, an autoimmune disease that affects the thyroid gland, can result in fatigue, weight
       gain, and muscle aches (National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases [NIAMS], 2012).

       In addition, the immune system may sometimes break down and be unable to do its job. This situation is
       referred to as immunosuppression, the decreased effectiveness of the immune system. When people
       experience immunosuppression, they become susceptible to any number of infections, illness, and diseases.
       For example, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a serious and lethal disease that is caused by
       human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which greatly weakens the immune system by infecting and destroying
       antibody-producing cells, thus rendering an untreated person vulnerable to any of a number of opportunistic
       infections (Powell, 1996).

       Stressors and Immune Function

       The question of whether stress and negative emotional states can influence immune function has captivated
       researchers for over three decades, and discoveries made over that time have dramatically changed the face of
       health psychology (Kiecolt-Glaser, 2009). Psychoneuroimmunology is the field that studies how psychological
       factors such as stress influence the immune system and immune functioning. The term
       psychoneuroimmunology was first coined in 1981, when it appeared as the title of a book that reviewed
       available evidence for associations between the brain, endocrine system, and immune system (Zacharie,
       2009). To a large extent, this field evolved from the discovery that there is a connection between the central
       nervous system and the immune system.

       Some of the most compelling evidence for a connection between the brain and the immune system comes
       from studies in which researchers demonstrated that immune responses in animals could be classically
       conditioned (Everly & Lating, 2002). For example, Ader and Cohen (1975) paired flavored water (the
       conditioned stimulus) with the presentation of an immunosuppressive drug (the unconditioned stimulus),
       causing sickness (an unconditioned response). Not surprisingly, rats exposed to this pairing developed a
       conditioned aversion to the flavored water. However, the taste of the water itself later produced
       immunosuppression (a conditioned response), indicating that the immune system itself had been conditioned.
       Many subsequent studies over the years have further demonstrated that immune responses can be classically
       conditioned in both animals and humans (Ader & Cohen, 2001). Thus, if classical conditioning can alter
       immunity, other psychological factors should be capable of altering it as well.

       Hundreds of studies involving tens of thousands of participants have tested many kinds of brief and chronic
       stressors and their effects on the immune system (e.g., public speaking, medical school examinations,
       unemployment, marital discord, divorce, death of spouse, burnout and job strain, caring for a relative with
       Alzheimer's disease, and exposure to the harsh climate of Antarctica). It has been repeatedly demonstrated
       that many kinds of stressors are associated with poor or weakened immune functioning (Glaser & Kiecolt-
       Glaser, 2005; Kiecolt-Glaser, McGuire, Robles, & Glaser, 2002; Segerstrom & Miller, 2004).

       When evaluating these findings, it is important to remember that there is a tangible physiological connection
       between the brain and the immune system. For example, the sympathetic nervous system innervates immune
       organs such as the thymus, bone marrow, spleen, and even lymph nodes (Maier, Watkins, & Fleshner, 1994).
       Also, we noted earlier that stress hormones released during hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                                                          14.3 · Stress and Illness 505

activation can adversely impact immune function. One way they do this is by inhibiting the production of
lymphocytes, white blood cells that circulate in the body's fluids that are important in the immune response
(Everly & Lating, 2002).
Some of the more dramatic examples demonstrating the link between stress and impaired immune function
involve studies in which volunteers were exposed to viruses. The rationale behind this research is that because
stress weakens the immune system, people with high stress levels should be more likely to develop an illness
compared to those under little stress. In one memorable experiment using this method, researchers
interviewed 276 healthy volunteers about recent stressful experiences (Cohen et al., 1998). Following the
interview, these participants were given nasal drops containing the cold virus (in case you are wondering why
anybody would ever want to participate in a study in which they are subjected to such treatment, the
participants were paid $800 for their trouble). When examined later, participants who reported experiencing
chronic stressors for more than one month--especially enduring difficulties involving work or
relationships--were considerably more likely to have developed colds than were participants who reported no
chronic stressors (Figure 14.15).

FIGURE 14.15 This graph shows the percentages of participants who developed colds (after receiving the cold
virus) after reporting having experienced chronic stressors lasting at least one month, three months, and six months
(adapted from Cohen et al., 1998).
In another study, older volunteers were given an influenza virus vaccination. Compared to controls, those who
were caring for a spouse with Alzheimer's disease (and thus were under chronic stress) showed poorer
antibody response following the vaccination (Kiecolt-Glaser, Glaser, Gravenstein, Malarkey, & Sheridan, 1996).
Other studies have demonstrated that stress slows down wound healing by impairing immune responses
important to wound repair (Glaser & Kiecolt-Glaser, 2005). In one study, for example, skin blisters were
induced on the forearm. Subjects who reported higher levels of stress produced lower levels of immune
proteins necessary for wound healing (Glaser et al., 1999). Stress, then, is not so much the sword that kills the
knight, so to speak; rather, it's the sword that breaks the knight's shield, and your immune system is that
shield.

 Stress and Aging: A Tale of Telomeres

  Have you ever wondered why people who are stressed often seem to have a haggard look about them? A
  pioneering study from 2004 suggests that the reason is because stress can actually accelerate the cell biology of
  aging.
  Stress, it seems, can shorten telomeres, which are segments of DNA that protect the ends of chromosomes.
506 14 · Stress, Lifestyle, and Health

         Shortened telomeres can inhibit or block cell division, which includes growth and proliferation of new cells,
         thereby leading to more rapid aging (Sapolsky, 2004). In the study, researchers compared telomere lengths in
         the white blood cells in mothers of chronically ill children to those of mothers of healthy children (Epel et al.,
         2004). Mothers of chronically ill children would be expected to experience more stress than would mothers of
         healthy children. The longer a mother had spent caring for her ill child, the shorter her telomeres (the correlation
         between years of caregiving and telomere length was r = -.40). In addition, higher levels of perceived stress were
         negatively correlated with telomere size (r = -.31). These researchers also found that the average telomere
         length of the most stressed mothers, compared to the least stressed, was similar to what you would find in
         people who were 9-17 years older than they were on average.
         Numerous other studies since have continued to find associations between stress and eroded telomeres
         (Blackburn & Epel, 2012). Some studies have even demonstrated that stress can begin to erode telomeres in
         childhood and perhaps even before children are born. For example, childhood exposure to violence (e.g.,
         maternal domestic violence, bullying victimization, and physical maltreatment) was found in one study to
         accelerate telomere erosion from ages 5 to 10 (Shalev et al., 2013). Another study reported that young adults
         whose mothers had experienced severe stress during their pregnancy had shorter telomeres than did those
         whose mothers had stress-free and uneventful pregnancies (Entringer et al., 2011). Further, the corrosive effects
         of childhood stress on telomeres can extend into young adulthood. In an investigation of over 4,000 U.K. women
         ages 41-80, adverse experiences during childhood (e.g., physical abuse, being sent away from home, and parent
         divorce) were associated with shortened telomere length (Surtees et al., 2010), and telomere size decreased as
         the amount of experienced adversity increased (Figure 14.16).

         FIGURE 14.16 Telomeres are shorter in adults who experienced more trauma as children (adapted from
         Blackburn & Epel, 2012).
         Efforts to dissect the precise cellular and physiological mechanisms linking short telomeres to stress and disease
         are currently underway. For the time being, telomeres provide us with yet another reminder that stress,
         especially during early life, can be just as harmful to our health as smoking or fast food (Blackburn & Epel, 2012).

      Cardiovascular Disorders

       The cardiovascular system is composed of the heart and blood circulation system. For many years, disorders
       that involve the cardiovascular system--known as cardiovascular disorders--have been a major focal point in
       the study of psychophysiological disorders because of the cardiovascular system's centrality in the stress
       response (Everly & Lating, 2002). Heart disease is one such condition. Each year, heart disease causes
       approximately one in three deaths in the United States, and it is the leading cause of death in the developed
       world (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2011; Shapiro, 2005).
       The symptoms of heart disease vary somewhat depending on the specific kind of heart disease one has, but

                                                                                                                                                          14.3 · Stress and Illness 507

they generally involve angina--chest pains or discomfort that occur when the heart does not receive enough
blood (Office on Women's Health, 2009). The pain often feels like the chest is being pressed or squeezed;
burning sensations in the chest and shortness of breath are also commonly reported. Such pain and
discomfort can spread to the arms, neck, jaws, stomach (as nausea), and back (American Heart Association
[AHA], 2012a) (Figure 14.17).

                  FIGURE 14.17 Males and females often experience different symptoms of a heart attack.
A major risk factor for heart disease is hypertension, which is high blood pressure. Hypertension forces a
person's heart to pump harder, thus putting more physical strain on the heart. If left unchecked, hypertension
can lead to a heart attack, stroke, or heart failure; it can also lead to kidney failure and blindness. Hypertension
is a serious cardiovascular disorder, and it is sometimes called the silent killer because it has no
symptoms--one who has high blood pressure may not even be aware of it (AHA, 2012b).
Many risk factors contributing to cardiovascular disorders have been identified. These risk factors include
social determinants such as aging, income, education, and employment status, as well as behavioral risk
factors that include unhealthy diet, tobacco use, physical inactivity, and excessive alcohol consumption;
obesity and diabetes are additional risk factors (World Health Organization [WHO], 2013).
Over the past few decades, there has been much greater recognition and awareness of the importance of stress
and other psychological factors in cardiovascular health (Nusair, Al-dadah, & Kumar, 2012). Indeed, exposure
to stressors of many kinds has also been linked to cardiovascular problems; in the case of hypertension, some
of these stressors include job strain (Trudel, Brisson, & Milot, 2010), natural disasters (Saito, Kim, Maekawa,
Ikeda, & Yokoyama, 1997), marital conflict (Nealey-Moore, Smith, Uchino, Hawkins, & Olson-Cerny, 2007), and
exposure to high traffic noise levels at one's home (de Kluizenaar, Gansevoort, Miedema, & de Jong, 2007).
Perceived discrimination appears to be associated with hypertension among African Americans (Sims et al.,
2012). In addition, laboratory-based stress tasks, such as performing mental arithmetic under time pressure,
immersing one's hand into ice water (known as the cold pressor test), mirror tracing, and public speaking have
all been shown to elevate blood pressure (Phillips, 2011).

Are You Type A or Type B?

Sometimes research ideas and theories emerge from seemingly trivial observations. In the 1950s, cardiologist
Meyer Friedman was looking over his waiting room furniture, which consisted of upholstered chairs with
508 14 · Stress, Lifestyle, and Health

       armrests. Friedman decided to have these chairs reupholstered. When the man doing the reupholstering came
       to the office to do the work, he commented on how the chairs were worn in a unique manner--the front edges
       of the cushions were worn down, as were the front tips of the arm rests. It seemed like the cardiology patients
       were tapping or squeezing the front of the armrests, as well as literally sitting on the edge of their seats
       (Friedman & Rosenman, 1974). Were cardiology patients somehow different than other types of patients? If so,
       how?
       After researching this matter, Friedman and his colleague, Ray Rosenman, came to understand that people
       who are prone to heart disease tend to think, feel, and act differently than those who are not. These individuals
       tend to be intensively driven workaholics who are preoccupied with deadlines and always seem to be in a rush.
       According to Friedman and Rosenman, these individuals exhibit Type A behavior pattern; those who are more
       relaxed and laid-back were characterized as Type B (Figure 14.18). In a sample of Type As and Type Bs,
       Friedman and Rosenman were startled to discover that heart disease was over seven times more frequent
       among the Type As than the Type Bs (Friedman & Rosenman, 1959).

       FIGURE 14.18 (a) Type A individuals are characterized as intensely driven, (b) while Type B people are
       characterized as laid-back and relaxed. (credit a: modification of work by Greg Hernandez; credit b: modification of
       work by Elvert Barnes)
       The major components of the Type A pattern include an aggressive and chronic struggle to achieve more and
       more in less and less time (Friedman & Rosenman, 1974). Specific characteristics of the Type A pattern
       include an excessive competitive drive, chronic sense of time urgency, impatience, and hostility toward others
       (particularly those who get in the person's way).
       An example of a person who exhibits Type A behavior pattern is Jeffrey. Even as a child, Jeffrey was intense
       and driven. He excelled at school, was captain of the swim team, and graduated with honors from an Ivy
       League college. Jeffrey never seems able to relax; he is always working on something, even on the weekends.
       However, Jeffrey always seems to feel as though there are not enough hours in the day to accomplish all he
       feels he should. He volunteers to take on extra tasks at work and often brings his work home with him; he often
       goes to bed frustrated late at night because he feels that he has not done enough. Jeffrey is quick tempered
       with his coworkers; he often becomes noticeably agitated when dealing with those coworkers he feels work too
       slowly or whose work does not meet his standards. He typically reacts with hostility when interrupted at work.
       He has experienced problems in his marriage over his lack of time spent with family. When caught in traffic
       during his commute to and from work, Jeffrey incessantly pounds on his horn and swears loudly at other
       drivers. When Jeffrey was 52, he suffered his first heart attack.
       By the 1970s, a majority of practicing cardiologists believed that Type A behavior pattern was a significant risk
       factor for heart disease (Friedman, 1977). Indeed, a number of early longitudinal investigations demonstrated
       a link between Type A behavior pattern and later development of heart disease (Rosenman et al., 1975;
       Haynes, Feinleib, & Kannel, 1980).
       Subsequent research examining the association between Type A and heart disease, however, failed to replicate
       these earlier findings (Glassman, 2007; Myrtek, 2001). Because Type A theory did not pan out as well as they
       had hoped, researchers shifted their attention toward determining if any of the specific elements of Type A

                                                                                                                                                          14.3 · Stress and Illness 509

predict heart disease.
Extensive research clearly suggests that the anger/hostility dimension of Type A behavior pattern may be one
of the most important factors in the development of heart disease. This relationship was initially described in
the Haynes et al. (1980) study mentioned above: Suppressed hostility was found to substantially elevate the
risk of heart disease for both men and women. Also, one investigation followed over 1,000 male medical
students from 32 to 48 years. At the beginning of the study, these men completed a questionnaire assessing
how they react to pressure; some indicated that they respond with high levels of anger, whereas others
indicated that they respond with less anger. Decades later, researchers found that those who earlier had
indicated the highest levels of anger were over 6 times more likely than those who indicated less anger to have
had a heart attack by age 55, and they were 3.5 times more likely to have experienced heart disease by the
same age (Chang, Ford, Meoni, Wang, & Klag, 2002). From a health standpoint, it clearly does not pay to be an
angry person.
After reviewing and statistically summarizing 35 studies from 1983 to 2006, Chida and Steptoe (2009)
concluded that the bulk of the evidence suggests that anger and hostility constitute serious long-term risk
factors for adverse cardiovascular outcomes among both healthy individuals and those already suffering from
heart disease. One reason angry and hostile moods might contribute to cardiovascular diseases is that such
moods can create social strain, mainly in the form of antagonistic social encounters with others. This strain
could then lay the foundation for disease-promoting cardiovascular responses among hostile individuals
(Vella, Kamarck, Flory, & Manuck, 2012). In this transactional model, hostility and social strain form a cycle
(Figure 14.19).

FIGURE 14.19 According to the transactional model of hostility for predicting social interactions (Vella et al., 2012),
the thoughts and feelings of a hostile person promote antagonistic behavior toward others, which in turn reinforces
complimentary reactions from others, thereby intensifying ones' hostile disposition and intensifying the cyclical
nature of this relationship.
For example, suppose Kaitlin has a hostile disposition; she has a cynical, distrustful attitude toward others and
510 14 · Stress, Lifestyle, and Health

       often thinks that other people are out to get her. She is very defensive around people, even those she has
       known for years, and she is always looking for signs that others are either disrespecting or belittling her. In the
       shower each morning before work, she often mentally rehearses what she would say to someone who said or
       did something that angered her, such as making a political statement that was counter to her own ideology. As
       Kaitlin goes through these mental rehearsals, she often grins and thinks about the retaliation on anyone who
       will irk her that day.

       Socially, she is confrontational and tends to use a harsh tone with people, which often leads to very
       disagreeable and sometimes argumentative social interactions. As you might imagine, Kaitlin is not especially
       popular with others, including coworkers, neighbors, and even members of her own family. They either avoid
       her at all costs or snap back at her, which causes Kaitlin to become even more cynical and distrustful of others,
       making her disposition even more hostile. Kaitlin's hostility--through her own doing--has created an
       antagonistic environment that cyclically causes her to become even more hostile and angry, thereby
       potentially setting the stage for cardiovascular problems.

       In addition to anger and hostility, a number of other negative emotional states have been linked with heart
       disease, including negative affectivity and depression (Suls & Bunde, 2005). Negative affectivity is a tendency
       to experience distressed emotional states involving anger, contempt, disgust, guilt, fear, and nervousness
       (Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988). It has been linked with the development of both hypertension and heart
       disease. For example, over 3,000 initially healthy participants in one study were tracked longitudinally, up to
       22 years. Those with higher levels of negative affectivity at the time the study began were substantially more
       likely to develop and be treated for hypertension during the ensuing years than were those with lower levels of
       negative affectivity (Jonas & Lando, 2000). In addition, a study of over 10,000 middle-aged London-based civil
       servants who were followed an average of 12.5 years revealed that those who earlier had scored in the upper
       third on a test of negative affectivity were 32% more likely to have experienced heart disease, heart attack, or
       angina over a period of years than were those who scored in the lowest third (Nabi, Kivimaki, De Vogli, Marmot,
       & Singh-Manoux, 2008). Hence, negative affectivity appears to be a potentially vital risk factor for the
       development of cardiovascular disorders.

      Depression and the Heart

       For centuries, poets and folklore have asserted that there is a connection between moods and the heart
       (Glassman & Shapiro, 1998). You are no doubt familiar with the notion of a broken heart following a
       disappointing or depressing event and have encountered that notion in songs, films, and literature.

       Perhaps the first to recognize the link between depression and heart disease was Benjamin Malzberg (1937),
       who found that the death rate among institutionalized patients with melancholia (an archaic term for
       depression) was six times higher than that of the population. A classic study in the late 1970s looked at over
       8,000 people diagnosed with manic-depressive disorder (now classified as bipolar disorder) in Denmark,
       finding a nearly 50% increase in deaths from heart disease among these patients compared with the general
       Danish population (Weeke, 1979). By the early 1990s, evidence began to accumulate showing that depressed
       individuals who were followed for long periods of time were at increased risk for heart disease and cardiac
       death (Glassman, 2007). In one investigation of over 700 Denmark residents, those with the highest depression
       scores were 71% more likely to have experienced a heart attack than were those with lower depression scores
       (Barefoot & Schroll, 1996). Figure 14.20 illustrates the gradation in risk of heart attacks for both men and
       women.

                                                                                                                                                          14.3 · Stress and Illness 511

FIGURE 14.20 This graph shows the incidence of heart attacks among men and women by depression score
quartile (adapted from Barefoot & Schroll, 1996).
After more than two decades of research, it is now clear that a relationship exists: Patients with heart disease
have more depression than the general population, and people with depression are more likely to eventually
develop heart disease and experience higher mortality than those who do not have depression (Hare,
Toukhsati, Johansson, & Jaarsma, 2013); the more severe the depression, the higher the risk (Glassman, 2007).
Consider the following:

  · In one study, death rates from cardiovascular problems was substantially higher in depressed people;
      depressed men were 50% more likely to have died from cardiovascular problems, and depressed women
      were 70% more likely (Ösby, Brandt, Correia, Ekbom, & Sparén, 2001).

  · A statistical review of 10 longitudinal studies involving initially healthy individuals revealed that those
      with elevated depressive symptoms have, on average, a 64% greater risk of developing heart disease than
      do those with fewer symptoms (Wulsin & Singal, 2003).

  · A study of over 63,000 registered nurses found that those with more depressed symptoms when the study
      began were 49% more likely to experience fatal heart disease over a 12-year period (Whang et al., 2009).

The American Heart Association, fully aware of the established importance of depression in cardiovascular
diseases, several years ago recommended routine depression screening for all heart disease patients
(Lichtman et al., 2008). Recently, they have recommended including depression as a risk factor for heart
disease patients (AHA, 2014).
Although the exact mechanisms through which depression might produce heart problems have not been fully
clarified, a recent investigation examining this connection in early life has shed some light. In an ongoing
study of childhood depression, adolescents who had been diagnosed with depression as children were more
likely to be obese, smoke, and be physically inactive than were those who had not received this diagnosis
(Rottenberg et al., 2014). One implication of this study is that depression, especially if it occurs early in life,
may increase the likelihood of living an unhealthy lifestyle, thereby predisposing people to an unfavorable
cardiovascular disease risk profile.
It is important to point out that depression may be just one piece of the emotional puzzle in elevating the risk
for heart disease, and that chronically experiencing several negative emotional states may be especially
important. A longitudinal investigation of Vietnam War veterans found that depression, anxiety, hostility, and
trait anger each independently predicted the onset of heart disease (Boyle, Michalek, & Suarez, 2006).
However, when each of these negative psychological attributes was combined into a single variable, this new
variable (which researchers called psychological risk factor) predicted heart disease more strongly than any of
the individual variables. Thus, rather than examining the predictive power of isolated psychological risk
factors, it seems crucial for future researchers to examine the effects of combined and more general negative
512 14 · Stress, Lifestyle, and Health

       emotional and psychological traits in the development of cardiovascular illnesses.

      Asthma

       Asthma is a chronic and serious disease in which the airways of the respiratory system become obstructed,
       leading to great difficulty expelling air from the lungs. The airway obstruction is caused by inflammation of the
       airways (leading to thickening of the airway walls) and a tightening of the muscles around them, resulting in a
       narrowing of the airways (Figure 14.21) (American Lung Association, 2010). Because airways become
       obstructed, a person with asthma will sometimes have great difficulty breathing and will experience repeated
       episodes of wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and coughing, the latter occurring mostly during
       the morning and night (CDC, 2006).

                                     FIGURE 14.21 In asthma, the airways become inflamed and narrowed.
       According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), around 4,000 people die each year from
       asthma-related causes, and asthma is a contributing factor to another 7,000 deaths each year (CDC, 2013a).
       The CDC has revealed that asthma affects 18.7 million U.S. adults and is more common among people with
       lower income levels (CDC, 2013b). Especially concerning is that asthma is on the rise, with rates of asthma
       increasing 157% between 2000 and 2010 (CDC, 2013b).
       Asthma attacks are acute episodes in which an asthma sufferer experiences the full range of symptoms.
       Asthma exacerbation is often triggered by environmental factors, such as air pollution, allergens (e.g., pollen,
       mold, and pet hairs), cigarette smoke, airway infections, cold air or a sudden change in temperature, and
       exercise (CDC, 2013b). Certain regions and neighborhoods are known for having notably high rates of asthma
       and related diseases due to high rates of concentrated pollution and low air quality. For example, Long Beach,
       California and Bronx, New York contain "asthma alleys" due to the density of trucking, power plants, factories,
       sewage works, or other agents of air pollution.
       Psychological factors appear to play an important role in asthma (Wright, Rodriguez, & Cohen, 1998), although
       some believe that psychological factors serve as potential triggers in only a subset of asthma patients (Ritz,
       Steptoe, Bobb, Harris, & Edwards, 2006). Many studies over the years have demonstrated that some people

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                                                          14.3 · Stress and Illness 513

with asthma will experience asthma-like symptoms if they expect to experience such symptoms, such as when
breathing an inert substance that they (falsely) believe will lead to airway obstruction (Sodergren & Hyland,
1999). As stress and emotions directly affect immune and respiratory functions, psychological factors likely
serve as one of the most common triggers of asthma exacerbation (Trueba & Ritz, 2013).

People with asthma tend to report and display a high level of negative emotions such as anxiety, and asthma
attacks have been linked to periods of high emotionality (Lehrer, Isenberg, & Hochron, 1993). In addition, high
levels of emotional distress during both laboratory tasks and daily life have been found to negatively affect
airway function and can produce asthma-like symptoms in people with asthma (von Leupoldt, Ehnes, &
Dahme, 2006). In one investigation, 20 adults with asthma wore preprogrammed wristwatches that signaled
them to breathe into a portable device that measures airway function. Results showed that higher levels of
negative emotions and stress were associated with increased airway obstruction and self-reported asthma
symptoms (Smyth, Soefer, Hurewitz, Kliment, & Stone, 1999). In addition, D'Amato, Liccardi, Cecchi,
Pellegrino, & D'Amato (2010) described a case study of an 18-year-old man with asthma whose girlfriend had
broken up with him, leaving him in a depressed state. She had also unfriended him on Facebook, while
friending other young males. Eventually, the young man was able to "friend" her once again and could monitor
her activity through Facebook. Subsequently, he would experience asthma symptoms whenever he logged on
and accessed her profile. When he later resigned not to use Facebook any longer, the asthma attacks stopped.
This case suggests that the use of Facebook and other forms of social media may represent a new source of
stress--it may be a triggering factor for asthma attacks, especially in depressed asthmatic individuals.

Exposure to stressful experiences, particularly those that involve parental or interpersonal conflicts, has been
linked to the development of asthma throughout the lifespan. A longitudinal study of 145 children found that
parenting difficulties during the first year of life increased the chances that the child developed asthma by
107% (Klinnert et al., 2001). In addition, a cross-sectional study of over 10,000 Finnish college students found
that high rates of parent or personal conflicts (e.g., parental divorce, separation from spouse, or severe
conflicts in other long-term relationships) increased the risk of asthma onset (Kilpeläinen, Koskenvuo,
Helenius, & Terho, 2002). Further, a study of over 4,000 middle-aged men who were interviewed in the early
1990s and again a decade later found that breaking off an important life partnership (e.g., divorce or breaking
off relationship from parents) increased the risk of developing asthma by 124% over the time of the study
(Loerbroks, Apfelbacher, Thayer, Debling, & Stürmer, 2009).

Headaches

A headache is a continuous pain anywhere in the head and neck region. Inflammation of the sinuses caused by
an infection or allergic reaction can cause sinus headaches, which are experienced as pain in the cheeks and
forehead. Migraine headaches are a type of headache thought to be caused by blood vessel swelling and
increased blood flow (McIntosh, 2013). Migraines are characterized by severe pain on one or both sides of the
head, an upset stomach, and disturbed vision. They are more frequently experienced by women than by men
(American Academy of Neurology, 2014). Tension headaches are triggered by tightening/tensing of facial and
neck muscles; they are the most commonly experienced kind of headache, accounting for about 42% of all
headaches worldwide (Stovner et al., 2007). In the United States, well over one-third of the population
experiences tension headaches each year, and 2-3% of the population suffers from chronic tension headaches
(Schwartz, Stewart, Simon, & Lipton, 1998).

A number of factors can contribute to tension headaches, including sleep deprivation, skipping meals, eye
strain, overexertion, muscular tension caused by poor posture, and stress (MedicineNet, 2013). Although there
is uncertainty regarding the exact mechanisms through which stress can produce tension headaches, stress
has been demonstrated to increase sensitivity to pain (Caceres & Burns, 1997; Logan et al., 2001). In general,
tension headache sufferers, compared to non-sufferers, have a lower threshold for and greater sensitivity to
pain (Ukestad & Wittrock, 1996), and they report greater levels of subjective stress when faced with a stressor
(Myers, Wittrock, & Foreman, 1998). Thus, stress may contribute to tension headaches by increasing pain
514 14 · Stress, Lifestyle, and Health

       sensitivity in already-sensitive pain pathways in tension headache sufferers (Cathcart, Petkov, & Pritchard,
       2008).

     14.4 Regulation of Stress

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Define coping and differentiate between problem-focused and emotion-focused coping
         · Describe the importance of perceived control in our reactions to stress
         · Explain how social support is vital in health and longevity

       As we learned in the previous section, stress--especially if it is chronic--takes a toll on our bodies and can have
       enormously negative health implications. When we experience events in our lives that we appraise as stressful,
       it is essential that we use effective coping strategies to manage our stress. Coping refers to mental and
       behavioral efforts that we use to deal with problems relating to stress.

      Coping Styles

       Lazarus and Folkman (1984) distinguished two fundamental kinds of coping: problem-focused coping and
       emotion-focused coping. In problem-focused coping, one attempts to manage or alter the problem that is
       causing one to experience stress (i.e., the stressor). Problem-focused coping strategies are similar to strategies
       used in everyday problem-solving: they typically involve identifying the problem, considering possible
       solutions, weighing the costs and benefits of these solutions, and then selecting an alternative (Lazarus &
       Folkman, 1984). As an example, suppose Bradford receives a midterm notice that he is failing statistics class. If
       Bradford adopts a problem-focused coping approach to managing his stress, he would be proactive in trying to
       alleviate the source of the stress. He might contact his professor to discuss what must be done to raise his
       grade, he might also decide to set aside two hours daily to study statistics assignments, and he may seek
       tutoring assistance. A problem-focused approach to managing stress means we actively try to do things to
       address the problem.

       Emotion-focused coping, in contrast, consists of efforts to change or reduce the negative emotions associated
       with stress. These efforts may include avoiding, minimizing, or distancing oneself from the problem, or
       positive comparisons with others ("I'm not as bad off as she is"), or seeking something positive in a negative
       event ("Now that I've been fired, I can sleep in for a few days"). In some cases, emotion-focused coping
       strategies involve reappraisal, whereby the stressor is construed differently (and somewhat self-deceptively)
       without changing its objective level of threat (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). For example, a person sentenced to
       federal prison who thinks, "This will give me a great chance to network with others," is using reappraisal. If
       Bradford adopted an emotion-focused approach to managing his midterm deficiency stress, he might watch a
       comedy movie, play video games, or spend hours on social media to take his mind off the situation. In a certain
       sense, emotion-focused coping can be thought of as treating the symptoms rather than the actual cause.

       While many stressors elicit both kinds of coping strategies, problem-focused coping is more likely to occur
       when encountering stressors we perceive as controllable, while emotion-focused coping is more likely to
       predominate when faced with stressors that we believe we are powerless to change (Folkman & Lazarus, 1980).
       Clearly, emotion-focused coping is more effective in dealing with uncontrollable stressors. For example, the
       stress you experience when a loved one dies can be overwhelming. You are simply powerless to change the
       situation as there is nothing you can do to bring this person back. The most helpful coping response is
       emotion-focused coping aimed at minimizing the pain of the grieving period.

       Fortunately, most stressors we encounter can be modified and are, to varying degrees, controllable. A person
       who cannot stand her job can quit and look for work elsewhere; a middle-aged divorcee can find another
       potential partner; the freshman who fails an exam can study harder next time, and a breast lump does not
       necessarily mean that one is fated to die of breast cancer.

Control and Stress

The desire and ability to predict events, make decisions, and affect outcomes--that is, to enact control in our
lives--is a basic tenet of human behavior (Everly & Lating, 2002). Albert Bandura (1997) stated that "the
intensity and chronicity of human stress is governed largely by perceived control over the demands of one's
life" (p. 262). As cogently described in his statement, our reaction to potential stressors depends to a large
extent on how much control we feel we have over such things. Perceived control is our beliefs about our
personal capacity to exert influence over and shape outcomes, and it has major implications for our health and
happiness (Infurna & Gerstorf, 2014). Extensive research has demonstrated that perceptions of personal
control are associated with a variety of favorable outcomes, such as better physical and mental health and
greater psychological well-being (Diehl & Hay, 2010). Greater personal control is also associated with lower
reactivity to stressors in daily life. For example, researchers in one investigation found that higher levels of
perceived control at one point in time were later associated with lower emotional and physical reactivity to
interpersonal stressors (Neupert, Almeida, & Charles, 2007). Further, a daily diary study with 34 older widows
found that their stress and anxiety levels were significantly reduced on days during which the widows felt
greater perceived control (Ong, Bergeman, & Bisconti, 2005).

                                                                                                             DIG DEEPER
 Learned Helplessness

  When we lack a sense of control over the events in our lives, particularly when those events are threatening,
  harmful, or noxious, the psychological consequences can be profound. In one of the better illustrations of this
  concept, psychologist Martin Seligman conducted a series of classic experiments in the 1960s (Seligman &
  Maier, 1967) in which dogs were placed in a chamber where they received electric shocks from which they could
  not escape. Later, when these dogs were given the opportunity to escape the shocks by jumping across a
  partition, most failed to even try; they seemed to just give up and passively accept any shocks the experimenters
  chose to administer. In comparison, dogs who were previously allowed to escape the shocks tended to jump the
  partition and escape the pain (Figure 14.22).

  FIGURE 14.22 Seligman's learned helplessness experiments with dogs used an apparatus that measured when
  the animals would move from a floor delivering shocks to one without.
  Seligman believed that the dogs who failed to try to escape the later shocks were demonstrating learned
516 14 · Stress, Lifestyle, and Health

         helplessness: They had acquired a belief that they were powerless to do anything about the stimulation they
         were receiving. Seligman also believed that the passivity and lack of initiative these dogs demonstrated was
         similar to that observed in human depression. Therefore, Seligman speculated that learned helplessness might
         be an important cause of depression in humans: Humans who experience negative life events that they believe
         they are unable to control may become helpless. As a result, they give up trying to change the situation and some
         may become depressed and show lack of initiative in future situations in which they can control the outcomes
         (Seligman, Maier, & Geer, 1968). In an application Seligman never proposed, learned helplessness was later used
         as a methodology in the torture of prisoners by U.S. military and intelligence personnel following the 2001
         attacks on the World Trade Center. The psychologists who designed the torture program, James E. Mitchell and
         Bruce Jesson, theorized that detainees who were subjected to uncontrollable afflictions would eventually
         become passive and compliant, making them more likely to reveal information to their interrogators. There is
         little evidence that the program achieved worthwhile results. It is now widely regarded as unethical and
         unjustified. This example emphasizes the need to consistently consider the ethics of research studies and their
         applications (Konnikova, 2015).

         Seligman and colleagues later reformulated the original learned helplessness model of depression (Abramson,
         Seligman, & Teasdale, 1978). In their reformulation, they emphasized attributions (i.e., a mental explanation for
         why something occurred) that fostered a sense of learned helplessness. For example, suppose a coworker shows
         up late to work; your belief as to what caused the coworker's tardiness would be an attribution (e.g., too much
         traffic, slept too late, or just doesn't care about being on time).

         The reformulated version of Seligman's study holds that the attributions made for negative life events contribute
         to depression. Consider the example of a student who performs poorly on a midterm exam. This model suggests
         that the student will make three kinds of attributions for this outcome: internal vs. external (believing the
         outcome was caused by his own personal inadequacies or by environmental factors), stable vs. unstable
         (believing the cause can be changed or is permanent), and global vs. specific (believing the outcome is a sign of
         inadequacy in most everything versus just this area). Assume that the student makes an internal ("I'm just not
         smart"), stable ("Nothing can be done to change the fact that I'm not smart") and global ("This is another
         example of how lousy I am at everything") attribution for the poor performance. The reformulated theory
         predicts that the student would perceive a lack of control over this stressful event and thus be especially prone
         to developing depression. Indeed, research has demonstrated that people who have a tendency to make
         internal, global, and stable attributions for bad outcomes tend to develop symptoms of depression when faced
         with negative life experiences (Peterson & Seligman, 1984). Fortunately, attribution habits can be changed
         through practice. Training in healthy attribution habits has been shown to make people less vulnerable to
         depression (Konnikova, 2015).

         Seligman's learned helplessness model has emerged over the years as a leading theoretical explanation for the
         onset of major depressive disorder. When you study psychological disorders, you will learn more about the latest
         reformulation of this model--now called hopelessness theory.

       People who report higher levels of perceived control view their health as controllable, thereby making it more
       likely that they will better manage their health and engage in behaviors conducive to good health (Bandura,
       2004). Not surprisingly, greater perceived control has been linked to lower risk of physical health problems,
       including declines in physical functioning (Infurna, Gerstorf, Ram, Schupp, & Wagner, 2011), heart attacks
       (Rosengren et al., 2004), and both cardiovascular disease incidence (Stürmer, Hasselbach, & Amelang, 2006)
       and mortality from cardiac disease (Surtees et al., 2010). In addition, longitudinal studies of British civil
       servants have found that those in low-status jobs (e.g., clerical and office support staff) in which the degree of
       control over the job is minimal are considerably more likely to develop heart disease than those with high-
       status jobs or considerable control over their jobs (Marmot, Bosma, Hemingway, & Stansfeld, 1997).

The link between perceived control and health may provide an explanation for the frequently observed
relationship between social class and health outcomes (Kraus, Piff, Mendoza-Denton, Rheinschmidt, & Keltner,
2012). In general, research has found that more affluent individuals experience better health partly because
they tend to believe that they can personally control and manage their reactions to life's stressors (Johnson &
Krueger, 2006). Perhaps buoyed by the perceived level of control, individuals of higher social class may be
prone to overestimating the degree of influence they have over particular outcomes. For example, those of
higher social class tend to believe that their votes have greater sway on election outcomes than do those of
lower social class, which may explain higher rates of voting in more affluent communities (Krosnick, 1990).
Other research has found that a sense of perceived control can protect less affluent individuals from poorer
health, depression, and reduced life-satisfaction--all of which tend to accompany lower social standing
(Lachman & Weaver, 1998).

Taken together, findings from these and many other studies clearly suggest that perceptions of control and
coping abilities are important in managing and coping with the stressors we encounter throughout life.

Social Support

The need to form and maintain strong, stable relationships with others is a powerful, pervasive, and
fundamental human motive (Baumeister & Leary, 1995). Building strong interpersonal relationships with
others helps us establish a network of close, caring individuals who can provide social support in times of
distress, sorrow, and fear. Social support can be thought of as the soothing impact of friends, family, and
acquaintances (Baron & Kerr, 2003). Social support can take many forms, including advice, guidance,
encouragement, acceptance, emotional comfort, and tangible assistance (such as financial help). Thus, other
people can be very comforting to us when we are faced with a wide range of life stressors, and they can be
extremely helpful in our efforts to manage these challenges. Even in nonhuman animals, species mates can
offer social support during times of stress. For example, elephants seem to be able to sense when other
elephants are stressed and will often comfort them with physical contact--such as a trunk touch--or an
empathetic vocal response (Krumboltz, 2014).

Scientific interest in the importance of social support first emerged in the 1970s when health researchers
developed an interest in the health consequences of being socially integrated (Stroebe & Stroebe, 1996).
Interest was further fueled by longitudinal studies showing that social connectedness reduced mortality. In
one classic study, nearly 7,000 Alameda County, California, residents were followed over 9 years. Those who
had previously indicated that they lacked social and community ties were more likely to die during the follow-
up period than those with more extensive social networks. Compared to those with the most social contacts,
isolated men and women were, respectively, 2.3 and 2.8 times more likely to die. These trends persisted even
after controlling for a variety of health-related variables, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, self-reported
health at the beginning of the study, and physical activity (Berkman & Syme, 1979).

Since the time of that study, social support has emerged as one of the well-documented psychosocial factors
affecting health outcomes (Uchino, 2009). A statistical review of 148 studies conducted between 1982 and
2007 involving over 300,000 participants concluded that individuals with stronger social relationships have a
50% greater likelihood of survival compared to those with weak or insufficient social relationships (Holt-
Lunstad, Smith, & Layton, 2010). According to the researchers, the magnitude of the effect of social support
observed in this study is comparable with quitting smoking and exceeded many well-known risk factors for
mortality, such as obesity and physical inactivity (Figure 14.23).

       than happiness and fulfillment--they can help foster good health. (credit a: modification of work by "Damian
       Gadal_Flickr"/Flickr; credit b: modification of work by Christian Haugen)
       A number of large-scale studies have found that individuals with low levels of social support are at greater risk
       of mortality, especially from cardiovascular disorders (Brummett et al., 2001). Further, higher levels of social
       supported have been linked to better survival rates following breast cancer (Falagas et al., 2007) and infectious
       diseases, especially HIV infection (Lee & Rotheram-Borus, 2001). In fact, a person with high levels of social
       support is less likely to contract a common cold. In one study, 334 participants completed questionnaires
       assessing their sociability; these individuals were subsequently exposed to a virus that causes a common cold
       and monitored for several weeks to see who became ill. Results showed that increased sociability was linearly
       associated with a decreased probability of developing a cold (Cohen, Doyle, Turner, Alper, & Skoner, 2003).
       For many of us, friends are a vital source of social support. But what if you find yourself in a situation in which
       you have few friends and companions? Many students who leave home to attend and live at college experience
       drastic reductions in their social support, which makes them vulnerable to anxiety, depression, and loneliness.
       Social media can sometimes be useful in navigating these transitions (Raney & Troop Gordon, 2012) but might
       also cause increases in loneliness (Hunt, Marx, Lipson, & Young, 2018). For this reason, many colleges have
       designed first-year programs, such as peer mentoring (Raymond & Shepard, 2018), that can help students
       build new social networks. For some people, our families--especially our parents--are a major source of social
       support.
       Social support appears to work by boosting the immune system, especially among people who are
       experiencing stress (Uchino, Vaughn, Carlisle, & Birmingham, 2012). In a pioneering study, spouses of cancer
       patients who reported high levels of social support showed indications of better immune functioning on two
       out of three immune functioning measures, compared to spouses who were below the median on reported
       social support (Baron, Cutrona, Hicklin, Russell, & Lubaroff, 1990). Studies of other populations have produced
       similar results, including those of spousal caregivers of dementia sufferers, medical students, elderly adults,
       and cancer patients (Cohen & Herbert, 1996; Kiecolt-Glaser, McGuire, Robles, & Glaser, 2002).
       In addition, social support has been shown to reduce blood pressure for people performing stressful tasks,
       such as giving a speech or performing mental arithmetic (Lepore, 1998). In these kinds of studies, participants
       are usually asked to perform a stressful task either alone, with a stranger present (who may be either
       supportive or unsupportive), or with a friend present. Those tested with a friend present generally exhibit
       lower blood pressure than those tested alone or with a stranger (Fontana, Diegnan, Villeneuve, & Lepore,
       1999). In one study, 112 female participants who performed stressful mental arithmetic exhibited lower blood
       pressure when they received support from a friend rather than a stranger, but only if the friend was a male
       (Phillips, Gallagher, & Carroll, 2009). Although these findings are somewhat difficult to interpret, the authors
       mention that it is possible that females feel less supported and more evaluated by other females, particularly
       females whose opinions they value.
       Taken together, the findings above suggest one of the reasons social support is connected to favorable health
       outcomes is because it has several beneficial physiological effects in stressful situations. However, it is also
       important to consider the possibility that social support may lead to better health behaviors, such as a healthy

 Stress and Discrimination

  Being the recipient of prejudice and discrimination is associated with a number of negative outcomes. Many
  studies have shown how discrimination is a significant stressor for marginalized groups (Pascoe & Smart
  Richman, 2009). Discrimination negatively impacts both physical and mental health for individuals in stigmatized
  groups. As you'll learn when you study social psychology, various social identities (such as gender, age, religion,
  sexuality, ethnicity) often lead people to simultaneously be exposed to multiple forms of discrimination, which
  can have even stronger negative effects on mental and physical health (Vines, Ward, Cordoba, & Black, 2017).
  For example, the amplified levels of discrimination faced by Latinx transgender women may have related effects,
  leading to high stress levels and poor mental and physical health outcomes.

  Perceived control and the general adaptation syndrome help explain the process by which discrimination affects
  mental and physical health. Discrimination can be conceptualized as an uncontrollable, persistent, and
  unpredictable stressor. When a discriminatory event occurs, the target of the event initially experiences an acute
  stress response (alarm stage). This acute reaction alone does not typically have a great impact on health.
  However, discrimination tends to be a chronic stressor. As people in marginalized groups experience repeated
  discrimination, they develop a heightened reactivity as their bodies prepare to act quickly (resistance stage). This
  long-term accumulation of stress responses can eventually lead to increases in negative emotion and wear on
  physical health (exhaustion stage). This explains why a history of perceived discrimination is associated with a
  host of mental and physical health problems including depression, cardiovascular disease, and cancer (Pascoe &
  Smart Richman, 2009).

  Protecting stigmatized groups from the negative impact of discrimination-induced stress may involve reducing
  the incidence of discriminatory behaviors in conjunction with protective strategies that reduce the impact of
  discriminatory events when they occur. Civil rights legislation has protected some stigmatized groups by making
  discrimination a prosecutable offense in many social contexts. However, some groups (e.g., transgender people)
  often lack important legal recourse when discrimination occurs. Moreover, most modern discrimination comes in
  subtle forms that fall below the radar of the law. For example, discrimination may be experienced as selective
  inhospitality toward people of specific races or ethnicities, but little is done in response since it would be easy to
  attribute the behavior to other causes. Although some cultural changes are increasingly helping people to
  recognize and control subtle discrimination, such shifts may take a long time.

  Similar to other stressors, buffers like social support and healthy coping strategies appear to be effective in
  lowering the impact of perceived discrimination. For example, one study (Ajrouch, Reisine, Lim, Sohn, & Ismail,
  2010) showed that discrimination predicted high psychological distress among African American mothers living
  in Detroit. However, the women who had readily available emotional support from friends and family experienced
  less distress than those with fewer social resources. While coping strategies and social support may buffer the
  effects of discrimination, they fail to erase all of the negative impacts. Vigilant antidiscrimination efforts,
  including the development of legal protections for vulnerable groups, are needed to reduce discrimination,
  stress, and the resulting physical and mental health effects.

Stress Reduction Techniques

Beyond having a sense of control and establishing social support networks, there are numerous other means
by which we can manage stress (Figure 14.24). A common technique people use to combat stress is exercise
(Salmon, 2001). It is well-established that exercise, both of long (aerobic) and short (anaerobic) duration, is
beneficial for both physical and mental health (Everly & Lating, 2002). There is considerable evidence that
physically fit individuals are more resistant to the adverse effects of stress and recover more quickly from
520 14 · Stress, Lifestyle, and Health

       stress than less physically fit individuals (Cotton, 1990). In a study of more than 500 Swiss police officers and
       emergency service personnel, increased physical fitness was associated with reduced stress, and regular
       exercise was reported to protect against stress-related health problems (Gerber, Kellman, Hartman, & Pühse,
       2010).

       FIGURE 14.24 Stress reduction techniques may include (a) exercise, (b) meditation and relaxation, or (c)
       biofeedback. (credit a: modification of work by "UNE Photos"/Flickr; credit b: modification of work by Caleb Roenigk;
       credit c: modification of work by Dr. Carmen Russoniello)
       One reason exercise may be beneficial is because it might buffer some of the deleterious physiological
       mechanisms of stress. One study found rats that exercised for six weeks showed a decrease in hypothalamic-
       pituitary-adrenal responsiveness to mild stressors (Campeau et al., 2010). In high-stress humans, exercise has
       been shown to prevent telomere shortening, which may explain the common observation of a youthful
       appearance among those who exercise regularly (Puterman et al., 2010). Further, exercise in later adulthood
       appears to minimize the detrimental effects of stress on the hippocampus and memory (Head, Singh, & Bugg,
       2012). Among cancer survivors, exercise has been shown to reduce anxiety (Speck, Courneya, Masse, Duval, &
       Schmitz, 2010) and depressive symptoms (Craft, VanIterson, Helenowski, Rademaker, & Courneya, 2012).
       Clearly, exercise is a highly effective tool for regulating stress.
       In the 1970s, Herbert Benson, a cardiologist, developed a stress reduction method called the relaxation
       response technique (Greenberg, 2006). The relaxation response technique combines relaxation with
       transcendental meditation, and consists of four components (Stein, 2001):
        1. sitting upright on a comfortable chair with feet on the ground and body in a relaxed position,
        2. being in a quiet environment with eyes closed,
        3. repeating a word or a phrase--a mantra--to oneself, such as "alert mind, calm body,"
        4. passively allowing the mind to focus on pleasant thoughts, such as nature or the warmth of your blood

             nourishing your body.
       The relaxation response approach is conceptualized as a general approach to stress reduction that reduces
       sympathetic arousal, and it has been used effectively to treat people with high blood pressure (Benson &
       Proctor, 1994).
       Another technique to combat stress, biofeedback, was developed by Gary Schwartz at Harvard University in
       the early 1970s. Biofeedback is a technique that uses electronic equipment to accurately measure a person's
       neuromuscular and autonomic activity--feedback is provided in the form of visual or auditory signals. The
       main assumption of this approach is that providing somebody biofeedback will enable the individual to
       develop strategies that help gain some level of voluntary control over what are normally involuntary bodily
       processes (Schwartz & Schwartz, 1995). A number of different bodily measures have been used in biofeedback
       research, including facial muscle movement, brain activity, and skin temperature, and it has been applied
       successfully with individuals experiencing tension headaches, high blood pressure, asthma, and phobias
       (Stein, 2001).

14.5 The Pursuit of Happiness

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Define and discuss happiness, including its determinants
  · Describe the field of positive psychology and identify the kinds of problems it addresses
  · Explain the meaning of positive affect and discuss its importance in health outcomes
  · Describe the concept of flow and its relationship to happiness and fulfillment

Although the study of stress and how it affects us physically and psychologically is fascinating, it
is--admittedly--somewhat of a grim topic. Psychology is also interested in the study of a more upbeat and
encouraging approach to human affairs--the quest for happiness.

Happiness

America's founders declared that its citizens have an unalienable right to pursue happiness. But what is
happiness? When asked to define the term, people emphasize different aspects of this elusive state. Indeed,
happiness is somewhat ambiguous and can be defined from different perspectives (Martin, 2012). Some
people, especially those who are highly committed to their religious faith, view happiness in ways that
emphasize virtuosity, reverence, and enlightened spirituality. Others see happiness as primarily
contentment--the inner peace and joy that come from deep satisfaction with one's surroundings, relationships
with others, accomplishments, and oneself. Still others view happiness mainly as pleasurable engagement
with their personal environment--having a career and hobbies that are engaging, meaningful, rewarding, and
exciting. These differences, of course, are merely differences in emphasis. Most people would probably agree
that each of these views, in some respects, captures the essence of happiness.

Elements of Happiness

Some psychologists have suggested that happiness consists of three distinct elements: the pleasant life, the
good life, and the meaningful life, as shown in Figure 14.25 (Seligman, 2002; Seligman, Steen, Park, &
Peterson, 2005). The pleasant life is realized through the attainment of day-to-day pleasures that add fun, joy,
and excitement to our lives. For example, evening walks along the beach and a fulfilling sex life can enhance
our daily pleasure and contribute to the pleasant life. The good life is achieved through identifying our unique
skills and abilities and engaging these talents to enrich our lives; those who achieve the good life often find
themselves absorbed in their work or their recreational pursuits. The meaningful life involves a deep sense of
fulfillment that comes from using our talents in the service of the greater good: in ways that benefit the lives of
others or that make the world a better place. In general, the happiest people tend to be those who pursue the
full life--they orient their pursuits toward all three elements (Seligman et al., 2005).

       FIGURE 14.25 Happiness is an enduring state of well-being involving satisfaction in the pleasant, good, and
       meaningful aspects of life.
       For practical purposes, a precise definition of happiness might incorporate each of these elements: an
       enduring state of mind consisting of joy, contentment, and other positive emotions, plus the sense that one's
       life has meaning and value (Lyubomirsky, 2001). The definition implies that happiness is a long-term
       state--what is often characterized as subjective well-being--rather than merely a transient positive mood we all
       experience from time to time. It is this enduring happiness that has captured the interests of psychologists and
       other social scientists.
       The study of happiness has grown dramatically in the last three decades (Diener, 2013). One of the most basic
       questions that happiness investigators routinely examine is this: How happy are people in general? The
       average person in the world tends to be relatively happy and tends to indicate experiencing more positive
       feelings than negative feelings (Diener, Ng, Harter, & Arora, 2010). When asked to evaluate their current lives
       on a scale ranging from 0 to 10 (with 0 representing "worst possible life" and 10 representing "best possible
       life"), people in more than 150 countries surveyed from 2010-2012 reported an average score of 5.2. People
       who live in North America, Australia, and New Zealand reported the highest average score at 7.1, whereas
       those living Sub-Saharan Africa reported the lowest average score at 4.6 (Helliwell, Layard, & Sachs, 2013).
       Worldwide, the five happiest countries are Denmark, Norway, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Sweden; the
       United States is ranked 17th happiest (Figure 14.26) (Helliwell et al., 2013).

       FIGURE 14.26 (a) Surveys of residents in over 150 countries indicate that Denmark has the happiest citizens in the

happy." In addition, more than 8 in 10 indicated that they were "very satisfied" with their lives (Carroll, 2007).
However, a recent poll found that only 42% of American adults report being "very happy." The groups that
show the greatest declines in happiness are people of color, those who have not completed a college education,
and those who politically identify as Democrats or independents (McCarthy, 2020). These results suggest that
challenging economic conditions may be related to declines in happiness. Of course, this interpretation
implies that happiness is closely tied to one's finances. But, is it? What factors influence happiness?

Factors Connected to Happiness

What really makes people happy? What factors contribute to sustained joy and contentment? Is it money,
attractiveness, material possessions, a rewarding occupation, a satisfying relationship? Extensive research
over the years has examined this question. One finding is that age is related to happiness: Life satisfaction
usually increases the older people get, but there do not appear to be gender differences in happiness (Diener,
Suh, Lucas, & Smith, 1999). Although it is important to point out that much of this work has been correlational,
many of the key findings (some of which may surprise you) are summarized below.

Family and other social relationships appear to be key factors correlated with happiness. Studies show that
married people report being happier than those who are single, divorced, or widowed (Diener et al., 1999).
Happy individuals also report that their marriages are fulfilling (Lyubomirsky, King, & Diener, 2005). In fact,
some have suggested that satisfaction with marriage and family life is the strongest predictor of happiness
(Myers, 2000). Happy people tend to have more friends, more high-quality social relationships, and stronger
social support networks than less happy people (Lyubomirsky et al., 2005). Happy people also have a high
frequency of contact with friends (Pinquart & Sörensen, 2000).

Can money buy happiness? In general, extensive research suggests that the answer is yes, but with several
caveats. While a nation's per capita gross domestic product (GDP) is associated with happiness levels (Helliwell
et al., 2013), changes in GDP (which is a less certain index of household income) bear little relationship to
changes in happiness (Diener, Tay, & Oishi, 2013). On the whole, residents of affluent countries tend to be
happier than residents of poor countries; within countries, wealthy individuals are happier than poor
individuals, but the association is much weaker (Diener & Biswas-Diener, 2002). To the extent that it leads to
increases in purchasing power, increases in income are associated with increases in happiness (Diener, Oishi,
& Ryan, 2013). However, income within societies appears to correlate with happiness only up to a point. In a
study of over 450,000 U.S. residents surveyed by the Gallup Organization, Kahneman and Deaton (2010) found
that well-being rises with annual income, but only up to $75,000. The average increase in reported well-being
for people with incomes greater than $75,000 was null. As implausible as these findings might seem--after all,
higher incomes would enable people to indulge in Hawaiian vacations, prime seats as sporting events,
expensive automobiles, and expansive new homes--higher incomes may impair people's ability to savor and
enjoy the small pleasures of life (Kahneman, 2011). Indeed, researchers in one study found that participants
exposed to a subliminal reminder of wealth spent less time savoring a chocolate candy bar and exhibited less
enjoyment of this experience than did participants who were not reminded of wealth (Quoidbach, Dunn,
Petrides, & Mikolajczak, 2010).

What about education and employment? Happy people, compared to those who are less happy, are more likely
to graduate from college and secure more meaningful and engaging jobs. Once they obtain a job, they are also
more likely to succeed (Lyubomirsky et al., 2005). While education shows a positive (but weak) correlation with
happiness, intelligence is not appreciably related to happiness (Diener et al., 1999).

Does religiosity correlate with happiness? In general, the answer is yes (Hackney & Sanders, 2003). However,
the relationship between religiosity and happiness depends on societal circumstances. Nations and states with
more difficult living conditions (e.g., widespread hunger and low life expectancy) tend to be more highly
religious than societies with more favorable living conditions. Among those who live in nations with difficult
living conditions, religiosity is associated with greater well-being; in nations with more favorable living
conditions, religious and nonreligious individuals report similar levels of well-being (Diener, Tay, & Myers,
524 14 · Stress, Lifestyle, and Health

       2011).
       Clearly the living conditions of one's nation can influence factors related to happiness. What about the
       influence of one's culture? To the extent that people possess characteristics that are highly valued by their
       culture, they tend to be happier (Diener, 2012). For example, self-esteem is a stronger predictor of life
       satisfaction in individualistic cultures than in collectivistic cultures (Diener, Diener, & Diener, 1995), and
       extraverted people tend to be happier in extraverted cultures than in introverted cultures (Fulmer et al., 2010).
       So we've identified many factors that exhibit some correlation to happiness. What factors don't show a
       correlation? Researchers have studied both parenthood and physical attractiveness as potential contributors
       to happiness, but no link has been identified. Although people tend to believe that parenthood is central to a
       meaningful and fulfilling life, aggregate findings from a range of countries indicate that people who do not
       have children are generally happier than those who do (Hansen, 2012). And although one's perceived level of
       attractiveness seems to predict happiness, a person's objective physical attractiveness is only weakly
       correlated with their happiness (Diener, Wolsic, & Fujita, 1995).
       Life Events and Happiness
       An important point should be considered regarding happiness. People are often poor at affective forecasting:
       predicting the intensity and duration of their future emotions (Wilson & Gilbert, 2003). In one study, nearly all
       newlywed spouses predicted their marital satisfaction would remain stable or improve over the following four
       years; despite this high level of initial optimism, their marital satisfaction actually declined during this period
       (Lavner, Karner, & Bradbury, 2013). In addition, we are often incorrect when estimating how our long-term
       happiness would change for the better or worse in response to certain life events. For example, it is easy for
       many of us to imagine how euphoric we would feel if we won the lottery, were asked on a date by an attractive
       celebrity, or were offered our dream job. It is also easy to understand how long-suffering fans of the Chicago
       Cubs baseball team, which had not won a World Series championship since 1908, thought they would feel
       permanently elated when their team finally won another World Series in 2016. Likewise, it is easy to predict
       that we would feel permanently miserable if we suffered a disabling accident or if a romantic relationship
       ended.
       However, something similar to sensory adaptation often occurs when people experience emotional reactions
       to life events. In much the same way our senses adapt to changes in stimulation (e.g., our eyes adapting to
       bright light after walking out of the darkness of a movie theater into the bright afternoon sun), we eventually
       adapt to changing emotional circumstances in our lives (Brickman & Campbell, 1971; Helson, 1964). When an
       event that provokes positive or negative emotions occurs, at first we tend to experience its emotional impact at
       full intensity. We feel a burst of pleasure following such things as a marriage proposal, birth of a child,
       acceptance to law school, an inheritance, and the like; as you might imagine, lottery winners experience a
       surge of happiness after hitting the jackpot (Lutter, 2007). Likewise, we experience a surge of misery following
       widowhood, a divorce, or a layoff from work. In the long run, however, we eventually adjust to the emotional
       new normal; the emotional impact of the event tends to erode, and we eventually revert to our original baseline
       happiness levels. Thus, what was at first a thrilling lottery windfall or World Series championship eventually
       loses its luster and becomes the status quo (Figure 14.27). Indeed, dramatic life events have much less long-
       lasting impact on happiness than might be expected (Brickman, Coats, & Janoff-Bulman, 1978).

FIGURE 14.27 (a) Long-suffering Chicago Cub fans felt elated in 2016 when their team won a World Series
championship, a feat that had not been accomplished by that franchise in over a century. (b) In ways that are similar,
those who play the lottery rightfully think that choosing the correct numbers and winning millions would lead to a
surge in happiness. However, the initial burst of elation following such elusive events would most likely erode with
time. (credit a: modification of work by Phil Roeder; credit b: modification of work by Robert S. Donovan)
Recently, some have raised questions concerning the extent to which important life events can permanently
alter people's happiness set points (Diener, Lucas, & Scollon, 2006). Evidence from a number of investigations
suggests that, in some circumstances, happiness levels do not revert to their original positions. For example,
although people generally tend to adapt to marriage so that it no longer makes them happier or unhappier
than before, they often do not fully adapt to unemployment or severe disabilities (Diener, 2012). Figure 14.28,
which is based on longitudinal data from a sample of over 3,000 German respondents, shows life satisfaction
scores several years before, during, and after various life events, and it illustrates how people adapt (or fail to
adapt) to these events. German respondents did not get lasting emotional boosts from marriage; instead, they
reported brief increases in happiness, followed by quick adaptation. In contrast, widows and those who had
been laid off experienced sizeable decreases in happiness that appeared to result in long-term changes in life
satisfaction (Diener et al., 2006). Further, longitudinal data from the same sample showed that happiness
levels changed significantly over time for nearly a quarter of respondents, with 9% showing major changes
(Fujita & Diener, 2005). Thus, long-term happiness levels can and do change for some people.

FIGURE 14.28 This graphs shows life satisfaction scores several years before and after three significant life events
(0 represents the year the event happened) (Diener et al., 2006).
Increasing Happiness
Some recent findings about happiness provide an optimistic picture, suggesting that real changes in happiness
are possible. For example, thoughtfully developed well-being interventions designed to augment people's
baseline levels of happiness may increase happiness in ways that are permanent and long-lasting, not just
temporary. These changes in happiness may be targeted at individual, organizational, and societal levels
526 14 · Stress, Lifestyle, and Health

       (Diener et al., 2006). Researchers in one study found that a series of happiness interventions involving such
       exercises as writing down three good things that occurred each day led to increases in happiness that lasted
       over six months (Seligman et al., 2005).

       Measuring happiness and well-being at the societal level over time may assist policy makers in determining if
       people are generally happy or miserable, as well as when and why they might feel the way they do. Studies
       show that average national happiness scores (over time and across countries) relate strongly to six key
       variables: per capita gross domestic product (GDP, which reflects a nation's economic standard of living), social
       support, freedom to make important life choices, healthy life expectancy, freedom from perceived corruption
       in government and business, and generosity (Helliwell et al., 2013). Investigating why people are happy or
       unhappy might help policymakers develop programs that increase happiness and well-being within a society
       (Diener et al., 2006). Resolutions about contemporary political and social issues that are frequent topics of
       debate--such as poverty, taxation, affordable health care and housing, clean air and water, and income
       inequality--might be best considered with people's happiness in mind.

      Positive Psychology

       In 1998, Seligman (the same person who conducted the learned helplessness experiments mentioned earlier),
       who was then president of the American Psychological Association, urged psychologists to focus more on
       understanding how to build human strength and psychological well-being. In deliberately setting out to create
       a new direction and new orientation for psychology, Seligman helped establish a growing movement and field
       of research called positive psychology (Compton, 2005). In a very general sense, positive psychology can be
       thought of as the science of happiness; it is an area of study that seeks to identify and promote those qualities
       that lead to greater fulfillment in our lives. This field looks at people's strengths and what helps individuals to
       lead happy, contented lives, and it moves away from focusing on people's pathology, faults, and problems.
       According to Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi (2000), positive psychology,

             at the subjective level is about valued subjective experiences: well-being, contentment, and
             satisfaction (in the past); hope and optimism (for the future); and... happiness (in the present). At the
             individual level, it is about positive individual traits: the capacity for love and vocation, courage,
             interpersonal skill, aesthetic sensibility, perseverance, forgiveness, originality, future mindedness,
             spirituality, high talent, and wisdom. (p. 5)

       Some of the topics studied by positive psychologists include altruism and empathy, creativity, forgiveness and
       compassion, the importance of positive emotions, enhancement of immune system functioning, savoring the
       fleeting moments of life, and strengthening virtues as a way to increase authentic happiness (Compton, 2005).
       Recent efforts in the field of positive psychology have focused on extending its principles toward peace and
       well-being at the level of the global community. In a war-torn world in which conflict, hatred, and distrust are
       common, such an extended "positive peace psychology" could have important implications for understanding
       how to overcome oppression and work toward global peace (Cohrs, Christie, White, & Das, 2013).

                                                                                                                   DIG DEEPER

        The Center for Investigating Healthy Minds

         On the campus of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the Center for Investigating Healthy Minds at the
         Waisman Center conducts rigorous scientific research on healthy aspects of the mind, such as kindness,
         forgiveness, compassion, and mindfulness. Established in 2008 and led by renowned neuroscientist Dr. Richard
         J. Davidson, the Center examines a wide range of ideas, including such things as a kindness curriculum in
         schools, neural correlates of prosocial behavior, psychological effects of Tai Chi training, digital games to foster
         prosocial behavior in children, and the effectiveness of yoga and breathing exercises in reducing symptoms of
         post-traumatic stress disorder.

  According to its website, the Center was founded after Dr. Davidson was challenged by His Holiness, the 14th
  Dalai Lama, "to apply the rigors of science to study positive qualities of mind" (Center for Investigating Health
  Minds, 2013). The Center continues to conduct scientific research with the aim of developing mental health
  training approaches that help people to live happier, healthier lives.

Positive Affect and Optimism

Taking a cue from positive psychology, extensive research over the last 10-15 years has examined the
importance of positive psychological attributes in physical well-being. Qualities that help promote
psychological well-being (e.g., having meaning and purpose in life, a sense of autonomy, positive emotions,
and satisfaction with life) are linked with a range of favorable health outcomes (especially improved
cardiovascular health) mainly through their relationships with biological functions and health behaviors (such
as diet, physical activity, and sleep quality) (Boehm & Kubzansky, 2012). The quality that has received attention
is positive affect, which refers to pleasurable engagement with the environment, such as happiness, joy,
enthusiasm, alertness, and excitement (Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988). The characteristics of positive affect,
as with negative affect (discussed earlier), can be brief, long-lasting, or trait-like (Pressman & Cohen, 2005).
Independent of age, gender, and income, positive affect is associated with greater social connectedness,
emotional and practical support, adaptive coping efforts, and lower depression; it is also associated with
longevity and favorable physiological functioning (Steptoe, O'Donnell, Marmot, & Wardle, 2008).

Positive affect also serves as a protective factor against heart disease. In a 10-year study of Nova Scotians, the
rate of heart disease was 22% lower for each one-point increase on the measure of positive affect, from 1 (no
positive affect expressed) to 5 (extreme positive affect) (Davidson, Mostofsky, & Whang, 2010). In terms of our
health, the expression, "don't worry, be happy" is helpful advice indeed. There has also been much work
suggesting that optimism--the general tendency to look on the bright side of things--is also a significant
predictor of positive health outcomes.

Although positive affect and optimism are related in some ways, they are not the same (Pressman & Cohen,
2005). Whereas positive affect is mostly concerned with positive feeling states, optimism has been regarded as
a generalized tendency to expect that good things will happen (Chang, 2001). It has also been conceptualized
as a tendency to view life's stressors and difficulties as temporary and external to oneself (Peterson & Steen,
2002). Numerous studies over the years have consistently shown that optimism is linked to longevity, healthier
behaviors, fewer postsurgical complications, better immune functioning among men with prostate cancer, and
better treatment adherence (Rasmussen & Wallio, 2008). Further, optimistic people report fewer physical
symptoms, less pain, better physical functioning, and are less likely to be rehospitalized following heart
surgery (Rasmussen, Scheier, & Greenhouse, 2009).

Flow

Another factor that seems to be important in fostering a deep sense of well-being is the ability to derive flow
from the things we do in life. Flow is described as a particular experience that is so engaging and engrossing
that it becomes worth doing for its own sake (Csikszentmihalyi, 1997). It is usually related to creative
endeavors and leisure activities, but it can also be experienced by workers who like their jobs or students who
love studying (Csikszentmihalyi, 1999). Many of us instantly recognize the notion of flow. In fact, the term
derived from respondents' spontaneous use of the term when asked to describe how it felt when what they
were doing was going well. When people experience flow, they become involved in an activity to the point
where they feel they lose themselves in the activity. They effortlessly maintain their concentration and focus,
they feel as though they have complete control of their actions, and time seems to pass more quickly than
usual (Csikszentmihalyi, 1997). Flow is considered a pleasurable experience, and it typically occurs when
people are engaged in challenging activities that require skills and knowledge they know they possess. For
example, people would be more likely report flow experiences in relation to their work or hobbies than in
528 14 · Stress, Lifestyle, and Health

       relation to eating. When asked the question, "Do you ever get involved in something so deeply that nothing else
       seems to matter, and you lose track of time?" about 20% of Americans and Europeans report having these
       flow-like experiences regularly (Csikszentmihalyi, 1997).
       Although wealth and material possessions are nice to have, the notion of flow suggests that neither are
       prerequisites for a happy and fulfilling life. Finding an activity that you are truly enthusiastic about, something
       so absorbing that doing it is reward itself (whether it be playing tennis, studying Arabic, writing children's
       novels, or cooking lavish meals) is perhaps the real key. According to Csikszentmihalyi (1999), creating
       conditions that make flow experiences possible should be a top social and political priority. How might this
       goal be achieved? How might flow be promoted in school systems? In the workplace? What potential benefits
       might be accrued from such efforts?
       In an ideal world, scientific research endeavors should inform us on how to bring about a better world for all
       people. The field of positive psychology promises to be instrumental in helping us understand what truly
       builds hope, optimism, happiness, healthy relationships, flow, and genuine personal fulfillment.

Summary

14.1 What Is Stress?

Stress is a process whereby an individual perceives and responds to events appraised as overwhelming or
threatening to one's well-being. The scientific study of how stress and emotional factors impact health and
well-being is called health psychology, a field devoted to studying the general impact of psychological factors
on health. The body's primary physiological response during stress, the fight-or-flight response, was first
identified in the early 20th century by Walter Cannon. The fight-or-flight response involves the coordinated
activity of both the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Hans
Selye, a noted endocrinologist, referred to these physiological reactions to stress as part of general adaptation
syndrome, which occurs in three stages: alarm reaction (fight-or-flight reactions begin), resistance (the body
begins to adapt to continuing stress), and exhaustion (adaptive energy is depleted, and stress begins to take a
physical toll).

14.2 Stressors

Stressors can be chronic (long term) or acute (short term), and can include traumatic events, significant life
changes, daily hassles, and situations in which people are frequently exposed to challenging and unpleasant
events. Many potential stressors include events or situations that require us to make changes in our lives, such
as a divorce or moving to a new residence. Thomas Holmes and Richard Rahe developed the Social

Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS) to measure stress by assigning a number of life change units to life events
that typically require some adjustment, including positive events. Although the SRRS has been criticized on a
number of grounds, extensive research has shown that the accumulation of many LCUs is associated with
increased risk of illness. Many potential stressors also include daily hassles, which are minor irritations and
annoyances that can build up over time. In addition, jobs that are especially demanding, offer little control over
one's working environment, or involve unfavorable working conditions can lead to job strain, thereby setting
the stage for job burnout.

14.3 Stress and Illness

Psychophysiological disorders are physical diseases that are either brought about or worsened by stress and
other emotional factors. One of the mechanisms through which stress and emotional factors can influence the
development of these diseases is by adversely affecting the body's immune system. A number of studies have
demonstrated that stress weakens the functioning of the immune system. Cardiovascular disorders are serious
medical conditions that have been consistently shown to be influenced by stress and negative emotions, such
as anger, negative affectivity, and depression. Other psychophysiological disorders that are known to be
influenced by stress and emotional factors include asthma and tension headaches.

14.4 Regulation of Stress

When faced with stress, people must attempt to manage or cope with it. In general, there are two basic forms of
coping: problem-focused coping and emotion-focused coping. Those who use problem-focused coping
strategies tend to cope better with stress because these strategies address the source of stress rather than the
resulting symptoms. To a large extent, perceived control greatly impacts reaction to stressors and is associated
with greater physical and mental well-being. Social support has been demonstrated to be a highly effective
buffer against the adverse effects of stress. Extensive research has shown that social support has beneficial
physiological effects for people, and it seems to influence immune functioning. However, the beneficial effects
of social support may be related to its influence on promoting healthy behaviors.

14.5 The Pursuit of Happiness

Happiness is conceptualized as an enduring state of mind that consists of the capacity to experience pleasure
in daily life, as well as the ability to engage one's skills and talents to enrich one's life and the lives of others.
Although people around the world generally report that they are happy, there are differences in average
happiness levels across nations. Although people have a tendency to overestimate the extent to which their
happiness set points would change for the better or for the worse following certain life events, researchers
have identified a number of factors that are consistently related to happiness. In recent years, positive
psychology has emerged as an area of study seeking to identify and promote qualities that lead to greater
happiness and fulfillment in our lives. These components include positive affect, optimism, and flow.

INTRODUCTION On Monday, September 16, 2013, a gunman killed 12 people as the workday began at the
Washington Navy Yard in Washington, DC. Aaron Alexis, 34, had a troubled history: he thought that he was
being controlled by radio waves. He called the police to complain about voices in his head and being under
surveillance by "shadowy forces" (Thomas, Levine, Date, & Cloherty, 2013). While Alexis's actions cannot be
excused, it is clear that he had some form of mental illness. Mental illness is not necessarily a cause of
violence; it is far more likely that the mentally ill will be victims rather than perpetrators of violence (Stuart,
2003). If, however, Alexis had received the help he needed, this tragedy might have been averted.

     15.1 What Are Psychological Disorders?

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Understand the problems inherent in defining the concept of psychological disorder
         · Describe what is meant by harmful dysfunction
         · Identify the formal criteria that thoughts, feelings, and behaviors must meet to be considered abnormal and,

             thus, symptomatic of a psychological disorder

       According to the American Psychiatric Association, a psychological disorder, or mental disorder, is "a
       syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotion regulation,
       or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or developmental processes underlying
       mental functioning. Mental disorders are usually associated with significant distress in social, occupational, or
       other important activities" (2013). Psychopathology is the study of psychological disorders, including their
       symptoms, etiology (i.e., their causes), and treatment. The term psychopathology can also refer to the
       manifestation of a psychological disorder. Although consensus can be difficult, it is extremely important for
       mental health professionals to agree on what kinds of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are truly abnormal in
       the sense that they genuinely indicate the presence of psychopathology. Certain patterns of behavior and inner
       experience can easily be labeled as abnormal and clearly signify some kind of psychological disturbance. The
       person who washes their hands 40 times per day and the person who claims to hear the voices of demons
       exhibit behaviors and inner experiences that most would regard as abnormal: beliefs and behaviors that
       suggest the existence of a psychological disorder. But, consider the nervousness a young man feels when
       talking to an attractive person or the loneliness and longing for home a first-year student experiences during
       her first semester of college--these feelings may not be regularly present, but they fall in the range of normal.
       So, what kinds of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors represent a true psychological disorder? Psychologists work
       to distinguish psychological disorders from inner experiences and behaviors that are merely situational,
       idiosyncratic, or unconventional.

       Mental health issues are often incorrectly viewed as less important than physical illnesses, and sometimes
       people are blamed or otherwise stigmatized for their condition. People with mental illnesses did not choose or
       create their illness, and cannot simply manage it through positive thinking or other attitudinal changes.
       Diagnosis, treatment, and support are all necessary, and all must be considered with respect and sensitivity to
       the extremely challenging nature of mental illness. While not everyone experiencing difficulty has a
       psychological disorder, mental health is critical to our ability to function in our relationships, education, and
       work. It is important that people talk with qualified professionals if they are having persistent feelings or
       experiences in line with the descriptions below; the discussion may or may not lead to a diagnosis, but as with
       physical illnesses, one has a better chance at success if they raise the issues with doctors or other experts.

      Definition of a Psychological Disorder

       Perhaps the simplest approach to conceptualizing psychological disorders is to label behaviors, thoughts, and
       inner experiences that are atypical, distressful, dysfunctional, and sometimes even dangerous, as signs of a
       disorder. For example, if you ask a classmate for a date and you are rejected, you probably would feel a little
       dejected. Such feelings would be normal. If you felt extremely depressed--so much so that you lost interest in
       activities, had difficulty eating or sleeping, felt utterly worthless, and contemplated suicide--your feelings
       would be atypical, would deviate from the norm, and could signify the presence of a psychological disorder.
       Just because something is atypical, however, does not necessarily mean it is disordered.

       For example, only about 4% of people in the United States have red hair, so red hair is considered an atypical
       characteristic (Figure 15.2), but it is not considered disordered, it's just unusual. And it is less unusual in
       Scotland, where approximately 13% of the population has red hair ("DNA Project Aims," 2012). As you will
       learn, some disorders, although not exactly typical, are far from atypical, and the rates in which they appear in
       the population are surprisingly high.

Cross are three natural redheads. (credit a: modification of work by Richard Goldschmidt; credit b: modification of
work by Glyn Lowe; credit c: modification of work by Kirk Weaver)
If we can agree that merely being atypical is an insufficient criterion for a having a psychological disorder, is it
reasonable to consider behavior or inner experiences that differ from widely expected cultural values or
expectations as disordered? Using this criterion, a person who walks around a subway platform wearing a
heavy winter coat in July while screaming obscenities at strangers may be considered as exhibiting symptoms
of a psychological disorder. Their actions and clothes violate socially accepted rules governing appropriate
dress and behavior; these characteristics are atypical.

Cultural Expectations

Violating cultural expectations is not, in and of itself, a satisfactory means of identifying the presence of a
psychological disorder. Since behavior varies from one culture to another, what may be expected and
considered appropriate in one culture may not be viewed as such in other cultures. For example, returning a
stranger's smile is expected in the United States because a pervasive social norm dictates that we reciprocate
friendly gestures. A person who refuses to acknowledge such gestures might be considered socially
awkward--perhaps even disordered--for violating this expectation. However, such expectations are not
universally shared. Cultural expectations in Japan involve showing reserve, restraint, and a concern for
maintaining privacy around strangers. Japanese people are generally unresponsive to smiles from strangers
(Patterson et al., 2007). Eye contact provides another example. In the United States and Europe, eye contact
with others typically signifies honesty and attention. However, most Latin-American, Asian, and African
cultures interpret direct eye contact as rude, confrontational, and aggressive (Pazain, 2010). Thus, someone
who makes eye contact with you could be considered appropriate and respectful or brazen and offensive,
depending on your culture (Figure 15.3).

       FIGURE 15.3 Eye contact is one of many social gestures that vary from culture to culture. (credit: Joi Ito)
Hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not physically present) in Western societies is a violation of
540 15 · Psychological Disorders

       cultural expectations, and a person who reports such inner experiences is readily labeled as psychologically
       disordered. In other cultures, visions that, for example, pertain to future events may be regarded as normal
       experiences that are positively valued (Bourguignon, 1970). Finally, it is important to recognize that cultural
       norms change over time: what might be considered typical in a society at one time may no longer be viewed
       this way later, similar to how fashion trends from one era may elicit quizzical looks decades later--imagine how
       a headband, legwarmers, and the big hair of the 1980s would go over on your campus today.

                                                                                                                   DIG DEEPER

        The Myth of Mental Illness

         In the 1950s and 1960s, the concept of mental illness was widely criticized. One of the major criticisms focused
         on the notion that mental illness was a "myth that justifies psychiatric intervention in socially disapproved
         behavior" (Wakefield, 1992). Thomas Szasz (1960), a noted psychiatrist, was perhaps the biggest proponent of
         this view. Szasz argued that the notion of mental illness was invented by society (and the mental health
         establishment) to stigmatize and subjugate people whose behavior violates accepted social and legal norms.
         Indeed, Szasz suggested that what appear to be symptoms of mental illness are more appropriately
         characterized as "problems in living" (Szasz, 1960).

         In his 1961 book, The Myth of Mental Illness: Foundations of a Theory of Personal Conduct, Szasz expressed his
         disdain for the concept of mental illness and for the field of psychiatry in general (Oliver, 2006). The basis for
         Szasz's attack was his contention that detectable abnormalities in bodily structures and functions (e.g.,
         infections and organ damage or dysfunction) represent the defining features of genuine illness or disease, and
         because symptoms of purported mental illness are not accompanied by such detectable abnormalities, so-called
         psychological disorders are not disorders at all. Szasz (1961/2010) proclaimed that "disease or illness can only
         affect the body; hence, there can be no mental illness" (p. 267).

         Today, we recognize the extreme level of psychological suffering experienced by people with psychological
         disorders: the painful thoughts and feelings they experience, the disordered behavior they demonstrate, and the
         levels of distress and impairment they exhibit. This makes it very difficult to deny the reality of mental illness.

         However controversial Szasz's views and those of his supporters might have been, they have influenced the
         mental health community and society in several ways. First, lay people, politicians, and professionals now often
         refer to mental illness as mental health "problems," implicitly acknowledging the "problems in living"
         perspective Szasz described (Buchanan-Barker & Barker, 2009). Also influential was Szasz's view of sexual
         orientation. Szasz was perhaps the first psychiatrist to openly challenge the idea that same-sex attraction
         represented a form of mental illness or disease (Szasz, 1965), which helped pave the way for the social and civil
         rights that gay and lesbian people now have (Barker, 2010). His work also inspired legal changes that protect the
         rights of people in psychiatric institutions and allow such individuals a greater degree of influence and
         responsibility over their lives (Buchanan-Barker & Barker, 2009).

      Harmful Dysfunction

       If none of the criterion discussed so far is adequate by itself to define the presence of a psychological disorder,
       how can a disorder be conceptualized? Many efforts have been made to identify the specific dimensions of
       psychological disorders, yet none is entirely satisfactory. No universal definition of psychological disorder
       exists that can apply to all situations in which a disorder is thought to be present (Zachar & Kendler, 2007).
       However, one of the more influential conceptualizations was proposed by Wakefield (1992), who defined
       psychological disorder as a harmful dysfunction. Wakefield argued that natural internal mechanisms--that is,
       psychological processes honed by evolution, such as cognition, perception, and learning--have important
       functions, such as enabling us to experience the world the way others do and to engage in rational thought,
       problem solving, and communication. For example, learning allows us to associate a fear with a potential

                                                                                                                                  15.1 · What Are Psychological Disorders? 541

danger in such a way that the intensity of fear is roughly equal to the degree of actual danger. Dysfunction
occurs when an internal mechanism breaks down and can no longer perform its normal function. But, the
presence of a dysfunction by itself does not determine a disorder. The dysfunction must be harmful in that it
leads to negative consequences for the individual or for others, as judged by the standards of the individual's
culture. The harm may include significant internal anguish (e.g., high levels of anxiety or depression) or
problems in day-to-day living (e.g., in one's social or work life).

To illustrate, Janet has an extreme fear of spiders. Janet's fear might be considered a dysfunction in that it
signals that the internal mechanism of learning is not working correctly (i.e., a faulty process prevents Janet
from appropriately associating the magnitude of fear with the actual threat posed by spiders). Janet's fear of
spiders has a significant negative influence on daily life: she avoids all situations in which she suspects spiders
to be present (e.g., the basement or a friend's home), and she quit her job last month because she saw a spider
in the restroom at work and is now unemployed. According to the harmful dysfunction model, Janet's
condition would signify a disorder because (a) there is a dysfunction in an internal mechanism, and (b) the
dysfunction has resulted in harmful consequences. Similar to how the symptoms of physical illness reflect
dysfunctions in biological processes, the symptoms of psychological disorders presumably reflect
dysfunctions in mental processes. The internal mechanism component of this model is especially appealing
because it implies that disorders may occur through a breakdown of biological functions that govern various
psychological processes, thus supporting contemporary neurobiological models of psychological disorders
(Fabrega, 2007).

The American Psychiatric Association (APA) Definition

Many of the features of the harmful dysfunction model are incorporated in a formal definition of psychological
disorder developed by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). According to the APA (2013), a
psychological disorder is a condition that is said to consist of the following:

  · There are significant disturbances in thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. A person must experience
      inner states (e.g., thoughts and/or feelings) and exhibit behaviors that are clearly disturbed--that is,
      unusual, but in a negative, self-defeating way. Often, such disturbances are troubling to those around the
      individual who experiences them. For example, an individual who is uncontrollably preoccupied by
      thoughts of germs spends hours each day bathing, has inner experiences, and displays behaviors that
      most would consider atypical and negative (disturbed) and that would likely be troubling to family
      members.

  · The disturbances reflect some kind of biological, psychological, or developmental dysfunction.
      Disturbed patterns of inner experiences and behaviors should reflect some flaw (dysfunction) in the
      internal biological, psychological, and developmental mechanisms that lead to normal, healthy
      psychological functioning. For example, the hallucinations observed in schizophrenia could be a sign of
      brain abnormalities.

  · The disturbances lead to significant distress or disability in one's life. A person's inner experiences and
      behaviors are considered to reflect a psychological disorder if they cause the person considerable distress,
      or greatly impair their ability to function as a normal individual (often referred to as functional
      impairment, or occupational and social impairment). As an illustration, a person's fear of social situations
      might be so distressing that it causes the person to avoid all social situations (e.g., preventing that person
      from being able to attend class or apply for a job).

  · The disturbances do not reflect expected or culturally approved responses to certain events.
      Disturbances in thoughts, feelings, and behaviors must be socially unacceptable responses to certain
      events that often happen in life. For example, it is perfectly natural (and expected) that a person would
      experience great sadness and might wish to be left alone following the death of a close family member.
      Because such reactions are in some ways culturally expected, the individual would not be assumed to
      signify a mental disorder.
542 15 · Psychological Disorders

       Some believe that there is no essential criterion or set of criteria that can definitively distinguish all cases of
       disorder from nondisorder (Lilienfeld & Marino, 1999). In truth, no single approach to defining a psychological
       disorder is adequate by itself, nor is there universal agreement on where the boundary is between disordered
       and not disordered. From time to time we all experience anxiety, unwanted thoughts, and moments of
       sadness; our behavior at other times may not make much sense to ourselves or to others. These inner
       experiences and behaviors can vary in their intensity, but are only considered disordered when they are highly
       disturbing to us and/or others, suggest a dysfunction in normal mental functioning, and are associated with
       significant distress or disability in social or occupational activities.

     15.2 Diagnosing and Classifying Psychological Disorders

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain why classification systems are necessary in the study of psychopathology
         · Describe the basic features of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)
         · Discuss changes in the DSM over time, including criticisms of the current edition
         · Identify which disorders are generally the most common
       A first step in the study of psychological disorders is carefully and systematically discerning significant signs
       and symptoms. How do mental health professionals ascertain whether or not a person's inner states and
       behaviors truly represent a psychological disorder? Arriving at a proper diagnosis--that is, appropriately
       identifying and labeling a set of defined symptoms--is absolutely crucial. This process enables professionals to
       use a common language with others in the field and aids in communication about the disorder with the
       patient, colleagues and the public. A proper diagnosis is an essential element to guide proper and successful
       treatment. For these reasons, classification systems that organize psychological disorders systematically are
       necessary.

      The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)

       Although a number of classification systems have been developed over time, the one that is used by most
       mental health professionals in the United States is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
       (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association (2013). (Note that the American Psychiatric
       Association differs from the American Psychological Association; both are abbreviated APA.) The first edition
       of the DSM, published in 1952, classified psychological disorders according to a format developed by the U.S.
       Army during World War II (Clegg, 2012). In the years since, the DSM has undergone numerous revisions and
       editions. The most recent edition, published in 2013, is the DSM-5 (APA, 2013). The DSM-5 includes many
       categories of disorders (e.g., anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and dissociative disorders). Each
       disorder is described in detail, including an overview of the disorder (diagnostic features), specific symptoms
       required for diagnosis (diagnostic criteria), prevalence information (what percent of the population is thought
       to be afflicted with the disorder), and risk factors associated with the disorder. Figure 15.4 shows lifetime
       prevalence rates--the percentage of people in a population who develop a disorder in their lifetime--of various
       psychological disorders among U.S. adults. These data were based on a national sample of 9,282 U.S. residents
       (National Comorbidity Survey, 2007).

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                           15.2 · Diagnosing and Classifying Psychological Disorders 543

FIGURE 15.4 The graph shows the breakdown of psychological disorders, comparing the percentage prevalence
among adult males and adult females in the United States. Because the data is from 2007, the categories shown
here are from the DSM-IV, which has been supplanted by the DSM-5. Most categories remain the same; however,
alcohol abuse now falls under a broader Alcohol Use Disorder category.
The DSM-5 also provides information about comorbidity; the co-occurrence of two disorders. For example, the
DSM-5 mentions that 41% of people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) also meet the diagnostic
criteria for major depressive disorder (Figure 15.5). Problematic substance use is highly comorbid with other
mental illnesses; 6 out of 10 people who have a substance use disorder also suffer from another form of mental
illness (National Institute on Drug Abuse [NIDA], 2007).

 FIGURE 15.5 Obsessive-compulsive disorder and major depressive disorder frequently occur in the same person.

         CONNECT THE CONCEPTS
Comorbidity

As you've learned in the text, comorbidity refers to situations in which an individual suffers from more than one
disorder, and often the symptoms of each can interact in negative ways. Co-occurrence and comorbidity of
psychological disorders are quite common, and some of the most pervasive comorbidities involve substance use
disorders that co-occur with psychological disorders. Indeed, some estimates suggest that around a quarter of
544 15 · Psychological Disorders

       people who suffer from the most severe cases of mental illness exhibit substance use disorder as well. Conversely,
       around 10 percent of individuals seeking treatment for substance use disorder have serious mental illnesses.
       Observations such as these have important implications for treatment options that are available. When people with
       a mental illness are also habitual drug users, their symptoms can be exacerbated and resistant to treatment.
       Furthermore, it is not always clear whether the symptoms are due to drug use, the mental illness, or a combination
       of the two. Therefore, it is recommended that behavior is observed in situations in which the individual has ceased
       using drugs and is no longer experiencing withdrawal from the drug in order to make the most accurate diagnosis
       (NIDA, 2018).

       Obviously, substance use disorders are not the only possible comorbidities. In fact, some of the most common
       psychological disorders tend to co-occur. For instance, more than half of individuals who have a primary diagnosis of
       depressive disorder are estimated to exhibit some sort of anxiety disorder. The reverse is also true for those
       diagnosed with a primary diagnosis of an anxiety disorder. Further, anxiety disorders and major depression have a
       high rate of comorbidity with several other psychological disorders (Al-Asadi, Klein, & Meyer, 2015).

       The DSM has changed considerably in the half-century since it was originally published. The first two editions
       of the DSM, for example, listed homosexuality as a disorder; however, in 1973, the APA voted to remove it from
       the manual (Silverstein, 2009). While the DSM-III did not list homosexuality as a disorder, it introduced a new
       diagnosis, ego-dystonic homosexuality, which emphasized same-sex arousal that the patient viewed as
       interfering with desired heterosexual relationships and causing distress for the individual. This new diagnosis
       was considered by many as a compromise to appease those who viewed homosexuality as a mental illness.
       Other professionals questioned how appropriate it was to have a separate diagnosis that described the content
       of an individual's distress. In 1986, the diagnosis was removed from the DSM-III-R (Herek, 2012). Additionally,
       beginning with the DSM-III in 1980, mental disorders have been described in much greater detail, and the
       number of diagnosable conditions has grown steadily, as has the size of the manual itself. DSM-I included 106
       diagnoses and was 130 total pages, whereas DSM-III included more than 2 times as many diagnoses (265) and
       was nearly seven times its size (886 total pages) (Mayes & Horowitz, 2005). Although DSM-5 is longer than
       DSM-IV, the volume includes only 237 disorders, a decrease from the 297 disorders that were listed in DSM-IV.
       The latest edition, DSM-5, includes revisions in the organization and naming of categories and in the
       diagnostic criteria for various disorders (Regier, Kuhl, & Kupfer, 2012), while emphasizing careful
       consideration of the importance of gender and cultural difference in the expression of various symptoms
       (Fisher, 2010).

       Some believe that establishing new diagnoses might overpathologize the human condition by turning common
       human problems into mental illnesses (The Associated Press, 2013). Indeed, the finding that nearly half of all
       Americans will meet the criteria for a DSM disorder at some point in their life (Kessler et al., 2005) likely fuels
       much of this skepticism. The DSM-5 is also criticized on the grounds that its diagnostic criteria have been
       loosened, thereby threatening to "turn our current diagnostic inflation into diagnostic hyperinflation"
       (Frances, 2012, para. 22). For example, DSM-IV specified that the symptoms of major depressive disorder must
       not be attributable to normal bereavement (loss of a loved one). The DSM-5, however, has removed this
       bereavement exclusion, essentially meaning that grief and sadness after a loved one's death can constitute
       major depressive disorder.

      The International Classification of Diseases

       A second classification system, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), is also widely recognized.
       Published by the World Health Organization (WHO), the ICD was developed in Europe shortly after World War
       II and, like the DSM, has been revised several times. The categories of psychological disorders in both the DSM
       and ICD are similar, as are the criteria for specific disorders; however, some differences exist. Although the ICD
       is used for clinical purposes, this tool is also used to examine the general health of populations and to monitor
       the prevalence of diseases and other health problems internationally (WHO, 2013). The ICD is in its 10th

edition (ICD-10); however, efforts are now underway to develop a new edition (ICD-11) that, in conjunction with
the changes in DSM-5, will help harmonize the two classification systems as much as possible (APA, 2013).

A study that compared the use of the two classification systems found that worldwide the ICD is more
frequently used for clinical diagnosis, whereas the DSM is more valued for research (Mezzich, 2002). Most
research findings concerning the etiology and treatment of psychological disorders are based on criteria set
forth in the DSM (Oltmanns & Castonguay, 2013). The DSM also includes more explicit disorder criteria, along
with an extensive and helpful explanatory text (Regier et al., 2012). The DSM is the classification system of
choice among U.S. mental health professionals, and this chapter is based on the DSM paradigm.

The Compassionate View of Psychological Disorders

As these disorders are outlined, please bear two things in mind. First, remember that psychological disorders
represent extremes of inner experience and behavior. If, while reading about these disorders, you feel that
these descriptions begin to personally characterize you, do not worry--this moment of enlightenment probably
means nothing more than you have had a range of experiences and emotions. Each of us experiences episodes
of sadness, anxiety, and preoccupation with certain thoughts--times when we do not quite feel ourselves.
These episodes should not be considered problematic unless the accompanying thoughts and behaviors
become extreme and have a disruptive effect on one's life. Second, understand that people with psychological
disorders are far more than just embodiments of their disorders. We do not use terms such as schizophrenics,
depressives, or phobics because they are labels that objectify people who have these conditions, thus
promoting biased and disparaging assumptions about them. It is important to remember that a psychological
disorder is not what a person is; it is something that a person has--through no fault of their own. As is the case
with cancer or diabetes, those with psychological disorders suffer debilitating, often painful conditions that are
not of their own choosing. These individuals deserve to be viewed and treated with compassion,
understanding, and dignity.

15.3 Perspectives on Psychological Disorders

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Discuss supernatural perspectives on the origin of psychological disorders, in their historical context
  · Describe modern biological and psychological perspectives on the origin of psychological disorders
  · Identify which disorders generally show the highest degree of heritability
  · Describe the diathesis-stress model and its importance to the study of psychopathology

Scientists, mental health professionals, and cultural healers may adopt different perspectives in attempting to
understand or explain the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the development of a psychological
disorder. The specific perspective used in explaining a psychological disorder is extremely important. Each
perspective explains psychological disorders, their causes or etiology, and effective treatments from a different
viewpoint. Different perspectives provide alternate ways for how to think about the nature of psychopathology.

Supernatural Perspectives of Psychological Disorders

For centuries, psychological disorders were viewed from a supernatural perspective: attributed to a force
beyond scientific understanding. Those afflicted were thought to be practitioners of black magic or possessed
by spirits (Figure 15.6) (Maher & Maher, 1985). For example, convents throughout Europe in the 16th and 17th
centuries reported hundreds of nuns falling into a state of frenzy in which the afflicted foamed at the mouth,
screamed and convulsed, sexually propositioned priests, and confessed to having carnal relations with devils
or Christ. Although, today, these cases would suggest serious mental illness; at the time, these events were
routinely explained as possession by devilish forces (Waller, 2009a). Similarly, grievous fits by young girls are
believed to have precipitated the witch panic in New England late in the 17th century (Demos, 1983). Such
beliefs in supernatural causes of mental illness are still held in some societies today; for example, beliefs that
supernatural forces cause mental illness are common in some cultures in modern-day Nigeria (Aghukwa,
546 15 · Psychological Disorders

       2012).

       FIGURE 15.6 In The Extraction of the Stone of Madness, a 15th century painting by Hieronymus Bosch, a
       practitioner is using a tool to extract an object (the supposed "stone of madness") from the head of an afflicted
       person.

                                                                                                                   DIG DEEPER
        Dancing Mania

         Between the 11th and 17th centuries, a curious epidemic swept across Western Europe. Groups of people would
         suddenly begin to dance with wild abandon. This compulsion to dance--referred to as dancing
         mania--sometimes gripped thousands of people at a time (Figure 15.7). Historical accounts indicate that those
         afflicted would sometimes dance with bruised and bloody feet for days or weeks, screaming of terrible visions
         and begging priests and monks to save their souls (Waller, 2009b). What caused dancing mania is not known, but
         several explanations have been proposed, including spider venom and ergot poisoning ("Dancing Mania," 2011).

         FIGURE 15.7 Although the cause of dancing mania, depicted in this painting, was unclear, the behavior was
         attributed to supernatural forces.
         Historian John Waller (2009a, 2009b) has provided a comprehensive and convincing explanation of dancing
         mania that suggests the phenomenon was attributable to a combination of three factors: psychological distress,
         social contagion, and belief in supernatural forces. Waller argued that various disasters of the time (such as
         famine, plagues, and floods) produced high levels of psychological distress that could increase the likelihood of

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                          15.3 · Perspectives on Psychological Disorders 547

  succumbing to an involuntary trance state. Waller indicated that anthropological studies and accounts of
  possession rituals show that people are more likely to enter a trance state if they expect it to happen, and that
  entranced individuals behave in a ritualistic manner, their thoughts and behavior shaped by the spiritual beliefs
  of their culture. Thus, during periods of extreme physical and mental distress, all it took were a few
  people--believing themselves to have been afflicted with a dancing curse--to slip into a spontaneous trance and
  then act out the part of one who is cursed by dancing for days on end.

Biological Perspectives of Psychological Disorders

The biological perspective views psychological disorders as linked to biological phenomena, such as genetic
factors, chemical imbalances, and brain abnormalities; it has gained considerable attention and acceptance in
recent decades (Wyatt & Midkiff, 2006). Evidence from many sources indicates that most psychological
disorders have a genetic component; in fact, there is little dispute that some disorders are largely due to
genetic factors. The graph in Figure 15.8 shows heritability estimates for schizophrenia.

FIGURE 15.8 A person's risk of developing schizophrenia increases if a relative has schizophrenia. The closer the
genetic relationship, the higher the risk.
Findings such as these have led many of today's researchers to search for specific genes and genetic mutations
that contribute to mental disorders. Also, sophisticated neural imaging technology in recent decades has
revealed how abnormalities in brain structure and function might be directly involved in many disorders, and
advances in our understanding of neurotransmitters and hormones have yielded insights into their possible
connections. The biological perspective is currently thriving in the study of psychological disorders.

The Diathesis-Stress Model of Psychological Disorders

Despite advances in understanding the biological basis of psychological disorders, the psychosocial
perspective is still very important. This perspective emphasizes the importance of learning, stress, faulty and
self-defeating thinking patterns, and environmental factors. Perhaps the best way to think about psychological
disorders, then, is to view them as originating from a combination of biological and psychological processes.
Many develop not from a single cause, but from a delicate fusion between partly biological and partly
psychosocial factors.
The diathesis-stress model (Zuckerman, 1999) integrates biological and psychosocial factors to predict the
likelihood of a disorder. This diathesis-stress model suggests that people with an underlying predisposition for
548 15 · Psychological Disorders

       a disorder (i.e., a diathesis) are more likely than others to develop a disorder when faced with adverse
       environmental or psychological events (i.e., stress), such as childhood maltreatment, negative life events,
       trauma, and so on. A diathesis is not always a biological vulnerability to an illness; some diatheses may be
       psychological (e.g., a tendency to think about life events in a pessimistic, self-defeating way).

       The key assumption of the diathesis-stress model is that both factors, diathesis and stress, are necessary in the
       development of a disorder. Different models explore the relationship between the two factors: the level of
       stress needed to produce the disorder is inversely proportional to the level of diathesis.

     15.4 Anxiety Disorders

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Distinguish normal anxiety from pathological anxiety
         · List and describe the major anxiety disorders, including their main features and prevalence
         · Describe basic psychological and biological factors that are suspected to be important in the etiology of anxiety

             disorder

       Everybody experiences anxiety from time to time. Although anxiety is closely related to fear, the two states
       possess important differences. Fear involves an instantaneous reaction to an imminent threat, whereas
       anxiety involves apprehension, avoidance, and cautiousness regarding a potential threat, danger, or other
       negative event (Craske, 1999). While anxiety is unpleasant to most people, it is important to our health, safety,
       and well-being. Anxiety motivates us to take actions--such as preparing for exams, watching our weight,
       showing up to work on time--that enable us to avert potential future problems. Anxiety also motivates us to
       avoid certain things--such as running up debts and engaging in illegal activities--that could lead to future
       trouble. Most individuals' level and duration of anxiety approximates the magnitude of the potential threat
       they face. For example, suppose a student who came to the U.S. as a "Dreamer" (someone whose parents didn't
       lawfully immigrate) is concerned about the possibility of being unable to continue in the university program or
       of losing access to academic financial aid, due to changes and litigation around the Deferred Action for
       Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. This person likely would experience anxiety of greater intensity and
       duration than would a 21-year-old junior who entered college as a birthright citizen. Some people experience
       anxiety that is excessive, persistent, and greatly out of proportion to the actual threat; if one's anxiety has a
       disruptive influence on one's life, this is a strong indicator that the individual is experiencing an anxiety
       disorder.

       Anxiety disorders are characterized by excessive and persistent fear and anxiety, and by related disturbances
       in behavior (APA, 2013). Although anxiety is universally experienced, anxiety disorders cause considerable
       distress. As a group, anxiety disorders are common: approximately 25%-30% of the U.S. population meets the
       criteria for at least one anxiety disorder during their lifetime (Kessler et al., 2005). Also, these disorders appear
       to be much more common in women than they are in men; within a 12-month period, around 23% of women
       and 14% of men will experience at least one anxiety disorder (National Comorbidity Survey, 2007). Anxiety
       disorders are the most frequently occurring class of mental disorders and are often comorbid with each other
       and with other mental disorders (Kessler, Ruscio, Shear, & Wittchen, 2009).

      Specific Phobia

       Phobia is a Greek word that means fear. A person diagnosed with a specific phobia (formerly known as simple
       phobia) experiences excessive, distressing, and persistent fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation
       (such as animals, enclosed spaces, elevators, or flying) (APA, 2013). Even though people realize their level of
       fear and anxiety in relation to the phobic stimulus is irrational, some people with a specific phobia may go to
       great lengths to avoid the phobic stimulus (the object or situation that triggers the fear and anxiety). Typically,
       the fear and anxiety a phobic stimulus elicits is disruptive to the person's life. For example, a man with a
       phobia of flying might refuse to accept a job that requires frequent air travel, thus negatively affecting his

career. Clinicians who have worked with people who have specific phobias have encountered many kinds of
phobias, some of which are shown in Table 15.1.

Specific phobias are common; in the United States, around 12.5% of the population will meet the criteria for a
specific phobia at some point in their lifetime (Kessler et al., 2005). One type of phobia, agoraphobia, is listed
in the DSM-5 as a separate anxiety disorder. Agoraphobia, which literally means "fear of the marketplace," is
characterized by intense fear, anxiety, and avoidance of situations in which it might be difficult to escape or
receive help if one experiences symptoms of a panic attack (a state of extreme anxiety that we will discuss
shortly). These situations include public transportation, open spaces (parking lots), enclosed spaces (stores),
crowds, or being outside the home alone (APA, 2013). About 1.4% of Americans experience agoraphobia
during their lifetime (Kessler et al., 2005).

Acquisition of Phobias Through Learning

Many theories suggest that phobias develop through learning. Rachman (1977) proposed that phobias can be
acquired through three major learning pathways. The first pathway is through classical conditioning. As you
may recall, classical conditioning is a form of learning in which a previously neutral stimulus is paired with an
unconditioned stimulus (UCS) that reflexively elicits an unconditioned response (UCR), eliciting the same
response through its association with the unconditioned stimulus. The response is called a conditioned
response (CR). For example, a child who has been bitten by a dog may come to fear dogs because of a past
association with pain. In this case, the dog bite is the UCS and the fear it elicits is the UCR. Because a dog was
associated with the bite, any dog may come to serve as a conditioned stimulus, thereby eliciting fear; the fear
the child experiences around dogs, then, becomes a CR.

The second pathway of phobia acquisition is through vicarious learning, such as modeling. For example, a
child who observes their cousin react fearfully to spiders may later express the same fears, even though
spiders have never presented any danger to them. This phenomenon has been observed in both humans and
nonhuman primates (Olsson & Phelps, 2007). A study of laboratory-reared monkeys readily acquired a fear of
550 15 · Psychological Disorders

       snakes after observing wild-reared monkeys react fearfully to snakes (Mineka & Cook, 1993).

       The third pathway is through verbal transmission or information. For example, a child whose parents, siblings,
       friends, and classmates constantly tell them how disgusting and dangerous snakes are may come to acquire a
       fear of snakes.

       Interestingly, people are more likely to develop phobias of things that do not represent much actual danger to
       themselves, such as animals and heights, and are less likely to develop phobias toward things that present
       legitimate danger in contemporary society, such as motorcycles and weapons (Öhman & Mineka, 2001). Why
       might this be so? One theory suggests that the human brain is evolutionarily predisposed to more readily
       associate certain objects or situations with fear (Seligman, 1971). This theory argues that throughout our
       evolutionary history, our ancestors associated certain stimuli (e.g., snakes, spiders, heights, and thunder) with
       potential danger. As time progressed, the mind has become adapted to more readily develop fears of these
       things than of others. Experimental evidence has consistently demonstrated that conditioned fears develop
       more readily to fear-relevant stimuli (images of snakes and spiders) than to fear-irrelevant stimuli (images of
       flowers and berries) (Öhman & Mineka, 2001). Such prepared learning has also been shown to occur in
       monkeys. In one study (Cook & Mineka, 1989), monkeys watched videotapes of model monkeys reacting
       fearfully to either fear-relevant stimuli (toy snakes or a toy crocodile) or fear-irrelevant stimuli (flowers or a toy
       rabbit). The observer monkeys developed fears of the fear-relevant stimuli but not the fear-irrelevant stimuli.

      Social Anxiety Disorder

       Social anxiety disorder (formerly called social phobia) is characterized by extreme and persistent fear or
       anxiety and avoidance of social situations in which the person could potentially be evaluated negatively by
       others (APA, 2013). As with specific phobias, social anxiety disorder is common in the United States; a little
       over 12% of all Americans experience social anxiety disorder during their lifetime (Kessler et al., 2005).

       The heart of the fear and anxiety in social anxiety disorder is the person's concern that they may act in a
       humiliating or embarrassing way, such as appearing foolish, showing symptoms of anxiety (blushing), or doing
       or saying something that might lead to rejection (such as offending others). The kinds of social situations in
       which individuals with social anxiety disorder usually have problems include public speaking, having a
       conversation, meeting strangers, eating in restaurants, and, in some cases, using public restrooms. Although
       many people become anxious in social situations like public speaking, the fear, anxiety, and avoidance
       experienced in social anxiety disorder are highly distressing and lead to serious impairments in life. Adults
       with this disorder are more likely to experience lower educational attainment and lower earnings (Katzelnick
       et al., 2001), perform more poorly at work and are more likely to be unemployed (Moitra, Beard, Weisberg, &
       Keller, 2011), and report greater dissatisfaction with their family lives, friends, leisure activities, and income
       (Stein & Kean, 2000).

       When people with social anxiety disorder are unable to avoid situations that provoke anxiety, they typically
       perform safety behaviors: mental or behavioral acts that reduce anxiety in social situations by reducing the
       chance of negative social outcomes. Safety behaviors include avoiding eye contact, rehearsing sentences
       before speaking, talking only briefly, and not talking about oneself (Alden & Bieling, 1998). Other examples of
       safety behaviors include the following (Marker, 2013):

         · assuming roles in social situations that minimize interaction with others (e.g., taking pictures, setting up
             equipment, or helping prepare food)

         · asking people many questions to keep the focus off of oneself
         · selecting a position to avoid scrutiny or contact with others (sitting in the back of the room)
         · wearing bland, neutral clothes to avoid drawing attention to oneself
         · avoiding substances or activities that might cause anxiety symptoms (such as caffeine, warm clothing, and

             physical exercise)

       Although these behaviors are intended to prevent the person with social anxiety disorder from doing

something awkward that might draw criticism, these actions usually exacerbate the problem because they do
not allow the individual to disconfirm their negative beliefs, often eliciting rejection and other negative
reactions from others (Alden & Bieling, 1998).

People with social anxiety disorder may resort to self-medication, such as drinking alcohol, as a means to avert
the anxiety symptoms they experience in social situations (Battista & Kocovski, 2010). The use of alcohol when
faced with such situations may become negatively reinforcing: encouraging individuals with social anxiety
disorder to turn to the substance whenever they experience anxiety symptoms. The tendency to use alcohol as
a coping mechanism for social anxiety, however, can come with a hefty price tag: a number of large scale
studies have reported a high rate of comorbidity between social anxiety disorder and alcohol use disorder
(Morris, Stewart, & Ham, 2005).

As with specific phobias, it is highly probable that the fears inherent to social anxiety disorder can develop
through conditioning experiences. For example, a child who is subjected to early unpleasant social
experiences (e.g., bullying at school) may develop negative social images of herself that become activated later
in anxiety-provoking situations (Hackmann, Clark, & McManus, 2000). Indeed, one study reported that 92% of
a sample of adults with social anxiety disorder reported a history of severe teasing in childhood, compared to
only 35% of a sample of adults with panic disorder (McCabe, Antony, Summerfeldt, Liss, & Swinson, 2003).

One of the most well-established risk factors for developing social anxiety disorder is behavioral inhibition
(Clauss & Blackford, 2012). Behavioral inhibition is thought to be an inherited trait, and it is characterized by a
consistent tendency to show fear and restraint when presented with unfamiliar people or situations (Kagan,
Reznick, & Snidman, 1988). Behavioral inhibition is displayed very early in life; behaviorally inhibited toddlers
and children respond with great caution and restraint in unfamiliar situations, and they are often timid,
fearful, and shy around unfamiliar people (Fox, Henderson, Marshall, Nichols, & Ghera, 2005). A recent
statistical review of studies demonstrated that behavioral inhibition was associated with more than a sevenfold
increase in the risk of development of social anxiety disorder, demonstrating that behavioral inhibition is a
major risk factor for the disorder (Clauss & Blackford, 2012).

Panic Disorder

Imagine that you are at the mall one day with your friends and--suddenly and inexplicably--you begin sweating
and trembling, your heart starts pounding, you have trouble breathing, and you start to feel dizzy and
nauseous. This episode lasts for 10 minutes and is terrifying because you start to think that you are going to
die. When you visit your doctor the following morning and describe what happened, she tells you that you have
experienced a panic attack (Figure 15.9). If you experience another one of these episodes two weeks later and
worry for a month or more that similar episodes will occur in the future, it is likely that you have developed
panic disorder.
552 15 · Psychological Disorders

       FIGURE 15.9 Some of the physical manifestations of a panic attack are shown. People may also experience
       sweating, trembling, feelings of faintness, or a fear of losing control, among other symptoms.
       People with panic disorder experience recurrent (more than one) and unexpected panic attacks, along with at
       least one month of persistent concern about additional panic attacks, worry over the consequences of the
       attacks, or self-defeating changes in behavior related to the attacks (e.g., avoidance of exercise or unfamiliar
       situations) (APA, 2013). As is the case with other anxiety disorders, the panic attacks cannot result from the
       physiological effects of drugs and other substances, a medical condition, or another mental disorder. A panic
       attack is defined as a period of extreme fear or discomfort that develops abruptly and reaches a peak within 10
       minutes. Its symptoms include accelerated heart rate, sweating, trembling, choking sensations, hot flashes or
       chills, dizziness or lightheadedness, fears of losing control or going crazy, and fears of dying (APA, 2013).
       Sometimes panic attacks are expected, occurring in response to specific environmental triggers (such as being
       in a tunnel); other times, these episodes are unexpected and emerge randomly (such as when relaxing).
       According to the DSM-5, the person must experience unexpected panic attacks to qualify for a diagnosis of
       panic disorder.
       Experiencing a panic attack is often terrifying. Rather than recognizing the symptoms of a panic attack merely
       as signs of intense anxiety, individuals with panic disorder often misinterpret them as a sign that something is
       intensely wrong internally (thinking, for example, that the pounding heart represents an impending heart
       attack). Panic attacks can occasionally precipitate trips to the emergency room because several symptoms of
       panic attacks are, in fact, similar to those associated with heart problems (e.g., palpitations, racing pulse, and a
       pounding sensation in the chest) (Root, 2000). Unsurprisingly, those with panic disorder fear future attacks
       and may become preoccupied with modifying their behavior in an effort to avoid future panic attacks. For this
       reason, panic disorder is often characterized as fear of fear (Goldstein & Chambless, 1978).
       Panic attacks themselves are not mental disorders. Indeed, around 23% of Americans experience isolated
       panic attacks in their lives without meeting the criteria for panic disorder (Kessler et al., 2006), indicating that
       panic attacks are fairly common. Panic disorder is, of course, much less common, afflicting 4.7% of Americans
       during their lifetime (Kessler et al., 2005). Many people with panic disorder develop agoraphobia, which is
       marked by fear and avoidance of situations in which escape might be difficult or help might not be available if
       one were to develop symptoms of a panic attack. People with panic disorder often experience a comorbid
       disorder, such as other anxiety disorders or major depressive disorder (APA, 2013).
       Researchers are not entirely sure what causes panic disorder. Children are at a higher risk of developing panic

disorder if their parents have the disorder (Biederman et al., 2001), and family and twins studies indicate that
the heritability of panic disorder is around 43% (Hettema, Neale, & Kendler, 2001). The exact genes and gene
functions involved in this disorder, however, are not well-understood (APA, 2013). Neurobiological theories of
panic disorder suggest that a region of the brain called the locus coeruleus may play a role in this disorder.
Located in the brainstem, the locus coeruleus is the brain's major source of norepinephrine, a
neurotransmitter that triggers the body's fight-or-flight response. Activation of the locus coeruleus is
associated with anxiety and fear, and research with nonhuman primates has shown that stimulating the locus
coeruleus either electrically or through drugs produces panic-like symptoms (Charney et al., 1990). Such
findings have led to the theory that panic disorder may be caused by abnormal norepinephrine activity in the
locus coeruleus (Bremner, Krystal, Southwick, & Charney, 1996).

Conditioning theories of panic disorder propose that panic attacks are classical conditioning responses to
subtle bodily sensations resembling those normally occurring when one is anxious or frightened (Bouton,
Mineka, & Barlow, 2001). For example, consider a child who has asthma. An acute asthma attack produces
sensations, such as shortness of breath, coughing, and chest tightness, that typically elicit fear and anxiety.
Later, when the child experiences subtle symptoms that resemble the frightening symptoms of earlier asthma
attacks (such as shortness of breath after climbing stairs), they may become anxious, fearful, and then
experience a panic attack. In this situation, the subtle symptoms would represent a conditioned stimulus, and
the panic attack would be a conditioned response. The finding that panic disorder is nearly three times as
frequent among people with asthma as it is among people without asthma (Weiser, 2007) supports the
possibility that panic disorder has the potential to develop through classical conditioning.

Cognitive factors may play an integral part in panic disorder. Generally, cognitive theories (Clark, 1996) argue
that those with panic disorder are prone to interpret ordinary bodily sensations catastrophically, and these
fearful interpretations set the stage for panic attacks. For example, a person might detect bodily changes that
are routinely triggered by innocuous events such as getting up from a seated position (dizziness), exercising
(increased heart rate, shortness of breath), or drinking a large cup of coffee (increased heart rate, trembling).
The individual interprets these subtle bodily changes catastrophically ("Maybe I'm having a heart attack!").
Such interpretations create fear and anxiety, which trigger additional physical symptoms; subsequently, the
person experiences a panic attack. Support of this contention rests with findings that people with more severe
catastrophic thoughts about sensations have more frequent and severe panic attacks, and among those with
panic disorder, reducing catastrophic cognitions about their sensations is as effective as medication in
reducing panic attacks (Good & Hinton, 2009).

Generalized Anxiety Disorder

Alex was always worried about many things. He worried that his children would drown when they played at the
beach. Each time he left the house, he worried that an electrical short circuit would start a fire in his home. He
worried that his husband would lose his job at the prestigious law firm. He worried that his daughter's minor
staph infection could turn into a massive life-threatening condition. These and other worries constantly
weighed heavily on Alex's mind, so much so that they made it difficult for him to make decisions and often left
him feeling tense, irritable, and worn out. One night, Alex's husband was to drive their son home from a soccer
game. However, his husband stayed after the game and talked with some of the other parents, resulting in him
arriving home 45 minutes late. Alex had tried to call his cell phone three or four times, but he could not get
through because the soccer field did not have a signal. Extremely worried, Alex eventually called the police,
convinced that his husband and son had not arrived home because they had been in a terrible car accident.

Alex suffers from generalized anxiety disorder: a relatively continuous state of excessive, uncontrollable, and
pointless worry and apprehension. People with generalized anxiety disorder often worry about routine,
everyday things, even though their concerns are unjustified (Figure 15.10). For example, an individual may
worry about her health and finances, the health of family members, the safety of her children, or minor
matters (e.g., being late for an appointment) without having any legitimate reason for doing so (APA, 2013). A
554 15 · Psychological Disorders

       diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder requires that the diffuse worrying and apprehension characteristic
       of this disorder--what Sigmund Freud referred to as free-floating anxiety--is not part of another disorder,
       occurs more days than not for at least six months, and is accompanied by any three of the following symptoms:
       restlessness, difficulty concentrating, being easily fatigued, muscle tension, irritability, and sleep difficulties.

                     FIGURE 15.10 Worry is a defining feature of generalized anxiety disorder. (credit: Freddie Peña)
       About 5.7% of the U.S. population will develop symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder during their lifetime
       (Kessler et al., 2005), and females are 2 times as likely as males to experience the disorder (APA, 2013).
       Generalized anxiety disorder is highly comorbid with mood disorders and other anxiety disorders (Noyes,
       2001), and it tends to be chronic. Also, generalized anxiety disorder appears to increase the risk for heart
       attacks and strokes, especially in people with preexisting heart conditions (Martens et al., 2010).
       Although there have been few investigations aimed at determining the heritability of generalized anxiety
       disorder, a summary of available family and twin studies suggests that genetic factors play a modest role in the
       disorder (Hettema et al., 2001). Cognitive theories of generalized anxiety disorder suggest that worry
       represents a mental strategy to avoid more powerful negative emotions (Aikins & Craske, 2001), perhaps
       stemming from earlier unpleasant or traumatic experiences. Indeed, one longitudinal study found that
       childhood maltreatment was strongly related to the development of this disorder during adulthood (Moffitt et
       al., 2007); worrying might distract people from remembering painful childhood experiences.

     15.5 Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe the main features and prevalence of obsessive-compulsive disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, and
             hoarding disorder

         · Understand some of the factors in the development of obsessive-compulsive disorder
       Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders are a group of overlapping disorders that generally involve
       intrusive, unpleasant thoughts and repetitive behaviors. Many of us experience unwanted thoughts from time
       to time (e.g., craving double cheeseburgers when dieting), and many of us engage in repetitive behaviors on
       occasion (e.g., pacing when nervous). However, obsessive-compulsive and related disorders elevate the
       unwanted thoughts and repetitive behaviors to a status so intense that these cognitions and activities disrupt
       daily life. Included in this category are obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), body dysmorphic disorder, and
       hoarding disorder.

      Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder

       People with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) experience thoughts and urges that are intrusive and
       unwanted (obsessions) and/or the need to engage in repetitive behaviors or mental acts (compulsions). A
       person with this disorder might, for example, spend hours each day washing his hands or constantly checking
       and rechecking to make sure that a stove, faucet, or light has been turned off.
       Obsessions are more than just unwanted thoughts that seem to randomly jump into our head from time to
       time, such as recalling an insensitive remark a coworker made recently, and they are more significant than

day-to-day worries we might have, such as justifiable concerns about being laid off from a job. Rather,
obsessions are characterized as persistent, unintentional, and unwanted thoughts and urges that are highly
intrusive, unpleasant, and distressing (APA, 2013). Common obsessions include concerns about germs and
contamination, doubts ("Did I turn the water off?"), order and symmetry ("I need all the spoons in the tray to be
arranged a certain way"), and urges that are aggressive or lustful. Usually, the person knows that such thoughts
and urges are irrational and thus tries to suppress or ignore them, but has an extremely difficult time doing so.
These obsessive symptoms sometimes overlap, such that someone might have both contamination and
aggressive obsessions (Abramowitz & Siqueland, 2013).
Compulsions are repetitive and ritualistic acts that are typically carried out primarily as a means to minimize
the distress that obsessions trigger or to reduce the likelihood of a feared event (APA, 2013). Compulsions
often include such behaviors as repeated and extensive hand washing, cleaning, checking (e.g., that a door is
locked), and ordering (e.g., lining up all the pencils in a particular way), and they also include such mental acts
as counting, praying, or reciting something to oneself (Figure 15.11). Compulsions characteristic of OCD are
not performed out of pleasure, nor are they connected in a realistic way to the source of the distress or feared
event. Approximately 2.3% of the U.S. population will experience OCD in their lifetime (Ruscio, Stein, Chiu, &
Kessler, 2010) and, if left untreated, OCD tends to be a chronic condition creating lifelong interpersonal and
psychological problems (Norberg, Calamari, Cohen, & Riemann, 2008).

FIGURE 15.11 (a) Repetitive hand washing and (b) checking (e.g., that a door is locked) are common compulsions
among those with obsessive-compulsive disorder. (credit a: modification of work by the USDA; credit b: modification
of work by Bradley Gordon)

Body Dysmorphic Disorder

An individual with body dysmorphic disorder is preoccupied with a perceived flaw in physical appearance
that is either nonexistent or barely noticeable to other people (APA, 2013). These perceived physical defects
cause people to think they are unattractive, ugly, hideous, or deformed. These preoccupations can focus on any
bodily area, but they typically involve the skin, face, or hair. The preoccupation with imagined physical flaws
drives the person to engage in repetitive and ritualistic behavioral and mental acts, such as constantly looking
in the mirror, trying to hide the offending body part, comparisons with others, and, in some extreme cases,
cosmetic surgery (Phillips, 2005). An estimated 2.4% of the adults in the United States meet the criteria for
body dysmorphic disorder, with slightly higher rates in women than in men (APA, 2013).

Hoarding Disorder

Although hoarding was traditionally considered to be a symptom of OCD, considerable evidence suggests that
hoarding represents an entirely different disorder (Mataix-Cols et al., 2010). People with hoarding disorder
cannot bear to part with personal possessions, regardless of how valueless or useless these possessions are. As
a result, these individuals accumulate excessive amounts of usually worthless items that clutter their living
areas (Figure 15.12). Often, the quantity of cluttered items is so excessive that the person is unable to use his
kitchen, or sleep in his bed. People who suffer from this disorder have great difficulty parting with items
because they believe the items might be of some later use, or because they form a sentimental attachment to
556 15 · Psychological Disorders

       the items (APA, 2013). Importantly, a diagnosis of hoarding disorder is made only if the hoarding is not caused
       by another medical condition and if the hoarding is not a symptom of another disorder (e.g., schizophrenia)
       (APA, 2013).

       FIGURE 15.12 Those who suffer from hoarding disorder have great difficulty in discarding possessions, usually
       resulting in an accumulation of items that clutter living or work areas. (credit: "puuikibeach"/Flickr)

      Causes of OCD

       The results of family and twin studies suggest that OCD has a moderate genetic component. The disorder is
       five times more frequent in the first-degree relatives of people with OCD than in people without the disorder
       (Nestadt et al., 2000). Additionally, the concordance rate of OCD among identical twins is around 57%;
       however, the concordance rate for fraternal twins is 22% (Bolton, Rijsdijk, O'Connor, Perrin, & Eley, 2007).
       Studies have implicated about two dozen potential genes that may be involved in OCD; these genes regulate the
       function of three neurotransmitters: serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate (Pauls, 2010). Many of these studies
       included small sample sizes and have yet to be replicated. Thus, additional research needs to be done in this
       area.
       A brain region that is believed to play a critical role in OCD is the orbitofrontal cortex (Kopell & Greenberg,
       2008), an area of the frontal lobe involved in learning and decision-making (Rushworth, Noonan, Boorman,
       Walton, & Behrens, 2011) (Figure 15.13). In people with OCD, the orbitofrontal cortex becomes especially
       hyperactive when they are provoked with tasks in which, for example, they are asked to look at a photo of a
       toilet or of pictures hanging crookedly on a wall (Simon, Kaufmann, Müsch, Kischkel, & Kathmann, 2010). The
       orbitofrontal cortex is part of a series of brain regions that, collectively, is called the OCD circuit; this circuit
       consists of several interconnected regions that influence the perceived emotional value of stimuli and the
       selection of both behavioral and cognitive responses (Graybiel & Rauch, 2000). As with the orbitofrontal cortex,
       other regions of the OCD circuit show heightened activity during symptom provocation (Rotge et al., 2008),
       which suggests that abnormalities in these regions may produce the symptoms of OCD (Saxena, Bota, & Brody,
       2001). Consistent with this explanation, people with OCD show a substantially higher degree of connectivity of

The findings discussed above were based on imaging studies, and they highlight the potential importance of
brain dysfunction in OCD. However, one important limitation of these findings is the inability to explain
differences in obsessions and compulsions. Another limitation is that the correlational relationship between
neurological abnormalities and OCD symptoms cannot imply causation (Abramowitz & Siqueland, 2013).

         CONNECT THE CONCEPTS
Conditioning and OCD

The symptoms of OCD have been theorized to be learned responses, acquired and sustained as the result of a
combination of two forms of learning: classical conditioning and operant conditioning (Mowrer, 1960; Steinmetz,
Tracy, & Green, 2001). Specifically, the acquisition of OCD may occur first as the result of classical conditioning,
whereby a neutral stimulus becomes associated with an unconditioned stimulus that provokes anxiety or distress.
When an individual has acquired this association, subsequent encounters with the neutral stimulus trigger anxiety,
including obsessive thoughts; the anxiety and obsessive thoughts (which are now a conditioned response) may
persist until they identify some strategy to relieve it. Relief may take the form of a ritualistic behavior or mental
activity that, when enacted repeatedly, reduces the anxiety. Such efforts to relieve anxiety constitute an example of
negative reinforcement (a form of operant conditioning). Recall from the chapter on learning that negative
reinforcement involves the strengthening of behavior through its ability to remove something unpleasant or aversive.
Hence, compulsive acts observed in OCD may be sustained because they are negatively reinforcing, in the sense
that they reduce anxiety triggered by a conditioned stimulus.
Suppose an individual with OCD experiences obsessive thoughts about germs, contamination, and disease
whenever they encounter a doorknob. What might have constituted a viable unconditioned stimulus? Also, what
would constitute the conditioned stimulus, unconditioned response, and conditioned response? What kinds of
compulsive behaviors might we expect, and how do they reinforce themselves? What is decreased? Additionally,
and from the standpoint of learning theory, how might the symptoms of OCD be treated successfully?

     15.6 Posttraumatic Stress Disorder

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe the nature and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder
         · Identify the risk factors associated with this disorder
         · Understand the role of learning and cognitive factors in its development

       Extremely stressful or traumatic events, such as combat, natural disasters, and crimes, place the people who
       experience them at an increased risk for developing psychological disorders such as posttraumatic stress
       disorder (PTSD). Throughout much of the 20th century, this disorder was called shell shock and combat
       neurosis because its symptoms were observed in soldiers who had engaged in wartime combat. By the late
       1970s it had become clear that women who had experienced sexual traumas (e.g., rape, domestic battery, and
       incest) often experienced the same set of symptoms as did soldiers (Herman, 1997). The term posttraumatic
       stress disorder was developed given that these symptoms could happen to anyone who experienced
       psychological trauma.

      A Broader Definition of PTSD

       PTSD was listed among the anxiety disorders in previous DSM editions. In DSM-5, it is now listed among a
       group called Trauma-and-Stressor-Related Disorders. For a person to be diagnosed with PTSD, they must be
       exposed to, witness, or experience the details of a traumatic experience (e.g., a first responder), one that
       involves "actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence" (APA, 2013, p. 271). These experiences
       can include such events as combat, threatened or actual physical attack, sexual assault, natural disasters,
       terrorist attacks, and automobile accidents. This criterion makes PTSD the only disorder listed in the DSM in
       which a cause (extreme trauma) is explicitly specified.

       Symptoms of PTSD include intrusive and distressing memories of the event, flashbacks (states that can last
       from a few seconds to several days, during which the individual relives the event and behaves as if the event
       were occurring at that moment [APA, 2013]), avoidance of stimuli connected to the event, persistently negative
       emotional states (e.g., fear, anger, guilt, and shame), feelings of detachment from others, irritability, proneness
       toward outbursts, and an exaggerated startle response (jumpiness). For PTSD to be diagnosed, these
       symptoms must occur for at least one month.

       Roughly 7% of adults in the United States, including 9.7% of women and 3.6% of men, experience PTSD in
       their lifetime (National Comorbidity Survey, 2007), with higher rates among people exposed to mass trauma
       and people whose jobs involve duty-related trauma exposure (e.g., police officers, firefighters, and emergency
       medical personnel) (APA, 2013). Nearly 21% of residents of areas affected by Hurricane Katrina suffered from
       PTSD one year following the hurricane (Kessler et al., 2008), and 12.6% of Manhattan residents were observed
       as having PTSD 2-3 years after the 9/11 terrorist attacks (DiGrande et al., 2008).

      Risk Factors For PTSD

       Of course, not everyone who experiences a traumatic event will go on to develop PTSD; several factors strongly
       predict the development of PTSD: trauma experience, greater trauma severity, lack of immediate social
       support, and more subsequent life stress (Brewin, Andrews, & Valentine, 2000). Traumatic events that involve
       harm by others (e.g., combat, rape, and sexual molestation) carry greater risk than do other traumas (e.g.,
       natural disasters) (Kessler, Sonnega, Bromet, Hughes, & Nelson, 1995). Women are more likely to have been
       traumatized because of sexual trauma, childhood neglect, and childhood physical abuse. Men are more likely
       to have been traumatized by natural disaster, life-threatening accident, and physical violence, either witnessed
       or directed at them. Adolescent boys are more likely to experience accident, physical assault, and witness
       death/injury; adolescent girls are more likely to experience rape/sexual assault, intimate partner violence, or
       unexpected death or injury of a loved one. Assaultive violence and witnessing trauma to others is more
       prevalent among non-White people when compared to White people. African American males are more likely

to be exposed to and victims of violence than males of other races (Kilpatrick, Badour, & Resnick, 2017). A
2012 study found that 27% of corrections officers reported experiencing symptoms of PTSD in the past 30
days. Rates were higher for males (31%) than females (22%) (Spinaris, Denhof, & Kellaway, 2012). A study
conducted by Jaegers et al (2019) found that 53.4% of jail correctional officers screened positively for PTSD.
PTSD is more prevalent in prison populations than in the general public, with prevalence estimates of 6% in
male prisoners and 21% in female prisoners (Facer-Irwin et al, 2019). Factors that increase the risk of PTSD
include female gender, low socioeconomic status, low intelligence, personal history of mental disorders,
history of childhood adversity (abuse or other trauma during childhood), and family history of mental
disorders (Brewin et al., 2000). Personality characteristics such as neuroticism and somatization (the tendency
to experience physical symptoms when one encounters stress) have been shown to elevate the risk of PTSD
(Bramsen, Dirkzwager, & van der Ploeg, 2000). People who experience childhood adversity and/or traumatic
experiences during adulthood are at significantly higher risk of developing PTSD if they possess one or two
short versions of a gene that regulates the neurotransmitter serotonin (Xie et al., 2009). This suggests a
possible diathesis-stress interpretation of PTSD: its development is influenced by the interaction of
psychosocial and biological factors.

Support For Sufferers of PTSD

Research has shown that social support following a traumatic event can reduce the likelihood of PTSD (Ozer,
Best, Lipsey, & Weiss, 2003). Social support is often defined as the comfort, advice, and assistance received
from relatives, friends, and neighbors. Social support can help individuals cope during difficult times by
allowing them to discuss feelings and experiences and providing a sense of being loved and appreciated. A
14-year study of 1,377 people who had served in the Vietnam War found that those who perceived less social
support when they came home were more likely to develop PTSD than were those who perceived greater
support (Figure 15.14). In addition, those who became involved in the community were less likely to develop
PTSD, and they were more likely to experience a remission of PTSD than were those who were less involved
(Koenen, Stellman, Stellman, & Sommer, 2003).

FIGURE 15.14 PTSD was first recognized in soldiers who had engaged in combat. Research has shown that strong
560 15 · Psychological Disorders

       Stanchfield)

      Learning and the Development of PTSD

       PTSD learning models suggest that some symptoms are developed and maintained through classical
       conditioning. The traumatic event may act as an unconditioned stimulus that elicits an unconditioned
       response characterized by extreme fear and anxiety. Cognitive, emotional, physiological, and environmental
       cues accompanying or related to the event are conditioned stimuli. These traumatic reminders evoke
       conditioned responses (extreme fear and anxiety) similar to those caused by the event itself (Nader, 2001). A
       person who witnessed or experienced a plane crash and who developed PTSD may display excessive
       hypervigilance and distress when planes fly overhead; this behavior constitutes a conditioned response to the
       traumatic reminder (conditioned stimulus of the sight and sound of an airplane). Differences in how
       conditionable individuals are help to explain differences in the development and maintenance of PTSD
       symptoms (Pittman, 1988). Conditioning studies demonstrate facilitated acquisition of conditioned responses
       and delayed extinction of conditioned responses in people with PTSD (Orr et al., 2000).

       Cognitive factors are important in the development and maintenance of PTSD. One model suggests that two
       key processes are crucial: disturbances in memory for the event, and negative appraisals of the trauma and its
       aftermath (Ehlers & Clark, 2000). According to this theory, some people who experience traumas do not form
       coherent memories of the trauma; memories of the traumatic event are poorly encoded and, thus, are
       fragmented, disorganized, and lacking in detail. Therefore, these individuals are unable remember the event
       in a way that gives it meaning and context. A rape victim who cannot coherently remember the event may
       remember only bits and pieces (e.g., the attacker repeating a word or insult); because the victim was unable to
       develop a fully integrated memory, the fragmentary memory tends to stand out. Although unable to retrieve a
       complete memory of the event, the victim may be haunted by intrusive fragments involuntarily triggered by
       stimuli associated with the event (e.g., memories of the attacker's comments when encountering a person who
       resembles the attacker). This interpretation fits previously discussed material concerning PTSD and
       conditioning. The model also proposes that negative appraisals of the event ("I deserved to be raped because
       I'm stupid") may lead to dysfunctional behavioral strategies (e.g., avoiding social activities where men are
       likely to be present) that maintain PTSD symptoms by preventing both a change in the nature of the memory
       and a change in the problematic appraisals.

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Distinguish normal states of sadness and euphoria from states of depression and mania

         · Understand the differences between major depressive disorder and persistent depressive disorder, and identify

             two subtypes of depression

             suicide

       Blake cries all day and feeling that he is worthless and his life is hopeless, he cannot get out of bed. Crystal
       stays up all night, talks very rapidly, and went on a shopping spree in which she spent $3,000 on furniture,
       although she cannot afford it. Maria recently had a baby, and she feels overwhelmed, teary, anxious, and
       panicked, and believes she is a terrible mother--practically every day since the baby was born. All these
       individuals demonstrate symptoms of a potential mood disorder.

       Mood disorders (Figure 15.15) are characterized by severe disturbances in mood and emotions--most often

depression, but also mania and elation (Rothschild, 1999). All of us experience fluctuations in our moods and
emotional states, and often these fluctuations are caused by events in our lives. We become elated if our
favorite team wins the World Series and dejected if a romantic relationship ends or if we lose our job. At times,
we feel fantastic or miserable for no clear reason. People with mood disorders also experience mood
fluctuations, but their fluctuations are extreme, distort their outlook on life, and impair their ability to
function.

FIGURE 15.15 Mood disorders are characterized by massive disruptions in mood. Symptoms can range from the
extreme sadness and hopelessness of depression to the extreme elation and irritability of mania. (credit: Kiran
Foster)
The DSM-5 lists two general categories of mood disorders. Depressive disorders are a group of disorders in
which depression is the main feature. Depression is a vague term that, in everyday language, refers to an
intense and persistent sadness. Depression is a heterogeneous mood state--it consists of a broad spectrum of
symptoms that range in severity. Depressed people feel sad, discouraged, and hopeless. These individuals lose
interest in activities once enjoyed, often experience a decrease in drives such as hunger and sex, and
frequently doubt personal worth. Depressive disorders vary by degree, but this chapter highlights the most
well-known: major depressive disorder (sometimes called unipolar depression).
Bipolar and related disorders are a group of disorders in which mania is the defining feature. Mania is a state
of extreme elation and agitation. When people experience mania, they may become extremely talkative,
behave recklessly, or attempt to take on many tasks simultaneously. The most recognized of these disorders is
bipolar disorder.

Major Depressive Disorder

According to the DSM-5, the defining symptoms of major depressive disorder include "depressed mood most
of the day, nearly every day" (feeling sad, empty, hopeless, or appearing tearful to others), and loss of interest
and pleasure in usual activities (APA, 2013). In addition to feeling overwhelmingly sad most of each day,
people with depression will no longer show interest or enjoyment in activities that previously were gratifying,
such as hobbies, sports, sex, social events, time spent with family, and so on. Friends and family members may
notice that the person has completely abandoned previously enjoyed hobbies; for example, an avid tennis
player who develops major depressive disorder no longer plays tennis (Rothschild, 1999).
To receive a diagnosis of major depressive disorder, one must experience a total of five symptoms for at least a
two-week period; these symptoms must cause significant distress or impair normal functioning, and they
must not be caused by substances or a medical condition. At least one of the two symptoms mentioned above
562 15 · Psychological Disorders

       must be present, plus any combination of the following symptoms (APA, 2013):

         · significant weight loss (when not dieting) or weight gain and/or significant decrease or increase in
             appetite;

         · difficulty falling asleep or sleeping too much;
         · psychomotor agitation (the person is noticeably fidgety and jittery, demonstrated by behaviors like the

             inability to sit, pacing, hand-wringing, pulling or rubbing of the skin, clothing, or other objects) or
             psychomotor retardation (the person talks and moves slowly, for example, talking softly, very little, or in a
             monotone);
         · fatigue or loss of energy;
         · feelings of worthlessness or guilt;
         · difficulty concentrating and indecisiveness; and
         · suicidal ideation: thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), thinking about or planning suicide, or making
             an actual suicide attempt.

       Major depressive disorder is considered episodic: its symptoms are typically present at their full magnitude
       for a certain period of time and then gradually abate. Approximately 50%-60% of people who experience an
       episode of major depressive disorder will have a second episode at some point in the future; those who have
       had two episodes have a 70% chance of having a third episode, and those who have had three episodes have a
       90% chance of having a fourth episode (Rothschild, 1999). Although the episodes can last for months, a
       majority of people diagnosed with this condition (around 70%) recover within a year. However, a substantial
       number do not recover; around 12% show serious signs of impairment associated with major depressive
       disorder after 5 years (Boland & Keller, 2009). In the long-term, many who do recover will still show minor
       symptoms that fluctuate in their severity (Judd, 2012).

       Results of Major Depressive Disorder

       Major depressive disorder is a serious and incapacitating condition that can have a devastating effect on the
       quality of one's life. The person suffering from this disorder lives a profoundly miserable existence that often
       results in unavailability for work or education, abandonment of promising careers, and lost wages;
       occasionally, the condition requires hospitalization. The majority of those with major depressive disorder
       report having faced some kind of discrimination, and many report that having received such treatment has
       stopped them from initiating close relationships, applying for jobs for which they are qualified, and applying
       for education or training (Lasalvia et al., 2013). Major depressive disorder also takes a toll on health.
       Depression is a risk factor for the development of heart disease in healthy patients, as well as adverse
       cardiovascular outcomes in patients with preexisting heart disease (Whooley, 2006).

       Risk Factors for Major Depressive Disorder

       Major depressive disorder is often referred to as the common cold of psychiatric disorders. Around 6.6% of the
       U.S. population experiences major depressive disorder each year; 16.9% will experience the disorder during
       their lifetime (Kessler & Wang, 2009). It is more common among women than among men, affecting
       approximately 20% of women and 13% of men at some point in their life (National Comorbidity Survey, 2007).
       The greater risk among women is not accounted for by a tendency to report symptoms or to seek help more
       readily, suggesting that gender differences in the rates of major depressive disorder may reflect biological and
       gender-related environmental experiences (Kessler, 2003).

       Lifetime rates of major depressive disorder tend to be highest in North and South America, Europe, and
       Australia; they are considerably lower in Asian countries (Hasin, Fenton, & Weissman, 2011). The rates of
       major depressive disorder are higher among younger age cohorts than among older cohorts, perhaps because
       people in younger age cohorts are more willing to admit depression (Kessler & Wang, 2009).

       A number of risk factors are associated with major depressive disorder: unemployment (including
       homemakers); earning less than $20,000 per year; living in urban areas; or being separated, divorced, or

widowed (Hasin et al., 2011). Comorbid disorders include anxiety disorders and substance abuse disorders
(Kessler & Wang, 2009).

Subtypes of Depression

The DSM-5 lists several different subtypes of depression. These subtypes--what the DSM-5 refer to as
specifiers--are not specific disorders; rather, they are labels used to indicate specific patterns of symptoms or
to specify certain periods of time in which the symptoms may be present. One subtype, seasonal pattern,
applies to situations in which a person experiences the symptoms of major depressive disorder only during a
particular time of year (e.g., fall or winter). In everyday language, people often refer to this subtype as the
winter blues.

Another subtype, peripartum onset (commonly referred to as postpartum depression), applies to women who
experience major depression during pregnancy or in the four weeks following the birth of their child (APA,
2013). These women often feel very anxious and may even have panic attacks. They may feel guilty, agitated,
and be weepy. They may not want to hold or care for their newborn, even in cases in which the pregnancy was
desired and intended. In extreme cases, the mother may have feelings of wanting to harm her child or herself.
In a horrific illustration, a woman named Andrea Yates, who suffered from extreme peripartum-onset
depression (as well as other mental illnesses), drowned her five children in a bathtub (Roche, 2002). Most
women with peripartum-onset depression do not physically harm their children, but most do have difficulty
being adequate caregivers (Fields, 2010). A surprisingly high number of women experience symptoms of
peripartum-onset depression. A study of 10,000 women who had recently given birth found that 14% screened
positive for peripartum-onset depression, and that nearly 20% reported having thoughts of wanting to harm
themselves (Wisner et al., 2013).

People with persistent depressive disorder (previously known as dysthymia) experience depressed moods
most of the day nearly every day for at least two years, as well as at least two of the other symptoms of major
depressive disorder. People with persistent depressive disorder are chronically sad and melancholy, but do not
meet all the criteria for major depression. However, episodes of full-blown major depressive disorder can
occur during persistent depressive disorder (APA, 2013).

Bipolar Disorder

A person with bipolar disorder (commonly known as manic depression) often experiences mood states that
vacillate between depression and mania; that is, the person's mood is said to alternate from one emotional
extreme to the other (in contrast to unipolar, which indicates a persistently sad mood).

To be diagnosed with bipolar disorder, a person must have experienced a manic episode at least once in their
life; although major depressive episodes are common in bipolar disorder, they are not required for a diagnosis
(APA, 2013). According to the DSM-5, a manic episode is characterized as a "distinct period of abnormally and
persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or
energy lasting at least one week," that lasts most of the time each day (APA, 2013, p. 124). During a manic
episode, some experience a mood that is almost euphoric and become excessively talkative, sometimes
spontaneously starting conversations with strangers; others become excessively irritable and complain or
make hostile comments. The person may talk loudly and rapidly, exhibiting flight of ideas, abruptly switching
from one topic to another. These individuals are easily distracted, which can make a conversation very
difficult. They may exhibit grandiosity, in which they experience inflated but unjustified self-esteem and self-
confidence. For example, they might quit a job in order to "strike it rich" in the stock market, despite lacking
the knowledge, experience, and capital for such an endeavor. They may take on several tasks at the same time
(e.g., several time-consuming projects at work) and yet show little, if any, need for sleep; some may go for days
without sleep. Patients may also recklessly engage in pleasurable activities that could have harmful
consequences, including spending sprees, reckless driving, making foolish investments, excessive gambling,
or engaging in sexual encounters with strangers (APA, 2013).
564 15 · Psychological Disorders

       During a manic episode, individuals usually feel as though they are not ill and do not need treatment. However,
       the reckless behaviors that often accompany these episodes--which can be antisocial, illegal, or physically
       threatening to others--may require involuntary hospitalization (APA, 2013). Some patients with bipolar
       disorder will experience a rapid-cycling subtype, which is characterized by at least four manic episodes (or
       some combination of at least four manic and major depressive episodes) within one year.

       In the 1997 independent film Sweetheart, actress Janeane Garofalo plays the part of Jasmine, a young woman
       with bipolar disorder. Watch this firsthand account from a person living with bipolar disorder
       (http://openstax.org/l/sweetheart) to learn more.

       Risk Factors for Bipolar Disorder
       Bipolar disorder is considerably less frequent than major depressive disorder. In the United States, 1 out of
       every 167 people meets the criteria for bipolar disorder each year, and 1 out of 100 meet the criteria within
       their lifetime (Merikangas et al., 2011). The rates are higher in men than in women, and about half of those
       with this disorder report onset before the age of 25 (Merikangas et al., 2011). Around 90% of those with bipolar
       disorder have a comorbid disorder, most often an anxiety disorder or a substance abuse problem.
       Unfortunately, close to half of the people suffering from bipolar disorder do not receive treatment (Merikangas
       & Tohen, 2011). Suicide rates are extremely high among those with bipolar disorder: around 36% of
       individuals with this disorder attempt suicide at least once in their lifetime (Novick, Swartz, & Frank, 2010),
       and between 15%-19% die by suicide (Newman, 2004).

      The Biological Basis of Mood and Bipolar Disorders

       Mood disorders have been shown to have a strong genetic and biological basis. Relatives of those with major
       depressive disorder have double the risk of developing major depressive disorder, whereas relatives of patients
       with bipolar disorder have over nine times the risk (Merikangas et al., 2011). The rate of concordance for major
       depressive disorder is higher among identical twins than fraternal twins (50% vs. 38%, respectively), as is that
       of bipolar disorder (67% vs. 16%, respectively), suggesting that genetic factors play a stronger role in bipolar
       disorder than in major depressive disorder (Merikangas et al. 2011).
       People with mood disorders often have imbalances in certain neurotransmitters, particularly norepinephrine
       and serotonin (Thase, 2009). These neurotransmitters are important regulators of the bodily functions that are
       disrupted in mood disorders, including appetite, sex drive, sleep, arousal, and mood. Medications that are
       used to treat major depressive disorder typically boost serotonin and norepinephrine activity, whereas
       lithium--used in the treatment of bipolar disorder--blocks norepinephrine activity at the synapses (Figure

Depression is linked to abnormal activity in several regions of the brain (Fitzgerald, Laird, Maller, & Daskalakis,
2008) including those important in assessing the emotional significance of stimuli and experiencing emotions
(amygdala), and in regulating and controlling emotions (like the prefrontal cortex, or PFC) (LeMoult,
Castonguay, Joormann, & McAleavey, 2013). People with depression show elevated amygdala activity (Drevets,
Bogers, & Raichle, 2002), especially when presented with negative emotional stimuli, such as photos of sad
faces (Figure 15.17) (Surguladze et al., 2005). Interestingly, heightened amygdala activation to negative
emotional stimuli among depressed persons occurs even when stimuli are presented outside of conscious
awareness (Victor, Furey, Fromm, Öhman, & Drevets, 2010), and it persists even after the negative emotional
stimuli are no longer present (Siegle, Thompson, Carter, Steinhauer, & Thase, 2007). Additionally, depressed
individuals exhibit less activation in the prefrontal, particularly on the left side (Davidson, Pizzagalli, &
Nitschke, 2009). Because the PFC can dampen amygdala activation, thereby enabling one to suppress negative
emotions (Phan et al., 2005), decreased activation in certain regions of the PFC may inhibit its ability to
override negative emotions that might then lead to more negative mood states (Davidson et al., 2009). These
findings suggest that people with depression are more prone to react to emotionally negative stimuli, yet have
greater difficulty controlling these reactions.

       FIGURE 15.17 People with depression react to negative emotional stimuli, such as sad faces, with greater
       amygdala activation than do non-depressed individuals. (credit: Ian Munroe)
       Since the 1950s, researchers have noted that depressed individuals have abnormal levels of cortisol, a stress
       hormone released into the blood by the neuroendocrine system during times of stress (Mackin & Young, 2004).
       When cortisol is released, the body initiates a fight-or-flight response in reaction to a threat or danger. Many
       people with depression show elevated cortisol levels (Holsboer & Ising, 2010), especially those reporting a
       history of early life trauma such as the loss of a parent or abuse during childhood (Baes, Tofoli, Martins, &
       Juruena, 2012). Such findings raise the question of whether high cortisol levels are a cause or a consequence of
       depression. High levels of cortisol are a risk factor for future depression (Halligan, Herbert, Goodyer, & Murray,
       2007), and cortisol activates activity in the amygdala while deactivating activity in the PFC (McEwen,
       2005)--both brain disturbances are connected to depression. Thus, high cortisol levels may have a causal
       effect on depression, as well as on its brain function abnormalities (van Praag, 2005). Also, because stress
       results in increased cortisol release (Michaud, Matheson, Kelly, Anisman, 2008), it is equally reasonable to
       assume that stress may precipitate depression.
       A Diathesis-Stress Model and Major Depressive Disorders
       Indeed, it has long been believed that stressful life events can trigger depression, and research has
       consistently supported this conclusion (Mazure, 1998). Stressful life events include significant losses, such as
       death of a loved one, divorce or separation, and serious health and money problems; life events such as these
       often precede the onset of depressive episodes (Brown & Harris, 1989). In particular, exit events--instances in
       which an important person departs (e.g., a death, divorce or separation, or a family member leaving
       home)--often occur prior to an episode (Paykel, 2003). Exit events are especially likely to trigger depression if
       these happenings occur in a way that humiliates or devalues the individual. For example, people who
       experience the breakup of a relationship initiated by the other person develop major depressive disorder at a
       rate more than 2 times that of people who experience the death of a loved one (Kendler, Hettema, Butera,
       Gardner, & Prescott, 2003).
       Likewise, individuals who are exposed to traumatic stress during childhood--such as separation from a parent,
       family turmoil, and maltreatment (physical or sexual abuse)--are at a heightened risk of developing depression
       at any point in their lives (Kessler, 1997). A recent review of 16 studies involving over 23,000 subjects
       concluded that those who experience childhood maltreatment are more than 2 times as likely to develop
       recurring and persistent depression (Nanni, Uher, & Danese, 2012).
       Of course, not everyone who experiences stressful life events or childhood adversities succumbs to
       depression--indeed, most do not. Clearly, a diathesis-stress interpretation of major depressive disorder, in
       which certain predispositions or vulnerability factors influence one's reaction to stress, would seem logical. If
       so, what might such predispositions be? A study by Caspi and others (2003) suggests that an alteration in a
       specific gene that regulates serotonin (the 5-HTTLPR gene) might be one culprit. These investigators found
       that people who experienced several stressful life events were significantly more likely to experience episodes
       of major depression if they carried one or two short versions of this gene than if they carried two long versions.
       Those who carried one or two short versions of the 5-HTTLPR gene were unlikely to experience an episode,
       however, if they had experienced few or no stressful life events. Numerous studies have replicated these

findings, including studies of people who experienced maltreatment during childhood (Goodman & Brand,
2009). In a recent investigation conducted in the United Kingdom (Brown & Harris, 2013), researchers found
that childhood maltreatment before age 9 elevated the risk of chronic adult depression (a depression episode
lasting for at least 12 months) among those individuals having one (LS) or two (SS) short versions of the
5-HTTLPR gene (Figure 15.18). Childhood maltreatment did not increase the risk for chronic depression for
those have two long (LL) versions of this gene. Thus, genetic vulnerability may be one mechanism through
which stress potentially leads to depression.

FIGURE 15.18 A study on gene-environment interaction in people experiencing chronic depression in adulthood
suggests a much higher incidence in individuals with a short version of the gene in combination with childhood
maltreatment (Brown & Harris, 2013).
Cognitive Theories of Depression

Cognitive theories of depression take the view that depression is triggered by negative thoughts,
interpretations, self-evaluations, and expectations (Joormann, 2009). These diathesis-stress models propose
that depression is triggered by a "cognitive vulnerability" (negative and maladaptive thinking) and by
precipitating stressful life events (Gotlib & Joormann, 2010). Perhaps the most well-known cognitive theory of
depression was developed in the 1960s by psychiatrist Aaron Beck, based on clinical observations and
supported by research (Beck, 2008). Beck theorized that depression-prone people possess depressive
schemas, or mental predispositions to think about most things in a negative way (Beck, 1976). Depressive
schemas contain themes of loss, failure, rejection, worthlessness, and inadequacy, and may develop early in
childhood in response to adverse experiences, then remain dormant until they are activated by stressful or
negative life events. Depressive schemas prompt dysfunctional and pessimistic thoughts about the self, the
world, and the future. Beck believed that this dysfunctional style of thinking is maintained by cognitive biases,
or errors in how we process information about ourselves, which lead us to focus on negative aspects of
experiences, interpret things negatively, and block positive memories (Beck, 2008). A person whose
depressive schema consists of a theme of rejection might be overly attentive to social cues of rejection (more
likely to notice another's frown), and they might interpret this cue as a sign of rejection and automatically
remember past incidents of rejection. Longitudinal studies have supported Beck's theory, in showing that a
preexisting tendency to engage in this negative, self-defeating style of thinking--when combined with life
stress--over time predicts the onset of depression (Dozois & Beck, 2008). Cognitive therapies for depression,
aimed at changing a depressed person's negative thinking, were developed as an expansion of this theory
(Beck, 1976).
Another cognitive theory of depression, hopelessness theory, postulates that a particular style of negative
thinking leads to a sense of hopelessness, which then leads to depression (Abramson, Metalsky, & Alloy, 1989).
According to this theory, hopelessness is an expectation that unpleasant outcomes will occur or that desired
outcomes will not occur, and there is nothing one can do to prevent such outcomes. A key assumption of this
theory is that hopelessness stems from a tendency to perceive negative life events as having stable ("It's never
going to change") and global ("It's going to affect my whole life") causes, in contrast to unstable ("It's fixable")
and specific ("It applies only to this particular situation") causes, especially if these negative life events occur
568 15 · Psychological Disorders

       in important life realms, such as relationships, academic achievement, and the like. Suppose a student who
       wishes to go to law school does poorly on an admissions test. If the student infers negative life events as having
       stable and global causes, they may believe that their poor performance has a stable and global cause ("I lack
       intelligence, and it's going to prevent me from ever finding a meaningful career"), as opposed to an unstable
       and specific cause ("I was sick the day of the exam, so my low score was a fluke"). Hopelessness theory predicts
       that people who exhibit this cognitive style in response to undesirable life events will view such events as
       having negative implications for their future and self-worth, thereby increasing the likelihood of
       hopelessness--the primary cause of depression (Abramson et al., 1989). One study testing hopelessness theory
       measured the tendency to make negative inferences for bad life effects in participants who were experiencing
       uncontrollable stressors. Over the ensuing six months, those with scores reflecting high cognitive vulnerability
       were 7 times more likely to develop depression compared to those with lower scores (Kleim, Gonzalo, & Ehlers,
       2011).

       A third cognitive theory of depression focuses on how people's thoughts about their distressed
       moods--depressed symptoms in particular--can increase the risk and duration of depression. This theory,
       which focuses on rumination in the development of depression, was first described in the late 1980s to explain
       the higher rates of depression in women than in men (Nolen-Hoeksema, 1987). Rumination is the repetitive
       and passive focus on the fact that one is depressed and dwelling on depressed symptoms, rather that
       distracting one's self from the symptoms or attempting to address them in an active, problem-solving manner
       (Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991). When people ruminate, they have thoughts such as "Why am I so unmotivated? I just
       can't get going. I'm never going to get my work done feeling this way" (Nolen-Hoeksema & Hilt, 2009, p. 393).
       Women are more likely than men to ruminate when they are sad or depressed (Butler & Nolen-Hoeksema,
       1994), and the tendency to ruminate is associated with increases in depression symptoms (Nolen-Hoeksema,
       Larson, & Grayson, 1999), heightened risk of major depressive episodes (Abela & Hankin, 2011), and
       chronicity of such episodes (Robinson & Alloy, 2003)

      Suicide

       For some people with mood disorders, the extreme emotional pain they experience becomes unendurable.
       Overwhelmed by hopelessness, devastated by incapacitating feelings of worthlessness, and burdened with the
       inability to adequately cope with such feelings, they may consider suicide to be a reasonable way out. Suicide,
       defined by the CDC as "death caused by self-directed injurious behavior with any intent to die as the result of
       the behavior" (CDC, 2013a), in a sense represents an outcome of several things going wrong all at the same
       time (Crosby, Ortega, & Melanson, 2011). Not only must the person be biologically or psychologically
       vulnerable, but they must also have the means to perform the suicidal act, and they must lack the necessary
       protective factors (e.g., social support from friends and family, religion, coping skills, and problem-solving
       skills) that provide comfort and enable one to cope during times of crisis or great psychological pain (Berman,
       2009).

       Suicide is not listed as a disorder in the DSM-5; however, people with a mental disorder--especially a mood
       disorder--have the greatest risk for suicide. Around 90% of those who die by suicide have a diagnosis of at least
       one mental disorder, with mood disorders being the most frequent (Fleischman, Bertolote, Belfer, & Beautrais,
       2005). In fact, the association between major depressive disorder and suicide is so strong that one of the
       criteria for the disorder is thoughts of suicide, as discussed above (APA, 2013).

       Suicide rates can be difficult to interpret because some deaths that appear to be accidental may in fact be acts
       of suicide (e.g., automobile crash). Nevertheless, investigations into U.S. suicide rates have uncovered these
       facts:

         · Suicide was the 10th leading cause of death for all ages in 2010 (Centers for Disease Control and
             Prevention [CDC], 2012).

         · There were 38,364 suicides in 2010 in the United States--an average of 105 each day (CDC, 2012).
         · Suicide among males is 4 times higher than among females and accounts for 79% of all suicides; firearms

                                                                                                                                           15.7 · Mood and Related Disorders 569

      are the most commonly used method of suicide for males, whereas poisoning is the most commonly used
      method for females (CDC, 2012).
  · From 1991 to 2003, suicide rates were consistently higher among those 65 years and older. Since 2001,
      however, suicide rates among those ages 25-64 have risen consistently, and, since 2006, suicide rates
      have been greater for those ages 65 and older (CDC, 2013b). This increase in suicide rates among middle-
      aged Americans has prompted concern in some quarters that baby boomers (individuals born between
      1946-1964) who face economic worry and easy access to prescription medication may be particularly
      vulnerable to suicide (Parker-Pope, 2013).
  · The highest rates of suicide within the United States are among American Indians/Alaskan natives and
      Non-Hispanic White people (CDC, 2013b).
  · Suicide rates vary across the United States, with the highest rates consistently found in the mountain
      states of the west (Alaska, Montana, Nevada, Wyoming, Colorado, and Idaho) (Berman, 2009).

Contrary to popular belief, suicide rates peak during the springtime (April and May), not during the holiday
season or winter. In fact, suicide rates are generally lowest during the winter months (Postolache et al., 2010).

Risk Factors For Suicide

Suicidal risk is especially high among people with substance use problems. Individuals with alcohol
dependence are at 10 times greater risk for suicide than the general population (Wilcox, Conner, & Caine,
2004). The risk of suicidal behavior is especially high among those who have made a prior suicide attempt.
Among those who attempt suicide, 16% make another attempt within a year and over 21% make another
attempt within four years (Owens, Horrocks, & House, 2002). Suicidal individuals may be at high risk for
terminating their life if they have a lethal means in which to act, such as a firearm in the home (Brent & Bridge,
2003). Withdrawal from social relationships, feeling as though one is a burden to others, and engaging in
reckless and risk-taking behaviors may be precursors to suicidal behavior (Berman, 2009). A sense of
entrapment or feeling unable to escape one's miserable feelings or external circumstances (e.g., an abusive
relationship with no perceived way out) predicts suicidal behavior (O'Connor, Smyth, Ferguson, Ryan, &
Williams, 2013). Tragically, reports of suicides among adolescents following instances of cyberbullying have
emerged in recent years. In one widely-publicized case a few years ago, Phoebe Prince, a 15-year-old
Massachusetts high school student, died by suicide following incessant harassment and taunting from her
classmates via texting and Facebook (McCabe, 2010).

Suicides can have a contagious effect on people. For example, another's suicide, especially that of a family
member, heightens one's risk of suicide (Agerbo, Nordentoft, & Mortensen, 2002). Additionally, widely-
publicized suicides tend to trigger additional suicides in some individuals. One study examining suicide
statistics in the United States from 1947-1967 found that the rates of suicide increased significantly for the
first month after a report about suicide was printed on the front page of the New York Times (Phillips, 1974).
Austrian researchers found a significant increase in the number of suicides by firearms in the three weeks
following extensive reports in Austria's largest newspaper of a celebrity suicide by gun (Etzersdorfer, Voracek,
& Sonneck, 2004). A review of 42 studies concluded that media coverage of celebrity suicides is more than 14
times more likely to trigger copycat suicides than is coverage of non-celebrity suicides (Stack, 2000). This
review also demonstrated that the medium of coverage is important: televised stories are considerably less
likely to prompt a surge in suicides than are newspaper stories. Research suggests that a trend appears to be
emerging whereby people use online social media to leave suicide notes, although it is not clear to what extent
suicide notes on such media might induce subsequent suicides (Ruder, Hatch, Ampanozi, Thali, & Fischer,
2011). Nevertheless, it is reasonable to conjecture that suicide notes left by individuals on social media may
influence the decisions of other vulnerable people who encounter them (Luxton, June, & Fairall, 2012).

One possible contributing factor in suicide is brain chemistry. Contemporary neurological research shows that
disturbances in the functioning of serotonin are linked to suicidal behavior (Pompili et al., 2010). Low levels of
serotonin predict future suicide attempts and death by suicide, and low levels have been observed post-
570 15 · Psychological Disorders

       mortem among suicide victims (Mann, 2003). Serotonin dysfunction, as noted earlier, is also known to play an
       important role in depression; low levels of serotonin have also been linked to aggression and impulsivity
       (Stanley et al., 2000). The combination of these three characteristics constitutes a potential formula for
       suicide--especially violent suicide. A classic study conducted during the 1970s found that patients with major
       depressive disorder who had very low levels of serotonin attempted suicide more frequently and more
       violently than did patients with higher levels (Asberg, Thorén, Träskman, Bertilsson, & Ringberger, 1976;
       Mann, 2003).

       Suicidal thoughts, plans, and even off-hand remarks ("I might kill myself this afternoon") should always be
       taken extremely seriously. People who contemplate terminating their life need immediate help. Below is a link

     15.8 Schizophrenia

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Recognize the essential nature of schizophrenia, avoiding the misconception that it involves a split personality
         · Categorize and describe the major symptoms of schizophrenia
         · Understand the interplay between genetic, biological, and environmental factors that are associated with the

             development of schizophrenia
         · Discuss the importance of research examining prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia

       Schizophrenia is a psychological disorder that is characterized by major disturbances in thought, perception,
       emotion, and behavior. About 1% of the population experiences schizophrenia in their lifetime, and usually the
       disorder is first diagnosed during early adulthood (early to mid-20s). Most people with schizophrenia
       experience significant difficulties in many day-to-day activities, such as holding a job, paying bills, caring for
       oneself (grooming and hygiene), and maintaining relationships with others. Frequent hospitalizations are
       more often the rule rather than the exception with schizophrenia. Even when they receive the best treatments
       available, many with schizophrenia will continue to experience serious social and occupational impairment
       throughout their lives.

       What is schizophrenia? First, schizophrenia is not a condition involving a split personality; that is,
       schizophrenia is not the same thing as dissociative identity disorder (better known as multiple personality
       disorder). These disorders are sometimes confused because the word schizophrenia first coined by the Swiss
       psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler in 1911, derives from Greek words that refer to a "splitting" (schizo) of psychic
       functions (phrene) (Green, 2001).

       Schizophrenia is considered a psychotic disorder, or one in which the person's thoughts, perceptions, and
       behaviors are impaired to the point where they are not able to function normally in life. In informal terms, one
       who suffers from a psychotic disorder (that is, has a psychosis) is disconnected from the world in which most
       of us live.

      Symptoms of Schizophrenia

       The main symptoms of schizophrenia include hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, disorganized
       or abnormal motor behavior, and negative symptoms (APA, 2013). A hallucination is a perceptual experience
       that occurs in the absence of external stimulation. Auditory hallucinations (hearing voices) occur in roughly
       two-thirds of patients with schizophrenia and are by far the most common form of hallucination (Andreasen,
       1987). The voices may be familiar or unfamiliar, they may have a conversation or argue, or the voices may
       provide a running commentary on the person's behavior (Tsuang, Farone, & Green, 1999).

Less common are visual hallucinations (seeing things that are not there) and olfactory hallucinations (smelling
odors that are not actually present).

Delusions are beliefs that are contrary to reality and are firmly held even in the face of contradictory evidence.
Many of us hold beliefs that some would consider odd, but a delusion is easily identified because it is clearly
absurd. A person with schizophrenia may believe that their mother is plotting with the FBI to poison their
coffee, or that their neighbor is an enemy spy who wants to kill them. These kinds of delusions are known as
paranoid delusions, which involve the (false) belief that other people or agencies are plotting to harm the
person. People with schizophrenia also may hold grandiose delusions, beliefs that one holds special power,
unique knowledge, or is extremely important. For example, the person who claims to be Jesus Christ, or who
claims to have knowledge going back 5,000 years, or who claims to be a great philosopher is experiencing
grandiose delusions. Other delusions include the belief that one's thoughts are being removed (thought
withdrawal) or thoughts have been placed inside one's head (thought insertion). Another type of delusion is
somatic delusion, which is the belief that something highly abnormal is happening to one's body (e.g., that
one's kidneys are being eaten by cockroaches).

Disorganized thinking refers to disjointed and incoherent thought processes--usually detected by what a
person says. The person might ramble, exhibit loose associations (jump from topic to topic), or talk in a way
that is so disorganized and incomprehensible that it seems as though the person is randomly combining
words. Disorganized thinking is also exhibited by blatantly illogical remarks (e.g., "Fenway Park is in Boston. I
live in Boston. Therefore, I live at Fenway Park.") and by tangentiality: responding to others' statements or
questions by remarks that are either barely related or unrelated to what was said or asked. For example, if a
person diagnosed with schizophrenia is asked if they are interested in receiving special job training, they
might state that they once rode on a train somewhere. To a person with schizophrenia, the tangential (slightly
related) connection between job training and riding a train are sufficient enough to cause such a response.

Disorganized or abnormal motor behavior refers to unusual behaviors and movements: becoming unusually
active, exhibiting silly child-like behaviors (giggling and self-absorbed smiling), engaging in repeated and
purposeless movements, or displaying odd facial expressions and gestures. In some cases, the person will
exhibit catatonic behaviors, which show decreased reactivity to the environment, such as posturing, in which
the person maintains a rigid and bizarre posture for long periods of time, or catatonic stupor, a complete lack
of movement and verbal behavior.

Negative symptoms are those that reflect noticeable decreases and absences in certain behaviors, emotions,
or drives (Green, 2001). A person who exhibits diminished emotional expression shows no emotion in their
facial expressions, speech, or movements, even when such expressions are normal or expected. Avolition is
characterized by a lack of motivation to engage in self-initiated and meaningful activity, including the most
basic of tasks, such as bathing and grooming. Alogia refers to reduced speech output; in simple terms, patients
do not say much. Another negative symptom is asociality, or social withdrawal and lack of interest in engaging
in social interactions with others. A final negative symptom, anhedonia, refers to an inability to experience
pleasure. One who exhibits anhedonia expresses little interest in what most people consider to be pleasurable
activities, such as hobbies, recreation, or sexual activity.

Causes of Schizophrenia

There is considerable evidence suggesting that schizophrenia has a genetic basis. The risk of developing
schizophrenia is nearly 6 times greater if one has a parent with schizophrenia than if one does not (Goldstein,
Buka, Seidman, & Tsuang, 2010). Additionally, one's risk of developing schizophrenia increases as genetic
572 15 · Psychological Disorders

       relatedness to family members diagnosed with schizophrenia increases (Gottesman, 2001).

       Genes

       When considering the role of genetics in schizophrenia, as in any disorder, conclusions based on family and
       twin studies are subject to criticism. This is because family members who are closely related (such as siblings)
       are more likely to share similar environments than are family members who are less closely related (such as
       cousins); further, identical twins may be more likely to be treated similarly by others than might fraternal
       twins. Thus, family and twin studies cannot completely rule out the possible effects of shared environments
       and experiences. Such problems can be corrected by using adoption studies, in which children are separated
       from their parents at an early age. One of the first adoption studies of schizophrenia conducted by Heston
       (1966) followed 97 adoptees, including 47 who were born to mothers with schizophrenia, over a 36-year
       period. Five of the 47 adoptees (11%) whose mothers had schizophrenia were later diagnosed with
       schizophrenia, compared to none of the 50 control adoptees. Other adoption studies have consistently
       reported that for adoptees who are later diagnosed with schizophrenia, their biological relatives have a higher
       risk of schizophrenia than do adoptive relatives (Shih, Belmonte, & Zandi, 2004).

       Although adoption studies have supported the hypothesis that genetic factors contribute to schizophrenia,
       they have also demonstrated that the disorder most likely arises from a combination of genetic and
       environmental factors, rather than just genes themselves. For example, investigators in one study examined
       the rates of schizophrenia among 303 adoptees (Tienari et al., 2004). A total of 145 of the adoptees had
       biological mothers with schizophrenia; these adoptees constituted the high genetic risk group. The other 158
       adoptees had mothers with no psychiatric history; these adoptees composed the low genetic risk group. The
       researchers managed to determine whether the adoptees' families were either healthy or disturbed. For
       example, the adoptees were considered to be raised in a disturbed family environment if the family exhibited a
       lot of criticism, conflict, and a lack of problem-solving skills. The findings revealed that adoptees whose
       biological mothers had schizophrenia (high genetic risk) and who had been raised in a disturbed family
       environment were much more likely to develop schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder (36.8%) than
       were adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia but who had been raised in a healthy environment
       (5.8%), or than adoptees with a low genetic risk who were raised in either a disturbed (5.3%) or healthy (4.8%)
       environment. Because the adoptees who were at high genetic risk were likely to develop schizophrenia only if
       they were raised in a disturbed home environment, this study supports a diathesis-stress interpretation of
       schizophrenia--both genetic vulnerability and environmental stress are necessary for schizophrenia to
       develop, genes alone do not show the complete picture.

       Neurotransmitters

       If we accept that schizophrenia is at least partly genetic in origin, as it seems to be, it makes sense that the next
       step should be to identify biological abnormalities commonly found in people with the disorder. Perhaps not
       surprisingly, a number of neurobiological factors have indeed been found to be related to schizophrenia. One
       such factor that has received considerable attention for many years is the neurotransmitter dopamine. Interest
       in the role of dopamine in schizophrenia was stimulated by two sets of findings: drugs that increase dopamine
       levels can produce schizophrenia-like symptoms, and medications that block dopamine activity reduce the
       symptoms (Howes & Kapur, 2009). The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia proposed that an
       overabundance of dopamine or too many dopamine receptors are responsible for the onset and maintenance
       of schizophrenia (Snyder, 1976). More recent work in this area suggests that abnormalities in dopamine vary
       by brain region and thus contribute to symptoms in unique ways. In general, this research has suggested that
       an overabundance of dopamine in the limbic system may be responsible for some symptoms, such as
       hallucinations and delusions, whereas low levels of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex might be responsible
       primarily for the negative symptoms (avolition, alogia, asociality, and anhedonia) (Davis, Kahn, Ko, & Davidson,
       1991). In recent years, serotonin has received attention, and newer antipsychotic medications used to treat the
       disorder work by blocking serotonin receptors (Baumeister & Hawkins, 2004).

Brain Anatomy

Brain imaging studies reveal that people with schizophrenia have enlarged ventricles, the cavities within the
brain that contain cerebral spinal fluid (Green, 2001). This finding is important because larger than normal
ventricles suggests that various brain regions are reduced in size, thus implying that schizophrenia is
associated with a loss of brain tissue. In addition, many people with schizophrenia display a reduction in gray
matter (cell bodies of neurons) in the frontal lobes (Lawrie & Abukmeil, 1998), and many show less frontal lobe
activity when performing cognitive tasks (Buchsbaum et al., 1990). The frontal lobes are important in a variety
of complex cognitive functions, such as planning and executing behavior, attention, speech, movement, and
problem solving. Hence, abnormalities in this region provide merit in explaining why people with
schizophrenia experience deficits in these of areas.

Events During Pregnancy

Why do people with schizophrenia have these brain abnormalities? A number of environmental factors that
could impact normal brain development might be at fault. High rates of obstetric complications in the births of
children who later developed schizophrenia have been reported (Cannon, Jones, & Murray, 2002). In addition,
people are at an increased risk for developing schizophrenia if their mother was exposed to influenza during
the first trimester of pregnancy (Brown et al., 2004). Research has also suggested that a person's emotional
stress during pregnancy may increase the risk of schizophrenia in offspring. One study reported that the risk
of schizophrenia is elevated substantially in offspring whose mothers experienced the death of a relative
during the first trimester of pregnancy (Khashan et al., 2008).

Marijuana

Another variable that is linked to schizophrenia is marijuana use. Although a number of reports have shown
that individuals with schizophrenia are more likely to use marijuana than are individuals without
schizophrenia (Thornicroft, 1990), such investigations cannot determine if marijuana use leads to
schizophrenia, or vice versa. However, a number of longitudinal studies have suggested that marijuana use is,
in fact, a risk factor for schizophrenia. A classic investigation of over 45,000 Swedish military personnel who
were followed up after 15 years found that those individuals who had reported using marijuana at least once by
the time they were conscripted (drafted) into the military were more than 2 times as likely to develop
schizophrenia during the ensuing 15 years than were those who reported never using marijuana; those who
had indicated using marijuana 50 or more times were 6 times as likely to develop schizophrenia (Andréasson,
Allbeck, Engström, & Rydberg, 1987). More recently, a review of 35 longitudinal studies found a substantially
increased risk of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders in people who had used marijuana, with the
greatest risk in the most frequent users (Moore et al., 2007). Other work has found that marijuana use is
associated with an onset of psychotic disorders at an earlier age (Large, Sharma, Compton, Slade, & Nielssen,
2011). Overall, the available evidence seems to indicate that marijuana use plays a causal role in the
development of schizophrenia, although it is important to point out that marijuana use is not an essential or
sufficient risk factor as not all people with schizophrenia have used marijuana and the majority of marijuana
users do not develop schizophrenia (Casadio, Fernandes, Murray, & Di Forti, 2011). One plausible
interpretation of the data is that early marijuana use may disrupt normal brain development during important
early maturation periods in adolescence (Trezza, Cuomo, & Vanderschuren, 2008). Thus, early marijuana use
may set the stage for the development of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, especially among
individuals with an established vulnerability (Casadio et al., 2011).

Schizophrenia: Early Warning Signs

Early detection and treatment of conditions such as heart disease and cancer have improved survival rates
and quality of life for people who suffer from these conditions. A new approach involves identifying people who
show minor symptoms of psychosis, such as unusual thought content, paranoia, odd communication,
delusions, problems at school or work, and a decline in social functioning--which are coined prodromal
574 15 · Psychological Disorders

       symptoms--and following these individuals over time to determine which of them develop a psychotic
       disorder and which factors best predict such a disorder. A number of factors have been identified that predict a
       greater likelihood that prodromal individuals will develop a psychotic disorder: genetic risk (a family history of
       psychosis), recent deterioration in functioning, high levels of unusual thought content, high levels of suspicion
       or paranoia, poor social functioning, and a history of substance abuse (Fusar-Poli et al., 2013). Further
       research will enable a more accurate prediction of those at greatest risk for developing schizophrenia, and
       thus to whom early intervention efforts should be directed.

        Forensic Psychology

         In August 2013, 17-year-old Cody Metzker-Madsen attacked 5-year-old Dominic Elkins on his foster parents'
         property. Believing that he was fighting goblins and that Dominic was the goblin commander, Metzker-Madsen
         beat Dominic with a brick and then held him face down in a creek. Dr. Alan Goldstein, a clinical and forensic
         psychologist, testified that Metzker-Madsen believed that the goblins he saw were real and was not aware that it
         was Dominic at the time. He was found not guilty by reason of insanity and was not held legally responsible for
         Dominic's death (Nelson, 2014). Cody was also found to be a danger to himself or others. He will be held in a
         psychiatric facility until he is judged to be no longer dangerous. This does not mean that he "got away with"
         anything. In fact, according to the American Psychiatric Association, individuals who are found not guilty by
         reason of insanity are often confined to psychiatric hospitals for as long or longer than they would have spent in
         prison for a conviction.

         Most people with mental illness are not violent. Only 3-5% of violent acts are committed by individuals
         diagnosed with severe mental illness, whereas individuals with severe mental illnesses are more than ten times
         as likely to be victims of crime (MentalHealth.gov, 2017). The psychologists who work with individuals such as
         Metzker-Madsen are part of the subdiscipline of forensic psychology. Forensic psychologists are involved in
         psychological assessment and treatment of individuals involved with the legal system. They use their knowledge
         of human behavior and mental illness to assist the judicial and legal system in making decisions in cases
         involving such issues as personal injury suits, workers' compensation, competency to stand trial, and pleas of not
         guilty by reason of insanity.

     15.9 Dissociative Disorders

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe the essential nature of dissociative disorders
         · Identify and differentiate the symptoms of dissociative amnesia, depersonalization/ derealization disorder, and

             dissociative identity disorder
         · Discuss the potential role of both social and psychological factors in dissociative identity disorder

       Dissociative disorders are characterized by an individual becoming split off, or dissociated, from their core
       sense of self. Memory and identity become disturbed; these disturbances have a psychological rather than
       physical cause. Dissociative disorders listed in the DSM-5 include dissociative amnesia, depersonalization/
       derealization disorder, and dissociative identity disorder.

      Dissociative Amnesia

       Amnesia refers to the partial or total forgetting of some experience or event. An individual with dissociative
       amnesia is unable to recall important personal information, usually following an extremely stressful or
       traumatic experience such as combat, natural disasters, or being the victim of violence. The memory
       impairments are not caused by ordinary forgetting. Some individuals with dissociative amnesia will also

experience dissociative fugue (from the word "to flee" in French), whereby they suddenly wander away from
their home, experience confusion about their identity, and sometimes even adopt a new identity (Cardeña &
Gleaves, 2006). Most fugue episodes last only a few hours or days, but some can last longer. One study of
residents in communities in upstate New York reported that about 1.8% experienced dissociative amnesia in
the previous year (Johnson, Cohen, Kasen, & Brook, 2006).

Some have questioned the validity of dissociative amnesia (Pope, Hudson, Bodkin, & Oliva, 1998); it has even
been characterized as a "piece of psychiatric folklore devoid of convincing empirical support" (McNally, 2003,
p. 275). Notably, scientific publications regarding dissociative amnesia rose during the 1980s and reached a
peak in the mid-1990s, followed by an equally sharp decline by 2003; in fact, only 13 cases of individuals with
dissociative amnesia worldwide could be found in the literature that same year (Pope, Barry, Bodkin, &
Hudson, 2006). Further, no description of individuals showing dissociative amnesia following a trauma exists
in any fictional or nonfictional work prior to 1800 (Pope, Poliakoff, Parker, Boynes, & Hudson, 2006). However,
a study of 82 individuals who enrolled for treatment at a psychiatric outpatient hospital found that nearly 10%
met the criteria for dissociative amnesia, perhaps suggesting that the condition is underdiagnosed, especially
in psychiatric populations (Foote, Smolin, Kaplan, Legatt, & Lipschitz, 2006).

Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder

Depersonalization/derealization disorder is characterized by recurring episodes of depersonalization,
derealization, or both. Depersonalization is defined as feelings of "unreality or detachment from, or
unfamiliarity with, one's whole self or from aspects of the self" (APA, 2013, p. 302). Individuals who experience
depersonalization might believe their thoughts and feelings are not their own; they may feel robotic as though
they lack control over their movements and speech; they may experience a distorted sense of time and, in
extreme cases, they may sense an "out-of-body" experience in which they see themselves from the vantage
point of another person. Derealization is conceptualized as a sense of "unreality or detachment from, or
unfamiliarity with, the world, be it individuals, inanimate objects, or all surroundings" (APA, 2013, p. 303). A
person who experiences derealization might feel as though they are in a fog or a dream, or that the
surrounding world is somehow artificial and unreal. Individuals with depersonalization/derealization disorder
often have difficulty describing their symptoms and may think they are going crazy (APA, 2013).

Dissociative Identity Disorder

By far, the most well-known dissociative disorder is dissociative identity disorder (formerly called multiple
personality disorder). People with dissociative identity disorder exhibit two or more separate personalities or
identities, each well-defined and distinct from one another. They also experience memory gaps for the time
during which another identity is in charge (e.g., one might find unfamiliar items in their shopping bags or
among their possessions), and in some cases may report hearing voices, such as a child's voice or the sound of
somebody crying (APA, 2013). The study of upstate New York residents mentioned above (Johnson et al., 2006)
reported that 1.5% of their sample experienced symptoms consistent with dissociative identity disorder in the
previous year.

Dissociative identity disorder (DID) is highly controversial. Some believe that people fake symptoms to avoid
the consequences of illegal actions (e.g., "I am not responsible for shoplifting because it was my other
personality"). In fact, it has been demonstrated that people are generally skilled at adopting the role of a
person with different personalities when they believe it might be advantageous to do so. As an example,
Kenneth Bianchi was an infamous serial killer who, along with his cousin, murdered over a dozen girls and
women around Los Angeles in the late 1970s. Eventually, he and his cousin were apprehended. At Bianchi's
trial, he pled not guilty by reason of insanity, presenting himself as though he had DID and claiming that a
different personality ("Steve Walker") committed the murders. When these claims were scrutinized, he
admitted faking the symptoms and was found guilty (Schwartz, 1981).

A second reason DID is controversial is because rates of the disorder suddenly skyrocketed in the 1980s. More
576 15 · Psychological Disorders

       cases of DID were identified during the five years prior to 1986 than in the preceding two centuries (Putnam,
       Guroff, Silberman, Barban, & Post, 1986). Although this increase may be due to the development of more
       sophisticated diagnostic techniques, it is also possible that the popularization of DID--helped in part by Sybil, a
       popular 1970s book (and later film) about a woman with 16 different personalities--may have prompted
       clinicians to overdiagnose the disorder (Piper & Merskey, 2004). Casting further scrutiny on the existence of
       multiple personalities or identities is the recent suggestion that the story of Sybil was largely fabricated, and
       the idea for the book might have been exaggerated (Nathan, 2011).

       Despite its controversial nature, DID is clearly a legitimate and serious disorder, and although some people
       may fake symptoms, others suffer their entire lives with it. People with this disorder tend to report a history of
       childhood trauma, some cases having been corroborated through medical or legal records (Cardeña & Gleaves,
       2006). Research by Ross et al. (1990) suggests that in one study about 95% of people with DID were physically
       and/or sexually abused as children. Of course, not all reports of childhood abuse can be expected to be valid or
       accurate. However, there is strong evidence that traumatic experiences can cause people to experience states
       of dissociation, suggesting that dissociative states--including the adoption of multiple personalities--may
       serve as a psychologically important coping mechanism for threat and danger (Dalenberg et al., 2012).

     15.10 Disorders in Childhood

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Describe the nature and symptoms of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder
         · Discuss the prevalence and factors that contribute to the development of these disorders

       Most of the disorders we have discussed so far are typically diagnosed in adulthood, although they can and
       sometimes do occur during childhood. However, there are a group of conditions that, when present, are
       diagnosed early in childhood, often before the time a child enters school. These conditions are listed in the
       DSM-5 as neurodevelopmental disorders, and they involve developmental problems in personal, social,
       academic, and intellectual functioning (APA, 2013). While they are often diagnosed in childhood, many people
       live with them throughout adulthood. In this section, we will discuss two such disorders: attention deficit/
       hyperactivity disorder and autism.

      Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder

       Diego is always active, from the time he wakes up in the morning until the time he goes to bed at night. His
       mother reports that he came out the womb kicking and screaming, and he has not stopped moving since. He
       has a sweet disposition, but always seems to be in trouble with his teachers, parents, and after-school program
       counselors. He seems to accidentally break things; he lost his jacket three times last winter, and he never
       seems to sit still. His teachers believe he is a smart child, but he never finishes anything he starts and is so
       impulsive that he does not seem to learn much in school.

       Diego likely has attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The symptoms of this disorder were first
       described by Hans Hoffman in the 1920s. While taking care of his son while his wife was in the hospital giving
       birth to a second child, Hoffman noticed that the boy had trouble concentrating on his homework, had a short
       attention span, and had to repeatedly go over easy homework to learn the material (Jellinek & Herzog, 1999).
       Later, it was discovered that many hyperactive children--those who are fidgety, restless, socially disruptive,
       and have trouble with impulse control--also display short attention spans, problems with concentration, and
       distractibility. By the 1970s, it had become clear that many children who display attention problems often also
       exhibit signs of hyperactivity. In recognition of such findings, the DSM-III (published in 1980) included a new
       disorder: attention deficit disorder with and without hyperactivity, now known as attention deficit/
       hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

       A child with ADHD shows a constant pattern of inattention and/or hyperactive and impulsive behavior that
       interferes with normal functioning (APA, 2013). Some of the signs of inattention include great difficulty with

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                                                 15.10 · Disorders in Childhood 577

and avoidance of tasks that require sustained attention (such as conversations or reading), failure to follow
instructions (often resulting in failure to complete school work and other duties), disorganization (difficulty
keeping things in order, poor time management, sloppy and messy work), lack of attention to detail, becoming
easily distracted, and forgetfulness. Hyperactivity is characterized by excessive movement, and includes
fidgeting or squirming, leaving one's seat in situations when remaining seated is expected, having trouble
sitting still (e.g., in a restaurant), running about and climbing on things, blurting out responses before another
person's question or statement has been completed, difficulty waiting one's turn for something, and
interrupting and intruding on others. Frequently, the hyperactive child comes across as noisy and boisterous.
The child's behavior is hasty, impulsive, and seems to occur without much forethought; these characteristics
may explain why adolescents and young adults diagnosed with ADHD receive more traffic tickets and have
more automobile accidents than do others (Thompson, Molina, Pelham, & Gnagy, 2007).

ADHD occurs in about 8% of children (Danielson et al, 2016), and studies estimate that for about 60% of these
people, ADHD continues into adulthood (Sibley et al 2016). On the average, boys are 3 times more likely to have
ADHD than are girls; however, such findings might reflect the greater propensity of boys to engage in
aggressive and antisocial behavior and thus incur a greater likelihood of being referred to psychological clinics
(Barkley, 2006). Children with ADHD face severe academic and social challenges. Compared to their non-
ADHD counterparts, children with ADHD have lower grades and standardized test scores and higher rates of
expulsion, grade retention, and dropping out (Loe & Feldman, 2007). they also are less well-liked and more
often rejected by their peers (Hoza et al., 2005).

A recent study found that nearly 81% of those whose ADHD persisted into adulthood had experienced at least
one other comorbid disorder, compared to 47% of those whose ADHD did not persist (Barbaresi et al., 2013).

Life Problems from ADHD

Children with ADHD face considerably worse long-term outcomes than do those children who do not have
ADHD. Adults diagnosed with ADHD in childhood, but not treated for ADHD, have been reported to have poor
outcomes in a wide range of areas of life, including social function, education, criminality, alcohol use,
substance use, and occupational outcomes (Arnold et al, 2015). In one investigation, 135 adults who had been
identified as having ADHD symptoms in the 1970s were contacted decades later and interviewed (Klein et al.,
2012). Compared to a control sample of 136 participants who had never been diagnosed with ADHD, those who
were diagnosed as children:

  · had worse educational attainment (more likely to have dropped out of high school and less likely to have
      earned a bachelor's degree);

  · had lower socioeconomic status;
  · held less prestigious occupational positions;
  · were more likely to be unemployed;
  · made considerably less in salary;
  · scored worse on a measure of occupational functioning (indicating, for example, lower job satisfaction,

      poorer work relationships, and more firings);
  · scored worse on a measure of social functioning (indicating, for example, fewer friendships and less

      involvement in social activities);
  · were more likely to be divorced; and
  · were more likely to have non-alcohol-related substance abuse problems. (Klein et al., 2012)

Longitudinal studies also show that children diagnosed with ADHD are at higher risk for substance abuse
problems. One study reported that childhood ADHD predicted later drinking problems, daily smoking, and use
of marijuana and other illicit drugs (Molina & Pelham, 2003). The risk of substance abuse problems appears to
be even greater for those with ADHD who also exhibit antisocial tendencies (Marshal & Molina, 2006).

Diagnosis, treatment, and general awareness of ADHD has certainly improved in the decades since the people
578 15 · Psychological Disorders

       in the above studies were diagnosed. Studies that include more recent outcomes show positive effects of
       treatment as opposed to non-treatment (Harpin, 2013; Arnold 2015). In most cases, the same studies indicate
       that more research and work needs to be undertaken to understand the most effect treatments and their
       impacts.

       Causes of ADHD

       Family and twin studies indicate that genetics play a significant role in the development of ADHD. Burt (2009),
       in a review of 26 studies, reported that the median rate of concordance for identical twins was .66 (one study
       reported a rate of .90), whereas the median concordance rate for fraternal twins was .20. This study also found
       that the median concordance rate for unrelated (adoptive) siblings was .09; although this number is small, it is
       greater than 0, thus suggesting that the environment may have at least some influence. Another review of
       studies concluded that the heritability of inattention and hyperactivity were 71% and 73%, respectively
       (Nikolas & Burt, 2010).

       The specific genes involved in ADHD are thought to include at least two that are important in the regulation of
       the neurotransmitter dopamine (Gizer, Ficks, & Waldman, 2009), suggesting that dopamine may be important
       in ADHD. Indeed, medications used in the treatment of ADHD, such as methylphenidate (Ritalin) and
       amphetamine with dextroamphetamine (Adderall), have stimulant qualities and elevate dopamine activity.
       People with ADHD show less dopamine activity in key regions of the brain, especially those associated with
       motivation and reward (Volkow et al., 2009), which provides support to the theory that dopamine deficits may
       be a vital factor in the development this disorder (Swanson et al., 2007).

       Brain imaging studies have shown that children with ADHD exhibit abnormalities in their frontal lobes, an area
       in which dopamine is in abundance. Compared to children without ADHD, those with ADHD appear to have
       smaller frontal lobe volume, and they show less frontal lobe activation when performing mental tasks. Recall
       that one of the functions of the frontal lobes is to inhibit our behavior. Thus, abnormalities in this region may
       go a long way toward explaining the hyperactive, uncontrolled behavior of ADHD.

       By the 1970s, many had become aware of the connection between nutritional factors and childhood behavior.
       At the time, much of the public believed that hyperactivity was caused by sugar and food additives, such as
       artificial coloring and flavoring. Undoubtedly, part of the appeal of this hypothesis was that it provided a
       simple explanation of (and treatment for) behavioral problems in children. A statistical review of 16 studies,
       however, concluded that sugar consumption has no effect at all on the behavioral and cognitive performance of
       children (Wolraich, Wilson, & White, 1995). Additionally, although food additives have been shown to increase
       hyperactivity in non-ADHD children, the effect is rather small (McCann et al., 2007). Numerous studies,
       however, have shown a significant relationship between exposure to nicotine in cigarette smoke during the
       prenatal period and ADHD (Linnet et al., 2003). Maternal smoking during pregnancy is associated with the
       development of more severe symptoms of the disorder (Thakur et al., 2013).

       Is ADHD caused by poor parenting? No. Remember, the genetics studies discussed above suggested that the
       family environment does not seem to play much of a role in the development of this disorder; if it did, we
       would expect the concordance rates to be higher for fraternal twins and adoptive siblings than has been
       demonstrated. All things considered, the evidence seems to point to the conclusion that ADHD is triggered
       more by genetic and neurological factors and less by social or environmental ones.

        Why Is the Prevalence Rate of ADHD Increasing?

         Many people believe that the rates of ADHD have increased in recent years, and there is evidence to support this
         contention. In a recent study, investigators found that the parent-reported prevalence of ADHD among children
         (4-17 years old) in the United States increased by 22% during a 4-year period, from 7.8% in 2003 to 9.5% in

  2007 (CDC, 2010). Over time this increase in parent-reported ADHD was observed in all sociodemographic
  groups and was reflected by substantial increases in 12 states (Indiana, North Carolina, and Colorado were the
  top three). The increases were greatest for older teens (ages 15-17), multiracial and Hispanic children, and
  children with a primary language other than English. Another investigation found that from 1998-2000 through
  2007-2009 the parent-reported prevalence of ADHD increased among U.S. children between the ages of 5-17
  years old, from 6.9% to 9.0% (Akinbami, Liu, Pastor, & Reuben, 2011).

  A major weakness of both studies was that children were not actually given a formal diagnosis. Instead, parents
  were simply asked whether or not a doctor or other health-care provider had ever told them their child had
  ADHD; the reported prevalence rates thus may have been affected by the accuracy of parental memory.
  Nevertheless, the findings from these studies raise important questions concerning what appears to be a
  demonstrable rise in the prevalence of ADHD. Although the reasons underlying this apparent increase in the
  rates of ADHD over time are poorly understood and, at best, speculative, several explanations are viable:

    · ADHD may be over-diagnosed by doctors who are too quick to medicate children as a behavior treatment.
    · There is greater awareness of ADHD now than in the past. Nearly everyone has heard of ADHD, and most

        parents and teachers are aware of its key symptoms. Thus, parents may be quick to take their children to a
        doctor if they believe their child possesses these symptoms, or teachers may be more likely now than in the
        past to notice the symptoms and refer the child for evaluation.
    · The use of computers, video games, iPhones, and other electronic devices has become pervasive among
        children in the early 21st century, and these devices could potentially shorten children's attentions spans.
        Thus, what might seem like inattention to some parents and teachers could simply reflect exposure to too
        much technology.
    · ADHD diagnostic criteria have changed over time.

Autism Spectrum Disorder

A seminal paper published in 1943 by psychiatrist Leo Kanner described an unusual neurodevelopmental
condition he observed in a group of children. He called this condition early infantile autism, and it was
characterized mainly by an inability to form close emotional ties with others, speech and language
abnormalities, repetitive behaviors, and an intolerance of minor changes in the environment and in normal
routines (Bregman, 2005). What the DSM-5 refers to as autism spectrum disorder today, is a direct extension
of Kanner's work.

Autism spectrum disorder is probably the most misunderstood of the neurodevelopmental disorders. Children
with this disorder show signs of significant disturbances in three main areas: (a) deficits in social interaction,
(b) deficits in communication, and (c) repetitive patterns of behavior or interests. These disturbances appear
early in life and cause serious impairments in functioning (APA, 2013). The child with autism spectrum
disorder might exhibit deficits in social interaction by not initiating conversations with other children or
turning their head away when spoken to. Typically, these children do not make eye contact with others and
seem to prefer playing alone rather than with others. In some cases, it is almost as though these individuals
live in a personal and isolated social world others are simply not privy to or able to penetrate. Communication
deficits can range from a complete lack of speech, to one word responses (e.g., saying "Yes" or "No" when
replying to questions or statements that require additional elaboration), to echoed speech (e.g., parroting what
another person says, either immediately or several hours or even days later), to difficulty maintaining a
conversation because of an inability to reciprocate others' comments. These deficits can also include problems
in using and understanding nonverbal cues (e.g., facial expressions, gestures, and postures) that facilitate
normal communication.

Repetitive patterns of behavior or interests can be exhibited a number of ways. The child might engage in
stereotyped, repetitive movements (rocking, head-banging, or repeatedly dropping an object and then picking
580 15 · Psychological Disorders

       it up), or they might show great distress at small changes in routine or the environment. In some cases, the
       person with autism spectrum disorder might show highly restricted and fixated interests that appear to be
       abnormal in their intensity. For instance, the person might learn and memorize every detail about something
       even though doing so serves no apparent purpose. Importantly, autism spectrum disorder is not the same
       thing as intellectual disability, although these two conditions are often comorbid. The DSM-5 specifies that the
       symptoms of autism spectrum disorder are not caused or explained by intellectual disability.

       Life Problems From Autism Spectrum Disorder

       Autism spectrum disorder is referred to in everyday language as autism; in fact, the disorder was termed
       "autistic disorder" in earlier editions of the DSM, and its diagnostic criteria were much narrower than those of
       autism spectrum disorder. The qualifier "spectrum" in autism spectrum disorder is used to indicate that
       individuals with the disorder can show a range, or spectrum, of symptoms that vary in their magnitude and
       severity: some severe, others less severe. The previous edition of the DSM included a diagnosis of Asperger's
       disorder, generally recognized as a less severe form of autistic disorder; individuals diagnosed with Asperger's
       disorder were described as having average or high intelligence and a strong vocabulary, but exhibiting
       impairments in social interaction and social communication, such as talking only about their special interests
       (Wing, Gould, & Gillberg, 2011). However, because research has failed to demonstrate that Asperger's disorder
       differs qualitatively from autistic disorder, the DSM-5 does not include it, which is prompting concerns among
       some parents that their children may no longer be eligible for special services ("Asperger's Syndrome
       Dropped," 2012). Some individuals with autism spectrum disorder, particularly those with better language and
       intellectual skills, can live and work independently as adults. However, most do not because the symptoms
       remain sufficient to cause serious impairment in many realms of life (APA, 2013).

       Current estimates from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Autism and Developmental Disabilities
       Monitoring Network indicate that 1 in 59 children in the United States has autism spectrum disorder; the
       disorder is 4 times more common among boys (1 in 38) than in girls (1 in 152) (Baio et al, 2018). Rates of
       autistic spectrum disorder have increased dramatically since the 1980s. For example, California saw an
       increase of 273% in reported cases from 1987 through 1998 (Byrd, 2002); between 2000 and 2008, the rate of
       autism diagnoses in the United States increased 78% (CDC, 2012). Although it is difficult to interpret this
       increase, it is possible that the rise in prevalence is the result of the broadening of the diagnosis, increased
       efforts to identify cases in the community, and greater awareness and acceptance of the diagnosis. In addition,
       mental health professionals are now more knowledgeable about autism spectrum disorder and are better
       equipped to make the diagnosis, even in subtle cases (Novella, 2008).

       Causes of Autism Spectrum Disorder

       The exact causes of autism spectrum disorder remain unknown despite massive research efforts over the last
       two decades (Meek, Lemery-Chalfant, Jahromi, & Valiente, 2013). Autism appears to be strongly influenced by
       genetics, as identical twins show concordance rates of 60%-90%, whereas concordance rates for fraternal
       twins and siblings are 5%-10% (Autism Genome Project Consortium, 2007). Many different genes and gene
       mutations have been implicated in autism (Meek et al., 2013). Among the genes involved are those important
       in the formation of synaptic circuits that facilitate communication between different areas of the brain
       (Gauthier et al., 2011). A number of environmental factors are also thought to be associated with increased
       risk for autism spectrum disorder, at least in part, because they contribute to new mutations. These factors
       include exposure to pollutants, such as plant emissions and mercury, urban versus rural residence, and
       vitamin D deficiency (Kinney, Barch, Chayka, Napoleon, & Munir, 2009).

Child Vaccinations and Autism Spectrum Disorder
In the late 1990s, a prestigious medical journal published an article purportedly showing that autism is
triggered by the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine. These findings were very controversial and drew
a great deal of attention, sparking an international forum on whether children should be vaccinated. In a
shocking turn of events, some years later the article was retracted by the journal that had published it after
evidence of fraud and unethical practices on the part of the lead researcher. Despite the retraction, the
reporting in popular media led to concerns about a possible link between vaccines and autism persisting. A
recent survey of parents, for example, found that roughly a third of respondents expressed such a concern
(Kennedy, LaVail, Nowak, Basket, & Landry, 2011); and perhaps fearing that their children would develop
autism, more than 10% of parents of young children refuse or delay vaccinations (Dempsey et al., 2011). Some
parents of children with autism mounted a campaign against scientists who refuted the vaccine-autism link.
Even politicians and several well-known celebrities weighed in; for example, actress Jenny McCarthy (who
believed that a vaccination caused her son's autism) co-authored a book on the matter. However, there is no
scientific evidence that a link exists between autism and vaccinations (Hughes, 2007). Indeed, a recent study
compared the vaccination histories of 256 children with autism spectrum disorder with that of 752 control
children across three time periods during their first two years of life (birth to 3 months, birth to 7 months, and
birth to 2 years) (DeStefano, Price, & Weintraub, 2013). At the time of the study, the children were between 6
and 13 years old, and their prior vaccination records were obtained. Because vaccines contain immunogens
(substances that fight infections), the investigators examined medical records to see how many immunogens
children received to determine if those children who received more immunogens were at greater risk for
developing autism spectrum disorder. The results of this study, a portion of which are shown in Figure 15.19,
clearly demonstrate that the quantity of immunogens from vaccines received during the first two years of life
were not at all related to the development of autism spectrum disorder. There is not a relationship between
vaccinations and autism spectrum disorders.

FIGURE 15.19 In terms of their exposure to immunogens in vaccines, overall, there is not a significant difference
between children with autism spectrum disorder and their age-matched controls without the disorder (DeStefano et
al., 2013).
Why does concern over vaccines and autism spectrum disorder persist? Since the proliferation of the Internet
in the 1990s, parents have been constantly bombarded with online information that can become magnified
and take on a life of its own. The enormous volume of electronic information pertaining to autism spectrum
582 15 · Psychological Disorders

disorder, combined with how difficult it can be to grasp complex scientific concepts, can make separating good
research from bad challenging (Downs, 2008). Notably, the study that fueled the controversy reported that 8
out of 12 children--according to their parents--developed symptoms consistent with autism spectrum
disorder shortly after receiving a vaccination. To conclude that vaccines cause autism spectrum disorder on
this basis, as many did, is clearly incorrect for a number of reasons, not the least of which is because
correlation does not imply causation, as you've learned.

Additionally, as was the case with diet and ADHD in the 1970s, the notion that autism spectrum disorder is
caused by vaccinations is appealing to some because it provides a simple explanation for this condition. Like
all disorders, however, there are no simple explanations for autism spectrum disorder. Although the research
discussed above has shed some light on its causes, science is still a long way from complete understanding of
the disorder.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Describe the nature of personality disorders and how they differ from other disorders
  · List and distinguish between the three clusters of personality disorders
  · Identify the basic features of borderline personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder, and the factors

      that are important in the etiology of both

The term personality refers loosely to one's stable, consistent, and distinctive way of thinking about, feeling,
acting, and relating to the world. People with personality disorders exhibit a personality style that differs
markedly from the expectations of their culture, is pervasive and inflexible, begins in adolescence or early
adulthood, and causes distress or impairment (APA, 2013). Generally, individuals with these disorders exhibit
enduring personality styles that are extremely troubling and often create problems for them and those with
whom they come into contact. Their maladaptive personality styles frequently bring them into conflict with
others, disrupt their ability to develop and maintain social relationships, and prevent them from
accomplishing realistic life goals.

The DSM-5 recognizes 10 personality disorders, organized into 3 different clusters. Cluster A disorders include
paranoid personality disorder, schizoid personality disorder, and schizotypal personality disorder. People with
these disorders display a personality style that is odd or eccentric. Cluster B disorders include antisocial
personality disorder, histrionic personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder, and borderline
personality disorder. People with these disorders usually are impulsive, overly dramatic, highly emotional, and
erratic. Cluster C disorders include avoidant personality disorder, dependent personality disorder, and
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (which is not the same thing as obsessive-compulsive disorder).
People with these disorders often appear to be nervous and fearful. Table 15.2 provides a description of each
of the DSM-5 personality disorders:

Slightly over 9% of the U.S. population suffers from a personality disorder, with avoidant and schizoid
584 15 · Psychological Disorders

       personality disorders the most frequent (Lezenweger, Lane, Loranger, & Kessler, 2007). Two of these
       personality disorders, borderline personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder, are regarded by
       many as especially problematic.

      Borderline Personality Disorder

       The "borderline" in borderline personality disorder was originally coined in the late 1930s in an effort to
       describe patients who appeared anxious, but were prone to brief psychotic experiences--that is, patients who
       were thought to be literally on the borderline between anxiety and psychosis (Freeman, Stone, Martin, &
       Reinecke, 2005). Today, borderline personality disorder has a completely different meaning. Borderline
       personality disorder is characterized chiefly by instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, and
       mood, as well as marked impulsivity (APA, 2013). People with borderline personality disorder cannot tolerate
       the thought of being alone and will make frantic efforts (including making suicidal gestures and engaging in
       self-mutilation) to avoid abandonment or separation (whether real or imagined). Their relationships are
       intense and unstable; for example, a romantic partner may be idealized early in a relationship, but then later
       vilified at the slightest sign they appear to no longer show interest. These individuals have an unstable view of
       self and, thus, might suddenly display a shift in personal attitudes, interests, career plans, and choice of
       friends. For example, a law school student may, despite having invested tens of thousands of dollars toward
       earning a law degree and despite having performed well in the program, consider dropping out and pursuing a
       career in another field. People with borderline personality disorder may be highly impulsive and may engage
       in reckless and self-destructive behaviors such as excessive gambling, spending money irresponsibly,
       substance abuse, engaging in unsafe sex, and reckless driving. They sometimes show intense and
       inappropriate anger that they have difficulty controlling, and they can be moody, sarcastic, bitter, and verbally
       abusive.

       The prevalence of borderline personality disorder in the U.S. population is estimated to be around 1.4%
       (Lezenweger et al., 2007), but the rates are higher among those who use mental health services; approximately
       10% of mental health outpatients and 20% of psychiatric inpatients meet the criteria for diagnosis (APA,
       2013). Additionally, borderline personality disorder is comorbid with anxiety, mood, and substance use
       disorders (Lezenweger et al., 2007).

       Biological Basis for Borderline Personality Disorder

       Genetic factors appear to be important in the development of borderline personality disorder. For example,
       core personality traits that characterize this disorder, such as impulsivity and emotional instability, show a
       high degree of heritability (Livesley, 2008). Also, the rates of borderline personality disorder among relatives of
       people with this disorder have been found to be as high as 24.9% (White, Gunderson, Zanarani, & Hudson,
       2003). Individuals with borderline personality disorder report experiencing childhood physical, sexual, and/or
       emotional abuse at rates far greater than those observed in the general population (Afifi et al., 2010), indicating
       that environmental factors are also crucial. These findings would suggest that borderline personality disorder
       may be determined by an interaction between genetic factors and adverse environmental experiences.
       Consistent with this hypothesis, one study found that the highest rates of borderline personality disorder were
       among individuals with a borderline temperament (characterized by high novelty seeking and high harm-
       avoidance) and those who experienced childhood abuse and/or neglect (Joyce et al., 2003).

      Antisocial Personality Disorder

       Most human beings live in accordance with a moral compass, a sense of right and wrong. Most individuals
       learn at a very young age that there are certain things that should not be done. We learn that we should not lie
       or cheat. We are taught that it is wrong to take things that do not belong to us, and that it is wrong to exploit
       others for personal gain. We also learn the importance of living up to our responsibilities, of doing what we say
       we will do. People with antisocial personality disorder, however, do not seem to have a moral compass. These
       individuals act as though they neither have a sense of nor care about right or wrong. Not surprisingly, these

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                                                   15.11 · Personality Disorders 585

people represent a serious problem for others and for society in general.

According to the DSM-5, the individual with antisocial personality disorder shows no regard at all for other
people's rights or feelings. This lack of regard is exhibited a number of ways and can include repeatedly
performing illegal acts, lying to or conning others, impulsivity and recklessness, irritability and aggressiveness
toward others, and failure to act in a responsible way (e.g., leaving debts unpaid) (APA, 2013). People with this
disorder have no remorse over their misdeeds; these people will hurt, manipulate, exploit, and abuse others
and not feel any guilt. Signs of this disorder can emerge early in life; however, a person must be at least 18
years old to be diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder.

People with antisocial personality disorder seem to view the world as self-serving and unkind. They seem to
think that they should use whatever means necessary to get by in life. They tend to view others not as living,
thinking, feeling beings, but rather as pawns to be used or abused for a specific purpose. They often have an
over-inflated sense of themselves and can appear extremely arrogant. They frequently display superficial
charm; for example, without really meaning it they might say exactly what they think another person wants to
hear. They lack empathy: they are incapable of understanding the emotional point-of-view of others. People
with this disorder may become involved in illegal enterprises, show cruelty toward others, leave their jobs with
no plans to obtain another job, have multiple sexual partners, repeatedly get into fights with others, and show
reckless disregard for themselves and others (e.g., repeated arrests for driving while intoxicated) (APA, 2013).

The DSM-5 has included an alternative model for conceptualizing personality disorders based on the traits
identified in the Five Factor Model of personality. This model addresses the level of personality functioning
such as impairments in self (identity or self-direction) and interpersonal (empathy or intimacy) functioning. In
the case of antisocial personality disorder, the DSM-5 identifies the predominant traits of antagonism (such as
disregard for others' needs, manipulative or deceitful behavior) and disinhibition (characterized by
impulsivity, irresponsibility, and risk-taking) (Harwood, Schade, Krueger, Wright, & Markon, 2012). A
psychopathology specifier is also included that emphasizes traits such as attention seeking and low
anxiousness (lack of concern about negative consequences for risky or harmful behavior) (Crego & Widiger,
2014).

Risk Factors for Antisocial Personality Disorder

Antisocial personality disorder is observed in about 3.6% of the population; the disorder is much more
common among men, with a 3 to 1 ratio of men to women, and it is more likely to occur in men who are
younger, widowed, separated, divorced, of lower socioeconomic status, who live in urban areas, and who live in
the western United States (Compton, Conway, Stinson, Colliver, & Grant, 2005). Compared to men with
antisocial personality disorder, women with the disorder are more likely to have experienced emotional
neglect and sexual abuse during childhood, and they are more likely to have had parents who abused
substances and who engaged in antisocial behaviors themselves (Alegria et al., 2013).

Table 15.3 shows some of the differences in the specific types of antisocial behaviors that men and women
with antisocial personality disorder exhibit (Alegria et al., 2013).

TABLE 15.3

Family, twin, and adoption studies suggest that both genetic and environmental factors influence the
development of antisocial personality disorder, as well as general antisocial behavior (criminality, violence,
aggressiveness) (Baker, Bezdjian, & Raine, 2006). Personality and temperament dimensions that are related to
this disorder, including fearlessness, impulsive antisociality, and callousness, have a substantial genetic
influence (Livesley & Jang, 2008). Adoption studies clearly demonstrate that the development of antisocial
behavior is determined by the interaction of genetic factors and adverse environmental circumstances (Rhee &
Waldman, 2002). For example, one investigation found that adoptees of biological parents with antisocial
personality disorder were more likely to exhibit adolescent and adult antisocial behaviors if they were raised
in adverse adoptive family environments (e.g., adoptive parents had marital problems, were divorced, used
drugs, and had legal problems) than if they were raised in a more normal adoptive environment (Cadoret,
Yates, Ed, Woodworth, & Stewart, 1995).

Researchers who are interested in the importance of environment in the development of antisocial personality
disorder have directed their attention to such factors as the community, the structure and functioning of the
family, and peer groups. Each of these factors influences the likelihood of antisocial behavior. One longitudinal
investigation of more than 800 Seattle-area youth measured risk factors for violence at 10, 14, 16, and 18 years
of age (Herrenkohl et al., 2000). The risk factors examined included those involving the family, peers, and
community. A portion of the findings from this study are provided in Figure 15.20.

         FIGURE 15.20 Longitudinal studies have helped to identify risk factors for predicting violent behavior.
Those with antisocial tendencies do not seem to experience emotions the way most other people do. These
individuals fail to show fear in response to environment cues that signal punishment, pain, or noxious
stimulation. For instance, they show less skin conductance (sweatiness on hands) in anticipation of electric
shock than do people without antisocial tendencies (Hare, 1965). Skin conductance is controlled by the
sympathetic nervous system and is used to assess autonomic nervous system functioning. When the
sympathetic nervous system is active, people become aroused and anxious, and sweat gland activity increases.
Thus, increased sweat gland activity, as assessed through skin conductance, is taken as a sign of arousal or
anxiety. For those with antisocial personality disorder, a lack of skin conductance may indicate the presence of
characteristics such as emotional deficits and impulsivity that underlie the propensity for antisocial behavior
and negative social relationships (Fung et al., 2005).
Another example showing that those with antisocial personality disorder fail to respond to environmental cues
comes from a recent study by Stuppy-Sullivan and Baskin-Sommers (2019). The researchers studied cognitive
and reward factors associated with antisocial personality disorder dysfunction in 119 incarcerated males.
588 15 · Psychological Disorders

       Each subject was administered three tasks targeting different aspects of cognition and reward. High-
       magnitude rewards tended to impair perception in those with antisocial personality disorder, worsened
       executive function when they were consciously aware of the high rewards, and worsened inhibition when the
       tasks placed high demand on working memory.

Summary

15.1 What Are Psychological Disorders?

Psychological disorders are conditions characterized by abnormal thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Although
challenging, it is essential for psychologists and mental health professionals to agree on what kinds of inner
experiences and behaviors constitute the presence of a psychological disorder. Inner experiences and
behaviors that are atypical or violate social norms could signify the presence of a disorder; however, each of
these criteria alone is inadequate. Harmful dysfunction describes the view that psychological disorders result
from the inability of an internal mechanism to perform its natural function. Many of the features of harmful
dysfunction conceptualization have been incorporated in the APA's formal definition of psychological
disorders. According to this definition, the presence of a psychological disorder is signaled by significant
disturbances in thoughts, feelings, and behaviors; these disturbances must reflect some kind of dysfunction
(biological, psychological, or developmental), must cause significant impairment in one's life, and must not
reflect culturally expected reactions to certain life events.

15.2 Diagnosing and Classifying Psychological Disorders

The diagnosis and classification of psychological disorders is essential in studying and treating
psychopathology. The classification system used by most U.S. professionals is the DSM-5. The first edition of
the DSM was published in 1952, and has undergone numerous revisions. The 5th and most recent edition, the
DSM-5, was published in 2013. The diagnostic manual includes a total of 237 specific diagnosable disorders,
each described in detail, including its symptoms, prevalence, risk factors, and comorbidity. Over time, the
number of diagnosable conditions listed in the DSM has grown steadily, prompting criticism from some.
Nevertheless, the diagnostic criteria in the DSM are more explicit than that of any other system, which makes
the DSM system highly desirable for both clinical diagnosis and research.
592 15 · Summary

15.3 Perspectives on Psychological Disorders

Psychopathology is very complex, involving a plethora of etiological theories and perspectives. For centuries,
psychological disorders were viewed primarily from a supernatural perspective and thought to arise from
divine forces or possession from spirits. Some cultures continue to hold this supernatural belief. Today, many
who study psychopathology view mental illness from a biological perspective, whereby psychological disorders
are thought to result largely from faulty biological processes. Indeed, scientific advances over the last several
decades have provided a better understanding of the genetic, neurological, hormonal, and biochemical bases
of psychopathology. The psychological perspective, in contrast, emphasizes the importance of psychological
factors (e.g., stress and thoughts) and environmental factors in the development of psychological disorders. A
contemporary, promising approach is to view disorders as originating from an integration of biological and
psychosocial factors. The diathesis-stress model suggests that people with an underlying diathesis, or
vulnerability, for a psychological disorder are more likely than those without the diathesis to develop the
disorder when faced with stressful events.

15.4 Anxiety Disorders

Anxiety disorders are a group of disorders in which a person experiences excessive, persistent, and distressing
fear and anxiety that interferes with normal functioning. Anxiety disorders include specific phobia: a specific
unrealistic fear; social anxiety disorder: extreme fear and avoidance of social situations; panic disorder:
suddenly overwhelmed by panic even though there is no apparent reason to be frightened; agoraphobia: an
intense fear and avoidance of situations in which it might be difficult to escape; and generalized anxiety
disorder: a relatively continuous state of tension, apprehension, and dread.

15.5 Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders

Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders are a group of DSM-5 disorders that overlap somewhat in that
they each involve intrusive thoughts and/or repetitive behaviors. Perhaps the most recognized of these
disorders is obsessive-compulsive disorder, in which a person is obsessed with unwanted, unpleasant
thoughts and/or compulsively engages in repetitive behaviors or mental acts, perhaps as a way of coping with
the obsessions. Body dysmorphic disorder is characterized by the individual becoming excessively
preoccupied with one or more perceived flaws in their physical appearance that are either nonexistent or
unnoticeable to others. Preoccupation with the perceived physical defects causes the person to experience
significant anxiety regarding how they appear to others. Hoarding disorder is characterized by persistent
difficulty in discarding or parting with objects, regardless of their actual value, often resulting in the
accumulation of items that clutter and congest their living area.

15.6 Posttraumatic Stress Disorder

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was described through much of the 20th century and was referred to as
shell shock and combat neurosis in the belief that its symptoms were thought to emerge from the stress of
active combat. Today, PTSD is defined as a disorder in which the experience of a traumatic or profoundly
stressful event, such as combat, sexual assault, or natural disaster, produces a constellation of symptoms that
must last for one month or more. These symptoms include intrusive and distressing memories of the event,
flashbacks, avoidance of stimuli or situations that are connected to the event, persistently negative emotional
states, feeling detached from others, irritability, proneness toward outbursts, and a tendency to be easily
startled. Not everyone who experiences a traumatic event will develop PTSD; a variety of risk factors
associated with its development have been identified.

15.7 Mood and Related Disorders

Mood disorders are those in which the person experiences severe disturbances in mood and emotion. They
include depressive disorders and bipolar and related disorders. Depressive disorders include major
depressive disorder, which is characterized by episodes of profound sadness and loss of interest or pleasure in

   usual activities and other associated features, and persistent depressive disorder, which marked by a chronic
   state of sadness.

   Bipolar disorder is characterized by mood states that vacillate between sadness and euphoria; a diagnosis of
   bipolar disorder requires experiencing at least one manic episode, which is defined as a period of extreme
   euphoria, irritability, and increased activity. During a manic episode, a person will likely exhibit behaviors
   atypical for that person. They may become excessively talkative, exhibit flight of ideas, and make grandiose
   plans. They may go on a spending spree, maxing out their credit card with items they can not afford, gamble,
   or engage in risky sexual behaviors. About fifty percent of people suffering from bipolar disorder do not
   receive treatment. Bipolar disorder is a definitive risk factor for suicide, with about a third of people with
   bipolar disorder attempting suicide.

   When a person's pain and distress completely overwhelm their ability to cope, some people may consider
   suicide. People who suffer from mental health and substance abuse problems are at a much higher risk of
   suicide than the general public. Males die by suicide at a significantly higher rate than females, and males use
   much more lethal means in their attempts. A person contemplating suicide needs help and should not have
   access to lethal means of suicide, such as firearms. If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, there
   are many helpful resources. Three of them are listed below:

   15.8 Schizophrenia

   Schizophrenia is a severe disorder characterized by a complete breakdown in one's ability to function in life; it
   often requires hospitalization. People with schizophrenia experience hallucinations and delusions, and they
   have extreme difficulty regulating their emotions and behavior. Thinking is incoherent and disorganized,
   behavior is extremely bizarre, emotions are flat, and motivation to engage in most basic life activities is
   lacking. Considerable evidence shows that genetic factors play a central role in schizophrenia; however,
   adoption studies have highlighted the additional importance of environmental factors. Neurotransmitter and
   brain abnormalities, which may be linked to environmental factors such as obstetric complications or
   exposure to influenza during the gestational period, have also been implicated. A promising new area of
   schizophrenia research involves identifying individuals who show prodromal symptoms and following them
   over time to determine which factors best predict the development of schizophrenia. Future research may
   enable us to pinpoint those especially at risk for developing schizophrenia and who may benefit from early
   intervention.

   15.9 Dissociative Disorders

   The main characteristic of dissociative disorders is that people become dissociated from their sense of self,
   resulting in memory and identity disturbances. Dissociative disorders listed in the DSM-5 include dissociative
   amnesia, depersonalization/derealization disorder, and dissociative identity disorder. A person with
   dissociative amnesia is unable to recall important personal information, often after a stressful or traumatic
   experience.

   Depersonalization/derealization disorder is characterized by recurring episodes of depersonalization (i.e.,
   detachment from or unfamiliarity with the self) and/or derealization (i.e., detachment from or unfamiliarity
   with the world). A person with dissociative identity disorder exhibits two or more well-defined and distinct
   personalities or identities, as well as memory gaps for the time during which another identity was present.

   Dissociative identity disorder has generated controversy, mainly because some believe its symptoms can be
594 15 · Review Questions

faked by patients if presenting its symptoms somehow benefits the patient in avoiding negative consequences
or taking responsibility for one's actions. The diagnostic rates of this disorder have increased dramatically
following its portrayal in popular culture. However, many people legitimately suffer over the course of a
lifetime with this disorder.

15.10 Disorders in Childhood

Neurodevelopmental disorders are a group of disorders that are typically diagnosed during childhood and are
characterized by developmental deficits in personal, social, academic, and intellectual realms; these disorders
include attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder. ADHD is characterized
by a pervasive pattern of inattention and/or hyperactive and impulsive behavior that interferes with normal
functioning. Genetic and neurobiological factors contribute to the development of ADHD, which can persist
well into adulthood and is often associated with poor long-term outcomes. The major features of autism
spectrum disorder include deficits in social interaction and communication and repetitive movements or
interests. As with ADHD, genetic factors appear to play a prominent role in the development of autism
spectrum disorder; exposure to environmental pollutants such as mercury have also been linked to the
development of this disorder. Although it is believed by some that autism is triggered by the MMR vaccination,
evidence does not support this claim.

15.11 Personality Disorders

Individuals with personality disorders exhibit a personality style that is inflexible, causes distress and
impairment, and creates problems for themselves and others. The DSM-5 recognizes 10 personality disorders,
organized into three clusters. The disorders in Cluster A include those characterized by a personality style that
is odd and eccentric. Cluster B includes personality disorders characterized chiefly by a personality style that
is impulsive, dramatic, highly emotional, and erratic, and those in Cluster C are characterized by a nervous
and fearful personality style. Two Cluster B personality disorders, borderline personality disorder and
antisocial personality disorder, are especially problematic. People with borderline personality disorder show
marked instability in mood, behavior, and self-image, as well as impulsivity. They cannot stand to be alone, are
unpredictable, have a history of stormy relationships, and frequently display intense and inappropriate anger.
Genetic factors and adverse childhood experiences (e.g., sexual abuse) appear to be important in its
development. People with antisocial personality display a lack of regard for the rights of others; they are
impulsive, deceitful, irresponsible, and unburdened by any sense of guilt. Genetic factors and socialization
both appear to be important in the origin of antisocial personality disorder. Research has also shown that those
with this disorder do not experience emotions the way most other people do.

INTRODUCTION What comes to mind when you think about therapy for mental health issues? You might
picture someone lying on a couch talking about his childhood while the therapist sits and takes notes, à la
Sigmund Freud. But can you envision a therapy session in which someone is wearing virtual reality headgear
to conquer a fear of snakes?

In this chapter, you will see that approaches to therapy include both psychological and biological interventions,
all with the goal of alleviating distress. Because psychological problems can originate from various
sources--biology, genetics, childhood experiences, conditioning, and sociocultural influences--psychologists
have developed many different therapeutic techniques and approaches. The Ocean Therapy program shown in
Figure 16.1 uses multiple approaches to support the mental health of veterans in the group.

There are many misconceptions and assumptions about therapy and treatment. In the same way that mental

       health and psychological disorders are often misunderstood and may be discounted, seeking help for
       problems can be a difficult and scary time for people. There is no one method that works for everyone, and
       those seeking help are displaying strength and courage in their decision to address a highly stigmatized and
       challenging issue. The goal of treatment is not to change whom a person is, but to address symptoms and/or
       underlying conditions.

     16.1 Mental Health Treatment: Past and Present

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain how people with psychological disorders have been treated throughout the ages
         · Discuss deinstitutionalization
         · Discuss the ways in which mental health services are delivered today
         · Distinguish between voluntary and involuntary treatment
       Before we explore the various approaches to therapy used today, let's begin our study of therapy by looking at
       how many people experience mental illness and how many receive treatment. According to the U.S.
       Department of Health and Human Services (2017), 18.9% of U.S. adults experienced mental illness in 2017.
       For teens (ages 13-18), the rate is similar to that of adults, and for children ages 8-15, current estimates
       suggest that approximately 13% experience mental illness in a given year (National Institute of Mental Health
       [NIMH], 2017).
       With many different treatment options available, approximately how many people receive mental health
       treatment per year? According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA),
       in 2017, 14.8% of adults received treatment for a mental health issue (NIMH, 2017). These percentages, shown
       in Figure 16.2, reflect the number of adults who received care in inpatient and outpatient settings and/or used
       prescription medication for psychological disorders.

       FIGURE 16.2 The percentage of adults who received mental health treatment in 2004-2008 is shown. Adults
       seeking treatment increased slightly from 2004 to 2008.
       Children and adolescents also receive mental health services. The Centers for Disease Control and
       Prevention's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) found that approximately half
       (50.6%) of children with mental disorders had received treatment for their disorder within the past year
       (NIMH, n.d.). However, there were some differences between treatment rates by category of disorder (Figure
       16.3). For example, children with anxiety disorders were least likely to have received treatment in the past
       year, while children with ADHD or a conduct disorder were more likely to receive treatment. Can you think of
       some possible reasons for these differences in receiving treatment?

FIGURE 16.3 About one-third to one-half of U.S. adolescents (ages 8-15) with mental disorders receive treatment,
with behavior-related disorders more likely to be treated.
Considering the many forms of treatment for mental health disorders available today, how did these forms of
treatment emerge? Let's take a look at the history of mental health treatment from the past (with some
questionable approaches in light of modern understanding of mental illness) to where we are today.

Treatment in the Past

For much of history, people with mental illness have been treated very poorly. It was believed that mental
illness was caused by demonic possession, witchcraft, or an angry god (Szasz, 1960). For example, in medieval
times, abnormal behaviors were viewed as a sign that a person was possessed by demons. If someone was
considered to be possessed, there were several forms of treatment to release spirits from the individual. The
most common treatment was exorcism, often conducted by priests or other religious figures: Incantations and
prayers were said over the person's body, and they may have been given some medicinal drinks. Another form
of treatment for extreme cases of mental illness was trephining: A small hole was made in the afflicted
individual's skull to release spirits from the body. Most people treated in this manner died. In addition to
exorcism and trephining, other practices involved execution or imprisonment of people with psychological
disorders. Still others were left to be homeless beggars. Generally speaking, most people who exhibited strange
behaviors were greatly misunderstood and treated cruelly. The prevailing theory of psychopathology in earlier
history was the idea that mental illness was the result of demonic possession by either an evil spirit or an evil
god because early beliefs incorrectly attributed all unexplainable phenomena to deities deemed either good or
evil.
From the late 1400s to the late 1600s, a common belief perpetuated by some religious organizations was that
some people made pacts with the devil and committed horrible acts, such as eating babies (Blumberg, 2007).
These people were considered to be witches and were tried and condemned by courts--they were often burned
at the stake. Worldwide, it is estimated that tens of thousands of mentally ill people were killed after being
accused of being witches or under the influence of witchcraft (Hemphill, 1966)
By the 18th century, people who were considered odd and unusual were placed in asylums (Figure 16.4).
Asylums were the first institutions created for the specific purpose of housing people with psychological
disorders, but the focus was ostracizing them from society rather than treating their disorders. Often these
people were kept in windowless dungeons, beaten, chained to their beds, and had little to no contact with
caregivers.

       FIGURE 16.4 This painting by Francisco Goya, called The Madhouse, depicts a mental asylum and its inhabitants in
       the early 1800s. It portrays those with psychological disorders as victims.
       In the late 1700s, a French physician, Philippe Pinel, argued for more humane treatment of people with mental
       illness. He suggested that they be unchained and talked to, and that's just what he did for patients at La
       Salpêtrière in Paris in 1795 (Figure 16.5). Patients benefited from this more humane treatment, and many
       were able to leave the hospital.

       FIGURE 16.5 This painting by Tony Robert-Fleury depicts Dr. Philippe Pinel ordering the removal of chains from
       patients at the Salpêtrière asylum in Paris.
       In the 19th century, Dorothea Dix led reform efforts for mental health care in the United States (Figure 16.6).
       She investigated how those who are mentally ill and poor were cared for, and she discovered an underfunded
       and unregulated system that perpetuated abuse of this population (Tiffany, 1891). Horrified by her findings,
       Dix began lobbying various state legislatures and the U.S. Congress for change (Tiffany, 1891). Her efforts led
       to the creation of the first mental asylums in the United States.

FIGURE 16.6 Dorothea Dix was a social reformer who became an advocate for the indigent insane and was
instrumental in creating the first American mental asylum. She did this by relentlessly lobbying state legislatures
and Congress to set up and fund such institutions.
Despite reformers' efforts, however, a typical asylum was filthy, offered very little treatment, and often kept
people for decades. At Willard Psychiatric Center in upstate New York, for example, one treatment was to
submerge patients in cold baths for long periods of time. Electroshock treatment was also used, and the way
the treatment was administered often broke patients' backs; in 1943, doctors at Willard administered 1,443
shock treatments (Willard Psychiatric Center, 2009). (Electroshock is now called electroconvulsive treatment,
and the therapy is still used, but with safeguards and under anesthesia. A brief application of electric stimulus
is used to produce a generalized seizure. Controversy continues over its effectiveness versus the side effects.)
Many of the wards and rooms were so cold that a glass of water would be frozen by morning (Willard
Psychiatric Center, 2009). Willard's doors were not closed until 1995. Conditions like these remained
commonplace until well into the 20th century.
Starting in 1954 and gaining popularity in the 1960s, antipsychotic medications were introduced. These
proved a tremendous help in controlling the symptoms of certain psychological disorders, such as psychosis.
Psychosis was a common diagnosis of individuals in mental hospitals, and it was often evidenced by symptoms
like hallucinations and delusions, indicating a loss of contact with reality. Then in 1963, Congress passed and
John F. Kennedy signed the Mental Retardation Facilities and Community Mental Health Centers Construction
Act, which provided federal support and funding for community mental health centers (National Institutes of
Health, 2013). This legislation changed how mental health services were delivered in the United States. It
started the process of deinstitutionalization, the closing of large asylums, by providing for people to stay in
their communities and be treated locally. In 1955, there were 558,239 severely mentally ill patients
institutionalized at public hospitals (Torrey, 1997). By 1994, by percentage of the population, there were 92%
fewer hospitalized individuals (Torrey, 1997).

Mental Health Treatment Today

Today, there are community mental health centers across the nation. They are located in neighborhoods near
the homes of clients, and they provide large numbers of people with mental health services of various kinds
and for many kinds of problems. Unfortunately, part of what occurred with deinstitutionalization was that
those released from institutions were supposed to go to newly created centers, but the system was not set up
effectively. Centers were underfunded, staff was not trained to handle severe illnesses such as schizophrenia,
there was high staff burnout, and no provision was made for the other services people needed, such as
housing, food, and job training. Without these supports, those people released under deinstitutionalization
often ended up homeless. Even today, a large portion of the homeless population is considered to be mentally
ill (Figure 16.7). Statistics show that 26% of homeless adults living in shelters experience mental illness (U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD], 2011).
604 16 · Therapy and Treatment

       FIGURE 16.7 (a) Of the homeless individuals in U.S. shelters, about one-quarter have a severe mental illness (HUD,
       2011). (b) Correctional institutions also report a high number of individuals living with mental illness. (credit a:
       modification of work by "Carl Campbell"/Flickr; credit b: modification of work by Bart Everson)
       Mental health issues are also significant concerns regarding those involved in the corrections system.
       According to a 2006 special report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), approximately 705,600 adults with
       mental health issues were incarcerated in the state prison system, and another 78,800 were incarcerated in
       the federal prison system. A further 479,000 were in local jails. According to the study, "people with mental
       illnesses are overrepresented in probation and parole populations at estimated rates ranging from two to four
       times the general population" (Prins & Draper, 2009, p. 23). The correctional system faces increasing burdens
       in managing and supporting people with mental health issues (Torrey et al., 2014). The incarceration
       experience itself exacerbates existing issues, triggers disturbances, or leads to long term effects such as PTSD,
       depression, or other disorders. While incarcerated, people are often subjected to or witness violence or sexual
       assault, face isolation from family, and endure other physical or emotional traumas (Edgemon & Clay-Warner,
       2019).
       Today, instead of asylums, there are psychiatric hospitals run by state governments and local community
       hospitals focused on short-term care. In all types of hospitals, the emphasis is on short-term stays, with the
       average length of stay being less than two weeks and often only several days. This is partly due to the very high
       cost of psychiatric hospitalization, which can be about $800 to $1000 per night (Stensland, Watson, & Grazier,
       2012). Therefore, insurance coverage often limits the length of time a person can be hospitalized for
       treatment. Usually individuals are hospitalized only if they are an imminent threat to themselves or others.

       Most people who have mental illnesses are not hospitalized. If someone is feeling very depressed, complains of
       hearing voices, or feels anxious all the time, they might seek psychological treatment. A friend, spouse, or
       parent might refer someone for treatment. The individual might go see their primary care physician first and
       then be referred to a mental health practitioner.
       Some people seek treatment because they are involved with the state's child protective services--that is, their
       children have been removed from their care due to abuse or neglect. The parents might be referred to
       psychiatric or substance abuse facilities and the children would likely receive treatment for trauma. If the
       parents are interested in and capable of becoming better parents, the goal of treatment might be family
       reunification. For other children whose parents are unable to change--for example, the parent or parents who
       are heavily addicted to drugs and refuse to enter treatment--the goal of therapy might be to help the children
       adjust to foster care and/or adoption (Figure 16.8).

Some people seek therapy because the criminal justice system referred them or required them to go. For some
individuals, for example, attending weekly counseling sessions might be a condition of parole. If an individual
is mandated to attend therapy, they are seeking services involuntarily. Involuntary treatment refers to
therapy that is not the individual's choice. Other individuals might voluntarily seek treatment. Voluntary
treatment means the person chooses to attend therapy to obtain relief from symptoms.
Psychological treatment can occur in a variety of places. An individual might go to a community mental health
center or a practitioner in private or community practice. A child might see a school counselor, school
psychologist, or school social worker. An incarcerated person might receive group therapy in prison. There are
many different types of treatment providers, and licensing requirements vary from state to state. Besides
psychologists and psychiatrists, there are clinical social workers, marriage and family therapists, and trained
religious personnel who also perform counseling and therapy.
A range of funding sources pay for mental health treatment: health insurance, government, and private pay. In
the past, even when people had health insurance, the coverage would not always pay for mental health
services. This changed with the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008, which requires group
health plans and insurers to make sure there is parity of mental health services (U.S. Department of Labor,
n.d.). This means that co-pays, total number of visits, and deductibles for mental health and substance use
treatment need to be equal to and cannot be more restrictive or harsher than those for physical illnesses and
medical/surgical problems.
Finding treatment sources is also not always easy: there may be limited options, especially in rural areas and
low-income urban areas; waiting lists; poor quality of care available for indigent patients; and financial
obstacles such as co-pays, deductibles, and time off from work. Over 85% of the l,669 federally designated
mental health professional shortage areas are rural; often primary care physicians and law enforcement are
the first-line mental health providers (Ivey, Scheffler, & Zazzali, 1998), although they do not have the
specialized training of a mental health professional, who often would be better equipped to provide care.
Availability, accessibility, and acceptability (the stigma attached to mental illness) are all problems in rural
areas. Approximately two-thirds of those with symptoms receive no care at all (U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services, 2005; Wagenfeld, Murray, Mohatt, & DeBruiynb, 1994). At the end of 2013, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture announced an investment of $50 million to help improve access and treatment for
mental health problems as part of the Obama administration's effort to strengthen rural communities.

       One of the goals of therapy is to help a person stop repeating and reenacting destructive patterns and to start
       looking for better solutions to difficult situations. This goal is reflected in the following poem:

       Two types of therapy are psychotherapy and biomedical therapy. Both types of treatment help people with
       mental health issues, such as depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia. Psychotherapy is a psychological
       treatment that employs various methods to help someone overcome personal problems, or to attain personal
       growth. In modern practice, it has evolved into what is known as psychodynamic therapy, which will be
       discussed later. Biomedical therapy involves medication and/or medical procedures to treat psychological
       disorders. First, we will explore the various psychotherapeutic orientations outlined in Table 16.1 (many of
       these orientations were discussed in the Introduction chapter).

Psychotherapy Techniques: Psychoanalysis

Psychoanalysis was developed by Sigmund Freud and was the first form of psychotherapy. It was the dominant
therapeutic technique in the early 20th century, but it has since waned significantly in popularity. Freud
believed most of our psychological problems are the result of repressed impulses and trauma experienced in
childhood, and he believed psychoanalysis would help uncover long-buried feelings. In a psychoanalyst's
office, you might see a patient lying on a couch speaking of dreams or childhood memories, and the therapist
using various Freudian methods such as free association and dream analysis (Figure 16.9). In free
association, the patient relaxes and then says whatever comes to mind at the moment. However, Freud felt
that the ego would at times try to block, or repress, unacceptable urges or painful conflicts during free
association. Consequently, a patient would demonstrate resistance to recalling these thoughts or situations. In
dream analysis, a therapist interprets the underlying meaning of dreams.

Psychoanalysis is a therapy approach that typically takes years. Over the course of time, the patient reveals a
great deal about himself to the therapist. Freud suggested that during this patient-therapist relationship, the
patient comes to develop strong feelings for the therapist--maybe positive feelings, maybe negative feelings.
Freud called this transference: the patient transfers all the positive or negative emotions associated with the
patient's other relationships to the psychoanalyst. For example, Crystal is seeing a psychoanalyst. During the
years of therapy, she comes to see her therapist as a father figure. She transfers her feelings about her father
onto her therapist, perhaps in an effort to gain the love and attention she did not receive from her own father.

       the couch and to face away from Freud in order to feel less inhibited and to help them focus. Today, psychotherapy
       patients are not likely to lie on a couch; instead they are more likely to sit facing the therapist (Prochaska &
       Norcross, 2010). (credit: Robert Huffstutter)
       Today, Freud's psychoanalytical perspective has been expanded upon by the developments of subsequent
       theories and methodologies: the psychodynamic perspective. This approach to therapy remains centered on
       the role of people's internal drives and forces, but treatment is less intensive than Freud's original model.

      Psychotherapy: Play Therapy

       Play therapy is often used with children since they are not likely to sit on a couch and recall their dreams or
       engage in traditional talk therapy. This technique uses a therapeutic process of play to "help clients prevent or
       resolve psychosocial difficulties and achieve optimal growth" (O'Connor, 2000, p. 7). The idea is that children
       play out their hopes, fantasies, and traumas while using dolls, stuffed animals, and sandbox figurines (Figure
       16.10). Play therapy can also be used to help a therapist make a diagnosis. The therapist observes how the
       child interacts with toys (e.g., dolls, animals, and home settings) in an effort to understand the roots of the
       child's disturbed behavior. Play therapy can be nondirective or directive. In nondirective play therapy, children
       are encouraged to work through their problems by playing freely while the therapist observes (LeBlanc &
       Ritchie, 2001). In directive play therapy, the therapist provides more structure and guidance in the play
       session by suggesting topics, asking questions, and even playing with the child (Harter, 1977).

       FIGURE 16.10 This type of play therapy is known as sandplay or sandtray therapy. Children can set up a three-
       dimensional world using various figures and objects that correspond to their inner state (Kalff, 1991). (credit:

      Psychotherapy: Behavior Therapy

       In psychoanalysis, therapists help their patients look into their past to uncover repressed feelings. In
       behavior therapy, a therapist employs principles of learning to help clients change undesirable
       behaviors--rather than digging deeply into one's unconscious. Therapists with this orientation believe that

dysfunctional behaviors, like phobias and bedwetting, can be changed by teaching clients new, more
constructive behaviors. Behavior therapy employs both classical and operant conditioning techniques to
change behavior.

One type of behavior therapy utilizes classical conditioning techniques. Therapists using these techniques
believe that dysfunctional behaviors are conditioned responses. Applying the conditioning principles
developed by Ivan Pavlov, these therapists seek to recondition their clients and thus change their behavior.
Emmie is eight years old, and frequently wets her bed at night. She's been invited to several sleepovers, but she
won't go because of her problem. Using a type of conditioning therapy, Emmie begins to sleep on a liquid-
sensitive bed pad that is hooked to an alarm. When moisture touches the pad, it sets off the alarm, waking up
Emmie. When this process is repeated enough times, Emmie develops an association between urinary
relaxation and waking up, and this stops the bedwetting. Emmie has now gone three weeks without wetting her
bed and is looking forward to her first sleepover this weekend.

One commonly used classical conditioning therapeutic technique is counterconditioning: a client learns a
new response to a stimulus that has previously elicited an undesirable behavior. Two counterconditioning
techniques are aversive conditioning and exposure therapy. Aversive conditioning uses an unpleasant
stimulus to stop an undesirable behavior. Therapists apply this technique to eliminate addictive behaviors,
such as smoking, nail biting, and drinking. In aversion therapy, clients will typically engage in a specific
behavior (such as nail biting) and at the same time are exposed to something unpleasant, such as a mild
electric shock or a bad taste. After repeated associations between the unpleasant stimulus and the behavior,
the client can learn to stop the unwanted behavior.

Aversion therapy has been used effectively for years in the treatment of alcoholism (Davidson, 1974; Elkins,
1991; Streeton & Whelan, 2001). One common way this occurs is through a chemically based substance known
as Antabuse. When a person takes Antabuse and then consumes alcohol, uncomfortable side effects result
including nausea, vomiting, increased heart rate, heart palpitations, severe headache, and shortness of breath.
Antabuse is repeatedly paired with alcohol until the client associates alcohol with unpleasant feelings, which
decreases the client's desire to consume alcohol. Antabuse creates a conditioned aversion to alcohol because it
replaces the original pleasure response with an unpleasant one.

In exposure therapy, a therapist seeks to treat clients' fears or anxiety by presenting them with the object or
situation that causes their problem, with the idea that they will eventually get used to it. This can be done via
reality, imagination, or virtual reality. Exposure therapy was first reported in 1924 by Mary Cover Jones, who is
considered the mother of behavior therapy. Jones worked with a boy named Peter who was afraid of rabbits.
Her goal was to replace Peter's fear of rabbits with a conditioned response of relaxation, which is a response
that is incompatible with fear (Figure 16.11). How did she do it? Jones began by placing a caged rabbit on the
other side of a room with Peter while he ate his afternoon snack. Over the course of several days, Jones moved
the rabbit closer and closer to where Peter was seated with his snack. After two months of being exposed to the
rabbit while relaxing with his snack, Peter was able to hold the rabbit and pet it while eating (Jones, 1924).
610 16 · Therapy and Treatment

       FIGURE 16.11 Exposure therapy seeks to change the response to a conditioned stimulus (CS). An unconditioned
       stimulus is presented over and over just after the presentation of the conditioned stimulus. This figure shows
       conditioning as conducted in Mary Cover Jones' 1924 study.
       Thirty years later, Joseph Wolpe (1958) refined Jones's techniques, giving us systematic desensitization.
       Using this method, a person creates a hierarchy of anxiety, ranging from the least-anxiety-producing stimulus
       to the feared object. These activities are paired with relaxation techniques, which are taught to the client
       beforehand and used during the graduated exposures. The idea is that a person cannot be nervous and relaxed
       at the same time. Therefore, if they can learn to relax when they are facing environmental stimuli that make
       them nervous or fearful, they can eventually eliminate the unwanted fear response. (Figure 16.12).

For example, Jayden is terrified of elevators. Nothing bad has ever happened to him on an elevator, but he's so
afraid of elevators that he will always take the stairs. That wasn't a problem when Jayden worked on the second
floor of an office building, but now he has a new job--on the 29th floor of a skyscraper in downtown Los
Angeles. Jayden knows he can't climb 29 flights of stairs in order to get to work each day, so he decided to see a
behavior therapist for help. The therapist asks Jayden to first construct a hierarchy of elevator-related
situations that elicit fear and anxiety. They range from situations of mild anxiety such as being nervous around
the other people in the elevator, to the fear of getting an arm caught in the door, to panic-provoking situations
such as getting trapped or the cable snapping. Next, the therapist uses progressive relaxation. They teach
Jayden how to relax each of his muscle groups so that he achieves a drowsy, relaxed, and comfortable state of
mind. Once he's in this state, the therapist asks Jayden to imagine a mildly anxiety-provoking situation. Jayden
is standing in front of the elevator thinking about pressing the call button.
If this scenario causes Jayden anxiety, he lifts his finger. The therapist would then tell Jayden to forget the
scene and return to his relaxed state. They repeat this scenario over and over until Jayden can imagine himself
pressing the call button without anxiety. Over time the therapist and Jayden use progressive relaxation and
imagination to proceed through all of the situations on Jayden's hierarchy until he becomes desensitized to
each one. After this, Jayden and the therapist begin to practice what he only previously envisioned in therapy,
gradually going from pressing the button to actually riding an elevator. The goal is that Jayden will soon be able
to take the elevator all the way up to the 29th floor of his office without feeling any anxiety.
Sometimes, it's too impractical, expensive, or embarrassing to re-create anxiety- producing situations, so a
therapist might employ virtual reality exposure therapy by using a simulation to help conquer fears. Virtual
reality exposure therapy has been used effectively to treat numerous anxiety disorders such as the fear of
public speaking, claustrophobia (fear of enclosed spaces), aviophobia (fear of flying), and post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD), a trauma and stressor-related disorder (Gerardi, Cukor, Difede, Rizzo, & Rothbaum, 2010).

reduction in their symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression (Rizzo et al., 2010). Watch this Virtual Iraq video

Some behavior therapies employ operant conditioning. Recall what you learned about operant conditioning:
We have a tendency to repeat behaviors that are reinforced. What happens to behaviors that are not
reinforced? They become extinguished. These principles, defined by Skinner as operant conditioning, can be
612 16 · Therapy and Treatment

       applied to help people with a wide range of psychological problems.
       One popular operant conditioning intervention is called the token economy. This involves a controlled setting
       where individuals are reinforced for desirable behaviors with tokens, such as a poker chip, that can be
       exchanged for items or privileges. Token economies are often used in psychiatric hospitals to increase patient
       cooperation and activity levels. Patients are rewarded with tokens when they engage in positive behaviors (e.g.,
       making their beds, brushing their teeth, coming to the cafeteria on time, and socializing with other patients).
       They can later exchange the tokens for extra TV time, private rooms, visits to the canteen, and so on
       (Dickerson, Tenhula, & Green-Paden, 2005).

      Psychotherapy: Cognitive Therapy

       Cognitive therapy is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on how a person's thoughts lead to feelings of
       distress. The idea behind cognitive therapy is that how you think determines how you feel and act. Cognitive
       therapists help their clients change dysfunctional thoughts in order to relieve distress. They help a client see
       how they misinterpret a situation (cognitive distortion). For example, a client may overgeneralize. Because a
       person failed one test in Psychology 101, they feel stupid and worthless. These thoughts then cause their mood
       to worsen. Therapists also help clients recognize when they blow things out of proportion. Because Ray failed
       his Psychology 101 test, he has concluded that he's going to fail the entire course and probably flunk out of
       college altogether. These errors in thinking have contributed to Ray's feelings of distress. His therapist will help
       him challenge these irrational beliefs, focus on their illogical basis, and correct them with more logical and
       rational thoughts and beliefs.
       Cognitive therapy was developed by psychiatrist Aaron Beck in the 1960s. His initial focus was on depression
       and how a client's self-defeating attitude served to maintain a depression despite positive factors in her life
       (Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emery, 1979) (Figure 16.13). Through questioning, a cognitive therapist can help a client
       recognize dysfunctional ideas, challenge catastrophizing thoughts about themselves and their situations, and
       find a more positive way to view things (Beck, 2011).

       FIGURE 16.13 Your emotional reactions are the result of your thoughts about the situation rather than the situation
       itself. For instance, if you consistently interpret events and emotions around the themes of loss and defeat, then you
       are likely to be depressed. Through therapy, you can learn more logical ways to interpret situations.

      Psychotherapy: Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy

       Cognitive-behavioral therapists focus much more on present issues than on a patient's childhood or past, as in
       other forms of psychotherapy. One of the first forms of cognitive-behavioral therapy was rational emotive

therapy (RET), which was founded by Albert Ellis and grew out of his dislike of Freudian psychoanalysis
(Daniel, n.d.). Behaviorists such as Joseph Wolpe also influenced Ellis's therapeutic approach (National
Association of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapists, 2009).

Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) helps clients examine how their thoughts affect their behavior. It aims to
change cognitive distortions and self-defeating behaviors. In essence, this approach is designed to change the
way people think as well as how they act. It is similar to cognitive therapy in that CBT attempts to make
individuals aware of their irrational and negative thoughts and helps people replace them with new, more
positive ways of thinking. It is also similar to behavior therapies in that CBT teaches people how to practice and
engage in more positive and healthy approaches to daily situations. In total, hundreds of studies have shown
the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy in the treatment of numerous psychological disorders such
as depression, PTSD, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, bipolar disorder, and substance abuse (Beck Institute
for Cognitive Behavior Therapy, n.d.). For example, CBT has been found to be effective in decreasing levels of
hopelessness and suicidal thoughts in previously suicidal teenagers (Alavi, Sharifi, Ghanizadeh, & Dehbozorgi,
2013). Cognitive-behavioral therapy has also been effective in reducing PTSD in specific populations, such as
transit workers (Lowinger & Rombom, 2012).

Cognitive-behavioral therapy aims to change cognitive distortions and self-defeating behaviors using
techniques like the ABC model. With this model, there is an Action (sometimes called an activating event), the
Belief about the event, and the Consequences of this belief. Let's say Jon and Joe both go to a party. Jon and Joe
each have met an interesting person at the party and spend a few hours chatting with them. At the end of the
party, Jon and Joe ask to exchange phone numbers with the person they've been talking to, and the request is
refused. Both Jon and Joe are surprised, as they thought things were going well. What can Jon and Joe tell
themselves about why the person was not interested? Let's say Jon tells himself he is a loser, or is ugly, or "has
no game." Jon then gets depressed and decides not to go to another party, which starts a cycle that keeps him
depressed. Joe tells himself that he had bad breath, goes out and buys a new toothbrush, goes to another party,
and meets someone new.

Jon's belief about what happened results in a consequence of further depression, whereas Joe's belief does not.
Jon is internalizing the attribution or reason for the rebuffs, which triggers his depression. On the other hand,
Joe is externalizing the cause, so his thinking does not contribute to feelings of depression. Cognitive-
behavioral therapy examines specific maladaptive and automatic thoughts and cognitive distortions. Some
examples of cognitive distortions are all-or-nothing thinking, overgeneralization, and jumping to conclusions.
In overgeneralization, someone takes a small situation and makes it huge--for example, instead of saying,
"This particular person was not interested in me," the man says, "I am ugly, a loser, and no one is ever going to
be interested in me."

All or nothing thinking, which is a common type of cognitive distortion for people suffering from depression,
reflects extremes. In other words, everything is black or white. After being turned down for a date, Jon begins
to think, "No woman will ever go out with me. I'm going to be alone forever." He begins to feel anxious and sad
as he contemplates his future.

The third kind of distortion involves jumping to conclusions--assuming that people are thinking negatively
about you or reacting negatively to you, even though there is no evidence. Consider the example of Savannah
and Hillaire, who recently met at a party. They have a lot in common, and Savannah thinks they could become
friends. She calls Hillaire to invite her for coffee. Since Hillaire doesn't answer, Savannah leaves her a message.
Several days go by and Savannah never hears back from her potential new friend. Maybe Hillaire never
received the message because she lost her phone or she is too busy to return the phone call. But if Savannah
believes that Hillaire didn't like Savannah or didn't want to be her friend, she is demonstrating the cognitive
distortion of jumping to conclusions.

How effective is CBT? One client said this about his cognitive-behavioral therapy:
614 16 · Therapy and Treatment

             I have had many painful episodes of depression in my life, and this has had a negative effect on my
             career and has put considerable strain on my friends and family. The treatments I have received, such
             as taking antidepressants and psychodynamic counseling, have helped [me] to cope with the
             symptoms and to get some insights into the roots of my problems. CBT has been by far the most useful
             approach I have found in tackling these mood problems. It has raised my awareness of how my
             thoughts impact on my moods. How the way I think about myself, about others and about the world
             can lead me into depression. It is a practical approach, which does not dwell so much on childhood
             experiences, whilst acknowledging that it was then that these patterns were learned. It looks at what is
             happening now, and gives tools to manage these moods on a daily basis. (Martin, 2007, n.p.)

      Psychotherapy: Humanistic Therapy

       Humanistic psychology focuses on helping people achieve their potential. So it makes sense that the goal of
       humanistic therapy is to help people become more self-aware and accepting of themselves. In contrast to
       psychoanalysis, humanistic therapists focus on conscious rather than unconscious thoughts. They also
       emphasize the patient's present and future, as opposed to exploring the patient's past.

       Psychologist Carl Rogers developed a therapeutic orientation known as Rogerian, or client-centered therapy.
       Note the change from patients to clients. Rogers (1951) felt that the term patient suggested the person seeking
       help was sick and looking for a cure. Since this is a form of nondirective therapy, a therapeutic approach in
       which the therapist does not give advice or provide interpretations but helps the person to identify conflicts
       and understand feelings, Rogers (1951) emphasized the importance of the person taking control of his own life
       to overcome life's challenges.

       In client-centered therapy, the therapist uses the technique of active listening. In active listening, the therapist
       acknowledges, restates, and clarifies what the client expresses. Therapists also practice what Rogers called
       unconditional positive regard, which involves not judging clients and simply accepting them for who they
       are. Rogers (1951) also felt that therapists should demonstrate genuineness, empathy, and acceptance toward
       their clients because this helps people become more accepting of themselves, which results in personal
       growth.

      Evaluating Various Forms of Psychotherapy

       How can we assess the effectiveness of psychotherapy? Is one technique more effective than another? For
       anyone considering therapy, these are important questions. According to the American Psychological
       Association, three factors work together to produce successful treatment. The first is the use of evidence-based
       treatment that is deemed appropriate for your particular issue. The second important factor is the clinical
       expertise of the psychologist or therapist. The third factor is your own characteristics, values, preferences, and
       culture. Many people begin psychotherapy feeling like their problem will never be resolved; however,
       psychotherapy helps people see that they can do things to make their situation better. Psychotherapy can help
       reduce a person's anxiety, depression, and maladaptive behaviors. Through psychotherapy, individuals can
       learn to engage in healthy behaviors designed to help them better express emotions, improve relationships,
       think more positively, and perform more effectively at work or school.

       Many studies have explored the effectiveness of psychotherapy. For example, one large-scale study that
       examined 16 meta-analyses of CBT reported that it was equally effective or more effective than other therapies
       in treating PTSD, generalized anxiety disorder, depression, and social phobia (Butlera, Chapmanb, Formanc, &
       Becka, 2006). Another study found that CBT was as effective at treating depression (43% success rate) as
       prescription medication (50% success rate) compared to the placebo rate of 25% (DeRubeis et al., 2005).
       Another meta-analysis found that psychodynamic therapy was also as effective at treating these types of
       psychological issues as CBT (Shedler, 2010). However, no studies have found one psychotherapeutic approach
       more effective than another (Abbass, Kisely, & Kroenke, 2006; Chorpita et al., 2011), nor have they shown any
       relationship between a client's treatment outcome and the level of the clinician's training or experience

(Wampold, 2007). Regardless of which type of psychotherapy an individual chooses, one critical factor that
determines the success of treatment is the person's relationship with the psychologist or therapist.

Biomedical Therapies

Individuals can be prescribed biologically based treatments or psychotropic medications that are used to treat
mental disorders. While these are often used in combination with psychotherapy, they also are taken by
individuals not in therapy. This is known as biomedical therapy. Medications used to treat psychological
disorders are called psychotropic medications and are prescribed by medical doctors, including psychiatrists.
In Louisiana and New Mexico, psychologists are able to prescribe some types of these medications (American
Psychological Association, 2014).

Different types and classes of medications are prescribed for different disorders. An individual with
depression might be given an antidepressant, an individual with bipolar disorder might be given a mood
stabilizer, and an individual with schizophrenia might be given an antipsychotic. These medications treat the
symptoms of a psychological disorder by altering the levels or effects of neurotransmitters. For example, each
type of antidepressant affects a different neurotransmitter, such as SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitor) antidepressants that increase the level of the neurotransmitter serotonin, and SNRI (serotonin-
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) antidepressants that increase the levels of both serotonin and
norepinephrine. They can help people feel better so that they can function on a daily basis, but they do not cure
the disorder. Some people may only need to take a psychotropic medication for a short period of time. Others
with severe disorders like bipolar disorder or schizophrenia may need to take psychotropic medication for a
long time.

Psychotropic medications are a popular treatment option for many types of disorders, and research suggests
that they are most effective when combined with psychotherapy. This is especially true for the most common
mental disorders, such as depressive and anxiety disorders (Cuijpers et al, 2014). When considering adding
medication as a treatment option, individuals should know that some psychotropic medications have very
concerning side effects. Table 16.2 shows the commonly prescribed types of medications, how they are used,
and some of the potential side effects that may occur.

Another biologically based treatment that continues to be used, although infrequently, is electroconvulsive
therapy (ECT) (formerly known by its unscientific name as electroshock therapy). It involves using an
electrical current to induce seizures to help alleviate the effects of severe depression. The exact mechanism is
unknown, although it does help alleviate symptoms for people with severe depression who have not responded
to traditional drug therapy (Pagnin, de Queiroz, Pini, & Cassano, 2004). About 85% of people treated with ECT
improve (Reti, n.d.). However, the memory loss associated with repeated administrations has led to it being
implemented as a last resort (Donahue, 2000; Prudic, Peyser, & Sackeim, 2000). A more recent alternative is

transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a procedure approved by the FDA in 2008 that uses magnetic fields
to stimulate nerve cells in the brain to improve depression symptoms; it is used when other treatments have
not worked (Mayo Clinic, 2012).

 Evidence-based Practice

  A buzzword in therapy today is evidence-based practice. However, it's not a novel concept but one that has been
  used in medicine for at least two decades. Evidence-based practice is used to reduce errors in treatment
  selection by making clinical decisions based on research (Sackett & Rosenberg, 1995). In any case, evidence-
  based treatment is on the rise in the field of psychology. So what is it, and why does it matter? In an effort to
  determine which treatment methodologies are evidenced-based, professional organizations such as the
  American Psychological Association (APA) have recommended that specific psychological treatments be used to
  treat certain psychological disorders (Chambless & Ollendick, 2001). According to the APA (2005), "Evidence-
  based practice in psychology (EBPP) is the integration of the best available research with clinical expertise in the
  context of patient characteristics, culture, and preferences" (p. 1).

  The foundational idea behind evidence based treatment is that best practices are determined by research
  evidence that has been compiled by comparing various forms of treatment (Charman & Barkham, 2005). These
  treatments are then operationalized and placed in treatment manuals--trained therapists follow these manuals.
  The benefits are that evidence-based treatment can reduce variability between therapists to ensure that a
  specific approach is delivered with integrity (Charman & Barkham, 2005). Therefore, clients have a higher chance
  of receiving therapeutic interventions that are effective at treating their specific disorder. While EBPP is based on
  randomized control trials, critics of EBPP reject it stating that the results of trials cannot be applied to individuals
  and instead determinations regarding treatment should be based on a therapist's judgment (Mullen & Streiner,
  2004).

16.3 Treatment Modalities

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Distinguish between the various modalities of treatment
  · Discuss benefits of group therapy

Once a person seeks treatment, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, they have an intake done to assess their
clinical needs. An intake is the therapist's first meeting with the client. The therapist gathers specific
information to address the client's immediate needs, such as the presenting problem, the client's support
system, and insurance status. The therapist informs the client about confidentiality, fees, and what to expect in
treatment. Confidentiality means the therapist cannot disclose confidential communications to any third
party unless mandated or permitted by law to do so. During the intake, the therapist and client will work
together to discuss treatment goals. Then a treatment plan will be formulated, usually with specific
measurable objectives. Also, the therapist and client will discuss how treatment success will be measured and
the estimated length of treatment. There are several different modalities of treatment (Figure 16.14):
Individual therapy, family therapy, couples therapy, and group therapy are the most common.

      Individual Therapy

       In individual therapy, also known as individual psychotherapy or individual counseling, the client and
       clinician meet one-on-one (usually from 45 minutes to 1 hour). These meetings typically occur weekly or every
       other week, and sessions are conducted in a confidential and caring environment (Figure 16.15). The clinician
       will work with clients to help them explore their feelings, work through life challenges, identify aspects of
       themselves and their lives that they wish to change, and set goals to help them work towards these changes. A
       client might see a clinician for only a few sessions, or the client may attend individual therapy sessions for a
       year or longer. The amount of time spent in therapy depends on the needs of the client as well as her personal
       goals.

       FIGURE 16.15 In an individual therapy session, a client works one-on-one with a trained therapist. (credit: Alan
       Cleaver)

      Group Therapy

       In group therapy, a clinician meets together with several clients with similar problems (Figure 16.16). When
       children are placed in group therapy, it is particularly important to match clients for age and problems. One
       benefit of group therapy is that it can help decrease a client's shame and isolation about a problem while
       offering needed support, both from the therapist and other members of the group (American Psychological
       Association, 2014). A nine-year-old sexual abuse victim, for example, may feel very embarrassed and
       ashamed. If he is placed in a group with other sexually abused boys, he will realize that he is not alone. A child
       struggling with poor social skills would likely benefit from a group with a specific curriculum to foster special

skills. A woman suffering from post-partum depression could feel less guilty and more supported by being in a
group with similar women.
Group therapy also has some specific limitations. Members of the group may be afraid to speak in front of
other people because sharing secrets and problems with complete strangers can be stressful and
overwhelming. There may be personality clashes and arguments among group members. There could also be
concerns about confidentiality: Someone from the group might share what another participant said to people
outside of the group.

FIGURE 16.16 In group therapy, usually 5-10 people meet with a trained therapist to discuss a common issue such
as divorce, grief, an eating disorder, substance abuse, or anger management. (credit: Cory Zanker)
Another benefit of group therapy is that members can confront each other about their patterns. For those with
some types of problems, such as sexual abusers, group therapy is the recommended treatment. Group
treatment for this population is considered to have several benefits:

      Group treatment is more economical than individual, couples, or family therapy. Sexual abusers often
      feel more comfortable admitting and discussing their offenses in a treatment group where others are
      modeling openness. Clients often accept feedback about their behavior more willingly from other
      group members than from therapists. Finally, clients can practice social skills in group treatment
      settings. (McGrath, Cumming, Burchard, Zeoli, & Ellerby, 2009)
Groups that have a strong educational component are called psycho-educational groups. For example, a group
for children whose parents have cancer might discuss in depth what cancer is, types of treatment for cancer,
and the side effects of treatments, such as hair loss. Often, group therapy sessions with children take place in
school. They are led by a school counselor, a school psychologist, or a school social worker. Groups might focus
on test anxiety, social isolation, self-esteem, bullying, or school failure (Shechtman, 2002). Whether the group
is held in school or in a clinician's office, group therapy has been found to be effective with children facing
numerous kinds of challenges (Shechtman, 2002).
During a group session, the entire group could reflect on an individual's problem or difficulties, and others
might disclose what they have done in that situation. When a clinician is facilitating a group, the focus is
always on making sure that everyone benefits and participates in the group and that no one person is the focus
of the entire session. Groups can be organized in various ways: some have an overarching theme or purpose,
some are time-limited, some have open membership that allows people to come and go, and some are closed.
Some groups are structured with planned activities and goals, while others are unstructured: There is no
specific plan, and group members themselves decide how the group will spend its time and on what goals it
will focus. This can become a complex and emotionally charged process, but it is also an opportunity for
personal growth (Page & Berkow, 1994).
620 16 · Therapy and Treatment

      Couples Therapy

       Couples therapy involves two people in an intimate relationship who are having difficulties and are trying to
       resolve them (Figure 16.17). The couple may be dating, partnered, engaged, or married. The primary
       therapeutic orientation used in couples counseling is cognitive-behavioral therapy (Rathus & Sanderson,
       1999). Couples meet with a therapist to discuss conflicts and/or aspects of their relationship that they want to
       change. The therapist helps them see how their individual backgrounds, beliefs, and actions are affecting their
       relationship. Often, a therapist tries to help the couple resolve these problems, as well as implement strategies
       that will lead to a healthier and happier relationship, such as how to listen, how to argue, and how to express
       feelings. However, sometimes, after working with a therapist, a couple will realize that they are too
       incompatible and will decide to separate. Some couples seek therapy to work out their problems, while others
       attend therapy to determine whether staying together is the best solution. Counseling couples in a high-
       conflict and volatile relationship can be difficult. In fact, psychologists Peter Pearson and Ellyn Bader, who
       founded the Couples Institute in Palo Alto, California, have compared the experience of the clinician in
       couples' therapy to be like "piloting a helicopter in a hurricane" (Weil, 2012, para. 7).

           FIGURE 16.17 In couples counseling, a therapist helps people work on their relationship. (credit: Cory Zanker)

      Family Therapy

       Family therapy is a special form of group therapy, consisting of one or more families. Although there are many
       theoretical orientations in family therapy, one of the most predominant is the systems approach. The family is
       viewed as an organized system, and each individual within the family is a contributing member who creates
       and maintains processes within the system that shape behavior (Minuchin, 1985). Each member of the family
       influences and is influenced by the others. The goal of this approach is to enhance the growth of each family
       member as well as that of the family as a whole.
       Often, dysfunctional patterns of communication that develop between family members can lead to conflict. A
       family with this dynamic might wish to attend therapy together rather than individually. In many cases, one
       member of the family has problems that detrimentally affect everyone. For example, a mother's depression,
       teen daughter's eating disorder, or father's alcohol dependence could affect all members of the family. The
       therapist would work with all members of the family to help them cope with the issue, and to encourage
       resolution and growth in the case of the individual family member with the problem.
       With family therapy, the nuclear family (i.e., parents and children) or the nuclear family plus whoever lives in
       the household (e.g., grandparent) come into treatment. Family therapists work with the whole family unit to
       heal the family. There are several different types of family therapy. In structural family therapy, the therapist

examines and discusses the boundaries and structure of the family: who makes the rules, who sleeps in the
bed with whom, how decisions are made, and what are the boundaries within the family. In some families, the
parents do not work together to make rules, or one parent may undermine the other, leading the children to act
out. The therapist helps them resolve these issues and learn to communicate more effectively.

     LINK TO LEARNING

Watch this video of a structural family session (http://openstax.org/l/Sfamily) to learn more.

In strategic family therapy, the goal is to address specific problems within the family that can be dealt with in
a relatively short amount of time. Typically, the therapist would guide what happens in the therapy session and
design a detailed approach to resolving each member's problem (Madanes, 1991).

16.4 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders: A Special Case

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Recognize the goal of substance-related and addictive disorders treatment
  · Discuss what makes for effective treatment
  · Describe how comorbid disorders are treated
Addiction is often viewed as a chronic disease (Figure 16.18). The choice to use a substance is initially
voluntary; however, because chronic substance use can permanently alter the neural structure in the
prefrontal cortex, an area of the brain associated with decision-making and judgment, a person becomes
driven to use drugs and/or alcohol (Muñoz-Cuevas, Athilingam, Piscopo, & Wilbrecht, 2013). This helps explain
why relapse rates tend to be high. About 40%-60% of individuals relapse, which means they return to abusing
drugs and/or alcohol after a period of improvement (National Institute on Drug Abuse [NIDA], 2008).

FIGURE 16.18 The National Survey on Drug Use and Health shows trends in prevalence of various drugs for ages
12-17, 18-25, and 26 or older.
The goal of substance-related treatment is to help a person with an addiction stop compulsive drug-seeking
behaviors (NIDA, 2012). This means a person with addiction will need long-term treatment, similar to a person
battling a chronic physical disease such as hypertension or diabetes. Treatment usually includes behavioral
therapy and/or medication, depending on the individual (NIDA, 2012). Specialized therapies have also been
622 16 · Therapy and Treatment

       developed for specific types of substance-related disorders, including alcohol, cocaine, and opioids (McGovern
       & Carroll, 2003). Substance-related treatment is considered much more cost-effective than incarceration or
       not treating those with addictions (NIDA, 2012) (Figure 16.19).

       FIGURE 16.19 Substance use and abuse costs the United States over $600 billion a year (NIDA, 2012). This person
       with addiction is using heroin. (credit: "jellymc - urbansnaps"/Flickr)

      What Makes Treatment Effective?

       Specific factors make substance-related treatment much more effective. One factor is duration of treatment.
       Generally, a person with addict needs to be in treatment for at least three months to achieve a positive
       outcome (Simpson, 1981; Simpson, Joe, & Bracy, 1982; NIDA, 2012). This is due to the psychological,
       physiological, behavioral, and social aspects of abuse (Simpson, 1981; Simpson et al., 1982; NIDA, 2012).
       While in treatment, a person with addiction might receive behavior therapy, which can help motivate the
       person with addiction to participate in the treatment program and teach strategies for dealing with cravings
       and how to prevent relapse. Also, treatment needs to be holistic and address multiple needs, not just the drug
       addiction. This means that treatment will address factors such as communication, stress management,
       relationship issues, parenting, vocational concerns, and legal concerns (McGovern & Carroll, 2003; NIDA,
       2012).
       While individual therapy is used in the treatment of substance-related disorders, group therapy is the most
       widespread treatment modality (Weiss, Jaffee, de Menil, & Cogley, 2004). The rationale behind using group
       therapy for addiction treatment is that people with addiction are much more likely to maintain sobriety in a
       group format. It has been suggested that this is due to the rewarding and therapeutic benefits of the group,
       such as support, affiliation, identification, and even confrontation (Center for Substance Abuse Treatment,
       2005). For teenagers, the whole family often needs to participate in treatment to address issues such as family
       dynamics, communication, and relapse prevention. Family involvement in teen drug addiction is vital.
       Research suggests that greater parental involvement is correlated with a greater reduction in use by teen
       substance abusers. Also, mothers who participated in treatment displayed better mental health and greater
       warmth toward their children (Bertrand et al., 2013). However, neither individual nor group therapy has been
       found to be more effective (Weiss et al., 2004). Regardless of the type of treatment service, the primary focus is
       on abstinence or at the very least a significant reduction in use (McGovern & Carroll, 2003).
       Treatment also usually involves medications to detox a person with addiction safely after an overdose, to
       prevent seizures and agitation that often occur in detox, to prevent reuse of the drug, and to manage
       withdrawal symptoms. Getting off drugs often involves the use of drugs--some of which can be just as
       addictive. Detox can be difficult and dangerous.

Comorbid Disorders

Frequently, a person with an addiction to drugs and/or alcohol has an additional psychological disorder. Saying
a person has comorbid disorders means the individual has two or more diagnoses. This can often be a
substance-related diagnosis and another psychiatric diagnosis, such as depression, bipolar disorder, or
schizophrenia. These individuals fall into the category of mentally ill and chemically addicted (MICA)--their
problems are often chronic and expensive to treat, with limited success. Compared with the overall population,
people who use illicit drugs or misuse prescription drugs are twice as likely to have a mood or anxiety disorder.
Drug use can cause symptoms of mood and anxiety disorders and the reverse is also true--people with
debilitating symptoms of a psychiatric disorder may self-medicate and misuse substances.

In cases of comorbidity, the best treatment is thought to address both (or multiple) disorders simultaneously
(NIDA, 2012). Behavior therapies are used to treat comorbid conditions, and in many cases, psychotropic
medications are used along with psychotherapy. For example, evidence suggests that bupropion (trade names:
Wellbutrin and Zyban), approved for treating depression and nicotine dependence, might also help reduce
craving and use of the drug methamphetamine (NIDA, 2011). However, more research is needed to better
understand how these medications work--particularly when combined in patients with comorbidities.

16.5 The Sociocultural Model and Therapy Utilization

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Explain how the sociocultural model is used in therapy
  · Discuss barriers to mental health services among ethnic minorities

The sociocultural perspective looks at you, your behaviors, and your symptoms in the context of your culture
and background. For example, José is an 18-year-old Hispanic male from a traditional family. José comes to
treatment because of depression. During the intake session, he reveals that he is gay and is nervous about
telling his family. He also discloses that he is concerned because his religious background has taught him that
being gay is wrong. How does his religious and cultural background affect him? How might his cultural
background affect how his family reacts if José were to tell them he is gay?

Mental health professionals must develop cultural competence (Figure 16.20), which means they must
understand and address issues of race, culture, and ethnicity. They must also develop strategies to effectively
address the needs of various populations for which Eurocentric therapies have limited application (Sue, 2004).
For example, a counselor whose treatment focuses on individual decision making may be ineffective at helping
a Chinese client with a collectivist approach to problem solving (Sue, 2004).

Multicultural counseling and therapy aims to offer both a helping role and process that uses modalities and
defines goals consistent with the life experiences and cultural values of clients. It strives to recognize client
identities to include individual, group, and universal dimensions, advocate the use of universal and culture-
specific strategies and roles in the healing process, and balances the importance of individualism and
collectivism in the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of client and client systems (Sue, 2001).

This therapeutic perspective integrates the impact of cultural and social norms, starting at the beginning of
treatment. Therapists who use this perspective work with clients to obtain and integrate information about
their cultural patterns into a unique treatment approach based on their particular situation (Stewart,
Simmons, & Habibpour, 2012). Sociocultural therapy can include individual, group, family, and couples
treatment modalities.

      Barriers to Treatment

       Statistically, ethnic minorities tend to utilize mental health services less frequently than White, middle-class
       Americans (Alegría et al., 2008; Richman, Kohn-Wood, & Williams, 2007). Why is this so? Perhaps the reason
       has to do with access and availability of mental health services. Ethnic minorities and individuals of low
       socioeconomic status (SES) report that barriers to services include lack of insurance, transportation, and time
       (Thomas & Snowden, 2002). However, researchers have found that even when income levels and insurance
       variables are taken into account, ethnic minorities are far less likely to seek out and utilize mental health
       services. And when access to mental health services is comparable across ethnic and racial groups, differences
       in service utilization remain (Richman et al., 2007).
       In a study involving thousands of women, it was found that the prevalence rate of anorexia was similar across
       different races, but that bulimia nervosa was more prevalent among Hispanic and African American women
       when compared with non-Hispanic White people (Marques et al., 2011). Although they have similar or higher
       rates of eating disorders, Hispanic and African American women with these disorders tend to seek and engage
       in treatment far less than White women. These findings suggest ethnic disparities in access to care, as well as
       clinical and referral practices that may prevent Hispanic and African American women from receiving care,
       which could include lack of bilingual treatment, stigma, fear of not being understood, family privacy, and lack
       of education about eating disorders.
       Perceptions and attitudes toward mental health services may also contribute to this imbalance. A recent study
       at King's College, London, found many complex reasons why people do not seek treatment: self-sufficiency and
       not seeing the need for help, not seeing therapy as effective, concerns about confidentiality, and the many
       effects of stigma and shame (Clement et al., 2014). And in another study, African Americans exhibiting
       depression were less willing to seek treatment due to fear of possible psychiatric hospitalization as well as fear
       of the treatment itself (Sussman, Robins, & Earls, 1987). Instead of mental health treatment, many African
       Americans prefer to be self-reliant or use spiritual practices (Snowden, 2001; Belgrave & Allison, 2010). For
       example, it has been found that the Black church plays a significant role as an alternative to mental health

services by providing prevention and treatment-type programs designed to enhance the psychological and
physical well-being of its members (Blank, Mahmood, Fox, & Guterbock, 2002).

Additionally, people belonging to ethnic groups that already report concerns about prejudice and
discrimination are less likely to seek services for a mental illness because they view it as an additional stigma
(Gary, 2005; Townes, Cunningham, & Chavez-Korell, 2009; Scott, McCoy, Munson, Snowden, & McMillen,
2011). For example, in one recent study of 462 older Korean Americans (over the age of 60) many participants
reported suffering from depressive symptoms. However, 71% indicated they thought depression was a sign of
personal weakness, and 14% reported that having a mentally ill family member would bring shame to the
family (Jang, Chiriboga, & Okazaki, 2009).

Language differences are a further barrier to treatment. In the previous study on Korean Americans' attitudes
toward mental health services, it was found that there were no Korean-speaking mental health professionals
where the study was conducted (Orlando and Tampa, Florida) (Jang et al., 2009). Because of the growing
number of people from ethnically diverse backgrounds, there is a need for therapists and psychologists to
develop knowledge and skills to become culturally competent (Ahmed, Wilson, Henriksen, & Jones, 2011).
Those providing therapy must approach the process from the context of the unique culture of each client (Sue
& Sue, 2007).

                                                                                                             DIG DEEPER

 Supporting Mental Health Treatment

  In the United States, about one in six children and one in five adults experiences a mental health disorder, but
  fewer than half of these people receive professional support for their disorder (Whitney & Peterson, 2019).
  Access to qualified mental health professionals is not universal or equitable, but it has improved to the point that
  more people could receive help if they sought it. Why then, do so many people go without support, therapy, or
  treatment?

  It seems that the public has a negative perception of people with mental health disorders. According to
  researchers from Indiana University, the University of Virginia, and Columbia University, interviews with over
  1,300 U.S. adults show that they believe children with depression are prone to violence and that if a child
  receives treatment for a psychological disorder, then that child is more likely to be rejected by peers at school.

  Bernice Pescosolido, author of the study, asserts that this is a misconception. And it is not limited to perceptions
  of mental health issues in children: adults living with mental health issues may face even more scrutiny when
  sharing their condition or seeking support. Stigmatization of psychological disorders is one of the main reasons
  why people do not get the help they need when they are having difficulties. Pescosolido and her colleagues
  caution that this stigma surrounding mental illness, based on misconceptions rather than facts, can be
  devastating to emotional and social well-being.

  Fortunately, we are starting to see discussions related to the destigmatization of mental illness and an increase
  in public education and awareness. Dozens of leaders have contributed to the conversation, including athletes
  like Naomi Osaka, Simone Biles, Michael Phelps, Kevin Love, and Dak Prescott, as well as artists such as Adele,
  Bruce Springsteen, Ariana Grande, Big Sean, and Bebe Rexha. Mental health awareness is stronger within
  workplaces, educational settings, and communities overall. However, stigma remains, particularly regarding
  mental health issues that are frequently misunderstood.

  The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) outlines key considerations regarding support, sensitivity, and
  compassion regarding mental health:

    · Talk and listen openly about mental health: if you are confident and comfortable sharing your own mental
        health story, you may help someone else. Likewise, if you are comfortable learning about someone's
626 16 · Therapy and Treatment

               experience, they may appreciate a friendly and supportive ear.
           · Avoid assumptions, generalizations, or judgments: people experience mental health differently, even if they

               have the same symptoms or diagnosis as another person. Although you may have the best intentions, it is
               usually not helpful to act as if you know how they feel or know how they should handle their condition.
           · Be conscious of language: using appropriate language creates a more welcoming and comfortable
               environment and reduces bias. Avoid language that stigmatizes, blames, or discourages people based on
               their or their family member's mental health.
           · Encourage equality regarding mental and physical illness, so that people recognize the necessity of
               addressing and treating both.
           · Encourage people to get help if they need it: first steps can include speaking to a doctor or counselor, or
               attending a support group meeting.
         Managing mental health and addressing mental illness can be extremely challenging and painful, and may
         sometimes seem futile and confusing. As we mention above, a significant number of people have experienced
         mental health problems, and it is in all of our interests to improve wellbeing. With greater awareness and
         understanding, we will increase their capacity for better health and recovery, creating more productive and
         supportive communities, families, and relationships.
         Join the effort by encouraging and supporting those around you to seek help if they need it. To learn more, visit

Summary

16.1 Mental Health Treatment: Past and Present

It was once believed that people with psychological disorders, or those exhibiting strange behavior, were
possessed by demons. These people were forced to take part in exorcisms, were imprisoned, or executed.
Later, asylums were built to house the mentally ill, but the patients received little to no treatment, and many of
the methods used were cruel. Philippe Pinel and Dorothea Dix argued for more humane treatment of people
with psychological disorders. In the mid-1960s, the deinstitutionalization movement gained support and
asylums were closed, enabling people with mental illness to return home and receive treatment in their own
communities. Some did go to their family homes, but many became homeless due to a lack of resources and
support mechanisms.

Today, instead of asylums, there are psychiatric hospitals run by state governments and local community
hospitals, with the emphasis on short-term stays. However, most people who have mental illness are not
hospitalized. A person suffering symptoms could speak with a primary care physician, who most likely would
refer him to someone who specializes in therapy. The person can receive outpatient mental health services
from a variety of sources, including psychologists, psychiatrists, marriage and family therapists, school
counselors, clinical social workers, and religious personnel. These therapy sessions would be covered through
insurance, government funds, or private (self) pay.

16.2 Types of Treatment

Psychoanalysis was developed by Sigmund Freud. Freud's theory is that a person's psychological problems are
the result of repressed impulses or childhood trauma. The goal of the therapist is to help a person uncover
buried feelings by using techniques such as free association and dream analysis.

Play therapy is a psychodynamic therapy technique often used with children. The idea is that children play out
their hopes, fantasies, and traumas, using dolls, stuffed animals, and sandbox figurines.

In behavior therapy, a therapist employs principles of learning from classical and operant conditioning to help
clients change undesirable behaviors. Counterconditioning is a commonly used therapeutic technique in

which a client learns a new response to a stimulus that has previously elicited an undesirable behavior via
classical conditioning. Principles of operant conditioning can be applied to help people deal with a wide range
of psychological problems. Token economy is an example of a popular operant conditioning technique.

Cognitive therapy is a technique that focuses on how thoughts lead to feelings of distress. The idea behind
cognitive therapy is that how you think determines how you feel and act. Cognitive therapists help clients
change dysfunctional thoughts in order to relieve distress. Cognitive-behavioral therapy explores how our
thoughts affect our behavior. Cognitive-behavioral therapy aims to change cognitive distortions and self-
defeating behaviors.

Humanistic therapy focuses on helping people achieve their potential. One form of humanistic therapy
developed by Carl Rogers is known as client-centered or Rogerian therapy. Client-centered therapists use the
techniques of active listening, unconditional positive regard, genuineness, and empathy to help clients
become more accepting of themselves.

Often in combination with psychotherapy, people can be prescribed biologically based treatments such as
psychotropic medications and/or other medical procedures such as electro-convulsive therapy.

16.3 Treatment Modalities

There are several modalities of treatment: individual therapy, group therapy, couples therapy, and family
therapy are the most common. In an individual therapy session, a client works one-on-one with a trained
therapist. In group therapy, usually 5-10 people meet with a trained group therapist to discuss a common
issue (e.g., divorce, grief, eating disorders, substance abuse, or anger management). Couples therapy involves
two people in an intimate relationship who are having difficulties and are trying to resolve them. The couple
may be dating, partnered, engaged, or married. The therapist helps them resolve their problems as well as
implement strategies that will lead to a healthier and happier relationship. Family therapy is a special form of
group therapy. The therapy group is made up of one or more families. The goal of this approach is to enhance
the growth of each individual family member and the family as a whole.

16.4 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders: A Special Case

Addiction is often viewed as a chronic disease that rewires the brain. This helps explain why relapse rates tend
to be high, around 40%-60% (McLellan, Lewis, & O'Brien, & Kleber, 2000). The goal of treatment is to help an
addict stop compulsive drug-seeking behaviors. Treatment usually includes behavioral therapy, which can
take place individually or in a group setting. Treatment may also include medication. Sometimes a person has
comorbid disorders, which usually means that they have a substance-related disorder diagnosis and another
psychiatric diagnosis, such as depression, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia. The best treatment would
address both problems simultaneously.

16.5 The Sociocultural Model and Therapy Utilization

The sociocultural perspective looks at you, your behaviors, and your symptoms in the context of your culture
and background. Clinicians using this approach integrate cultural and religious beliefs into the therapeutic
process. Research has shown that ethnic minorities are less likely to access mental health services than their
White middle-class American counterparts. Barriers to treatment include lack of insurance, transportation,
and time; cultural views that mental illness is a stigma; fears about treatment; and language barriers.
Supporting mental health treatment involves speaking and listening openly about mental health, avoiding
assumptions, being conscious about language, and encouraging others to get help when needed.

17. Imagine that you are a psychiatrist. Your patient, Pat, comes to you with the following symptoms: anxiety
      and feelings of sadness. Which therapeutic approach would you recommend and why?

18. Compare and contrast individual and group therapies.
19. You are conducting an intake assessment. Your client is a 45-year-old single, employed male with cocaine

      dependence. He failed a drug screen at work and is mandated to treatment by his employer if he wants to
      keep his job. Your client admits that he needs help. Why would you recommend group therapy for him?
20. Lashawn is a 24-year-old African American female. For years she has been struggling with bulimia. She
      knows she has a problem, but she is not willing to seek mental health services. What are some reasons
      why she may be hesitant to get help?

Personal Application Questions

21. Do you think there is a stigma associated with mentally ill persons today? Why or why not?
22. What are some places in your community that offer mental health services? Would you feel comfortable

      seeking assistance at one of these facilities? Why or why not?
23. If you were to choose a therapist practicing one of the techniques presented in this section, which kind of

      therapist would you choose and why?
24. Your best friend tells you that she is concerned about her cousin. The cousin--a teenage girl--is constantly

      coming home after her curfew, and your friend suspects that she has been drinking. What treatment
      modality would you recommend to your friend and why?
25. What are some substance-related and addictive disorder treatment facilities in your community, and what
      types of services do they provide? Would you recommend any of them to a friend or family member with a
      substance abuse problem? Why or why not?
26. What is your attitude toward mental health treatment? Would you seek treatment if you were experiencing
      symptoms or having trouble functioning in your life? Why or why not? In what ways do you think your
      cultural and/or religious beliefs influence your attitude toward psychological intervention?
