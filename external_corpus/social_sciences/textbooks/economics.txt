About Principles of Economics 3e

Principles of Economics 3e aligns to the topics and objectives of most introductory economics courses.
Arranged in the traditional progression from microeconomics to macroeconomics, it allows flexibility in
coverage and sequencing. The text uses conversational language and ample illustrations to explore economic
theories, and provides a wide array of examples using both fictional and real-world scenarios. The third
2 Preface

    edition has been carefully and thoroughly updated to reflect current data and understanding, as well as to
    provide a deeper background in diverse contributors and their impacts on economic thought and analysis.

    Coverage and scope

    In response to faculty feedback and to ease transition to a new edition, Principles of Economics 3e retains the
    organization of the previous editions. The book covers the breadth of economics topics and also provides the
    necessary depth to ensure the course is manageable for instructors and students alike. We strove to balance
    theory and application, as well as the amount of calculation and mathematical examples.

    The book is organized into eight main parts:

      · What is Economics? The first two chapters introduce students to the study of economics with a focus on
          making choices in a world of scarce resources.

      · Supply and Demand, Chapters 3 and 4, introduces and explains the first analytical model in economics:
          supply, demand, and equilibrium, before showing applications in the markets for labor and finance.

      · The Fundamentals of Microeconomic Theory, Chapters 5 through 10, begins the microeconomics
          portion of the text, presenting the theories of consumer behavior, production and costs, and the different
          models of market structure, including some simple game theory.

      · Microeconomic Policy Issues, Chapters 11 through 18, covers the range of topics in applied micro,
          framed around the concepts of public goods and positive and negative externalities. Students explore
          competition and antitrust policies, environmental problems, poverty, income inequality, and other labor
          market issues. The text also covers information, risk and financial markets, as well as public economy.

      · The Macroeconomic Perspective and Goals, Chapters 19 through 23, introduces a number of key
          concepts in macro: economic growth, unemployment and inflation, and international trade and capital
          flows.

      · A Framework for Macroeconomic Analysis, Chapters 24 through 26, introduces the principal analytic
          model in macro, namely the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model. The model is then applied to the
          Keynesian and Neoclassical perspectives. The expenditure-output model is fully explained in a stand-
          alone appendix.

      · Monetary and Fiscal Policy, Chapters 27 through 31, explains the role of money and the banking system,
          as well as monetary policy and financial regulation. Then the discussion switches to government deficits
          and fiscal policy.

      · International Economics, Chapters 32 through 34, the final part of the text, introduces the international
          dimensions of economics, including international trade and protectionism.

    Changes to the third edition

    The revision process incorporated extensive feedback from faculty who have used the book in their courses.
    They advised that the third edition changes focus on currency updates, integration of newer perspectives and
    more diverse contributors, and relevance to students' lives and careers.

    Current data and analysis: The authors have updated dozens of explanations, graphs, and tables containing
    financial, demographic, employment, and related economic data. The corresponding discussions provide
    context and interpretations of the data, including descriptions of change over time, cause-and-effect
    relationships, and balanced analysis of policies and opinions.

    Diverse perspectives and contributors: The third edition highlights the research and views of a broader
    group of economists. These include people from across the spectrum of economic thought, with a particular
    focus on those who take what are often considered non-traditional views of economic policy and government
    action. Examples include:

      · Chapter 1: Esther Duflo, Abhijit Banerjee, and Michael Kremer regarding experimental analysis in
          development economics.

  · Chapter 4: Walter Williams and Thomas Sowell regarding the downsides of minimum wages.
  · Chapter 13: Carlota Perez regarding employment shifts resulting from innovation; Mariana Mazzucato

      regarding government involvement in innovation; Elinor Ostrom and the "non-tragedy of the commons."
  · Chapter 14: William A. Darity Jr. on employment discrimination and market forces; Phyllis Ann Wallace

      and the EEOC.
  · Chapter 19: Kate Raworth regarding concepts for expanding economic measures beyond GDP and similar

      metrics.
  · Chapter 32: W. Arthur Lewis and the dual sector economy; Dambisa Moyo regarding the benefits and

      detriments of foreign aid.

Relevance and engagement: In order to show the importance and application of economics in students' lives
and careers, the third edition directly addresses and expands topics likely to connect to various industries,
issues, groups, and events. Brief references and deeply explored socio-political examples have been updated
to showcase the critical--and sometimes unnoticed--ties between economic developments and topics relevant
to students. Examples include education spending, the value of college degrees, discrimination, environmental
policies, immigration policies, entrepreneurship and innovation, healthcare and insurance, and general
financial literacy. Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic is referenced frequently to demonstrate its deep and
evolving impacts on financial data, employment, and other aspects of the economy.

FRED Data and Graphs: As in previous editions, the authors have included and referenced data from the
Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED). In some cases, interactive FRED graphs are embedded directly in the
web view of the book; students may magnify and focus on specific time periods, analyze individual data points,
and otherwise manipulate the graphs from within the OpenStax reading experience. In others cases (and in
the PDF), links to the direct source of the FRED data are provided, and students are encouraged to explore the
information and the overall FRED resources more thoroughly. Note that other data sources, such as the Bureau
of Labor Statistics, U.S. Census Bureau, and World Bank, usually include links in the captions or credits;
instructors and students can also explore those sites for more detailed investigations of the topics at hand.

Updated art

Principles of Economics 3e includes updated and redesigned art to clarify concepts and provide opportunities
for graphical interpretation. Many graphs are shown with accompanying data tables and explanations of the
drivers and consequences of change.
4 Preface

    Pedagogical foundation
    The narrative explanations and analysis presented in Principles of Economics 3e have been carefully crafted to
    provide a solid basis in economic concepts, flexibly approach skills and assess understanding, and deepen
    students' engagement with the course materials. You will also find features that promote economic inquiry and
    explorations, including:

      · Bring It Home: These explorations include a brief case study, specific to each chapter, which connects the
          chapter's main topic to the real word. It is broken up into two parts: the first at the beginning of the
          chapter (in the intro module) and the second at chapter's end, when students have learned what's
          necessary to understand the case and "bring home" the chapter's core concepts.

      · Work It Out: These worked examples progress through an analytical or computational problem, and guide
          students step by step to find out how its solution is derived.

      · Clear It Up: These boxes are deeper explanations of something in the main body of the text. Each Clear It
          Up starts with a question. The rest of the feature explains the answer.

    Questions for each level of learning
    Principles of Economics 3e offers flexibility in practice and assessment, and provides a range of opportunities
    to check understanding and encourage deeper thinking and application.

      · Self-Checks are analytical self-assessment questions that appear at the end of each module. They "click to
          reveal" an answer in the web view so students can check their understanding before moving on to the next
          module. Self-Check questions are not simple look-up questions. They push the student to think beyond
          what is said in the text. Self-Check questions are designed for formative (rather than summative)

      assessment. The questions and answers are explained so that students feel like they are being walked
      through the problem.
  · Review Questions are simple recall questions from the chapter in open-response format (not multiple
      choice or true/false). The answers can be looked up in the text.
  · Critical Thinking Questions are higher-level, conceptual questions that ask students to demonstrate their
      understanding by applying what they have learned in different contexts.
  · Problems are exercises that give students additional practice working with the analytic and
      computational concepts in the module.

OpenStax is retiring Principles of Microeconomics and Principles of Macroeconomics for AP textbooks
because they are outdated. We recommend that Advanced Placement instructors and students use the college-
level textbooks.

Academic integrity

Academic integrity builds trust, understanding, equity, and genuine learning. While students may encounter
significant challenges in their courses and their lives, doing their own work and maintaining a high degree of
authenticity will result in meaningful outcomes that will extend far beyond their college career. Faculty,
administrators, resource providers, and students should work together to maintain a fair and positive
experience.
We realize that students benefit when academic integrity ground rules are established early in the course. To
that end, OpenStax has created an interactive to aid with academic integrity discussions in your course.

                                                                       FIGURE 1

FIGURE 1.1 Do You Use Facebook? Economics is greatly impacted by how well information travels through
society. Today, social media giants Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram are major forces on the information super
highway. (Credit: modification of "Social Media Mixed Icons - Banner" by Blogtrepreneur/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)

CHAPTER OBJECTIVES

In this chapter, you will learn about:
  · What Is Economics, and Why Is It Important?
  · Microeconomics and Macroeconomics
  · How Economists Use Theories and Models to Understand Economic Issues
  · How Economies Can Be Organized: An Overview of Economic Systems

Introduction

         BRING IT HOME

Information Overload in the Information Age

To post or not to post? Every day we are faced with a myriad of decisions, from what to have for breakfast, to which
show to stream, to the more complex--"Should I double major and add possibly another semester of study to my
education?" Our response to these choices depends on the information we have available at any given moment.
Economists call this "imperfect" because we rarely have all the data we need to make perfect decisions. Despite the
lack of perfect information, we still make hundreds of decisions a day.

Streams, sponsors, and social media are altering the process by which we make choices, how we spend our time,
which movies we see, which products we buy, and more. Whether they read the reviews or just check the ratings, it's
unlikely for Americans to make many significant decisions without these information streams.

As you will see in this course, what happens in economics is affected by how well and how fast information
disseminates through a society, such as how quickly information travels through Facebook. "Economists love
nothing better than when deep and liquid markets operate under conditions of perfect information," says Jessica
Irvine, National Economics Editor for News Corp Australia.

This leads us to the topic of this chapter, an introduction to the world of making decisions, processing information,
10 1 · Welcome to Economics!

      and understanding behavior in markets --the world of economics. Each chapter in this book will start with a
      discussion about current (or sometimes past) events and revisit it at chapter's end--to "bring home" the concepts in
      play.

      What is economics and why should you spend your time learning it? After all, there are other disciplines you
      could be studying, and other ways you could be spending your time. As the Bring it Home feature just
      mentioned, making choices is at the heart of what economists study, and your decision to take this course is as
      much as economic decision as anything else.

      Economics is probably not what you think. It is not primarily about money or finance. It is not primarily about
      business. It is not mathematics. What is it then? It is both a subject area and a way of viewing the world.

    1.1 What Is Economics, and Why Is It Important?

      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Discuss the importance of studying economics
        · Explain the relationship between production and division of labor
        · Evaluate the significance of scarcity

      Economics is the study of how humans make decisions in the face of scarcity. These can be individual
      decisions, family decisions, business decisions or societal decisions. If you look around carefully, you will see
      that scarcity is a fact of life. Scarcity means that human wants for goods, services and resources exceed what
      is available. Resources, such as labor, tools, land, and raw materials are necessary to produce the goods and
      services we want but they exist in limited supply. Of course, the ultimate scarce resource is time- everyone,
      rich or poor, has just 24 expendable hours in the day to earn income to acquire goods and services, for leisure
      time, or for sleep. At any point in time, there is only a finite amount of resources available.

      Think about it this way: In 2015 the labor force in the United States contained over 158 million workers,
      according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The total land area was 3,794,101 square miles. While these
      are certainly large numbers, they are not infinite. Because these resources are limited, so are the numbers of
      goods and services we produce with them. Combine this with the fact that human wants seem to be virtually
      infinite, and you can see why scarcity is a problem.

     Introduction to FRED

      Data is very important in economics because it describes and measures the issues and problems that
      economics seek to understand. A variety of government agencies publish economic and social data. For this
      course, we will generally use data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank's FRED database. FRED is very user
      friendly. It allows you to display data in tables or charts, and you can easily download it into spreadsheet form
      if you want to use the data for other purposes. The FRED website (https://openstax.org/l/FRED/) includes data
      on nearly 400,000 domestic and international variables over time, in the following broad categories:

        · Money, Banking & Finance
        · Population, Employment, & Labor Markets (including Income Distribution)
        · National Accounts (Gross Domestic Product & its components), Flow of Funds, and International Accounts
        · Production & Business Activity (including Business Cycles)
        · Prices & Inflation (including the Consumer Price Index, the Producer Price Index, and the Employment

            Cost Index)
        · International Data from other nations
        · U.S. Regional Data
        · Academic Data (including Penn World Tables & NBER Macrohistory database)

      For more information about how to use FRED, see the variety of videos (https://openstax.org/l/FRED_intro) on

FIGURE 1.2 Scarcity of Resources People experiencing homelessness are a stark reminder that scarcity of
resources is real. (Credit: "Pittsburgh Homeless" by "daveyinn"/Flickr Creative Commons, CC BY 2.0)

If you still do not believe that scarcity is a problem, consider the following: Does everyone require food to eat?
Does everyone need a decent place to live? Does everyone have access to healthcare? In every country in the
world, there are people who are hungry, homeless (for example, those who call park benches their beds, as
Figure 1.2 shows), and in need of healthcare, just to focus on a few critical goods and services. Why is this the
case? It is because of scarcity. Let's delve into the concept of scarcity a little deeper, because it is crucial to
understanding economics.

The Problem of Scarcity

Think about all the things you consume: food, shelter, clothing, transportation, healthcare, and entertainment.
How do you acquire those items? You do not produce them yourself. You buy them. How do you afford the
things you buy? You work for pay. If you do not, someone else does on your behalf. Yet most of us never have
enough income to buy all the things we want. This is because of scarcity. So how do we solve it?

     LINK IT UP

Visit this website (http://openstax.org/l/drought) to read about how the United States is dealing with scarcity in
resources.

Every society, at every level, must make choices about how to use its resources. Families must decide whether
to spend their money on a new car or a fancy vacation. Towns must choose whether to put more of the budget
into police and fire protection or into the school system. Nations must decide whether to devote more funds to
national defense or to protecting the environment. In most cases, there just isn't enough money in the budget
to do everything. How do we use our limited resources the best way possible, that is, to obtain the most goods
and services we can? There are a couple of options. First, we could each produce everything we each consume.
Alternatively, we could each produce some of what we want to consume, and "trade" for the rest of what we
want. Let's explore these options. Why do we not each just produce all of the things we consume? Think back to
pioneer days, when individuals knew how to do so much more than we do today, from building their homes, to
growing their crops, to hunting for food, to repairing their equipment. Most of us do not know how to do all--or
any--of those things, but it is not because we could not learn. Rather, we do not have to. The reason why is
something called the division and specialization of labor, a production innovation first put forth by Adam

     The Division of and Specialization of Labor

     The formal study of economics began when Adam Smith (1723-1790) published his famous book The Wealth
     of Nations in 1776. Many authors had written on economics in the centuries before Smith, but he was the first
      to address the subject in a comprehensive way. In the first chapter, Smith introduces the concept of division of
      labor, which means that the way one produces a good or service is divided into a number of tasks that
      different workers perform, instead of all the tasks being done by the same person.
      To illustrate division of labor, Smith counted how many tasks went into making a pin: drawing out a piece of
      wire, cutting it to the right length, straightening it, putting a head on one end and a point on the other, and
      packaging pins for sale, to name just a few. Smith counted 18 distinct tasks that different people
      performed--all for a pin, believe it or not!
      Modern businesses divide tasks as well. Even a relatively simple business like a restaurant divides the task of
      serving meals into a range of jobs like top chef, sous chefs, less-skilled kitchen help, servers to wait on the
      tables, a greeter at the door, janitors to clean up, and a business manager to handle paychecks and bills--not to
      mention the economic connections a restaurant has with suppliers of food, furniture, kitchen equipment, and
      the building where it is located. A complex business like a large manufacturing factory, such as the shoe
      factory (Figure 1.4), or a hospital can have hundreds of job classifications.

Why the Division of Labor Increases Production

When we divide and subdivide the tasks involved with producing a good or service, workers and businesses
can produce a greater quantity of output. In his observations of pin factories, Smith noticed that one worker
alone might make 20 pins in a day, but that a small business of 10 workers (some of whom would need to
complete two or three of the 18 tasks involved with pin-making), could make 48,000 pins in a day. How can a
group of workers, each specializing in certain tasks, produce so much more than the same number of workers
who try to produce the entire good or service by themselves? Smith offered three reasons.

First, specialization in a particular small job allows workers to focus on the parts of the production process
where they have an advantage. (In later chapters, we will develop this idea by discussing comparative
advantage.) People have different skills, talents, and interests, so they will be better at some jobs than at others.
The particular advantages may be based on educational choices, which are in turn shaped by interests and
talents. Only those with medical degrees qualify to become doctors, for instance. For some goods, geography
affects specialization. For example, it is easier to be a wheat farmer in North Dakota than in Florida, but easier
to run a tourist hotel in Florida than in North Dakota. If you live in or near a big city, it is easier to attract
enough customers to operate a successful dry cleaning business or movie theater than if you live in a sparsely
populated rural area. Whatever the reason, if people specialize in the production of what they do best, they will
be more effective than if they produce a combination of things, some of which they are good at and some of
which they are not.

Second, workers who specialize in certain tasks often learn to produce more quickly and with higher quality.
This pattern holds true for many workers, including assembly line laborers who build cars, stylists who cut
hair, and doctors who perform heart surgery. In fact, specialized workers often know their jobs well enough to
suggest innovative ways to do their work faster and better.

A similar pattern often operates within businesses. In many cases, a business that focuses on one or a few
products (sometimes called its "core competency") is more successful than firms that try to make a wide range
of products.

Third, specialization allows businesses to take advantage of economies of scale, which means that for many
goods, as the level of production increases, the average cost of producing each individual unit declines. For
example, if a factory produces only 100 cars per year, each car will be quite expensive to make on average.
However, if a factory produces 50,000 cars each year, then it can set up an assembly line with huge machines
and workers performing specialized tasks, and the average cost of production per car will be lower. The
ultimate result of workers who can focus on their preferences and talents, learn to do their specialized jobs
better, and work in larger organizations is that society as a whole can produce and consume far more than if
each person tried to produce all of their own goods and services. The division and specialization of labor has
been a force against the problem of scarcity.

Trade and Markets

Specialization only makes sense, though, if workers can use the pay they receive for doing their jobs to
purchase the other goods and services that they need. In short, specialization requires trade.

You do not have to know anything about electronics or sound systems to play music--you just buy an iPod or
MP3 player, download the music, and listen. You do not have to know anything about artificial fibers or the
construction of sewing machines if you need a jacket--you just buy the jacket and wear it. You do not need to
know anything about internal combustion engines to operate a car--you just get in and drive. Instead of trying
to acquire all the knowledge and skills involved in producing all of the goods and services that you wish to
consume, the market allows you to learn a specialized set of skills and then use the pay you receive to buy the
goods and services you need or want. This is how our modern society has evolved into a strong economy.

     Why Study Economics?

      FIGURE 1.5 Esther Duflo, Abhijit Banerjee, and Michael Kremer Esther Duflo, Abhijit Banerjee (both from
      Massachusetts Institute of Technology), and Michael Kremer (University of Chicago) were awarded the Nobel Prize
      for groundbreaking work in which they established experimental methods to understand poverty and outcomes of
      initiatives to address it. (Credit: modification of work by U.S. Embassy Sweden/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 2.0;

      Now that you have an overview on what economics studies, let's quickly discuss why you are right to study it.
      Economics is not primarily a collection of facts to memorize, although there are plenty of important concepts
      to learn. Instead, think of economics as a collection of questions to answer or puzzles to work. Most
      importantly, economics provides the tools to solve those puzzles.
      Consider the complex and critical issue of education barriers on national and regional levels, which affect
      millions of people and result in widespread poverty and inequality. Governments, aid organizations, and
      wealthy individuals spend billions of dollars each year trying to address these issues. Nations announce the
      revitalization of their education programs; tech companies donate devices and infrastructure, and celebrities
      and charities build schools and sponsor students. Yet the problems remain, sometimes almost as pronounced
      as they were before the intervention. Why is that the case? In 2019, three economists--Esther Duflo, Abhijit
      Banerjee, and Michael Kremer--were awarded the Nobel Prize for their work to answer those questions. They
      worked diligently to break the widespread problems into smaller pieces, and experimented with small
      interventions to test success. The award citation credited their work with giving the world better tools and
      information to address poverty and improve education. Esther Duflo, who is the youngest person and second
      woman to win the Nobel Prize in Economics, said, "We believed that like the war on cancer, the war on poverty
      was not going to be won in one major battle, but in a series of small triumphs. . . . This work and the culture of
      learning that it fostered in governments has led to real improvement in the lives of hundreds of millions of
      poor people."
      As you can see, economics affects far more than business. For example:

        · Virtually every major problem facing the world today, from global warming, to world poverty, to the
            conflicts in Syria, Afghanistan, and Somalia, has an economic dimension. If you are going to be part of
            solving those problems, you need to be able to understand them. Economics is crucial.

        · It is hard to overstate the importance of economics to good citizenship. You need to be able to vote
            intelligently on budgets, regulations, and laws in general. When the U.S. government came close to a
            standstill at the end of 2012 due to the "fiscal cliff," what were the issues? Did you know?

        · A basic understanding of economics makes you a well-rounded thinker. When you read articles about
            economic issues, you will understand and be able to evaluate the writer's argument. When you hear

      classmates, co-workers, or political candidates talking about economics, you will be able to distinguish
      between common sense and nonsense. You will find new ways of thinking about current events and about
      personal and business decisions, as well as current events and politics.

The study of economics does not dictate the answers, but it can illuminate the different choices.

1.2 Microeconomics and Macroeconomics

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Describe microeconomics
  · Describe macroeconomics
  · Contrast monetary policy and fiscal policy

Economics is concerned with the well-being of all people, including those with jobs and those without jobs, as
well as those with high incomes and those with low incomes. Economics acknowledges that production of
useful goods and services can create problems of environmental pollution. It explores the question of how
investing in education helps to develop workers' skills. It probes questions like how to tell when big businesses
or big labor unions are operating in a way that benefits society as a whole and when they are operating in a way
that benefits their owners or members at the expense of others. It looks at how government spending, taxes,
and regulations affect decisions about production and consumption.

It should be clear by now that economics covers considerable ground. We can divide that ground into two
parts: Microeconomics focuses on the actions of individual agents within the economy, like households,
workers, and businesses. Macroeconomics looks at the economy as a whole. It focuses on broad issues such as
growth of production, the number of unemployed people, the inflationary increase in prices, government
deficits, and levels of exports and imports. Microeconomics and macroeconomics are not separate subjects,
but rather complementary perspectives on the overall subject of the economy.

To understand why both microeconomic and macroeconomic perspectives are useful, consider the problem of
studying a biological ecosystem like a lake. One person who sets out to study the lake might focus on specific
topics: certain kinds of algae or plant life; the characteristics of particular fish or snails; or the trees
surrounding the lake. Another person might take an overall view and instead consider the lake's ecosystem
from top to bottom; what eats what, how the system stays in a rough balance, and what environmental stresses
affect this balance. Both approaches are useful, and both examine the same lake, but the viewpoints are
different. In a similar way, both microeconomics and macroeconomics study the same economy, but each has
a different viewpoint.

Whether you are scrutinizing lakes or economics, the micro and the macro insights should blend with each
other. In studying a lake, the micro insights about particular plants and animals help to understand the overall
food chain, while the macro insights about the overall food chain help to explain the environment in which
individual plants and animals live.

In economics, the micro decisions of individual businesses are influenced by whether the macroeconomy is
healthy. For example, firms will be more likely to hire workers if the overall economy is growing. In turn,
macroeconomy's performance ultimately depends on the microeconomic decisions that individual
households and businesses make.

Microeconomics

What determines how households and individuals spend their budgets? What combination of goods and
services will best fit their needs and wants, given the budget they have to spend? How do people decide
whether to work, and if so, whether to work full time or part time? How do people decide how much to save for
the future, or whether they should borrow to spend beyond their current means?

What determines the products, and how many of each, a firm will produce and sell? What determines the
16 1 · Welcome to Economics!

      prices a firm will charge? What determines how a firm will produce its products? What determines how many
      workers it will hire? How will a firm finance its business? When will a firm decide to expand, downsize, or even
      close? In the microeconomics part of this book, we will learn about the theory of consumer behavior, the
      theory of the firm, how markets for labor and other resources work, and how markets sometimes fail to work
      properly.

     Macroeconomics

      What determines the level of economic activity in a society? In other words, what determines how many goods
      and services a nation actually produces? What determines how many jobs are available in an economy? What
      determines a nation's standard of living? What causes the economy to speed up or slow down? What causes
      firms to hire more workers or to lay them off? Finally, what causes the economy to grow over the long term?
      We can determine an economy's macroeconomic health by examining a number of goals: growth in the
      standard of living, low unemployment, and low inflation, to name the most important. How can we use
      government macroeconomic policy to pursue these goals? A nation's central bank conducts monetary policy,
      which involves policies that affect bank lending, interest rates, and financial capital markets. For the United
      States, this is the Federal Reserve. A nation's legislative body determines fiscal policy, which involves
      government spending and taxes. For the United States, this is the Congress and the executive branch, which
      originates the federal budget. These are the government's main tools. Americans tend to expect that
      government can fix whatever economic problems we encounter, but to what extent is that expectation
      realistic? These are just some of the issues that we will explore in the macroeconomic chapters of this book.

      FIGURE 1.6 John Maynard Keynes One of the most influential economists in modern times was John Maynard
      Keynes. (Credit: "John Maynard Keynes" by IMF/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
      John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946), one of the greatest economists of the twentieth century, pointed out that
      economics is not just a subject area but also a way of thinking. Keynes (Figure 1.6) famously wrote in the
      introduction to a fellow economist's book: "[Economics] is a method rather than a doctrine, an apparatus of the
      mind, a technique of thinking, which helps its possessor to draw correct conclusions." In other words,
      economics teaches you how to think, not what to think.

Economists see the world through a different lens than anthropologists, biologists, classicists, or practitioners
of any other discipline. They analyze issues and problems using economic theories that are based on
particular assumptions about human behavior. These assumptions tend to be different than the assumptions
an anthropologist or psychologist might use. A theory is a simplified representation of how two or more
variables interact with each other. The purpose of a theory is to take a complex, real-world issue and simplify it
down to its essentials. If done well, this enables the analyst to understand the issue and any problems around
it. A good theory is simple enough to understand, while complex enough to capture the key features of the
object or situation you are studying.
Sometimes economists use the term model instead of theory. Strictly speaking, a theory is a more abstract
representation, while a model is a more applied or empirical representation. We use models to test theories,
but for this course we will use the terms interchangeably.
For example, an architect who is planning a major office building will often build a physical model that sits on
a tabletop to show how the entire city block will look after the new building is constructed. Companies often
build models of their new products, which are more rough and unfinished than the final product, but can still
demonstrate how the new product will work.
A good model to start with in economics is the circular flow diagram (Figure 1.7). It pictures the economy as
consisting of two groups--households and firms--that interact in two markets: the goods and services market
in which firms sell and households buy and the labor market in which households sell labor to business firms
or other employees.

FIGURE 1.7 The Circular Flow Diagram The circular flow diagram shows how households and firms interact in the
goods and services market, and in the labor market. The direction of the arrows shows that in the goods and
services market, households receive goods and services and pay firms for them. In the labor market, households
provide labor and receive payment from firms through wages, salaries, and benefits.
Firms produce and sell goods and services to households in the market for goods and services (or product
market). Arrow "A" indicates this. Households pay for goods and services, which becomes the revenues to
firms. Arrow "B" indicates this. Arrows A and B represent the two sides of the product market. Where do
households obtain the income to buy goods and services? They provide the labor and other resources (e.g.,
land, capital, raw materials) firms need to produce goods and services in the market for inputs (or factors of
production). Arrow "C" indicates this. In return, firms pay for the inputs (or resources) they use in the form of
wages and other factor payments. Arrow "D" indicates this. Arrows "C" and "D" represent the two sides of the
factor market.
Of course, in the real world, there are many different markets for goods and services and markets for many
different types of labor. The circular flow diagram simplifies this to make the picture easier to grasp. In the
diagram, firms produce goods and services, which they sell to households in return for revenues. The outer
circle shows this, and represents the two sides of the product market (for example, the market for goods and
18 1 · Welcome to Economics!

      services) in which households demand and firms supply. Households sell their labor as workers to firms in
      return for wages, salaries, and benefits. The inner circle shows this and represents the two sides of the labor
      market in which households supply and firms demand.
      This version of the circular flow model is stripped down to the essentials, but it has enough features to explain
      how the product and labor markets work in the economy. We could easily add details to this basic model if we
      wanted to introduce more real-world elements, like financial markets, governments, and interactions with the
      rest of the globe (imports and exports).
      Economists carry a set of theories in their heads like a carpenter carries around a toolkit. When they see an
      economic issue or problem, they go through the theories they know to see if they can find one that fits. Then
      they use the theory to derive insights about the issue or problem. Economists express theories as diagrams,
      graphs, or even as mathematical equations. (Do not worry. In this course, we will mostly use graphs.)
      Economists do not figure out the answer to the problem first and then draw the graph to illustrate. Rather, they
      use the graph of the theory to help them figure out the answer. Although at the introductory level, you can
      sometimes figure out the right answer without applying a model, if you keep studying economics, before too
      long you will run into issues and problems that you will need to graph to solve. We explain both micro and
      macroeconomics in terms of theories and models. The most well-known theories are probably those of supply
      and demand, but you will learn a number of others.

    1.4 How To Organize Economies: An Overview of Economic Systems

      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Contrast traditional economies, command economies, and market economies
        · Explain gross domestic product (GDP)
        · Assess the importance and effects of globalization
      Think about what a complex system a modern economy is. It includes all production of goods and services, all
      buying and selling, all employment. The economic life of every individual is interrelated, at least to a small
      extent, with the economic lives of thousands or even millions of other individuals. Who organizes and
      coordinates this system? Who ensures that, for example, the number of televisions a society provides is the
      same as the amount it needs and wants? Who ensures that the right number of employees work in the
      electronics industry? Who ensures that televisions are produced in the best way possible? How does it all get
      done?
      There are at least three ways that societies organize an economy. The first is the traditional economy, which is
      the oldest economic system and is used in parts of Asia, Africa, and South America. Traditional economies
      organize their economic affairs the way they have always done (i.e., tradition). Occupations stay in the family.
      Most families are farmers who grow the crops using traditional methods. What you produce is what you
      consume. Because tradition drives the way of life, there is little economic progress or development.

FIGURE 1.8 A Command Economy Ancient Egypt was an example of a command economy. (Credit: "Pyramids at
Giza" by Jay Bergesen/Flickr Creative Commons, CC BY 2.0)
Command economies are very different. In a command economy, economic effort is devoted to goals passed
down from a ruler or ruling class. Ancient Egypt was a good example: a large part of economic life was devoted
to building pyramids, like those in Figure 1.8, for the pharaohs. Medieval manor life is another example: the
lord provided the land for growing crops and protection in the event of war. In return, vassals provided labor
and soldiers to do the lord's bidding. In the last century, communism emphasized command economies.
In a command economy, the government decides what goods and services will be produced and what prices it
will charge for them. The government decides what methods of production to use and sets wages for workers.
The government provides many necessities like healthcare and education for free. Currently, Cuba and North
Korea have command economies.

FIGURE 1.9 A Market Economy Nothing says "market" more than The New York Stock Exchange. (Credit: work by
Erik Drost/Flickr Creative Commons, CC BY 2.0)
Although command economies have a very centralized structure for economic decisions, market economies
have a very decentralized structure. A market is an institution that brings together buyers and sellers of goods
or services, who may be either individuals or businesses. The New York Stock Exchange (Figure 1.9) is a prime
example of a market which brings buyers and sellers together. In a market economy, decision-making is
decentralized. Market economies are based on private enterprise: the private individuals or groups of private
individuals own and operate the means of production (resources and businesses). Businesses supply goods
and services based on demand. (In a command economy, by contrast, the government owns resources and
businesses.) Supply of goods and services depends on what the demands are. A person's income is based on
their ability to convert resources (especially labor) into something that society values. The more society values
the person's output, the higher the income (think Lady Gaga or LeBron James). In this scenario, market forces,
not governments, determine economic decisions.
Most economies in the real world are mixed. They combine elements of command and market (and even
traditional) systems. The U.S. economy is positioned toward the market-oriented end of the spectrum. Many
countries in Europe and Latin America, while primarily market-oriented, have a greater degree of government
20 1 · Welcome to Economics!

involvement in economic decisions than the U.S. economy. China and Russia, while over the past several
decades have moved more in the direction of having a market-oriented system, remain closer to the command
economy end of the spectrum. The Heritage Foundation provides perspective on countries' economic freedom,
as the following Clear It Up feature discusses.

         CLEAR IT UP

What countries are considered economically free?

Who is in control of economic decisions? Are people free to do what they want and to work where they want? Are
businesses free to produce when they want and what they choose, and to hire and fire as they wish? Are banks free
to choose who will receive loans, or does the government control these kinds of choices? Each year, researchers at
the Heritage Foundation and the Wall Street Journal look at 50 different categories of economic freedom for
countries around the world. They give each nation a score based on the extent of economic freedom in each
category. Note that while the Heritage Foundation/WSJ index is widely cited by an array of scholars and
publications, it should be regarded as only one viewpoint. Some experts indicate that the index's category choices
and scores are politically biased. However, the index and others like it provide a useful resource for critical
discussion of economic freedom.

The 2016 Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom report ranked 178 countries around the world: Table
1.1 lists some examples of the most free and the least free countries. Although technically not a separate country,
Hong Kong has been granted a degree of autonomy such that, for purposes of measuring economic statistics, it is
often treated as a separate country. Several additional countries were not ranked because of extreme instability that
made judgments about economic freedom impossible. These countries include Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria,
Somalia, and Yemen.

The assigned rankings are inevitably based on estimates, yet even these rough measures can be useful for
discerning trends. In 2015, 101 of the 178 included countries shifted toward greater economic freedom, although
77 of the countries shifted toward less economic freedom. In recent decades, the overall trend has been a higher
level of economic freedom around the world.

Regulations: The Rules of the Game

Markets and government regulations are always entangled. There is no such thing as an absolutely free
market. Regulations always define the "rules of the game" in the economy. Economies that are primarily
market-oriented have fewer regulations--ideally just enough to maintain an even playing field for participants.
At a minimum, these laws govern matters like safeguarding private property against theft, protecting people
from violence, enforcing legal contracts, preventing fraud, and collecting taxes. Conversely, even the most
command-oriented economies operate using markets. How else would buying and selling occur? The
government heavily regulates decisions of what to produce and prices to charge. Heavily regulated economies
often have underground economies (or black markets), which are markets where the buyers and sellers make
transactions without the government's approval.

The question of how to organize economic institutions is typically not a straightforward choice between all
market or all government, but instead involves a balancing act over the appropriate combination of market
freedom and government rules.

The Rise of Globalization

Recent decades have seen a trend toward globalization, which is the expanding cultural, political, and
economic connections between people around the world. One measure of this is the increased buying and
selling of goods, services, and assets across national borders--in other words, international trade and financial
capital flows.

Globalization has occurred for a number of reasons. Improvements in shipping, as illustrated by the container
22 1 · Welcome to Economics!

ship in Figure 1.10, and air cargo have driven down transportation costs. Innovations in computing and
telecommunications have made it easier and cheaper to manage long-distance economic connections of
production and sales. Many valuable products and services in the modern economy can take the form of
information--for example: computer software; financial advice; travel planning; music, books and movies; and
blueprints for designing a building. These products and many others can be transported over telephones and
computer networks at ever-lower costs. Finally, international agreements and treaties between countries have
encouraged greater trade.

Table 1.2 presents one measure of globalization. It shows the percentage of domestic economic production
that was exported for a selection of countries from 2010 to 2015, according to an entity known as The World
Bank. Exports are the goods and services that one produces domestically and sells abroad. Imports are the
goods and services that one produces abroad and then sells domestically. Gross domestic product (GDP)
measures the size of total production in an economy. Thus, the ratio of exports divided by GDP measures what
share of a country's total economic production is sold in other countries.

In recent decades, the export/GDP ratio has generally risen, both worldwide and for the U.S. economy.
Interestingly, the share of U.S. exports in proportion to the U.S. economy is well below the global average, in
part because large economies like the United States can contain more of the division of labor inside their
national borders. However, smaller economies like Belgium, Korea, and Canada need to trade across their
borders with other countries to take full advantage of division of labor, specialization, and economies of scale.
In this sense, the enormous U.S. economy is less affected by globalization than most other countries.

Table 1.2 indicates that many medium and low income countries around the world, like Mexico and China,
have also experienced a surge of globalization in recent decades. If an astronaut in orbit could put on special
glasses that make all economic transactions visible as brightly colored lines and look down at Earth, the
astronaut would see the planet covered with connections.

Despite the rise in globalization over the last few decades, in recent years we've seen significant pushback
against globalization from people across the world concerned about loss of jobs, loss of political sovereignty,
and increased economic inequality. Prominent examples of this pushback include the 2016 vote in Great
Britain to exit the European Union (i.e. Brexit), and the election of Donald J. Trump for President of the United
States.

Hopefully, you now have an idea about economics. Before you move to any other chapter of study, be sure to
read the very important appendix to this chapter called The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics. It
is essential that you learn more about how to read and use models in economics.

Information Overload in the Information Age

The world provides nearly instant access to a wealth of information. Consider that as recently as the late 1970s, the
Farmer's Almanac, along with the Weather Bureau of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, were the primary sources
American farmers used to determine when to plant and harvest their crops. Today, these decisions are driven by
data. Farmers access detailed data streams driven by global positioning systems, historical rainfall patterns, and
complex weather monitoring services. They combine this information with crop yield data and soil quality
measurements from prior years. Maximizing production efficiently can mean the difference between a farm that
remains profitable and one that may need to sell its land, and data helps eliminate guesswork.

Information helps us make decisions as simple as what to wear today to how many reporters the media should send
to cover an event. Each of these decisions is an economic decision. After all, resources are scarce. If the media send
ten reporters to cover an announcement, they are not available to cover other stories or complete other tasks.
Information provides the necessary knowledge to make the best possible decisions on how to utilize scarce
resources. Welcome to the world of economics!

Key Concepts and Summary

1.1 What Is Economics, and Why Is It Important?

Economics seeks to solve the problem of scarcity, which is when human wants for goods and services exceed
the available supply. A modern economy displays a division of labor, in which people earn income by
specializing in what they produce and then use that income to purchase the products they need or want. The
division of labor allows individuals and firms to specialize and to produce more for several reasons: a) It allows
the agents to focus on areas of advantage due to natural factors and skill levels; b) It encourages the agents to
learn and invent; c) It allows agents to take advantage of economies of scale. Division and specialization of
labor only work when individuals can purchase what they do not produce in markets. Learning about
economics helps you understand the major problems facing the world today, prepares you to be a good citizen,
and helps you become a well-rounded thinker.

1.2 Microeconomics and Macroeconomics

Microeconomics and macroeconomics are two different perspectives on the economy. The microeconomic
perspective focuses on parts of the economy: individuals, firms, and industries. The macroeconomic
perspective looks at the economy as a whole, focusing on goals like growth in the standard of living,
unemployment, and inflation. Macroeconomics has two types of policies for pursuing these goals: monetary
policy and fiscal policy.

1.3 How Economists Use Theories and Models to Understand Economic Issues

Economists analyze problems differently than do other disciplinary experts. The main tools economists use
are economic theories or models. A theory is not an illustration of the answer to a problem. Rather, a theory is a
tool for determining the answer.

1.4 How To Organize Economies: An Overview of Economic Systems

We can organize societies as traditional, command, or market-oriented economies. Most societies are a mix.
The last few decades have seen globalization evolve as a result of growth in commercial and financial networks
that cross national borders, making businesses and workers from different economies increasingly
interdependent.

Introduction to Choice in a World of Scarcity

         BRING IT HOME
Choices ... to What Degree?

Does your level of education impact earning? Let's look at some data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). In
2020, among full-time wage and salary workers, median weekly earnings for those with a master's degree were
$1,545. Multiply this average by 52 weeks, and you get average annual earnings of $80,340. Compare that to the
28 2 · Choice in a World of Scarcity

      median weekly earnings for full-time workers aged 25 and over with just a bachelor's degree: $1,305 weekly and
      $67,860 a year. What about those with no higher than a high school diploma in 2020? They earn an average of just
      $781 weekly and $40,612 over 12 months. In other words, data from the BLS indicates that receiving a bachelor's
      degree boosts earnings by 67% over what workers would have earned if they only obtained a high school diploma,
      and a master's degree yields average earnings that are nearly double those of workers with a high school diploma.
      Given these statistics, we might expect many people to choose to go to college and at least earn a bachelor's
      degree. Assuming that people want to improve their material well-being, it seems like they would make those
      choices that provide them with the greatest opportunity to consume goods and services. As it turns out, the analysis
      is not nearly as simple as this. In fact, in 2019, the BLS reported that while just over 90% of the population aged 25
      and over in the United States had a high school diploma, only 36% of those aged 25 and over had a bachelor's or
      higher degree, and only 13.5% had earned a master's or higher degree.
      This brings us to the subject of this chapter: why people make the choices they make and how economists explain
      those choices.

      You will learn quickly when you examine the relationship between economics and scarcity that choices involve
      tradeoffs. Every choice has a cost.
      In 1968, the Rolling Stones recorded "You Can't Always Get What You Want." Economists chuckled, because
     they had been singing a similar tune for decades. English economist Lionel Robbins (1898-1984), in his Essay
     on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science in 1932, described not always getting what you want in
      this way:

            The time at our disposal is limited. There are only twenty-four hours in the day. We have to choose
            between the different uses to which they may be put. ... Everywhere we turn, if we choose one thing we
            must relinquish others which, in different circumstances, we would wish not to have relinquished.
            Scarcity of means to satisfy given ends is an almost ubiquitous condition of human nature.
      Because people live in a world of scarcity, they cannot have all the time, money, possessions, and experiences
      they wish. Neither can society.
      This chapter will continue our discussion of scarcity and the economic way of thinking by first introducing
      three critical concepts: opportunity cost, marginal decision making, and diminishing returns. Later, it will
     consider whether the economic way of thinking accurately describes either how we make choices and how we
     should make them.

    2.1 How Individuals Make Choices Based on Their Budget Constraint

      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Calculate and graph budget constraints
        · Explain opportunity sets and opportunity costs
        · Evaluate the law of diminishing marginal utility
        · Explain how marginal analysis and utility influence choices
      Consider the typical consumer's budget problem. Consumers have a limited amount of income to spend on the
      things they need and want. Suppose Alphonso has $10 in spending money each week that he can allocate
      between bus tickets for getting to work and the burgers that he eats for lunch. Burgers cost $2 each, and bus
      tickets are 50 cents each. We can see Alphonso's budget problem in Figure 2.2.

       Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                          2.1 · How Individuals Make Choices Based on Their Budget Constraint 29

FIGURE 2.2 The Budget Constraint: Alphonso's Consumption Choice Opportunity Frontier Each point on the
budget constraint represents a combination of burgers and bus tickets whose total cost adds up to Alphonso's
budget of $10. The relative price of burgers and bus tickets determines the slope of the budget constraint. All along
the budget set, giving up one burger means gaining four bus tickets.
The vertical axis in the figure shows burger purchases and the horizontal axis shows bus ticket purchases. If
Alphonso spends all his money on burgers, he can afford five per week. ($10 per week/$2 per burger = 5
burgers per week.) However, if he does this, he will not be able to afford any bus tickets. Point A in the figure
shows the choice (zero bus tickets and five burgers). Alternatively, if Alphonso spends all his money on bus
tickets, he can afford 20 per week. ($10 per week/$0.50 per bus ticket = 20 bus tickets per week.) Then,
however, he will not be able to afford any burgers. Point F shows this alternative choice (20 bus tickets and zero
burgers).
If we connect all the points between A and F, we get Alphonso's budget constraint. This indicates all the
combination of burgers and bus tickets Alphonso can afford, given the price of the two goods and his budget
amount.
If Alphonso is like most people, he will choose some combination that includes both bus tickets and burgers.
That is, he will choose some combination on the budget constraint that is between points A and F. Every point
on (or inside) the constraint shows a combination of burgers and bus tickets that Alphonso can afford. Any
point outside the constraint is not affordable, because it would cost more money than Alphonso has in his
budget.
The budget constraint clearly shows the tradeoff Alphonso faces in choosing between burgers and bus tickets.
Suppose he is currently at point D, where he can afford 12 bus tickets and two burgers. What would it cost
Alphonso for one more burger? It would be natural to answer $2, but that's not the way economists think.
Instead they ask, how many bus tickets would Alphonso have to give up to get one more burger, while staying
within his budget? Since bus tickets cost 50 cents, Alphonso would have to give up four to afford one more
burger. That is the true cost to Alphonso.

The Concept of Opportunity Cost

Economists use the term opportunity cost to indicate what people must give up to obtain what they desire.
The idea behind opportunity cost is that the cost of one item is the lost opportunity to do or consume
something else. In short, opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative. For Alphonso, the
opportunity cost of a burger is the four bus tickets he would have to give up. He would decide whether or not to
choose the burger depending on whether the value of the burger exceeds the value of the forgone
alternative--in this case, bus tickets. Since people must choose, they inevitably face tradeoffs in which they
have to give up things they desire to obtain other things they desire more.

View this website (http://openstax.org/l/linestanding) for an example of opportunity cost--paying someone else
to wait in line for you.
30 2 · Choice in a World of Scarcity

      A fundamental principle of economics is that every choice has an opportunity cost. If you sleep through your
      economics class, the opportunity cost is the learning you miss from not attending class. If you spend your
      income on video games, you cannot spend it on movies. If you choose to marry one person, you give up the
      opportunity to marry anyone else. In short, opportunity cost is all around us and part of human existence.
      The following Work It Out feature shows a step-by-step analysis of a budget constraint calculation. Read
      through it to understand another important concept--slope--that we further explain in the appendix The Use
      of Mathematics in Principles of Economics.

                                                                                                               WORK IT OUT
      Understanding Budget Constraints

        Budget constraints are easy to understand if you apply a little math. The appendix The Use of Mathematics in
        Principles of Economics explains all the math you are likely to need in this book. Therefore, if math is not your
        strength, you might want to take a look at the appendix.
        Step 1: The equation for any budget constraint is:

        where P and Q are the price and quantity of items purchased (which we assume here to be two items) and
        Budget is the amount of income one has to spend.
        Step 2. Apply the budget constraint equation to the scenario. In Alphonso's case, this works out to be:

        Step 3. Using a little algebra, we can turn this into the familiar equation of a line:

        For Alphonso, this is:

        Step 4. Simplify the equation. Begin by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

        Step 5. Subtract one bus ticket from both sides:

        Divide each side by 4 to yield the answer:

        Step 6. Notice that this equation fits the budget constraint in Figure 2.2. The vertical intercept is 5 and the slope
        is -0.25, just as the equation says. If you plug 20 bus tickets into the equation, you get 0 burgers. If you plug
        other numbers of bus tickets into the equation, you get the results (see Table 2.1), which are the points on
        Alphonso's budget constraint.

TABLE 2.1

Step 7. Notice that the slope of a budget constraint always shows the opportunity cost of the good which is on
the horizontal axis. For Alphonso, the slope is -0.25, indicating that for every bus ticket he buys, he must give up
1/4 burger. To phrase it differently, for every four tickets he buys, Alphonso must give up 1 burger.

There are two important observations here. First, the algebraic sign of the slope is negative, which means that
the only way to get more of one good is to give up some of the other. Second, we define the slope as the price of
bus tickets (whatever is on the horizontal axis in the graph) divided by the price of burgers (whatever is on the
vertical axis), in this case $0.50/$2 = 0.25. If you want to determine the opportunity cost quickly, just divide the
two prices.

Identifying Opportunity Cost

In many cases, it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the price. If your cousin buys a new bicycle for
$300, then $300 measures the amount of "other consumption" that he has forsaken. For practical purposes,
there may be no special need to identify the specific alternative product or products that he could have bought
with that $300, but sometimes the price as measured in dollars may not accurately capture the true
opportunity cost. This problem can loom especially large when costs of time are involved.

For example, consider a boss who decides that all employees will attend a two-day retreat to "build team
spirit." The out-of-pocket monetary cost of the event may involve hiring an outside consulting firm to run the
retreat, as well as room and board for all participants. However, an opportunity cost exists as well: during the
two days of the retreat, none of the employees are doing any other work.

Attending college is another case where the opportunity cost exceeds the monetary cost. The out-of-pocket
costs of attending college include tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. However, in addition,
during the hours that you are attending class and studying, it is impossible to work at a paying job. Thus,
college imposes both an out-of-pocket cost and an opportunity cost of lost earnings.

What is the opportunity cost associated with increased airport security measures?

After the terrorist plane hijackings on September 11, 2001, many steps were proposed to improve air travel safety.
For example, the federal government could provide armed "sky marshals" who would travel inconspicuously with
the rest of the passengers. The cost of having a sky marshal on every flight would be roughly $3 billion per year.
32 2 · Choice in a World of Scarcity

      Retrofitting all U.S. planes with reinforced cockpit doors to make it harder for terrorists to take over the plane would
      have a price tag of $450 million. Buying more sophisticated security equipment for airports, like three-dimensional
      baggage scanners and cameras linked to face recognition software, could cost another $2 billion.

      However, the single biggest cost of greater airline security does not involve spending money. It is the opportunity
      cost of additional waiting time at the airport. According to the United States Department of Transportation (DOT),
      there were 895.5 million systemwide (domestic and international) scheduled service passengers in 2015. Since the
      9/11 hijackings, security screening has become more intensive, and consequently, the procedure takes longer than
      in the past. Say that, on average, each air passenger spends an extra 30 minutes in the airport per trip. Economists
      commonly place a value on time to convert an opportunity cost in time into a monetary figure. Because many air
      travelers are relatively high-paid business people, conservative estimates set the average price of time for air
      travelers at $20 per hour. By these back-of-the-envelope calculations, the opportunity cost of delays in airports
      could be as much as 800 million × 0.5 hours × $20/hour, or $8 billion per year. Clearly, the opportunity costs of
      waiting time can be just as important as costs that involve direct spending.

      In some cases, realizing the opportunity cost can alter behavior. Imagine, for example, that you spend $8 on
      lunch every day at work. You may know perfectly well that bringing a lunch from home would cost only $3 a
      day, so the opportunity cost of buying lunch at the restaurant is $5 each day (that is, the $8 buying lunch costs
      minus the $3 your lunch from home would cost). Five dollars each day does not seem to be that much.
      However, if you project what that adds up to in a year--250 days a year × $5 per day equals $1,250, the cost,
      perhaps, of a decent vacation. If you describe the opportunity cost as "a nice vacation" instead of "$5 a day,"
      you might make different choices.

     Marginal Decision-Making and Diminishing Marginal Utility

      The budget constraint framework helps to emphasize that most choices in the real world are not about getting
      all of one thing or all of another; that is, they are not about choosing either the point at one end of the budget
      constraint or else the point all the way at the other end. Instead, most choices involve marginal analysis,
      which means examining the benefits and costs of choosing a little more or a little less of a good. People
      naturally compare costs and benefits, but often we look at total costs and total benefits, when the optimal
      choice necessitates comparing how costs and benefits change from one option to another. You might think of
      marginal analysis as "change analysis." Marginal analysis is used throughout economics.

      We now turn to the notion of utility. People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility those goods
      and services provide. Utility, as we will see in the chapter on Consumer Choices, is subjective but that does not
      make it less real. Economists typically assume that the more of some good one consumes (for example, slices
      of pizza), the more utility one obtains. At the same time, the utility a person receives from consuming the first
      unit of a good is typically more than the utility received from consuming the fifth or the tenth unit of that same
      good. When Alphonso chooses between burgers and bus tickets, for example, the first few bus rides that he
      chooses might provide him with a great deal of utility--perhaps they help him get to a job interview or a
      doctor's appointment. However, later bus rides might provide much less utility--they may only serve to kill
      time on a rainy day. Similarly, the first burger that Alphonso chooses to buy may be on a day when he missed
      breakfast and is ravenously hungry. However, if Alphonso has multiple burgers every day, the last few burgers
      may taste pretty boring. The general pattern that consumption of the first few units of any good tends to bring
      a higher level of utility to a person than consumption of later units is a common pattern. Economists refer to
      this pattern as the law of diminishing marginal utility, which means that as a person receives more of a good,
      the additional (or marginal) utility from each additional unit of the good declines. In other words, the first slice
      of pizza brings more satisfaction than the sixth.

      The law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all-or-nothing choices.
      You would not say, "My favorite food is ice cream, so I will eat nothing but ice cream from now on." Instead,
      even if you get a very high level of utility from your favorite food, if you ate it exclusively, the additional or

                                                                                          2.1 · How Individuals Make Choices Based on Their Budget Constraint 33

marginal utility from those last few servings would not be very high. Similarly, most workers do not say: "I
enjoy leisure, so I'll never work." Instead, workers recognize that even though some leisure is very nice, a
combination of all leisure and no income is not so attractive. The budget constraint framework suggests that
when people make choices in a world of scarcity, they will use marginal analysis and think about whether they
would prefer a little more or a little less.

A rational consumer would only purchase additional units of some product as long as the marginal utility
exceeds the opportunity cost. Suppose Alphonso moves down his budget constraint from Point A to Point B to
Point C and further. As he consumes more bus tickets, the marginal utility of bus tickets will diminish, while
the opportunity cost, that is, the marginal utility of foregone burgers, will increase. Eventually, the opportunity
cost will exceed the marginal utility of an additional bus ticket. If Alphonso is rational, he won't purchase more
bus tickets once the marginal utility just equals the opportunity cost. While we can't (yet) say exactly how many
bus tickets Alphonso will buy, that number is unlikely to be the most he can afford, 20.

Sunk Costs

In the budget constraint framework, all decisions involve what will happen next: that is, what quantities of
goods will you consume, how many hours will you work, or how much will you save. These decisions do not
look back to past choices. Thus, the budget constraint framework assumes that sunk costs, which are costs
that were incurred in the past and cannot be recovered, should not affect the current decision.

Consider the case of Selena, who pays $8 to see a movie, but after watching the film for 30 minutes, she knows
that it is truly terrible. Should she stay and watch the rest of the movie because she paid for the ticket, or
should she leave? The money she spent is a sunk cost, and unless the theater manager is sympathetic, Selena
will not get a refund. However, staying in the movie still means paying an opportunity cost in time. Her choice
is whether to spend the next 90 minutes suffering through a cinematic disaster or to do
something--anything--else. The lesson of sunk costs is to forget about the money and time that is irretrievably
gone and instead to focus on the marginal costs and benefits of current and future options.

For people and firms alike, dealing with sunk costs can be frustrating. It often means admitting an earlier error
in judgment. Many firms, for example, find it hard to give up on a new product that is doing poorly because
they spent so much money in creating and launching the product. However, the lesson of sunk costs is to
ignore them and make decisions based on what will happen in the future.

From a Model with Two Goods to One of Many Goods

The budget constraint diagram containing just two goods, like most models used in this book, is not realistic.
After all, in a modern economy people choose from thousands of goods. However, thinking about a model with
many goods is a straightforward extension of what we discussed here. Instead of drawing just one budget
constraint, showing the tradeoff between two goods, you can draw multiple budget constraints, showing the
possible tradeoffs between many different pairs of goods. In more advanced classes in economics, you would
use mathematical equations that include many possible goods and services that can be purchased, together
with their quantities and prices, and show how the total spending on all goods and services is limited to the
overall budget available. The graph with two goods that we presented here clearly illustrates that every choice
has an opportunity cost, which is the point that does carry over to the real world.

    2.2 The Production Possibilities Frontier and Social Choices

      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Interpret production possibilities frontier graphs
        · Contrast a budget constraint and a production possibilities frontier
        · Explain the relationship between a production possibilities frontier and the law of diminishing returns
        · Contrast productive efficiency and allocative efficiency
        · Define comparative advantage
      Just as individuals cannot have everything they want and must instead make choices, society as a whole
      cannot have everything it might want, either. This section of the chapter will explain the constraints society
      faces, using a model called the production possibilities frontier (PPF). There are more similarities than
      differences between individual choice and social choice. As you read this section, focus on the similarities.
      Because society has limited resources (e.g., labor, land, capital, raw materials) at any point in time, there is a
      limit to the quantities of goods and services it can produce. Suppose a society desires two products, healthcare
      and education. The production possibilities frontier in Figure 2.3 illustrates this situation.

      FIGURE 2.3 A Healthcare vs. Education Production Possibilities Frontier This production possibilities frontier
      shows a tradeoff between devoting social resources to healthcare and devoting them to education. At A all
      resources go to healthcare and at B, most go to healthcare. At D most resources go to education, and at F, all go to
      education.
      Figure 2.3 shows healthcare on the vertical axis and education on the horizontal axis. If the society were to
      allocate all of its resources to healthcare, it could produce at point A. However, it would not have any resources
      to produce education. If it were to allocate all of its resources to education, it could produce at point F.
      Alternatively, the society could choose to produce any combination of healthcare and education on the
      production possibilities frontier. In effect, the production possibilities frontier plays the same role for society
      as the budget constraint plays for Alphonso. Society can choose any combination of the two goods on or inside
      the PPF. However, it does not have enough resources to produce outside the PPF.
      Most importantly, the production possibilities frontier clearly shows the tradeoff between healthcare and
      education. Suppose society has chosen to operate at point B, and it is considering producing more education.
      Because the PPF is downward sloping from left to right, the only way society can obtain more education is by
      giving up some healthcare. That is the tradeoff society faces. Suppose it considers moving from point B to
      point C. What would the opportunity cost be for the additional education? The opportunity cost would be the
      healthcare society has to forgo. Just as with Alphonso's budget constraint, the slope of the production
      possibilities frontier shows the opportunity cost. By now you might be saying, "Hey, this PPF is sounding like
      the budget constraint." If so, read the following Clear It Up feature.

         CLEAR IT UP

What's the difference between a budget constraint and a PPF?

There are two major differences between a budget constraint and a production possibilities frontier. The first is the
fact that the budget constraint is a straight line. This is because its slope is given by the relative prices of the two
goods, which from the point of view of an individual consumer, are fixed, so the slope doesn't change. In contrast,
the PPF has a curved shape because of the law of the diminishing returns. Thus, the slope is different at various
points on the PPF. The second major difference is the absence of specific numbers on the axes of the PPF. There are
no specific numbers because we do not know the exact amount of resources this imaginary economy has, nor do we
know how many resources it takes to produce healthcare and how many resources it takes to produce education. If
this were a real world example, that data would be available.

Whether or not we have specific numbers, conceptually we can measure the opportunity cost of additional
education as society moves from point B to point C on the PPF. We measure the additional education by the
horizontal distance between B and C. The foregone healthcare is given by the vertical distance between B and C. The
slope of the PPF between B and C is (approximately) the vertical distance (the "rise") over the horizontal distance
(the "run"). This is the opportunity cost of the additional education.

The PPF and the Law of Increasing Opportunity Cost

The budget constraints that we presented earlier in this chapter, showing individual choices about what
quantities of goods to consume, were all straight lines. The reason for these straight lines was that the relative
prices of the two goods in the consumption budget constraint determined the slope of the budget constraint.
However, we drew the production possibilities frontier for healthcare and education as a curved line. Why does
the PPF have a different shape?

To understand why the PPF is curved, start by considering point A at the top left-hand side of the PPF. At point
A, all available resources are devoted to healthcare and none are left for education. This situation would be
extreme and even ridiculous. For example, children are seeing a doctor every day, whether they are sick or not,
but not attending school. People are having cosmetic surgery on every part of their bodies, but no high school
or college education exists. Now imagine that some of these resources are diverted from healthcare to
education, so that the economy is at point B instead of point A. Diverting some resources away from A to B
causes relatively little reduction in health because the last few marginal dollars going into healthcare services
are not producing much additional gain in health. However, putting those marginal dollars into education,
which is completely without resources at point A, can produce relatively large gains. For this reason, the shape
of the PPF from A to B is relatively flat, representing a relatively small drop-off in health and a relatively large
gain in education.

Now consider the other end, at the lower right, of the production possibilities frontier. Imagine that society
starts at choice D, which is devoting nearly all resources to education and very few to healthcare, and moves to
point F, which is devoting all spending to education and none to healthcare. For the sake of concreteness, you
can imagine that in the movement from D to F, the last few doctors must become high school science teachers,
the last few nurses must become school librarians rather than dispensers of vaccinations, and the last few
emergency rooms are turned into kindergartens. The gains to education from adding these last few resources
to education are very small. However, the opportunity cost lost to health will be fairly large, and thus the slope
of the PPF between D and F is steep, showing a large drop in health for only a small gain in education.

The lesson is not that society is likely to make an extreme choice like devoting no resources to education at
point A or no resources to health at point F. Instead, the lesson is that the gains from committing additional
marginal resources to education depend on how much is already being spent. If on the one hand, very few
resources are currently committed to education, then an increase in resources used for education can bring
36 2 · Choice in a World of Scarcity

      relatively large gains. On the other hand, if a large number of resources are already committed to education,
      then committing additional resources will bring relatively smaller gains.
      This pattern is common enough that economists have given it a name: the law of increasing opportunity cost,
      which holds that as production of a good or service increases, the marginal opportunity cost of producing it
      increases as well. This happens because some resources are better suited for producing certain goods and
      services instead of others. When government spends a certain amount more on reducing crime, for example,
      the original increase in opportunity cost of reducing crime could be relatively small. However, additional
      increases typically cause relatively larger increases in the opportunity cost of reducing crime, and paying for
      enough police and security to reduce crime to nothing at all would be a tremendously high opportunity cost.
      The curvature of the production possibilities frontier shows that as we add more resources to education,
      moving from left to right along the horizontal axis, the original increase in opportunity cost is fairly small, but
      gradually increases. Thus, the slope of the PPF is relatively flat near the vertical-axis intercept. Conversely, as
      we add more resources to healthcare, moving from bottom to top on the vertical axis, the original declines in
      opportunity cost are fairly large, but again gradually diminish. Thus, the slope of the PPF is relatively steep
      near the horizontal-axis intercept. In this way, the law of increasing opportunity cost produces the outward-
      bending shape of the production possibilities frontier.

     Productive Efficiency and Allocative Efficiency

      The study of economics does not presume to tell a society what choice it should make along its production
      possibilities frontier. In a market-oriented economy with a democratic government, the choice will involve a
      mixture of decisions by individuals, firms, and government. However, economics can point out that some
      choices are unambiguously better than others. This observation is based on the concept of efficiency. In
      everyday usage, efficiency refers to lack of waste. An inefficient machine operates at high cost, while an
      efficient machine operates at lower cost, because it is not wasting energy or materials. An inefficient
      organization operates with long delays and high costs, while an efficient organization meets schedules, is
      focused, and performs within budget.
      The production possibilities frontier can illustrate two kinds of efficiency: productive efficiency and allocative
      efficiency. Figure 2.4 illustrates these ideas using a production possibilities frontier between healthcare and
      education.

      FIGURE 2.4 Productive and Allocative Efficiency Productive efficiency means it is impossible to produce more of
      one good without decreasing the quantity that is produced of another good. Thus, all choices along a given PPF like
      B, C, and D display productive efficiency, but R does not. Allocative efficiency means that the particular mix of goods
      being produced--that is, the specific choice along the production possibilities frontier--represents the allocation
      that society most desires.

       Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                      2.2 · The Production Possibilities Frontier and Social Choices 37

Productive efficiency means that, given the available inputs and technology, it is impossible to produce more
of one good without decreasing the quantity that is produced of another good. All choices on the PPF in Figure
2.4, including A, B, C, D, and F, display productive efficiency. As a firm moves from any one of these choices to
any other, either healthcare increases and education decreases or vice versa. However, any choice inside the
production possibilities frontier is productively inefficient and wasteful because it is possible to produce more
of one good, the other good, or some combination of both goods.

For example, point R is productively inefficient because it is possible at choice C to have more of both goods:
education on the horizontal axis is higher at point C than point R (E2 is greater than E1), and healthcare on the
vertical axis is also higher at point C than point R (H2 is great than H1).

We can show the particular mix of goods and services produced--that is, the specific combination of selected
healthcare and education along the production possibilities frontier--as a ray (line) from the origin to a specific
point on the PPF. Output mixes that had more healthcare (and less education) would have a steeper ray, while
those with more education (and less healthcare) would have a flatter ray.

Allocative efficiency means that the particular combination of goods and services on the production
possibility curve that a society produces represents the combination that society most desires. How to
determine what a society desires can be a controversial question, and is usually a discussion in political
science, sociology, and philosophy classes as well as in economics. At its most basic, allocative efficiency
means producers supply the quantity of each product that consumers demand. Only one of the productively
efficient choices will be the allocatively efficient choice for society as a whole.

Why Society Must Choose

In Welcome to Economics! we learned that every society faces the problem of scarcity, where limited resources
conflict with unlimited needs and wants. The production possibilities curve illustrates the choices involved in
this dilemma.

Every economy faces two situations in which it may be able to expand consumption of all goods. In the first
case, a society may discover that it has been using its resources inefficiently, in which case by improving
efficiency and producing on the production possibilities frontier, it can have more of all goods (or at least more
of some and less of none). In the second case, as resources grow over a period of years (e.g., more labor and
more capital), the economy grows. As it does, the production possibilities frontier for a society will tend to shift
outward and society will be able to afford more of all goods. In addition, over time, improvements in
technology can increase the level of production with given resources, and hence push out the PPF.

However, improvements in productive efficiency take time to discover and implement, and economic growth
happens only gradually. Thus, a society must choose between tradeoffs in the present. For government, this
process often involves trying to identify where additional spending could do the most good and where
reductions in spending would do the least harm. At the individual and firm level, the market economy
coordinates a process in which firms seek to produce goods and services in the quantity, quality, and price that
people want. However, for both the government and the market economy in the short term, increases in
production of one good typically mean offsetting decreases somewhere else in the economy.

The PPF and Comparative Advantage

While every society must choose how much of each good or service it should produce, it does not need to
produce every single good it consumes. Often how much of a good a country decides to produce depends on
how expensive it is to produce it versus buying it from a different country. As we saw earlier, the curvature of a
country's PPF gives us information about the tradeoff between devoting resources to producing one good
versus another. In particular, its slope gives the opportunity cost of producing one more unit of the good in the
x-axis in terms of the other good (in the y-axis). Countries tend to have different opportunity costs of producing
a specific good, either because of different climates, geography, technology, or skills.
38 2 · Choice in a World of Scarcity

      Suppose two countries, the US and Brazil, need to decide how much they will produce of two crops: sugar cane
      and wheat. Due to its climatic conditions, Brazil can produce quite a bit of sugar cane per acre but not much
      wheat. Conversely, the U.S. can produce large amounts of wheat per acre, but not much sugar cane. Clearly,
      Brazil has a lower opportunity cost of producing sugar cane (in terms of wheat) than the U.S. The reverse is
      also true: the U.S. has a lower opportunity cost of producing wheat than Brazil. We illustrate this by the PPFs of
      the two countries in Figure 2.5.

      FIGURE 2.5 Production Possibility Frontier for the U.S. and Brazil The U.S. PPF is flatter than the Brazil PPF implying
      that the opportunity cost of wheat in terms of sugar cane is lower in the U.S. than in Brazil. Conversely, the
      opportunity cost of sugar cane is lower in Brazil. The U.S. has comparative advantage in wheat and Brazil has
      comparative advantage in sugar cane.
      When a country can produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than another country, we say that this country
      has a comparative advantage in that good. Comparative advantage is not the same as absolute advantage,
      which is when a country can produce more of a good. In our example, Brazil has an absolute advantage in
      sugar cane and the U.S. has an absolute advantage in wheat. One can easily see this with a simple observation
      of the extreme production points in the PPFs of the two countries. If Brazil devoted all of its resources to
      producing wheat, it would be producing at point A. If however it had devoted all of its resources to producing
      sugar cane instead, it would be producing a much larger amount than the U.S., at point B.
      The slope of the PPF gives the opportunity cost of producing an additional unit of wheat. While the slope is not
      constant throughout the PPFs, it is quite apparent that the PPF in Brazil is much steeper than in the U.S., and
      therefore the opportunity cost of wheat is generally higher in Brazil. In the chapter on International Trade you
      will learn that countries' differences in comparative advantage determine which goods they will choose to
      produce and trade. When countries engage in trade, they specialize in the production of the goods in which
      they have comparative advantage, and trade part of that production for goods in which they do not have
      comparative advantage. With trade, manufacturers produce goods where the opportunity cost is lowest, so
      total production increases, benefiting both trading parties.

2.3 Confronting Objections to the Economic Approach

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Analyze arguments against economic approaches to decision-making
  · Interpret a tradeoff diagram
  · Contrast normative statements and positive statements

It is one thing to understand the economic approach to decision-making and another thing to feel comfortable
applying it. The sources of discomfort typically fall into two categories: that people do not act in the way that
fits the economic way of thinking, and that even if people did act that way, they should try not to. Let's consider
these arguments in turn.

First Objection: People, Firms, and Society Do Not Act Like This

The economic approach to decision-making seems to require more information than most individuals possess
and more careful decision-making than most individuals actually display. After all, do you or any of your
friends draw a budget constraint and mutter to yourself about maximizing utility before you head to the
shopping mall? Do members of the U.S. Congress contemplate production possibilities frontiers before they
vote on the annual budget? The messy ways in which people and societies operate somehow doesn't look much
like neat budget constraints or smoothly curving production possibilities frontiers.

However, the economics approach can be a useful way to analyze and understand the tradeoffs of economic
decisions. To appreciate this point, imagine for a moment that you are playing basketball, dribbling to the
right, and throwing a bounce-pass to the left to a teammate who is running toward the basket. A physicist or
engineer could work out the correct speed and trajectory for the pass, given the different movements involved
and the weight and bounciness of the ball. However, when you are playing basketball, you do not perform any
of these calculations. You just pass the ball, and if you are a good player, you will do so with high accuracy.

Someone might argue: "The scientist's formula of the bounce-pass requires a far greater knowledge of physics
and far more specific information about speeds of movement and weights than the basketball player actually
has, so it must be an unrealistic description of how basketball passes actually occur." This reaction would be
wrongheaded. The fact that a good player can throw the ball accurately because of practice and skill, without
making a physics calculation, does not mean that the physics calculation is wrong.

Similarly, from an economic point of view, someone who shops for groceries every week has a great deal of
practice with how to purchase the combination of goods that will provide that person with utility, even if the
shopper does not phrase decisions in terms of a budget constraint. Government institutions may work
imperfectly and slowly, but in general, a democratic form of government feels pressure from voters and social
institutions to make the choices that are most widely preferred by people in that society. Thus, when thinking
about the economic actions of groups of people, firms, and society, it is reasonable, as a first approximation, to
analyze them with the tools of economic analysis. For more on this, read about behavioral economics in the
chapter on Consumer Choices.

Second Objection: People, Firms, and Society Should Not Act This Way

The economics approach portrays people as self-interested. For some critics of this approach, even if self-
interest is an accurate description of how people behave, these behaviors are not moral. Instead, the critics
argue that people should be taught to care more deeply about others. Economists offer several answers to
these concerns.

First, economics is not a form of moral instruction. Rather, it seeks to describe economic behavior as it actually
exists. Philosophers draw a distinction between positive statements, which describe the world as it is, and
normative statements, which describe how the world should be. Positive statements are factual. They may be
true or false, but we can test them, at least in principle. Normative statements are subjective questions of

      opinion. We cannot test them since we cannot prove opinions to be true or false. They just are opinions based
      on one's values. For example, an economist could analyze a proposed subway system in a certain city. If the
      expected benefits exceed the costs, he concludes that the project is worthy--an example of positive analysis.
      Another economist argues for extended unemployment compensation during the COVID-19 pandemic
      because a rich country like the United States should take care of its less fortunate citizens--an example of
      normative analysis.

      Even if the line between positive and normative statements is not always crystal clear, economic analysis does
      try to remain rooted in the study of the actual people who inhabit the actual economy. Fortunately however, the
      assumption that individuals are purely self-interested is a simplification about human nature. In fact, we need
      to look no further than to Adam Smith, the very father of modern economics to find evidence of this. The
     opening sentence of his book, The Theory of Moral Sentiments, puts it very clearly: "How selfish soever man
      may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of
      others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of
      seeing it." Clearly, individuals are both self-interested and altruistic.

      Second, we can label self-interested behavior and profit-seeking with other names, such as personal choice
      and freedom. The ability to make personal choices about buying, working, and saving is an important personal
      freedom. Some people may choose high-pressure, high-paying jobs so that they can earn and spend
      considerable amounts of money on themselves. Others may allocate large portions of their earnings to charity
      or spend it on their friends and family. Others may devote themselves to a career that can require much time,
      energy, and expertise but does not offer high financial rewards, like being an elementary school teacher or a
      social worker. Still others may choose a job that does consume much of their time or provide a high level of
      income, but still leaves time for family, friends, and contemplation. Some people may prefer to work for a large
      company; others might want to start their own business. People's freedom to make their own economic choices
      has a moral value worth respecting.

     Is a diagram by any other name the same?

      When you study economics, you may feel buried under an avalanche of diagrams. Your goal should be to recognize
      the common underlying logic and pattern of the diagrams, not to memorize each one.

      This chapter uses only one basic diagram, although we present it with different sets of labels. The consumption
      budget constraint and the production possibilities frontier for society, as a whole, are the same basic diagram.
      Figure 2.6 shows an individual budget constraint and a production possibilities frontier for two goods, Good 1 and
      Good 2. The tradeoff diagram always illustrates three basic themes: scarcity, tradeoffs, and economic efficiency.

      The first theme is scarcity. It is not feasible to have unlimited amounts of both goods. Even if the budget constraint
      or a PPF shifts, scarcity remains--just at a different level. The second theme is tradeoffs. As depicted in the budget
      constraint or the production possibilities frontier, it is necessary to forgo some of one good to gain more of the other
      good. The details of this tradeoff vary. In a budget constraint we determine, the tradeoff is determined by the
      relative prices of the goods: that is, the relative price of two goods in the consumption choice budget constraint.
      These tradeoffs appear as a straight line. However, a curved line represents the tradeoffs in many production
      possibilities frontiers because the law of diminishing returns holds that as we add resources to an area, the marginal
      gains tend to diminish. Regardless of the specific shape, tradeoffs remain.

      The third theme is economic efficiency, or getting the most benefit from scarce resources. All choices on the
      production possibilities frontier show productive efficiency because in such cases, there is no way to increase the
      quantity of one good without decreasing the quantity of the other. Similarly, when an individual makes a choice
      along a budget constraint, there is no way to increase the quantity of one good without decreasing the quantity of
      the other. The choice on a production possibilities set that is socially preferred, or the choice on an individual's

budget constraint that is personally preferred, will display allocative efficiency.
The basic budget constraint/production possibilities frontier diagram will recur throughout this book. Some
examples include using these tradeoff diagrams to analyze trade, environmental protection and economic output,
equality of incomes and economic output, and the macroeconomic tradeoff between consumption and investment.
Do not allow the different labels to confuse you. The budget constraint/production possibilities frontier diagram is
always just a tool for thinking carefully about scarcity, tradeoffs, and efficiency in a particular situation.

FIGURE 2.6 The Tradeoff Diagram Both the individual opportunity set (or budget constraint) and the social
production possibilities frontier show the constraints under which individual consumers and society as a whole
operate. Both diagrams show the tradeoff in choosing more of one good at the cost of less of the other.

Third, self-interested behavior can lead to positive social results. For example, when people work hard to make
a living, they create economic output. Consumers who are looking for the best deals will encourage businesses
to offer goods and services that meet their needs. Adam Smith, writing in The Wealth of Nations, named this
property the invisible hand. In describing how consumers and producers interact in a market economy, Smith
wrote:

      Every individual...generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how
      much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends
      only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the
      greatest value, he intends only his own gain. And he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an
      invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention...By pursuing his own interest he
      frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it.
The metaphor of the invisible hand suggests the remarkable possibility that broader social good can emerge
from selfish individual actions.
Fourth, even people who focus on their own self-interest in the economic part of their life often set aside their
own narrow self-interest in other parts of life. For example, you might focus on your own self-interest when
asking your employer for a raise or negotiating to buy a car. Then you might turn around and focus on other
people when you volunteer to read stories at the local library, help a friend move to a new apartment, or donate
money to a charity. Self-interest is a reasonable starting point for analyzing many economic decisions, without
needing to imply that people never do anything that is not in their own immediate self-interest.

     Choices ... to What Degree?

      What have we learned? We know that scarcity impacts all the choices we make. An economist might argue that
      people do not obtain a bachelor's or master's degree because they do not have the resources to make those choices
      or because their incomes are too low and/or the price of these degrees is too high. A bachelor's or a master's degree
      may not be available in their opportunity set.
      The price of these degrees may be too high not only because the actual price, college tuition (and perhaps room and
      board), is too high. An economist might also say that for many people, the full opportunity cost of a bachelor's or a
      master's degree is too high. For these people, they are unwilling or unable to make the tradeoff of forfeiting years of
      working, and earning an income, to earn a degree.
      Finally, the statistics we introduced at the start of the chapter reveal information about intertemporal choices. An
      economist might say that people choose not to obtain a college degree because they may have to borrow money to
      attend college, and the interest they have to pay on that loan in the future will affect their decisions today. Also, it
      could be that some people have a preference for current consumption over future consumption, so they choose to
      work now at a lower salary and consume now, rather than postponing that consumption until after they graduate
      college.

Key Concepts and Summary

2.1 How Individuals Make Choices Based on Their Budget Constraint

Economists see the real world as one of scarcity: that is, a world in which people's desires exceed what is
possible. As a result, economic behavior involves tradeoffs in which individuals, firms, and society must forgo
something that they desire to obtain things that they desire more. Individuals face the tradeoff of what
quantities of goods and services to consume. The budget constraint, which is the frontier of the opportunity
set, illustrates the range of available choices. The relative price of the choices determines the slope of the
budget constraint. Choices beyond the budget constraint are not affordable.

Opportunity cost measures cost by what we forgo in exchange. Sometimes we can measure opportunity cost in
money, but it is often useful to consider time as well, or to measure it in terms of the actual resources that we
must forfeit.

Most economic decisions and tradeoffs are not all-or-nothing. Instead, they involve marginal analysis, which
means they are about decisions on the margin, involving a little more or a little less. The law of diminishing
marginal utility points out that as a person receives more of something--whether it is a specific good or
another resource--the additional marginal gains tend to become smaller. Because sunk costs occurred in the
past and cannot be recovered, they should be disregarded in making current decisions.

2.2 The Production Possibilities Frontier and Social Choices

A production possibilities frontier defines the set of choices society faces for the combinations of goods and
services it can produce given the resources and the technology that are available. The shape of the PPF is
typically curved outward, rather than straight. Choices outside the PPF are unattainable and choices inside the
44 2 · Self-Check Questions

PPF are wasteful. Over time, a growing economy will tend to shift the PPF outwards.

The law of diminishing returns holds that as increments of additional resources are devoted to producing
something, the marginal increase in output will become increasingly smaller. All choices along a production
possibilities frontier display productive efficiency; that is, it is impossible to use society's resources to produce
more of one good without decreasing production of the other good. The specific choice along a production
possibilities frontier that reflects the mix of goods society prefers is the choice with allocative efficiency. The
curvature of the PPF is likely to differ by country, which results in different countries having comparative
advantage in different goods. Total production can increase if countries specialize in the goods in which they
have comparative advantage and trade some of their production for the remaining goods.

2.3 Confronting Objections to the Economic Approach

The economic way of thinking provides a useful approach to understanding human behavior. Economists
make the careful distinction between positive statements, which describe the world as it is, and normative
statements, which describe how the world should be. Even when economics analyzes the gains and losses from
various events or policies, and thus draws normative conclusions about how the world should be, the analysis
of economics is rooted in a positive analysis of how people, firms, and governments actually behave, not how
they should behave.

Why Can We Not Get Enough of Organic Foods?

Organic food is increasingly popular, not just in the United States, but worldwide. At one time, consumers had to go
to specialty stores or farmers' markets to find organic produce. Now it is available in most grocery stores. In short,
48 3 · Demand and Supply

      organic has become part of the mainstream.

      Ever wonder why organic food costs more than conventional food? Why, say, does an organic Fuji apple cost $2.75 a
      pound, while its conventional counterpart costs $1.72 a pound? The same price relationship is true for just about
      every organic product on the market. If many organic foods are locally grown, would they not take less time to get to
      market and therefore be cheaper? What are the forces that keep those prices from coming down? Turns out those
      forces have quite a bit to do with this chapter's topic: demand and supply.

      An auction bidder pays thousands of dollars for a dress Whitney Houston wore. A collector spends a small
      fortune for a few drawings by John Lennon. People usually react to purchases like these in two ways: their jaw
      drops because they think these are high prices to pay for such goods or they think these are rare, desirable
      items and the amount paid seems right.

      for their ties to celebrities. These examples represent an interesting facet of demand and supply.

      When economists talk about prices, they are less interested in making judgments than in gaining a practical
      understanding of what determines prices and why prices change. Consider a price most of us contend with
      weekly: that of a gallon of gas. Why was the average price of gasoline in the United States $3.16 per gallon in
      June of 2020? Why did the price for gasoline fall sharply to $2.42 per gallon by January of 2021? To explain
      these price movements, economists focus on the determinants of what gasoline buyers are willing to pay and
      what gasoline sellers are willing to accept.

      As it turns out, the price of gasoline in June of any given year is nearly always higher than the price in January
      of that same year. Over recent decades, gasoline prices in midsummer have averaged about 10 cents per gallon
      more than their midwinter low. The likely reason is that people drive more in the summer, and are also willing
      to pay more for gas, but that does not explain how steeply gas prices fell. Other factors were at work during
      those 18 months, such as increases in supply and decreases in the demand for crude oil.

      This chapter introduces the economic model of demand and supply--one of the most powerful models in all of
      economics. The discussion here begins by examining how demand and supply determine the price and the
      quantity sold in markets for goods and services, and how changes in demand and supply lead to changes in
      prices and quantities.

    3.1 Demand, Supply, and Equilibrium in Markets for Goods and Services

      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Explain demand, quantity demanded, and the law of demand
        · Explain supply, quantity supplied, and the law of supply
        · Identify a demand curve and a supply curve
        · Explain equilibrium, equilibrium price, and equilibrium quantity

      First let's first focus on what economists mean by demand, what they mean by supply, and then how demand
      and supply interact in a market.

     Demand for Goods and Services

      Economists use the term demand to refer to the amount of some good or service consumers are willing and
      able to purchase at each price. Demand is fundamentally based on needs and wants--if you have no need or
      want for something, you won't buy it. While a consumer may be able to differentiate between a need and a
      want, from an economist's perspective they are the same thing. Demand is also based on ability to pay. If you

       Access for free at openstax.org
            3.1 · Demand, Supply, and Equilibrium in Markets for Goods and Services 49

cannot pay for it, you have no effective demand. By this definition, a person who does not have a drivers
license has no effective demand for a car.

What a buyer pays for a unit of the specific good or service is called price. The total number of units that
consumers would purchase at that price is called the quantity demanded. A rise in price of a good or service
almost always decreases the quantity demanded of that good or service. Conversely, a fall in price will increase
the quantity demanded. When the price of a gallon of gasoline increases, for example, people look for ways to
reduce their consumption by combining several errands, commuting by carpool or mass transit, or taking
weekend or vacation trips closer to home. Economists call this inverse relationship between price and quantity
demanded the law of demand. The law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand (which
we explain in the next module) are held constant.

We can show an example from the market for gasoline in a table or a graph. Economists call a table that shows
the quantity demanded at each price, such as Table 3.1, a demand schedule. In this case we measure price in
dollars per gallon of gasoline. We measure the quantity demanded in millions of gallons over some time period
(for example, per day or per year) and over some geographic area (like a state or a country). A demand curve
shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded on a graph like Figure 3.2, with quantity on the
horizontal axis and the price per gallon on the vertical axis. (Note that this is an exception to the normal rule in
mathematics that the independent variable (x) goes on the horizontal axis and the dependent variable (y) goes
on the vertical axis. While economists often use math, they are different disciplines.)

Table 3.1 shows the demand schedule and the graph in Figure 3.2 shows the demand curve. These are two
ways to describe the same relationship between price and quantity demanded.

      FIGURE 3.2 A Demand Curve for Gasoline The demand schedule shows that as price rises, quantity demanded
      decreases, and vice versa. We graph these points, and the line connecting them is the demand curve (D). The
      downward slope of the demand curve again illustrates the law of demand--the inverse relationship between prices
      and quantity demanded.
      Demand curves will appear somewhat different for each product. They may appear relatively steep or flat, or
      they may be straight or curved. Nearly all demand curves share the fundamental similarity that they slope
      down from left to right. Demand curves embody the law of demand: As the price increases, the quantity
      demanded decreases, and conversely, as the price decreases, the quantity demanded increases.

              CLEAR IT UP
     Is demand the same as quantity demanded?

      In economic terminology, demand is not the same as quantity demanded. When economists talk about demand,
      they mean the relationship between a range of prices and the quantities demanded at those prices, as illustrated by
      a demand curve or a demand schedule. When economists talk about quantity demanded, they mean only a certain
      point on the demand curve, or one quantity on the demand schedule. In short, demand refers to the curve and
      quantity demanded refers to a (specific) point on the curve.

     Supply of Goods and Services

      When economists talk about supply, they mean the amount of some good or service a producer is willing to
      supply at each price. Price is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service. A rise in price
      almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of that good or service, while a fall in price will
      decrease the quantity supplied. When the price of gasoline rises, for example, it encourages profit-seeking
      firms to take several actions: expand exploration for oil reserves; drill for more oil; invest in more pipelines
      and oil tankers to bring the oil to plants for refining into gasoline; build new oil refineries; purchase additional
      pipelines and trucks to ship the gasoline to gas stations; and open more gas stations or keep existing gas
      stations open longer hours. Economists call this positive relationship between price and quantity
      supplied--that a higher price leads to a higher quantity supplied and a lower price leads to a lower quantity
      supplied--the law of supply. The law of supply assumes that all other variables that affect supply (to be
      explained in the next module) are held constant.

Is supply the same as quantity supplied?

In economic terminology, supply is not the same as quantity supplied. When economists refer to supply, they mean
the relationship between a range of prices and the quantities supplied at those prices, a relationship that we can
illustrate with a supply curve or a supply schedule. When economists refer to quantity supplied, they mean only a
certain point on the supply curve, or one quantity on the supply schedule. In short, supply refers to the curve and
quantity supplied refers to a (specific) point on the curve.

Figure 3.3 illustrates the law of supply, again using the market for gasoline as an example. Like demand, we
can illustrate supply using a table or a graph. A supply schedule is a table, like Table 3.2, that shows the
quantity supplied at a range of different prices. Again, we measure price in dollars per gallon of gasoline and
we measure quantity supplied in millions of gallons. A supply curve is a graphic illustration of the relationship
between price, shown on the vertical axis, and quantity, shown on the horizontal axis. The supply schedule and
the supply curve are just two different ways of showing the same information. Notice that the horizontal and
vertical axes on the graph for the supply curve are the same as for the demand curve.

FIGURE 3.3 A Supply Curve for Gasoline The supply schedule is the table that shows quantity supplied of gasoline
at each price. As price rises, quantity supplied also increases, and vice versa. The supply curve (S) is created by
graphing the points from the supply schedule and then connecting them. The upward slope of the supply curve
illustrates the law of supply--that a higher price leads to a higher quantity supplied, and vice versa.

                          TABLE 3.2 Price and Supply of Gasoline

The shape of supply curves will vary somewhat according to the product: steeper, flatter, straighter, or curved.
Nearly all supply curves, however, share a basic similarity: they slope up from left to right and illustrate the law
of supply: as the price rises, say, from $1.00 per gallon to $2.20 per gallon, the quantity supplied increases
from 500 gallons to 720 gallons. Conversely, as the price falls, the quantity supplied decreases.

Equilibrium--Where Demand and Supply Intersect

Because the graphs for demand and supply curves both have price on the vertical axis and quantity on the
horizontal axis, the demand curve and supply curve for a particular good or service can appear on the same
graph. Together, demand and supply determine the price and the quantity that will be bought and sold in a
market.

Figure 3.4 illustrates the interaction of demand and supply in the market for gasoline. The demand curve (D) is
identical to Figure 3.2. The supply curve (S) is identical to Figure 3.3. Table 3.3 contains the same information
in tabular form.

FIGURE 3.4 Demand and Supply for Gasoline The demand curve (D) and the supply curve (S) intersect at the
equilibrium point E, with a price of $1.40 and a quantity of 600. The equilibrium price is the only price where
quantity demanded is equal to quantity supplied. At a price above equilibrium like $1.80, quantity supplied exceeds
the quantity demanded, so there is excess supply. At a price below equilibrium such as $1.20, quantity demanded
exceeds quantity supplied, so there is excess demand.

TABLE 3.3 Price, Quantity Demanded, and Quantity Supplied

Remember this: When two lines on a diagram cross, this intersection usually means something. The point
where the supply curve (S) and the demand curve (D) cross, designated by point E in Figure 3.4, is called the
equilibrium. The equilibrium price is the only price where the plans of consumers and the plans of producers
agree--that is, where the amount of the product consumers want to buy (quantity demanded) is equal to the
amount producers want to sell (quantity supplied). Economists call this common quantity the equilibrium
quantity. At any other price, the quantity demanded does not equal the quantity supplied, so the market is not
in equilibrium at that price.

In Figure 3.4, the equilibrium price is $1.40 per gallon of gasoline and the equilibrium quantity is 600 million
gallons. If you had only the demand and supply schedules, and not the graph, you could find the equilibrium by
looking for the price level on the tables where the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied are equal.

The word "equilibrium" means "balance." If a market is at its equilibrium price and quantity, then it has no
reason to move away from that point. However, if a market is not at equilibrium, then economic pressures arise
to move the market toward the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity.

Imagine, for example, that the price of a gallon of gasoline was above the equilibrium price--that is, instead of
$1.40 per gallon, the price is $1.80 per gallon. The dashed horizontal line at the price of $1.80 in Figure 3.4
illustrates this above-equilibrium price. At this higher price, the quantity demanded drops from 600 to 500.
This decline in quantity reflects how consumers react to the higher price by finding ways to use less gasoline.

Moreover, at this higher price of $1.80, the quantity of gasoline supplied rises from 600 to 680, as the higher
price makes it more profitable for gasoline producers to expand their output. Now, consider how quantity
demanded and quantity supplied are related at this above-equilibrium price. Quantity demanded has fallen to
500 gallons, while quantity supplied has risen to 680 gallons. In fact, at any above-equilibrium price, the
quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded. We call this an excess supply or a surplus.

With a surplus, gasoline accumulates at gas stations, in tanker trucks, in pipelines, and at oil refineries. This
accumulation puts pressure on gasoline sellers. If a surplus remains unsold, those firms involved in making
and selling gasoline are not receiving enough cash to pay their workers and to cover their expenses. In this
situation, some producers and sellers will want to cut prices, because it is better to sell at a lower price than not
to sell at all. Once some sellers start cutting prices, others will follow to avoid losing sales. These price
reductions in turn will stimulate a higher quantity demanded. Therefore, if the price is above the equilibrium
level, incentives built into the structure of demand and supply will create pressures for the price to fall toward
the equilibrium.

Now suppose that the price is below its equilibrium level at $1.20 per gallon, as the dashed horizontal line at
this price in Figure 3.4 shows. At this lower price, the quantity demanded increases from 600 to 700 as drivers
take longer trips, spend more minutes warming up the car in the driveway in wintertime, stop sharing rides to
work, and buy larger cars that get fewer miles to the gallon. However, the below-equilibrium price reduces
gasoline producers' incentives to produce and sell gasoline, and the quantity supplied falls from 600 to 550.
54 3 · Demand and Supply

      When the price is below equilibrium, there is excess demand, or a shortage--that is, at the given price the
      quantity demanded, which has been stimulated by the lower price, now exceeds the quantity supplied, which
      has been depressed by the lower price. In this situation, eager gasoline buyers mob the gas stations, only to
      find many stations running short of fuel. Oil companies and gas stations recognize that they have an
      opportunity to make higher profits by selling what gasoline they have at a higher price. As a result, the price
      rises toward the equilibrium level. Read Demand, Supply, and Efficiency for more discussion on the
      importance of the demand and supply model.

      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Identify factors that affect demand
        · Graph demand curves and demand shifts
        · Identify factors that affect supply
        · Graph supply curves and supply shifts

      The previous module explored how price affects the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied. The result
      was the demand curve and the supply curve. Price, however, is not the only factor that influences buyers' and
      sellers' decisions. For example, how is demand for vegetarian food affected if, say, health concerns cause more
      consumers to avoid eating meat? How is the supply of diamonds affected if diamond producers discover
      several new diamond mines? What are the major factors, in addition to the price, that influence demand or
      supply?

     What Factors Affect Demand?

      We defined demand as the amount of some product a consumer is willing and able to purchase at each price.
      That suggests at least two factors that affect demand. Willingness to purchase suggests a desire, based on what
      economists call tastes and preferences. If you neither need nor want something, you will not buy it, and if you
      really like something, you will buy more of it than someone who does not share your strong preference for it.
      Ability to purchase suggests that income is important. Professors are usually able to afford better housing and
      transportation than students, because they have more income. Prices of related goods can affect demand also.
      If you need a new car, the price of a Honda may affect your demand for a Ford. Finally, the size or composition
      of the population can affect demand. The more children a family has, the greater their demand for clothing.
      The more driving-age children a family has, the greater their demand for car insurance, and the less for
      diapers and baby formula.

      These factors matter for both individual and market demand as a whole. Exactly how do these various factors
     affect demand, and how do we show the effects graphically? To answer those questions, we need the ceteris
     paribus assumption.

    The Ceteris Paribus Assumption

      A demand curve or a supply curve is a relationship between two, and only two, variables: quantity on the
      horizontal axis and price on the vertical axis. The assumption behind a demand curve or a supply curve is that
      no relevant economic factors, other than the product's price, are changing. Economists call this assumption
      ceteris paribus, a Latin phrase meaning "other things being equal." Any given demand or supply curve is
     based on the ceteris paribus assumption that all else is held equal. A demand curve or a supply curve is a
      relationship between two, and only two, variables when all other variables are kept constant. If all else is not

held equal, then the laws of supply and demand will not necessarily hold, as the following Clear It Up feature
shows.

         CLEAR IT UP

When does ceteris paribus apply?

We typically apply ceteris paribus when we observe how changes in price affect demand or supply, but we can apply
ceteris paribus more generally. In the real world, demand and supply depend on more factors than just price. For
example, a consumer's demand depends on income and a producer's supply depends on the cost of producing the
product. How can we analyze the effect on demand or supply if multiple factors are changing at the same time--say
price rises and income falls? The answer is that we examine the changes one at a time, assuming the other factors
are held constant.

For example, we can say that an increase in the price reduces the amount consumers will buy (assuming income,
and anything else that affects demand, is unchanged). Additionally, a decrease in income reduces the amount
consumers can afford to buy (assuming price, and anything else that affects demand, is unchanged). This is what the
ceteris paribus assumption really means. In this particular case, after we analyze each factor separately, we can
combine the results. The amount consumers buy falls for two reasons: first because of the higher price and second
because of the lower income.

How Does Income Affect Demand?

Let's use income as an example of how factors other than price affect demand. Figure 3.5 shows the initial
demand for automobiles as D0. At point Q, for example, if the price is $20,000 per car, the quantity of cars
demanded is 18 million. D0 also shows how the quantity of cars demanded would change as a result of a higher
or lower price. For example, if the price of a car rose to $22,000, the quantity demanded would decrease to 17
million, at point R.

The original demand curve D0, like every demand curve, is based on the ceteris paribus assumption that no
other economically relevant factors change. Now imagine that the economy expands in a way that raises the
incomes of many people, making cars more affordable. How will this affect demand? How can we show this
graphically?

Return to Figure 3.5. The price of cars is still $20,000, but with higher incomes, the quantity demanded has
now increased to 20 million cars, shown at point S. As a result of the higher income levels, the demand curve
shifts to the right to the new demand curve D1, indicating an increase in demand. Table 3.4 shows clearly that
this increased demand would occur at every price, not just the original one.
56 3 · Demand and Supply

FIGURE 3.5 Shifts in Demand: A Car Example Increased demand means that at every given price, the quantity
demanded is higher, so that the demand curve shifts to the right from D0 to D1. Decreased demand means that at
every given price, the quantity demanded is lower, so that the demand curve shifts to the left from D0 to D2.

Price Decrease to D2 Original Quantity Demanded D0 Increase to D1

$16,000 17.6 million             22.0 million     24.0 million

$18,000 16.0 million             20.0 million     22.0 million

$20,000 14.4 million             18.0 million     20.0 million

$22,000 13.6 million             17.0 million     19.0 million

$24,000 13.2 million             16.5 million     18.5 million

$26,000 12.8 million             16.0 million     18.0 million

TABLE 3.4 Price and Demand Shifts: A Car Example

Now, imagine that the economy slows down so that many people lose their jobs or work fewer hours, reducing
their incomes. In this case, the decrease in income would lead to a lower quantity of cars demanded at every
given price, and the original demand curve D0 would shift left to D2. The shift from D0 to D2 represents such a
decrease in demand: At any given price level, the quantity demanded is now lower. In this example, a price of
$20,000 means 18 million cars sold along the original demand curve, but only 14.4 million sold after demand
fell.

When a demand curve shifts, it does not mean that the quantity demanded by every individual buyer changes
by the same amount. In this example, not everyone would have higher or lower income and not everyone
would buy or not buy an additional car. Instead, a shift in a demand curve captures a pattern for the market as
a whole.

In the previous section, we argued that higher income causes greater demand at every price. This is true for
most goods and services. For some--luxury cars, vacations in Europe, and fine jewelry--the effect of a rise in
income can be especially pronounced. A product whose demand rises when income rises, and vice versa, is
called a normal good. A few exceptions to this pattern do exist. As incomes rise, many people will buy fewer

generic brand groceries and more name brand groceries. They are less likely to buy used cars and more likely
to buy new cars. They will be less likely to rent an apartment and more likely to own a home. A product whose
demand falls when income rises, and vice versa, is called an inferior good. In other words, when income
increases, the demand curve shifts to the left.

Other Factors That Shift Demand Curves

Income is not the only factor that causes a shift in demand. Other factors that change demand include tastes
and preferences, the composition or size of the population, the prices of related goods, and even expectations.
A change in any one of the underlying factors that determine what quantity people are willing to buy at a given
price will cause a shift in demand. Graphically, the new demand curve lies either to the right (an increase) or to
the left (a decrease) of the original demand curve. Let's look at these factors.

Changing Tastes or Preferences

From 1980 to 2021, the per-person consumption of chicken by Americans rose from 47 pounds per year to 97
pounds per year, and consumption of beef fell from 76 pounds per year to 59 pounds per year, according to the
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Changes like these are largely due to movements in taste, which
change the quantity of a good demanded at every price: that is, they shift the demand curve for that good,
rightward for chicken and leftward for beef.

Changes in the Composition of the Population

The proportion of elderly citizens in the United States population is rising. It rose from 9.8% in 1970 to 12.6%
in 2000, and will be a projected (by the U.S. Census Bureau) 20% of the population by 2030. A society with
relatively more children, like the United States in the 1960s, will have greater demand for goods and services
like tricycles and day care facilities. A society with relatively more elderly persons, as the United States is
projected to have by 2030, has a higher demand for nursing homes and hearing aids. Similarly, changes in the
size of the population can affect the demand for housing and many other goods. Each of these changes in
demand will be shown as a shift in the demand curve.

Changes in the Prices of Related Goods

Changes in the prices of related goods such as substitutes or complements also can affect the demand for a
product. A substitute is a good or service that we can use in place of another good or service. As electronic
books, like this one, become more available, you would expect to see a decrease in demand for traditional
printed books. A lower price for a substitute decreases demand for the other product. For example, in recent
years as the price of tablet computers has fallen, the quantity demanded has increased (because of the law of
demand). Since people are purchasing tablets, there has been a decrease in demand for laptops, which we can
show graphically as a leftward shift in the demand curve for laptops. A higher price for a substitute good has
the reverse effect.

Other goods are complements for each other, meaning we often use the goods together, because consumption
of one good tends to enhance consumption of the other. Examples include breakfast cereal and milk;
notebooks and pens or pencils, golf balls and golf clubs; gasoline and sport utility vehicles; and the five-way
combination of bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, and bread. If the price of golf clubs rises, since the
quantity demanded of golf clubs falls (because of the law of demand), demand for a complement good like golf
balls decreases, too. Similarly, a higher price for skis would shift the demand curve for a complement good like
ski resort trips to the left, while a lower price for a complement has the reverse effect.

Changes in Expectations about Future Prices or Other Factors that Affect Demand

While it is clear that the price of a good affects the quantity demanded, it is also true that expectations about
the future price (or expectations about tastes and preferences, income, and so on) can affect demand. For
example, if people hear that a hurricane is coming, they may rush to the store to buy flashlight batteries and
bottled water. If people learn that the price of a good like coffee is likely to rise in the future, they may head for
58 3 · Demand and Supply

      the store to stock up on coffee now. We show these changes in demand as shifts in the curve. Therefore, a shift
      in demand happens when a change in some economic factor (other than price) causes a different quantity to
      be demanded at every price. The following Work It Out feature shows how this happens.

                                                                                                               WORK IT OUT
      Shift in Demand

        A shift in demand means that at any price (and at every price), the quantity demanded will be different than it
        was before. Following is an example of a shift in demand due to an income increase.
        Step 1. Draw the graph of a demand curve for a normal good like pizza. Pick a price (like P0). Identify the
        corresponding Q0. See an example in Figure 3.6.

        FIGURE 3.6 Demand Curve We can use the demand curve to identify how much consumers would buy at any
        given price.
        Step 2. Suppose income increases. As a result of the change, are consumers going to buy more or less pizza? The
        answer is more. Draw a dotted horizontal line from the chosen price, through the original quantity demanded, to
        the new point with the new Q1. Draw a dotted vertical line down to the horizontal axis and label the new Q1.
        Figure 3.7 provides an example.

        FIGURE 3.7 Demand Curve with Income Increase With an increase in income, consumers will purchase larger
        quantities, pushing demand to the right.
        Step 3. Now, shift the curve through the new point. You will see that an increase in income causes an upward (or
        rightward) shift in the demand curve, so that at any price the quantities demanded will be higher, as Figure 3.8
        illustrates.

  FIGURE 3.8 Demand Curve Shifted Right With an increase in income, consumers will purchase larger quantities,
  pushing demand to the right, and causing the demand curve to shift right.

Summing Up Factors That Change Demand

Figure 3.9 summarizes six factors that can shift demand curves. The direction of the arrows indicates whether
the demand curve shifts represent an increase in demand or a decrease in demand. Notice that a change in the
price of the good or service itself is not listed among the factors that can shift a demand curve. A change in the
price of a good or service causes a movement along a specific demand curve, and it typically leads to some
change in the quantity demanded, but it does not shift the demand curve.

FIGURE 3.9 Factors That Shift Demand Curves (a) A list of factors that can cause an increase in demand from D0 to
D1. (b) The same factors, if their direction is reversed, can cause a decrease in demand from D0 to D1.
When a demand curve shifts, it will then intersect with a given supply curve at a different equilibrium price
and quantity. We are, however, getting ahead of our story. Before discussing how changes in demand can affect
equilibrium price and quantity, we first need to discuss shifts in supply curves.

How Production Costs Affect Supply

A supply curve shows how quantity supplied will change as the price rises and falls, assuming ceteris paribus
so that no other economically relevant factors are changing. If other factors relevant to supply do change, then
the entire supply curve will shift. Just as we described a shift in demand as a change in the quantity demanded
at every price, a shift in supply means a change in the quantity supplied at every price.
In thinking about the factors that affect supply, remember what motivates firms: profits, which are the
difference between revenues and costs. A firm produces goods and services using combinations of labor,
materials, and machinery, or what we call inputs or factors of production. If a firm faces lower costs of
production, while the prices for the good or service the firm produces remain unchanged, a firm's profits go
60 3 · Demand and Supply

      up. When a firm's profits increase, it is more motivated to produce output, since the more it produces the more
      profit it will earn. When costs of production fall, a firm will tend to supply a larger quantity at any given price
      for its output. We can show this by the supply curve shifting to the right.

      Take, for example, a messenger company that delivers packages around a city. The company may find that
      buying gasoline is one of its main costs. If the price of gasoline falls, then the company will find it can deliver
      messages more cheaply than before. Since lower costs correspond to higher profits, the messenger company
      may now supply more of its services at any given price. For example, given the lower gasoline prices, the
      company can now serve a greater area, and increase its supply.

      Conversely, if a firm faces higher costs of production, then it will earn lower profits at any given selling price for
      its products. As a result, a higher cost of production typically causes a firm to supply a smaller quantity at any
      given price. In this case, the supply curve shifts to the left.

      Consider the supply for cars, shown by curve S0 in Figure 3.10. Point J indicates that if the price is $20,000, the
     quantity supplied will be 18 million cars. If the price rises to $22,000 per car, ceteris paribus, the quantity
      supplied will rise to 20 million cars, as point K on the S0 curve shows. We can show the same information in
      table form, as in Table 3.5.

FIGURE 3.10 Shifts in Supply: A Car Example Decreased supply means that at every given price, the quantity
supplied is lower, so that the supply curve shifts to the left, from S0 to S1. Increased supply means that at every
given price, the quantity supplied is higher, so that the supply curve shifts to the right, from S0 to S2.

Now, imagine that the price of steel, an important ingredient in manufacturing cars, rises, so that producing a
car has become more expensive. At any given price for selling cars, car manufacturers will react by supplying a
lower quantity. We can show this graphically as a leftward shift of supply, from S0 to S1, which indicates that at
any given price, the quantity supplied decreases. In this example, at a price of $20,000, the quantity supplied
decreases from 18 million on the original supply curve (S0) to 16.5 million on the supply curve S1, which is
labeled as point L.

Conversely, if the price of steel decreases, producing a car becomes less expensive. At any given price for
selling cars, car manufacturers can now expect to earn higher profits, so they will supply a higher quantity. The
shift of supply to the right, from S0 to S2, means that at all prices, the quantity supplied has increased. In this
example, at a price of $20,000, the quantity supplied increases from 18 million on the original supply curve
(S0) to 19.8 million on the supply curve S2, which is labeled M.

In the example above, we saw that changes in the prices of inputs in the production process will affect the cost
of production and thus the supply. Several other things affect the cost of production, too, such as changes in
weather or other natural conditions, new technologies for production, and some government policies.

Changes in weather and climate will affect the cost of production for many agricultural products. For example,
in 2014 the Manchurian Plain in Northeastern China, which produces most of the country's wheat, corn, and
soybeans, experienced its most severe drought in 50 years. A drought decreases the supply of agricultural
products, which means that at any given price, a lower quantity will be supplied. Conversely, especially good
weather would shift the supply curve to the right.

When a firm discovers a new technology that allows the firm to produce at a lower cost, the supply curve will
shift to the right, as well. For instance, in the 1960s a major scientific effort nicknamed the Green Revolution
focused on breeding improved seeds for basic crops like wheat and rice. By the early 1990s, more than two-
thirds of the wheat and rice in low-income countries around the world used these Green Revolution seeds--and
the harvest was twice as high per acre. A technological improvement that reduces costs of production will shift
supply to the right, so that a greater quantity will be produced at any given price.

Government policies can affect the cost of production and the supply curve through taxes, regulations, and
subsidies. For example, the U.S. government imposes a tax on alcoholic beverages that collects about $8 billion
per year from producers. Businesses treat taxes as costs. Higher costs decrease supply for the reasons we
discussed above. Other examples of policy that can affect cost are the wide array of government regulations
that require firms to spend money to provide a cleaner environment or a safer workplace. Complying with
regulations increases costs.

A government subsidy, on the other hand, is the opposite of a tax. A subsidy occurs when the government pays
a firm directly or reduces the firm's taxes if the firm carries out certain actions. From the firm's perspective,
taxes or regulations are an additional cost of production that shifts supply to the left, leading the firm to
produce a lower quantity at every given price. Government subsidies reduce the cost of production and
increase supply at every given price, shifting supply to the right. The following Work It Out feature shows how
this shift happens.

                                                                                                          WORK IT OUT

 Shift in Supply

  We know that a supply curve shows the minimum price a firm will accept to produce a given quantity of output.
  What happens to the supply curve when the cost of production goes up? Following is an example of a shift in
  supply due to a production cost increase. (We'll introduce some other concepts regarding firm decision-making in
62 3 · Demand and Supply

        Chapters 7 and 8.)
        Step 1. Draw a graph of a supply curve for pizza. Pick a quantity (like Q0). If you draw a vertical line up from Q0 to
        the supply curve, you will see the price the firm chooses. Figure 3.11 provides an example.

        FIGURE 3.11 Supply Curve You can use a supply curve to show the minimum price a firm will accept to produce
        a given quantity of output.
        Step 2. Why did the firm choose that price and not some other? One way to think about this is that the price is
        composed of two parts. The first part is the cost of producing pizzas at the margin; in this case, the cost of
        producing the pizza, including cost of ingredients (e.g., dough, sauce, cheese, and pepperoni), the cost of the
        pizza oven, the shop rent, and the workers' wages. The second part is the firm's desired profit, which is
        determined, among other factors, by the profit margins in that particular business. (Desired profit is not
        necessarily the same as economic profit, which will be explained in Chapter 7.) If you add these two parts
        together, you get the price the firm wishes to charge. The quantity Q0 and associated price P0 give you one point
        on the firm's supply curve, as Figure 3.12 illustrates.

        FIGURE 3.12 Setting Prices The cost of production and the desired profit equal the price a firm will set for a
        product.
        Step 3. Now, suppose that the cost of production increases. Perhaps cheese has become more expensive by
        $0.75 per pizza. If that is true, the firm will want to raise its price by the amount of the increase in cost ($0.75).
        Draw this point on the supply curve directly above the initial point on the curve, but $0.75 higher, as Figure 3.13
        shows.

  FIGURE 3.13 Increasing Costs Leads to Increasing Price Because the cost of production and the desired profit
  equal the price a firm will set for a product, if the cost of production increases, the price for the product will also
  need to increase.
  Step 4. Shift the supply curve through this point. You will see that an increase in cost causes an upward (or a
  leftward) shift of the supply curve so that at any price, the quantities supplied will be smaller, as Figure 3.14
  illustrates.

  FIGURE 3.14 Supply Curve Shifts When the cost of production increases, the supply curve shifts upwardly to a
  new price level.

Summing Up Factors That Change Supply

Changes in the cost of inputs, natural disasters, new technologies, and the impact of government decisions all
affect the cost of production. In turn, these factors affect how much firms are willing to supply at any given
price.
Figure 3.15 summarizes factors that change the supply of goods and services. Notice that a change in the price
of the product itself is not among the factors that shift the supply curve. Although a change in price of a good or
service typically causes a change in quantity supplied or a movement along the supply curve for that specific
good or service, it does not cause the supply curve itself to shift.
64 3 · Demand and Supply

      FIGURE 3.15 Factors That Shift Supply Curves (a) A list of factors that can cause an increase in supply from S0 to
      S1. (b) The same factors, if their direction is reversed, can cause a decrease in supply from S0 to S1.
      Because demand and supply curves appear on a two-dimensional diagram with only price and quantity on the
      axes, an unwary visitor to the land of economics might be fooled into believing that economics is about only
      four topics: demand, supply, price, and quantity. However, demand and supply are really "umbrella" concepts:
      demand covers all the factors that affect demand, and supply covers all the factors that affect supply. We
      include factors other than price that affect demand and supply by using shifts in the demand or the supply
      curve. In this way, the two-dimensional demand and supply model becomes a powerful tool for analyzing a
      wide range of economic circumstances.

    3.3 Changes in Equilibrium Price and Quantity: The Four-Step Process

      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Identify equilibrium price and quantity through the four-step process
        · Graph equilibrium price and quantity
        · Contrast shifts of demand or supply and movements along a demand or supply curve
        · Graph demand and supply curves, including equilibrium price and quantity, based on real-world

            examples
      Let's begin this discussion with a single economic event. It might be an event that affects demand, like a
      change in income, population, tastes, prices of substitutes or complements, or expectations about future
      prices. It might be an event that affects supply, like a change in natural conditions, input prices, or technology,
      or government policies that affect production. How does this economic event affect equilibrium price and
      quantity? We will analyze this question using a four-step process.
      Step 1. Draw a demand and supply model before the economic change took place. To establish the model
      requires four standard pieces of information: The law of demand, which tells us the slope of the demand curve
      is negative; the law of supply, which tells us that the slope of the supply curve is positive; the shift variables for
      demand; and the shift variables for supply. From this model, find the initial equilibrium values for price and
      quantity.
      Step 2. Decide whether the economic change you are analyzing affects demand or supply. In other words, does
      the event refer to something in the list of demand factors or supply factors?
      Step 3. Decide whether the effect on demand or supply causes the curve to shift to the right or to the left, and
      sketch the new demand or supply curve on the diagram. In other words, does the event increase or decrease
      the amount consumers want to buy or producers want to sell?
      Step 4. Identify the new equilibrium and then compare the original equilibrium price and quantity to the new
      equilibrium price and quantity.

Let's consider one example that involves a shift in supply and one that involves a shift in demand. Then we will
consider an example where both supply and demand shift.

Good Weather for Salmon Fishing

Suppose that during the summer of 2015, weather conditions were excellent for commercial salmon fishing off
the California coast. Heavy rains meant higher than normal levels of water in the rivers, which helps the
salmon to breed. Slightly cooler ocean temperatures stimulated the growth of plankton, the microscopic
organisms at the bottom of the ocean food chain, providing everything in the ocean with a hearty food supply.
The ocean stayed calm during fishing season, so commercial fishing operations did not lose many days to bad
weather. How did these climate conditions affect the quantity and price of salmon? Figure 3.16 illustrates the
four-step approach, which we explain below, to work through this problem. Table 3.6 also provides the
information to work the problem.

FIGURE 3.16 Good Weather for Salmon Fishing: The Four-Step Process Unusually good weather leads to changes
in the price and quantity of salmon.

Price per Pound Quantity Supplied in 2014 Quantity Supplied in 2015 Quantity Demanded

$2.00  80                 400  840

$2.25  120                480  680

$2.50  160                550  550

$2.75  200                600  450

$3.00  230                640  350

$3.25  250                670  250

$3.50  270                700  200

TABLE 3.6 Salmon Fishing

Step 1. Draw a demand and supply model to illustrate the market for salmon in the year before the good
weather conditions began. The demand curve D0 and the supply curve S0 show that the original equilibrium
66 3 · Demand and Supply

      price is $3.25 per pound and the original equilibrium quantity is 250,000 fish. (This price per pound is what
      commercial buyers pay at the fishing docks. What consumers pay at the grocery is higher.)
      Step 2. Did the economic event affect supply or demand? Good weather is an example of a natural condition
      that affects supply.
      Step 3. Was the effect on supply an increase or a decrease? Good weather is a change in natural conditions that
      increases the quantity supplied at any given price. The supply curve shifts to the right, moving from the
      original supply curve S0 to the new supply curve S1, which Figure 3.16 and Table 3.6 show.
      Step 4. Compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the original equilibrium. At the new equilibrium E1,
      the equilibrium price falls from $3.25 to $2.50, but the equilibrium quantity increases from 250,000 to
      550,000 salmon. Notice that the equilibrium quantity demanded increased, even though the demand curve
      did not move.
      In short, good weather conditions increased supply of the California commercial salmon. The result was a
      higher equilibrium quantity of salmon bought and sold in the market at a lower price.

     Newspapers and the Internet

      According to the Pew Research Center for People and the Press, increasingly more people, especially younger
      people, are obtaining their news from online and digital sources. The majority of U.S. adults now own
      smartphones or tablets, and most of those Americans say they use them in part to access the news. From 2004
      to 2012, the share of Americans who reported obtaining their news from digital sources increased from 24% to
      39%. How has this affected consumption of print news media, and radio and television news? Figure 3.17 and
      the text below illustrates using the four-step analysis to answer this question.

      FIGURE 3.17 The Print News Market: A Four-Step Analysis A change in tastes from print news sources to digital
      sources results in a leftward shift in demand for the former. The result is a decrease in both equilibrium price and
      quantity.
      Step 1. Develop a demand and supply model to think about what the market looked like before the event. The
      demand curve D0 and the supply curve S0 show the original relationships. In this case, we perform the analysis
      without specific numbers on the price and quantity axis.
      Step 2. Did the described change affect supply or demand? A change in tastes, from traditional news sources
      (print, radio, and television) to digital sources, caused a change in demand for the former.
      Step 3. Was the effect on demand positive or negative? A shift to digital news sources will tend to mean a lower

                                                                                        3.3 · Changes in Equilibrium Price and Quantity: The Four-Step Process 67

quantity demanded of traditional news sources at every given price, causing the demand curve for print and
other traditional news sources to shift to the left, from D0 to D1.
Step 4. Compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the original equilibrium price. The new equilibrium
(E1) occurs at a lower quantity and a lower price than the original equilibrium (E0).
The decline in print news reading predates 2004. Print newspaper circulation peaked in 1973 and has
declined since then due to competition from television and radio news. In 1991, 55% of Americans indicated
they received their news from print sources, while only 29% did so in 2012. Radio news has followed a similar
path in recent decades, with the share of Americans obtaining their news from radio declining from 54% in
1991 to 33% in 2012. Television news has held its own in recent years, with a market share staying in the mid
to upper fifties. What does this suggest for the future, given that two-thirds of Americans under 30 years old
say they do not obtain their news from television at all?

The Interconnections and Speed of Adjustment in Real Markets

In the real world, many factors that affect demand and supply can change all at once. For example, the demand
for cars might increase because of rising incomes and population, and it might decrease because of rising
gasoline prices (a complementary good). Likewise, the supply of cars might increase because of innovative new
technologies that reduce the cost of car production, and it might decrease as a result of new government
regulations requiring the installation of costly pollution-control technology.
Moreover, rising incomes and population or changes in gasoline prices will affect many markets, not just cars.
How can an economist sort out all these interconnected events? The answer lies in the ceteris paribus
assumption. Look at how each economic event affects each market, one event at a time, holding all else
constant. Then combine the analyses to see the net effect.

A Combined Example

The U.S. Postal Service is facing difficult challenges. Compensation for postal workers tends to increase most
years due to cost-of-living increases. At the same time, increasingly more people are using email, text, and
other digital message forms such as Facebook and Twitter to communicate with friends and others. What does
this suggest about the continued viability of the Postal Service? Figure 3.18 and the text below illustrate this
using the four-step analysis to answer this question.

FIGURE 3.18 Higher Compensation for Postal Workers: A Four-Step Analysis (a) Higher labor compensation causes
68 3 · Demand and Supply

      a leftward shift in the supply curve, a decrease in the equilibrium quantity, and an increase in the equilibrium price.
      (b) A change in tastes away from Postal Services causes a leftward shift in the demand curve, a decrease in the
      equilibrium quantity, and a decrease in the equilibrium price.
      Since this problem involves two disturbances, we need two four-step analyses, the first to analyze the effects of
      higher compensation for postal workers, the second to analyze the effects of many people switching from
      "snail mail" to email and other digital messages.
      Figure 3.18 (a) shows the shift in supply discussed in the following steps.
      Step 1. Draw a demand and supply model to illustrate what the market for the U.S. Postal Service looked like
      before this scenario starts. The demand curve D0 and the supply curve S0 show the original relationships.
      Step 2. Did the described change affect supply or demand? Labor compensation is a cost of production. A
      change in production costs caused a change in supply for the Postal Service.
      Step 3. Was the effect on supply positive or negative? Higher labor compensation leads to a lower quantity
      supplied of postal services at every given price, causing the supply curve for postal services to shift to the left,
      from S0 to S1.
      Step 4. Compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the original equilibrium price. The new equilibrium
      (E1) occurs at a lower quantity and a higher price than the original equilibrium (E0).
      Figure 3.18 (b) shows the shift in demand in the following steps.
      Step 1. Draw a demand and supply model to illustrate what the market for U.S. Postal Services looked like
      before this scenario starts. The demand curve D0 and the supply curve S0 show the original relationships. Note
      that this diagram is independent from the diagram in panel (a).
      Step 2. Did the change described affect supply or demand? A change in tastes away from snail mail toward
      digital messages will cause a change in demand for the Postal Service.
      Step 3. Was the effect on demand positive or negative? A change in tastes away from snailmail toward digital
      messages causes lower quantity demanded of postal services at every given price, causing the demand curve
      for postal services to shift to the left, from D0 to D1.
      Step 4. Compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the original equilibrium price. The new equilibrium
      (E2) occurs at a lower quantity and a lower price than the original equilibrium (E0).
      The final step in a scenario where both supply and demand shift is to combine the two individual analyses to
      determine what happens to the equilibrium quantity and price. Graphically, we superimpose the previous two
      diagrams one on top of the other, as in Figure 3.19.

FIGURE 3.19 Combined Effect of Decreased Demand and Decreased Supply Supply and demand shifts cause
changes in equilibrium price and quantity.
Following are the results:
Effect on Quantity: The effect of higher labor compensation on Postal Services because it raises the cost of
production is to decrease the equilibrium quantity. The effect of a change in tastes away from snail mail is to
decrease the equilibrium quantity. Since both shifts are to the left, the overall impact is a decrease in the
equilibrium quantity of Postal Services (Q3). This is easy to see graphically, since Q3 is to the left of Q0.
Effect on Price: The overall effect on price is more complicated. The effect of higher labor compensation on
Postal Services, because it raises the cost of production, is to increase the equilibrium price. The effect of a
change in tastes away from snail mail is to decrease the equilibrium price. Since the two effects are in opposite
directions, unless we know the magnitudes of the two effects, the overall effect is unclear. This is not unusual.
When both curves shift, typically we can determine the overall effect on price or on quantity, but not on both.
In this case, we determined the overall effect on the equilibrium quantity, but not on the equilibrium price. In
other cases, it might be the opposite.
The next Clear It Up feature focuses on the difference between shifts of supply or demand and movements
along a curve.

         CLEAR IT UP
What is the difference between shifts of demand or supply versus movements along a demand or
supply curve?

One common mistake in applying the demand and supply framework is to confuse the shift of a demand or a supply
curve with movement along a demand or supply curve. As an example, consider a problem that asks whether a
drought will increase or decrease the equilibrium quantity and equilibrium price of wheat. Lee, a student in an
introductory economics class, might reason:
"Well, it is clear that a drought reduces supply, so I will shift back the supply curve, as in the shift from the original
supply curve S0 to S1 on the diagram (Shift 1). The equilibrium moves from E0 to E1, the equilibrium quantity is
lower and the equilibrium price is higher. Then, a higher price makes farmers more likely to supply the good, so the
supply curve shifts right, as shows the shift from S1 to S2, shows on the diagram (Shift 2), so that the equilibrium
now moves from E1 to E2. The higher price, however, also reduces demand and so causes demand to shift back, like
70 3 · Demand and Supply

      the shift from the original demand curve, D0 to D1 on the diagram (labeled Shift 3), and the equilibrium moves from
      E2 to E3."

      FIGURE 3.20 Shifts of Demand or Supply versus Movements along a Demand or Supply Curve A shift in one curve
      never causes a shift in the other curve. Rather, a shift in one curve causes a movement along the second curve.
      At about this point, Lee suspects that this answer is headed down the wrong path. Think about what might be wrong
      with Lee's logic, and then read the answer that follows.
     Answer: Lee's first step is correct: that is, a drought shifts back the supply curve of wheat and leads to a prediction
      of a lower equilibrium quantity and a higher equilibrium price. This corresponds to a movement along the original
      demand curve (D0), from E0 to E1. The rest of Lee's argument is wrong, because it mixes up shifts in supply with
      quantity supplied, and shifts in demand with quantity demanded. A higher or lower price never shifts the supply
      curve, as suggested by the shift in supply from S1 to S2. Instead, a price change leads to a movement along a given
      supply curve. Similarly, a higher or lower price never shifts a demand curve, as suggested in the shift from D0 to D1.
      Instead, a price change leads to a movement along a given demand curve. Remember, a change in the price of a
      good never causes the demand or supply curve for that good to shift.
      Think carefully about the timeline of events: What happens first, what happens next? What is cause, what is effect?
      If you keep the order right, you are more likely to get the analysis correct.

      In the four-step analysis of how economic events affect equilibrium price and quantity, the movement from the
      old to the new equilibrium seems immediate. As a practical matter, however, prices and quantities often do not
      zoom straight to equilibrium. More realistically, when an economic event causes demand or supply to shift,
      prices and quantities set off in the general direction of equilibrium. Even as they are moving toward one new
      equilibrium, a subsequent change in demand or supply often pushes prices toward another equilibrium.

    3.4 Price Ceilings and Price Floors

      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Explain price controls, price ceilings, and price floors
        · Analyze demand and supply as a social adjustment mechanism
      To this point in the chapter, we have been assuming that markets are free, that is, they operate with no
      government intervention. In this section, we will explore the outcomes, both anticipated and otherwise, when
      government does intervene in a market either to prevent the price of some good or service from rising "too
      high" or to prevent the price of some good or service from falling "too low".
      Economists believe there are a small number of fundamental principles that explain how economic agents

                                                                                                                                          3.4 · Price Ceilings and Price Floors 71

respond in different situations. Two of these principles, which we have already introduced, are the laws of
demand and supply.

Governments can pass laws affecting market outcomes, but no law can negate these economic principles.
Rather, the principles will become apparent in sometimes unexpected ways, which may undermine the intent
of the government policy. This is one of the major conclusions of this section.

Controversy sometimes surrounds the prices and quantities established by demand and supply, especially for
products that are considered necessities. In some cases, discontent over prices turns into public pressure on
politicians, who may then pass legislation to prevent a certain price from climbing "too high" or falling "too
low."

The demand and supply model shows how people and firms will react to the incentives that these laws provide
to control prices, in ways that will often lead to undesirable consequences. Alternative policy tools can often
achieve the desired goals of price control laws, while avoiding at least some of their costs and tradeoffs.

Price Ceilings

Laws that governments enact to regulate prices are called price controls. Price controls come in two flavors. A
price ceiling keeps a price from rising above a certain level (the "ceiling"), while a price floor keeps a price
from falling below a given level (the "floor"). This section uses the demand and supply framework to analyze
price ceilings. The next section discusses price floors.

A price ceiling is a legal maximum price that one pays for some good or service. A government imposes price
ceilings in order to keep the price of some necessary good or service affordable. For example, in 2005 during
Hurricane Katrina, the price of bottled water increased above $5 per gallon. As a result, many people called for
price controls on bottled water to prevent the price from rising so high. In this particular case, the government
did not impose a price ceiling, but there are other examples of where price ceilings did occur.

In many markets for goods and services, demanders outnumber suppliers. Consumers, who are also potential
voters, sometimes unite behind a political proposal to hold down a certain price. In some cities, such as
Albany, renters have pressed political leaders to pass rent control laws, a price ceiling that usually works by
stating that landlords can raise rents by only a certain maximum percentage each year. Some of the best
examples of rent control occur in urban areas such as New York, Washington D.C., or San Francisco.

Rent control becomes a politically hot topic when rents begin to rise rapidly. Everyone needs an affordable
place to live. Perhaps a change in tastes makes a certain suburb or town a more popular place to live. Perhaps
locally-based businesses expand, bringing higher incomes and more people into the area. Such changes can
cause a change in the demand for rental housing, as Figure 3.21 illustrates. The original equilibrium (E0) lies at
the intersection of supply curve S0 and demand curve D0, corresponding to an equilibrium price of $500 and
an equilibrium quantity of 15,000 units of rental housing. The effect of greater income or a change in tastes is
to shift the demand curve for rental housing to the right, as the data in Table 3.7 shows and the shift from D0 to
D1 on the graph. In this market, at the new equilibrium E1, the price of a rental unit would rise to $600 and the
equilibrium quantity would increase to 17,000 units.

demand shifts from D0 to D1, the new equilibrium would be at E1--unless a price ceiling prevents the price from
rising. If the price is not permitted to rise, the quantity supplied remains at 15,000. However, after the change in
demand, the quantity demanded rises to 19,000, resulting in a shortage.

TABLE 3.7 Rent Control

Suppose that a city government passes a rent control law to keep the price at the original equilibrium of $500
for a typical apartment. In Figure 3.21, the horizontal line at the price of $500 shows the legally fixed
maximum price set by the rent control law. However, the underlying forces that shifted the demand curve to
the right are still there. At that price ($500), the quantity supplied remains at the same 15,000 rental units, but
the quantity demanded is 19,000 rental units. In other words, the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity
supplied, so there is a shortage of rental housing. One of the ironies of price ceilings is that while the price
ceiling was intended to help renters, there are actually fewer apartments rented out under the price ceiling
(15,000 rental units) than would be the case at the market rent of $600 (17,000 rental units).

Price ceilings do not simply benefit renters at the expense of landlords. Rather, some renters (or potential
renters) lose their housing as landlords convert apartments to co-ops and condos. Even when the housing
remains in the rental market, landlords tend to spend less on maintenance and on essentials like heating,
cooling, hot water, and lighting. The first rule of economics is you do not get something for nothing--everything
has an opportunity cost. Thus, if renters obtain "cheaper" housing than the market requires, they tend to also
end up with lower quality housing.

Price ceilings are enacted in an attempt to keep prices low for those who need the product. However, when the
market price is not allowed to rise to the equilibrium level, quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied, and
thus a shortage occurs. Those who manage to purchase the product at the lower price given by the price ceiling
will benefit, but sellers of the product will suffer, along with those who are not able to purchase the product at

all. Quality is also likely to deteriorate.

Price Floors

A price floor is the lowest price that one can legally pay for some good or service. Perhaps the best-known
example of a price floor is the minimum wage, which is based on the view that someone working full time
should be able to afford a basic standard of living. The federal minimum wage in 2022 was $7.25 per hour,
although some states and localities have a higher minimum wage. The federal minimum wage yields an annual
income for a single person of $15,080, which is slightly higher than the Federal poverty line of $11,880.
Congress periodically raises the federal minimum wage as the cost of living rises. As of March 2022, the most
recent adjustment occurred in 2009, when the federal minimum wage was raised from $6.55 to $7.25.

Price floors are sometimes called "price supports," because they support a price by preventing it from falling
below a certain level. Around the world, many countries have passed laws to create agricultural price supports.
Farm prices and thus farm incomes fluctuate, sometimes widely. Even if, on average, farm incomes are
adequate, some years they can be quite low. The purpose of price supports is to prevent these swings.

The most common way price supports work is that the government enters the market and buys up the product,
adding to demand to keep prices higher than they otherwise would be. According to the Common Agricultural
Policy reform effective in 2019, the European Union (EU) will spend about 58 billion euros per year, or 65.5
billion dollars per year (with the December 2021 exchange rate), or roughly 36% of the EU budget, on price
supports for Europe's farmers.

Figure 3.22 illustrates the effects of a government program that assures a price above the equilibrium by
focusing on the market for wheat in Europe. In the absence of government intervention, the price would adjust
so that the quantity supplied would equal the quantity demanded at the equilibrium point E0, with price P0 and
quantity Q0. However, policies to keep prices high for farmers keep the price above what would have been the
market equilibrium level--the price Pf shown by the dashed horizontal line in the diagram. The result is a
quantity supplied in excess of the quantity demanded (Qd). When quantity supplied exceeds quantity
demanded, a surplus exists.

Economists estimate that the high-income areas of the world, including the United States, Europe, and Japan,
spend roughly $1 billion per day in supporting their farmers. If the government is willing to purchase the
excess supply (or to provide payments for others to purchase it), then farmers will benefit from the price floor,
but taxpayers and consumers of food will pay the costs. Agricultural economists and policy makers have
offered numerous proposals for reducing farm subsidies. In many countries, however, political support for
subsidies for farmers remains strong. This is either because the population views this as supporting the
traditional rural way of life or because of industry's lobbying power of the agro-business.
74 3 · Demand and Supply

      FIGURE 3.22 European Wheat Prices: A Price Floor Example The intersection of demand (D) and supply (S) would
      be at the equilibrium point E0. However, a price floor set at Pf holds the price above E0 and prevents it from falling.
      The result of the price floor is that the quantity supplied Qs exceeds the quantity demanded Qd. There is excess
      supply, also called a surplus.

    3.5 Demand, Supply, and Efficiency

      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Contrast consumer surplus, producer surplus, and social surplus
        · Explain why price floors and price ceilings can be inefficient
        · Analyze demand and supply as a social adjustment mechanism
      The familiar demand and supply diagram holds within it the concept of economic efficiency. One typical way
      that economists define efficiency is when it is impossible to improve the situation of one party without
      imposing a cost on another. Conversely, if a situation is inefficient, it becomes possible to benefit at least one
      party without imposing costs on others.
      Efficiency in the demand and supply model has the same basic meaning: The economy is getting as much
      benefit as possible from its scarce resources and all the possible gains from trade have been achieved. In other
      words, the optimal amount of each good and service is produced and consumed.

     Consumer Surplus, Producer Surplus, Social Surplus

      Consider a market for tablet computers, as Figure 3.23 shows. The equilibrium price is $80 and the
      equilibrium quantity is 28 million. To see the benefits to consumers, look at the segment of the demand curve
      above the equilibrium point and to the left. This portion of the demand curve shows that at least some
      demanders would have been willing to pay more than $80 for a tablet.
      For example, point J shows that if the price were $90, 20 million tablets would be sold. Those consumers who
      would have been willing to pay $90 for a tablet based on the utility they expect to receive from it, but who were
      able to pay the equilibrium price of $80, clearly received a benefit beyond what they had to pay. Remember, the
      demand curve traces consumers' willingness to pay for different quantities. The amount that individuals
      would have been willing to pay, minus the amount that they actually paid, is called consumer surplus.
      Consumer surplus is the area labeled F--that is, the area above the market price and below the demand curve.

FIGURE 3.23 Consumer and Producer Surplus The somewhat triangular area labeled by F shows the area of
consumer surplus, which shows that the equilibrium price in the market was less than what many of the consumers
were willing to pay. Point J on the demand curve shows that, even at the price of $90, consumers would have been
willing to purchase a quantity of 20 million. The somewhat triangular area labeled by G shows the area of producer
surplus, which shows that the equilibrium price received in the market was more than what many of the producers
were willing to accept for their products. For example, point K on the supply curve shows that at a price of $45, firms
would have been willing to supply a quantity of 14 million.
The supply curve shows the quantity that firms are willing to supply at each price. For example, point K in
Figure 3.23 illustrates that, at $45, firms would still have been willing to supply a quantity of 14 million. Those
producers who would have been willing to supply the tablets at $45, but who were instead able to charge the
equilibrium price of $80, clearly received an extra benefit beyond what they required to supply the product.
The extra benefit producers receive from selling a good or service, measured by the price the producer actually
received minus the price the producer would have been willing to accept is called producer surplus. In Figure
3.23, producer surplus is the area labeled G--that is, the area between the market price and the segment of the
supply curve below the equilibrium.
The sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus is social surplus, also referred to as economic surplus or
total surplus. In Figure 3.23 we show social surplus as the area F + G. Social surplus is larger at equilibrium
quantity and price than it would be at any other quantity. This demonstrates the economic efficiency of the
market equilibrium. In addition, at the efficient level of output, it is impossible to produce greater consumer
surplus without reducing producer surplus, and it is impossible to produce greater producer surplus without
reducing consumer surplus.

Inefficiency of Price Floors and Price Ceilings

The imposition of a price floor or a price ceiling will prevent a market from adjusting to its equilibrium price
and quantity, and thus will create an inefficient outcome. However, there is an additional twist here. Along with
creating inefficiency, price floors and ceilings will also transfer some consumer surplus to producers, or some
producer surplus to consumers.
Imagine that several firms develop a promising but expensive new drug for treating back pain. If this therapy
is left to the market, the equilibrium price will be $600 per month and 20,000 people will use the drug, as
shown in Figure 3.24 (a). The original level of consumer surplus is T + U and producer surplus is V + W + X.
However, the government decides to impose a price ceiling of $400 to make the drug more affordable. At this
price ceiling, firms in the market now produce only 15,000.
76 3 · Demand and Supply

      As a result, two changes occur. First, an inefficient outcome occurs and the total surplus of society is reduced.
      The loss in social surplus that occurs when the economy produces at an inefficient quantity is called
      deadweight loss. In a very real sense, it is like money thrown away that benefits no one. In Figure 3.24 (a), the
      deadweight loss is the area U + W. When deadweight loss exists, it is possible for both consumer and producer
      surplus to be higher, in this case because the price control is blocking some suppliers and demanders from
      transactions they would both be willing to make.
      A second change from the price ceiling is that some of the producer surplus is transferred to consumers. After
      the price ceiling is imposed, the new consumer surplus is T + V, while the new producer surplus is X. In other
      words, the price ceiling transfers the area of surplus (V) from producers to consumers. Note that the gain to
      consumers is less than the loss to producers, which is just another way of seeing the deadweight loss.

      FIGURE 3.24 Efficiency and Price Floors and Ceilings (a) The original equilibrium price is $600 with a quantity of
      20,000. Consumer surplus is T + U, and producer surplus is V + W + X. A price ceiling is imposed at $400, so firms in
      the market now produce only a quantity of 15,000. As a result, the new consumer surplus is T + V, while the new
      producer surplus is X. (b) The original equilibrium is $8 at a quantity of 1,800. Consumer surplus is G + H + J, and
      producer surplus is I + K. A price floor is imposed at $12, which means that quantity demanded falls to 1,400. As a
      result, the new consumer surplus is G, and the new producer surplus is H + I.
      Figure 3.24 (b) shows a price floor example using a string of struggling movie theaters, all in the same city. The
      current equilibrium is $8 per movie ticket, with 1,800 people attending movies. The original consumer surplus
      is G + H + J, and producer surplus is I + K. The city government is worried that movie theaters will go out of
      business, reducing the entertainment options available to citizens, so it decides to impose a price floor of $12
      per ticket. As a result, the quantity demanded of movie tickets falls to 1,400. The new consumer surplus is G,
      and the new producer surplus is H + I. In effect, the price floor causes the area H to be transferred from
      consumer to producer surplus, but also causes a deadweight loss of J + K.
      This analysis shows that a price ceiling, like a law establishing rent controls, will transfer some producer
      surplus to consumers--which helps to explain why consumers often favor them. Conversely, a price floor like a
      guarantee that farmers will receive a certain price for their crops will transfer some consumer surplus to
      producers, which explains why producers often favor them. However, both price floors and price ceilings block
      some transactions that buyers and sellers would have been willing to make, and creates deadweight loss.
      Removing such barriers, so that prices and quantities can adjust to their equilibrium level, will increase the
      economy's social surplus.

     Demand and Supply as a Social Adjustment Mechanism

      The demand and supply model emphasizes that prices are not set only by demand or only by supply, but by the

interaction between the two. In 1890, the famous economist Alfred Marshall wrote that asking whether supply
or demand determined a price was like arguing "whether it is the upper or the under blade of a pair of scissors
that cuts a piece of paper." The answer is that both blades of the demand and supply scissors are always
involved.

The adjustments of equilibrium price and quantity in a market-oriented economy often occur without much
government direction or oversight. If the coffee crop in Brazil suffers a terrible frost, then the supply curve of
coffee shifts to the left and the price of coffee rises. Some people continue to drink coffee and pay the higher
price. Others switch to tea or soft drinks. No government commission is needed to figure out how to adjust
coffee prices, which companies will be allowed to process the remaining supply, which supermarkets in which
cities will get how much coffee to sell, or which consumers will ultimately be allowed to drink the brew. Such
adjustments in response to price changes happen all the time in a market economy, often so smoothly and
rapidly that we barely notice them.

Think for a moment of all the seasonal foods that are available and inexpensive at certain times of the year, like
fresh corn in midsummer, but more expensive at other times of the year. People alter their diets and
restaurants alter their menus in response to these fluctuations in prices without fuss or fanfare. For both the
U.S. economy and the world economy as a whole, markets--that is, demand and supply--are the primary social
mechanism for answering the basic questions about what is produced, how it is produced, and for whom it is
produced.

         BRING IT HOME

Why Can We Not Get Enough of Organic Food?

Organic food is grown without synthetic pesticides, chemical fertilizers or genetically modified seeds. In recent
decades, the demand for organic products has increased dramatically. The Organic Trade Association reported sales
increased from $1 billion in 1990 to nearly $62 billion in 2020, more than 90% of which were sales of food
products.

Why, then, are organic foods more expensive than their conventional counterparts? The answer is a clear application
of the theories of supply and demand. As people have learned more about the harmful effects of chemical fertilizers,
growth hormones, pesticides and the like from large-scale factory farming, our tastes and preferences for safer,
organic foods have increased. This change in tastes has been reinforced by increases in income, which allow people
to purchase pricier products, and has made organic foods more mainstream. This shift, in addition to population
growth, has led to an increased demand for organic foods. Graphically, the demand curve has shifted right, and we
have moved up the supply curve as producers have responded to the higher prices by supplying a greater quantity.

In addition to the movement along the supply curve, we have also had an increase in the number of farmers
converting to organic farming over time. This is represented by a shift to the right of the supply curve. Since both
demand and supply have shifted to the right, the resulting equilibrium quantity of organic foods is definitely higher,
but the price will only fall when the increase in supply is larger than the increase in demand. We may need more
time before we see lower prices in organic foods. Since the production costs of these foods may remain higher than
conventional farming, because organic fertilizers and pest management techniques are more expensive, they may
never fully catch up with the lower prices of non-organic foods.

As a final, specific example: The Environmental Working Group's "Dirty Dozen" list of fruits and vegetables, which
test high for pesticide residue even after washing, was released in April 2013. The inclusion of strawberries on the
list led to an increase in demand for organic strawberries, resulting in both a higher equilibrium price and quantity of
sales.

Key Concepts and Summary

3.1 Demand, Supply, and Equilibrium in Markets for Goods and Services

A demand schedule is a table that shows the quantity demanded at different prices in the market. A demand
curve shows the relationship between quantity demanded and price in a given market on a graph. The law of
demand states that a higher price typically leads to a lower quantity demanded.

A supply schedule is a table that shows the quantity supplied at different prices in the market. A supply curve
shows the relationship between quantity supplied and price on a graph. The law of supply says that a higher
price typically leads to a higher quantity supplied.

The equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity occur where the supply and demand curves cross. The
equilibrium occurs where the quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied. If the price is below the
equilibrium level, then the quantity demanded will exceed the quantity supplied. Excess demand or a shortage
will exist. If the price is above the equilibrium level, then the quantity supplied will exceed the quantity
demanded. Excess supply or a surplus will exist. In either case, economic pressures will push the price toward
the equilibrium level.

3.2 Shifts in Demand and Supply for Goods and Services

Economists often use the ceteris paribus or "other things being equal" assumption: while examining the
economic impact of one event, all other factors remain unchanged for analysis purposes. Factors that can shift
the demand curve for goods and services, causing a different quantity to be demanded at any given price,
include changes in tastes, population, income, prices of substitute or complement goods, and expectations
about future conditions and prices. Factors that can shift the supply curve for goods and services, causing a
different quantity to be supplied at any given price, include input prices, natural conditions, changes in
technology, and government taxes, regulations, or subsidies.

3.3 Changes in Equilibrium Price and Quantity: The Four-Step Process

When using the supply and demand framework to think about how an event will affect the equilibrium price
and quantity, proceed through four steps: (1) sketch a supply and demand diagram to think about what the
market looked like before the event; (2) decide whether the event will affect supply or demand; (3) decide
whether the effect on supply or demand is negative or positive, and draw the appropriate shifted supply or
demand curve; (4) compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the original ones.

3.4 Price Ceilings and Price Floors

Price ceilings prevent a price from rising above a certain level. When a price ceiling is set below the
equilibrium price, quantity demanded will exceed quantity supplied, and excess demand or shortages will
result. Price floors prevent a price from falling below a certain level. When a price floor is set above the
equilibrium price, quantity supplied will exceed quantity demanded, and excess supply or surpluses will
result. Price floors and price ceilings often lead to unintended consequences.

3.5 Demand, Supply, and Efficiency

Consumer surplus is the gap between the price that consumers are willing to pay, based on their preferences,
and the market equilibrium price. Producer surplus is the gap between the price for which producers are
willing to sell a product, based on their costs, and the market equilibrium price. Social surplus is the sum of
consumer surplus and producer surplus. Total surplus is larger at the equilibrium quantity and price than it
will be at any other quantity and price. Deadweight loss is loss in total surplus that occurs when the economy
produces at an inefficient quantity.

Introduction to Labor and Financial Markets

         BRING IT HOME

Baby Boomers Come of Age

According to the 2020 Census, 22% of the U.S. population was 60 years old or older, which means that more than
74 million people have reached an age when they will need increased medical care.
The baby boomer population, the group born between 1946 and 1964, is comprised of more than 71 million people
who have already reached retirement age or will soon reach retirement. As this population grows older, they will be
faced with common healthcare issues such as heart conditions, arthritis, and Alzheimer's that may require
hospitalization, long-term, or at-home nursing care. Aging baby boomers and advances in life-saving and life-
extending technologies will increase the demand for healthcare and nursing. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act,
88 4 · Labor and Financial Markets

      which expands access to healthcare for millions of Americans, has further increased the demand.
      These data tell us, as economists, that the market for healthcare professionals, and nurses in particular, will face
      several challenges. Our study of supply and demand will help us to analyze what might happen in the labor market
      for nursing and other healthcare professionals, as we will discuss in the second half of this case at the end of the
      chapter.

      The theories of supply and demand do not apply just to markets for goods. They apply to any market, even
      markets for things we may not think of as goods and services like labor and financial services. Labor markets
      are markets for employees or jobs. Financial services markets are markets for saving or borrowing.
      When we think about demand and supply curves in goods and services markets, it is easy to picture the
      demanders and suppliers: businesses produce the products and households buy them. Who are the
      demanders and suppliers in labor and financial service markets? In labor markets job seekers (individuals) are
      the suppliers of labor, while firms and other employers who hire labor are the demanders for labor. In financial
      markets, any individual or firm who saves contributes to the supply of money, and any entity that borrows
      (person, firm, or government) contributes to the demand for money.
      As a college student, you most likely participate in both labor and financial markets. Employment is a fact of
      life for most college students: According to the National Center for Educational Statistics, in 2018 43% of full-
      time college students and 81% of part-time college students were employed. Most college students are also
      heavily involved in financial markets, primarily as borrowers. As of the 2018-19 school year, 43% of full-time
      undergraduate students were receiving loan aid to help finance their education, and those loans averaged
      $7,300 per year. Many students also borrow for other expenses, like purchasing a car. As this chapter will
      illustrate, we can analyze labor markets and financial markets with the same tools we use to analyze demand
      and supply in the goods markets.

    4.1 Demand and Supply at Work in Labor Markets

      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Predict shifts in the demand and supply curves of the labor market
        · Explain the impact of new technology on the demand and supply curves of the labor market
        · Explain price floors in the labor market such as minimum wage or a living wage
      Markets for labor have demand and supply curves, just like markets for goods. The law of demand applies in
      labor markets this way: A higher salary or wage--that is, a higher price in the labor market--leads to a
      decrease in the quantity of labor demanded by employers, while a lower salary or wage leads to an increase in
      the quantity of labor demanded. The law of supply functions in labor markets, too: A higher price for labor
      leads to a higher quantity of labor supplied; a lower price leads to a lower quantity supplied.

     Equilibrium in the Labor Market

      In 2020, nearly 41,000 registered nurses worked in the Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington, Minnesota-
      Wisconsin metropolitan area, according to the BLS. They worked for a variety of employers: hospitals, doctors'
      offices, schools, health clinics, and nursing homes. Figure 4.2 illustrates how demand and supply determine
      equilibrium in this labor market. The demand and supply schedules in Table 4.1 list the quantity supplied and
      quantity demanded of nurses at different salaries.

FIGURE 4.2 Labor Market Example: Demand and Supply for Nurses in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington The
demand curve (D) of those employers who want to hire nurses intersects with the supply curve (S) of those who are
qualified and willing to work as nurses at the equilibrium point (E). The equilibrium salary is $85,000 and the
equilibrium quantity is 41,000 nurses. At an above-equilibrium salary of $90,000, quantity supplied increases to
45,000, but the quantity of nurses demanded at the higher pay declines to 40,000. At this above-equilibrium salary,
an excess supply or surplus of nurses would exist. At a below-equilibrium salary of $75,000, quantity supplied
declines to 34,000, while the quantity demanded at the lower wage increases to 47,000 nurses. At this below-
equilibrium salary, excess demand or a shortage exists.

$75,000  47,000  34,000

TABLE 4.1 Demand and Supply of Nurses in Minneapolis-St.
Paul-Bloomington

The horizontal axis shows the quantity of nurses hired. In this example we measure labor by number of
workers, but another common way to measure the quantity of labor is by the number of hours worked. The
vertical axis shows the price for nurses' labor--that is, how much they are paid. In the real world, this "price"
would be total labor compensation: salary plus benefits. It is not obvious, but benefits are a significant part (as
high as 30 percent) of labor compensation. In this example we measure the price of labor by salary on an
annual basis, although in other cases we could measure the price of labor by monthly or weekly pay, or even
the wage paid per hour. As the salary for nurses rises, the quantity demanded will fall. Some hospitals and
nursing homes may reduce the number of nurses they hire, or they may lay off some of their existing nurses,
rather than pay them higher salaries. Employers who face higher nurses' salaries may also try to replace some
nursing functions by investing in physical equipment, like computer monitoring and diagnostic systems to
90 4 · Labor and Financial Markets

      monitor patients, or by using lower-paid health care aides to reduce the number of nurses they need.

      As the salary for nurses rises, the quantity supplied will rise. If nurses' salaries in Minneapolis-St. Paul-
      Bloomington are higher than in other cities, more nurses will move to Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington to
      find jobs, more people will be willing to train as nurses, and those currently trained as nurses will be more
      likely to pursue nursing as a full-time job. In other words, there will be more nurses looking for jobs in the
      area.

      At equilibrium, the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded are equal. Thus, every employer who wants
      to hire a nurse at this equilibrium wage can find a willing worker, and every nurse who wants to work at this
      equilibrium salary can find a job. In Figure 4.2, the supply curve (S) and demand curve (D) intersect at the
      equilibrium point (E). The equilibrium quantity of nurses in the Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington area is
      41,000, and the equilibrium salary is $85,000 per year. This example simplifies the nursing market by
      focusing on the "average" nurse. In reality, of course, the market for nurses actually comprises many smaller
      markets, like markets for nurses with varying degrees of experience and credentials. Many markets contain
      closely related products that differ in quality. For instance, even a simple product like gasoline comes in
      regular, premium, and super-premium, each with a different price. Even in such cases, discussing the average
      price of gasoline, like the average salary for nurses, can still be useful because it reflects what is happening in
      most of the submarkets.

      When the price of labor is not at the equilibrium, economic incentives tend to move salaries toward the
      equilibrium. For example, if salaries for nurses in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington were above the
      equilibrium at $90,000 per year, then 45,000 people want to work as nurses, but employers want to hire only
      40,000 nurses. At that above-equilibrium salary, excess supply or a surplus results. In a situation of excess
      supply in the labor market, with many applicants for every job opening, employers will have an incentive to
      offer lower wages than they otherwise would have. Nurses' salary will move down toward equilibrium.

      In contrast, if the salary is below the equilibrium at, say, $70,000 per year, then a situation of excess demand or
      a shortage arises. In this case, employers encouraged by the relatively lower wage want to hire 52,000 nurses,
      but only 27,000 individuals want to work as nurses at that salary in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington. In
      response to the shortage, some employers will offer higher pay to attract the nurses. Other employers will have
      to match the higher pay to keep their own employees. The higher salaries will encourage more nurses to train
      or work in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington. Again, price and quantity in the labor market will move toward
      equilibrium.

     Shifts in Labor Demand

      The demand curve for labor shows the quantity of labor employers wish to hire at any given salary or wage
     rate, under the ceteris paribus assumption. A change in the wage or salary will result in a change in the
      quantity demanded of labor. If the wage rate increases, employers will want to hire fewer employees. The
      quantity of labor demanded will decrease, and there will be a movement upward along the demand curve. If
      the wages and salaries decrease, employers are more likely to hire a greater number of workers. The quantity
      of labor demanded will increase, resulting in a downward movement along the demand curve.

      Shifts in the demand curve for labor occur for many reasons. One key reason is that the demand for labor is
      based on the demand for the good or service that is produced. For example, the more new automobiles
      consumers demand, the greater the number of workers automakers will need to hire. Therefore the demand
      for labor is called a "derived demand." Here are some examples of derived demand for labor:

        · The demand for chefs is dependent on the demand for restaurant meals.
        · The demand for pharmacists is dependent on the demand for prescription drugs.
        · The demand for attorneys is dependent on the demand for legal services.

      As the demand for the goods and services increases, the demand for labor will increase, or shift to the right, to

meet employers' production requirements. As the demand for the goods and services decreases, the demand
for labor will decrease, or shift to the left. Table 4.2 shows that in addition to the derived demand for labor,
demand can also increase or decrease (shift) in response to several factors.

Factors                                  Results

Demand for    When the demand for the good produced (output) increases, both the output price and profitability
Output        increase. As a result, producers demand more labor to ramp up production.

Education     A well-trained and educated workforce causes an increase in the demand for that labor by
and Training  employers. Increased levels of productivity within the workforce will cause the demand for labor to
              shift to the right. If the workforce is not well-trained or educated, employers will not hire from
              within that labor pool, since they will need to spend a significant amount of time and money
              training that workforce. Demand for such will shift to the left.

Technology    Technology changes can act as either substitutes for or complements to labor. When technology
              acts as a substitute, it replaces the need for the number of workers an employer needs to hire. For
              example, word processing decreased the number of typists needed in the workplace. This shifted
              the demand curve for typists left. An increase in the availability of certain technologies may
              increase the demand for labor. Technology that acts as a complement to labor will increase the
              demand for certain types of labor, resulting in a rightward shift of the demand curve. For example,
              the increased use of word processing and other software has increased the demand for information
              technology professionals who can resolve software and hardware issues related to a firm's
              network. More and better technology will increase demand for skilled workers who know how to
              use technology to enhance workplace productivity. Those workers who do not adapt to changes in
              technology will experience a decrease in demand.

Number of     An increase in the number of companies producing a given product will increase the demand for
Companies     labor resulting in a shift to the right. A decrease in the number of companies producing a given
              product will decrease the demand for labor resulting in a shift to the left.

Government    Complying with government regulations can increase or decrease the demand for labor at any given
Regulations   wage. In the healthcare industry, government rules may require that nurses be hired to carry out
              certain medical procedures. This will increase the demand for nurses. Less-trained healthcare
              workers would be prohibited from carrying out these procedures, and the demand for these
              workers will shift to the left.

Price and     Labor is not the only input into the production process. For example, a salesperson at a call center
Availability  needs a telephone and a computer terminal to enter data and record sales. If prices of other inputs
of Other      fall, production will become more profitable and suppliers will demand more labor to increase
Inputs        production. This will cause a rightward shift in the demand curve for labor. The opposite is also
              true. Higher prices for other inputs lower demand for labor.

Shifts in Labor Supply

The supply of labor is upward-sloping and adheres to the law of supply: The higher the price, the greater the
quantity supplied and the lower the price, the less quantity supplied. The supply curve models the tradeoff
between supplying labor into the market or using time in leisure activities at every given price level. The
higher the wage, the more labor is willing to work and forego leisure activities. Table 4.3 lists some of the
factors that will cause the supply to increase or decrease.

Factors                                  Results

Number of   An increased number of workers will cause the supply curve to shift to the right. An increased
Workers     number of workers can be due to several factors, such as immigration, increasing population, an
            aging population, and changing demographics. Policies that encourage immigration will increase
            the supply of labor, and vice versa. Population grows when birth rates exceed death rates. This
            eventually increases supply of labor when the former reach working age. Another example of
            changing demographics is more women working outside of the home, which increases the supply
            of labor.

Required    The more required education, the lower the supply. There is a lower supply of PhD mathematicians
Education   than of high school mathematics teachers; there is a lower supply of cardiologists than of primary
            care physicians; and there is a lower supply of physicians than of nurses.

Government  Government policies can also affect the supply of labor for jobs. Alternatively, the government may
Policies    support rules that set high qualifications for certain jobs: academic training, certificates or licenses,
            or experience. When these qualifications are made tougher, the number of qualified workers will
            decrease at any given wage. On the other hand, the government may also subsidize training or even
            reduce the required level of qualifications. For example, government might offer subsidies for
            nursing schools or nursing students. Such provisions would shift the supply curve of nurses to the
            right. In addition, government policies that change the relative desirability of working versus not
            working also affect the labor supply. These include unemployment benefits, maternity leave, child
            care benefits, and welfare policy. For example, child care benefits may increase the labor supply of
            working mothers. Long term unemployment benefits may discourage job searching for unemployed
            workers. All these policies must therefore be carefully designed to minimize any negative labor
            supply effects.

TABLE 4.3 Factors that Can Shift Supply

A change in salary will lead to a movement along labor demand or labor supply curves, but it will not shift
those curves. However, other events like those we have outlined here will cause either the demand or the
supply of labor to shift, and thus will move the labor market to a new equilibrium salary and quantity.

Technology and Wage Inequality: The Four-Step Process

Economic events can change the equilibrium salary (or wage) and quantity of labor. Consider how the wave of
new information technologies, like computer and telecommunications networks, has affected low-skill and
high-skill workers in the U.S. economy. From the perspective of employers who demand labor, these new
technologies are often a substitute for low-skill laborers like file clerks who used to keep file cabinets full of
paper records of transactions. However, the same new technologies are a complement to high-skill workers
like managers, who benefit from the technological advances by having the ability to monitor more information,
communicate more easily, and juggle a wider array of responsibilities. How will the new technologies affect the
wages of high-skill and low-skill workers? For this question, the four-step process of analyzing how shifts in
supply or demand affect a market (introduced in Demand and Supply) works in this way:

                                                                                                                    4.1 · Demand and Supply at Work in Labor Markets 93

Step 1. What did the markets for low-skill labor and high-skill labor look like before the arrival of the new
technologies? In Figure 4.3 (a) and Figure 4.3 (b), S0 is the original supply curve for labor and D0 is the original
demand curve for labor in each market. In each graph, the original point of equilibrium, E0, occurs at the price
W0 and the quantity Q0.

FIGURE 4.3 Technology and Wages: Applying Demand and Supply (a) The demand for low-skill labor shifts to the
left when technology can do the job previously done by these workers. (b) New technologies can also increase the
demand for high-skill labor in fields such as information technology and network administration.
Step 2. Does the new technology affect the supply of labor from households or the demand for labor from
firms? The technology change described here affects demand for labor by firms that hire workers.
Step 3. Will the new technology increase or decrease demand? Based on the description earlier, as the
substitute for low-skill labor becomes available, demand for low-skill labor will shift to the left, from D0 to D1.
As the technology complement for high-skill labor becomes cheaper, demand for high-skill labor will shift to
the right, from D0 to D1.
Step 4. The new equilibrium for low-skill labor, shown as point E1 with price W1 and quantity Q1, has a lower
wage and quantity hired than the original equilibrium, E0. The new equilibrium for high-skill labor, shown as
point E1 with price W1 and quantity Q1, has a higher wage and quantity hired than the original equilibrium
(E0).
Thus, the demand and supply model predicts that the new computer and communications technologies will
raise the pay of high-skill workers but reduce the pay of low-skill workers. From the 1970s to the mid-2000s,
the wage gap widened between high-skill and low-skill labor. According to the National Center for Education
Statistics, in 1980, for example, a college graduate earned about 30% more than a high school graduate with
comparable job experience, but by 2019, a college graduate earned about 59% more than an otherwise
comparable high school graduate. Many economists believe that the trend toward greater wage inequality
across the U.S. economy is due to improvements in technology.

Price Floors in the Labor Market: Living Wages and Minimum Wages

In contrast to goods and services markets, price ceilings are rare in labor markets, because rules that prevent
94 4 · Labor and Financial Markets

      people from earning income are not politically popular. There is one exception: boards of trustees or
      stockholders, as an example, propose limits on the high incomes of top business executives.
      The labor market, however, presents some prominent examples of price floors, which are an attempt to
      increase the wages of low-paid workers. The U.S. government sets a minimum wage, a price floor that makes it
      illegal for an employer to pay employees less than a certain hourly rate. In mid-2009, the U.S. minimum wage
      was raised to $7.25 per hour. Local political movements in a number of U.S. cities have pushed for a higher
      minimum wage, which they call a living wage. Promoters of living wage laws maintain that the minimum wage
      is too low to ensure a reasonable standard of living. They base this conclusion on the calculation that, if you
      work 40 hours a week at a minimum wage of $7.25 per hour for 50 weeks a year, your annual income is
      $14,500, which is less than the official U.S. government definition of what it means for a family to be in poverty.
      (A family with two adults earning minimum wage and two young children will find it more cost efficient for one
      parent to provide childcare while the other works for income. Thus the family income would be $14,500, which
      is significantly lower than the federal poverty line for a family of four, which was $26,500 in 2021.)
      Supporters of the living wage argue that full-time workers should be assured a high enough wage so that they
      can afford the essentials of life: food, clothing, shelter, and healthcare. Since Baltimore passed the first living
      wage law in 1994, several dozen cities enacted similar laws in the late 1990s and the 2000s. The living wage
      ordinances do not apply to all employers, but they have specified that all employees of the city or employees of
      firms that the city hires be paid at least a certain wage that is usually a few dollars per hour above the U.S.
      minimum wage.
      Figure 4.4 illustrates the situation of a city considering a living wage law. For simplicity, we assume that there
      is no federal minimum wage. The wage appears on the vertical axis, because the wage is the price in the labor
      market. Before the passage of the living wage law, the equilibrium wage is $10 per hour and the city hires 1,200
      workers at this wage. However, a group of concerned citizens persuades the city council to enact a living wage
      law requiring employers to pay no less than $12 per hour. In response to the higher wage, 1,600 workers look
      for jobs with the city. At this higher wage, the city, as an employer, is willing to hire only 700 workers. At the
      price floor, the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded, and a surplus of labor exists in this market.
      For workers who continue to have a job at a higher salary, life has improved. For those who were willing to
      work at the old wage rate but lost their jobs with the wage increase, life has not improved. Table 4.4 shows the
      differences in supply and demand at different wages.

      FIGURE 4.4 A Living Wage: Example of a Price Floor The original equilibrium in this labor market is a wage of $10/
      hour and a quantity of 1,200 workers, shown at point E. Imposing a wage floor at $12/hour leads to an excess
      supply of labor. At that wage, the quantity of labor supplied is 1,600 and the quantity of labor demanded is only 700.

TABLE 4.4 Living Wage: Example of a Price Floor

The Minimum Wage as an Example of a Price Floor

The U.S. minimum wage is a price floor that is set either very close to the equilibrium wage or even slightly
below it. About 1.5% of hourly workers in the U.S. are paid the minimum wage. In other words, the vast
majority of the U.S. labor force has its wages determined in the labor market, not as a result of the government
price floor. However, for workers with low skills and little experience, like those without a high school diploma
or teenagers, the minimum wage is quite important. In many cities, the federal minimum wage is apparently
below the market price for unskilled labor, because employers offer more than the minimum wage to checkout
clerks and other low-skill workers without any government prodding.

Economists have attempted to estimate how much the minimum wage reduces the quantity demanded of low-
skill labor. A typical result of such studies is that a 10% increase in the minimum wage would decrease the
hiring of unskilled workers by 1 to 2%, which seems a relatively small reduction. In fact, some studies have
even found no effect of a higher minimum wage on employment at certain times and places--although these
studies are controversial. Well-known economists Walter Williams and Thomas Sowell, who both focus on the
intersections of race and economics, argue that minimum wages increase discrimination and limit economic
mobility. Williams, for example, indicates that higher minimum wages would increase employment barriers
for lower-skilled workers, reducing the opportunity for them to learn on the job and gain experience that
would give them more choice in employment.

Let's suppose that the minimum wage lies just slightly below the equilibrium wage level. Wages could fluctuate
according to market forces above this price floor, but they would not be allowed to move beneath the floor. In
this situation, the price floor minimum wage is nonbinding --that is, the price floor is not determining the
market outcome. Even if the minimum wage moves just a little higher, it will still have no effect on the quantity
of employment in the economy, as long as it remains below the equilibrium wage. Even if the government
increases the minimum wage by enough so that it rises slightly above the equilibrium wage and becomes
binding, there will be only a small excess supply gap between the quantity demanded and quantity supplied.

These insights help to explain why U.S. minimum wage laws have historically had only a small impact on
employment. Since the minimum wage has typically been set close to the equilibrium wage for low-skill labor
and sometimes even below it, it has not had a large effect in creating an excess supply of labor. However, if the
minimum wage increased dramatically--say, if it doubled to match the living wages that some U.S. cities have
considered--then its impact on reducing the quantity demanded of employment would be far greater. The
following Clear It Up feature describes in greater detail some of the arguments for and against changes to the
minimum wage.
96 4 · Labor and Financial Markets

              CLEAR IT UP

     What's the harm in raising the minimum wage?

      Because of the law of demand, a higher required wage will reduce the amount of low-skill employment either in
      terms of employees or in terms of work hours. Although there is controversy over the numbers, let's say for the sake
      of the argument that a 10% rise in the minimum wage will reduce the employment of low-skill workers by 2%. Does
      this outcome mean that raising the minimum wage by 10% is bad public policy? Not necessarily.

      If 98% of those receiving the minimum wage have a pay increase of 10%, but 2% of those receiving the minimum
      wage lose their jobs, are the gains for society as a whole greater than the losses? The answer is not clear, because
      job losses, even for a small group, may cause more pain than modest income gains for others. For one thing, we
      need to consider which minimum wage workers are losing their jobs. If the 2% of minimum wage workers who lose
      their jobs are struggling to support families, that is one thing. If those who lose their job are high school students
      picking up spending money over summer vacation, that is something else.

      Another complexity is that many minimum wage workers do not work full-time for an entire year. Imagine a
      minimum wage worker who holds different part-time jobs for a few months at a time, with bouts of unemployment
      in between. The worker in this situation receives the 10% raise in the minimum wage when working, but also ends
      up working 2% fewer hours during the year because the higher minimum wage reduces how much employers want
      people to work. Overall, this worker's income would rise because the 10% pay raise would more than offset the 2%
      fewer hours worked.

      Of course, these arguments do not prove that raising the minimum wage is necessarily a good idea either. There may
      well be other, better public policy options for helping low-wage workers. (The Poverty and Economic Inequality
      chapter discusses some possibilities.) The lesson from this maze of minimum wage arguments is that complex
      social problems rarely have simple answers. Even those who agree on how a proposed economic policy affects
      quantity demanded and quantity supplied may still disagree on whether the policy is a good idea.

    4.2 Demand and Supply in Financial Markets

      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      By the end of this section, you will be able to:

        · Identify the demanders and suppliers in a financial market
        · Explain how interest rates can affect supply and demand
        · Analyze the economic effects of U.S. debt in terms of domestic financial markets
        · Explain the role of price ceilings and usury laws in the U.S.

      United States' households, institutions, and domestic businesses saved almost $1.3 trillion in 2015. Where did
      that savings go and how was it used? Some of the savings ended up in banks, which in turn loaned the money
      to individuals or businesses that wanted to borrow money. Some was invested in private companies or loaned
      to government agencies that wanted to borrow money to raise funds for purposes like building roads or mass
      transit. Some firms reinvested their savings in their own businesses.

      In this section, we will determine how the demand and supply model links those who wish to supply financial
      capital (i.e., savings) with those who demand financial capital (i.e., borrowing). Those who save money (or
      make financial investments, which is the same thing), whether individuals or businesses, are on the supply
      side of the financial market. Those who borrow money are on the demand side of the financial market. For a
      more detailed treatment of the different kinds of financial investments like bank accounts, stocks and bonds,
      see the Financial Markets chapter.

     Who Demands and Who Supplies in Financial Markets?

      In any market, the price is what suppliers receive and what demanders pay. In financial markets, those who

supply financial capital through saving expect to receive a rate of return, while those who demand financial
capital by receiving funds expect to pay a rate of return. This rate of return can come in a variety of forms,
depending on the type of investment.
The simplest example of a rate of return is the interest rate. For example, when you supply money into a
savings account at a bank, you receive interest on your deposit. The interest the bank pays you as a percent of
your deposits is the interest rate. Similarly, if you demand a loan to buy a car or a computer, you will need to
pay interest on the money you borrow.
Let's consider the market for borrowing money with credit cards. In 2021, almost 200 million Americans were
cardholders. Credit cards allow you to borrow money from the card's issuer, and pay back the borrowed
amount plus interest, although most allow you a period of time in which you can repay the loan without paying
interest. A typical credit card interest rate ranges from 12% to 18% per year. In May 2021, Americans had
about $807 billion outstanding in credit card debts. As of 2021, just over 45% of American families carried
some credit card debt. Let's say that, on average, the annual interest rate for credit card borrowing is 15% per
year. Thus, Americans pay tens of billions of dollars every year in interest on their credit cards--plus basic fees
for the credit card or fees for late payments.
Figure 4.5 illustrates demand and supply in the financial market for credit cards. The horizontal axis of the
financial market shows the quantity of money loaned or borrowed in this market. The vertical or price axis
shows the rate of return, which in the case of credit card borrowing we can measure with an interest rate. Table
4.5 shows the quantity of financial capital that consumers demand at various interest rates and the quantity
that credit card firms (often banks) are willing to supply.

FIGURE 4.5 Demand and Supply for Borrowing Money with Credit Cards In this market for credit card borrowing,
the demand curve (D) for borrowing financial capital intersects the supply curve (S) for lending financial capital at
equilibrium E. At the equilibrium, the interest rate (the "price" in this market) is 15% and the quantity of financial
capital loaned and borrowed is $600 billion. The equilibrium price is where the quantity demanded and the quantity
supplied are equal. At an above-equilibrium interest rate like 21%, the quantity of financial capital supplied would
increase to $750 billion, but the quantity demanded would decrease to $480 billion. At a below-equilibrium interest
rate like 13%, the quantity of financial capital demanded would increase to $700 billion, but the quantity of financial
capital supplied would decrease to $510 billion.

TABLE 4.5 Demand and Supply for Borrowing Money with Credit Cards

The laws of demand and supply continue to apply in the financial markets. According to the law of demand, a
higher rate of return (that is, a higher price) will decrease the quantity demanded. As the interest rate rises,
consumers will reduce the quantity that they borrow. According to the law of supply, a higher price increases
the quantity supplied. Consequently, as the interest rate paid on credit card borrowing rises, more firms will be
eager to issue credit cards and to encourage customers to use them. Conversely, if the interest rate on credit
cards falls, the quantity of financial capital supplied in the credit card market will decrease and the quantity
demanded will increase.

Equilibrium in Financial Markets

In the financial market for credit cards in Figure 4.5, the supply curve (S) and the demand curve (D) cross at
the equilibrium point (E). The equilibrium occurs at an interest rate of 15%, where the quantity of funds
demanded and the quantity supplied are equal at an equilibrium quantity of $600 billion.

If the interest rate (remember, this measures the "price" in the financial market) is above the equilibrium level,
then an excess supply, or a surplus, of financial capital will arise in this market. For example, at an interest rate
of 21%, the quantity of funds supplied increases to $750 billion, while the quantity demanded decreases to
$480 billion. At this above-equilibrium interest rate, firms are eager to supply loans to credit card borrowers,
but relatively few people or businesses wish to borrow. As a result, some credit card firms will lower the
interest rates (or other fees) they charge to attract more business. This strategy will push the interest rate down
toward the equilibrium level.

If the interest rate is below the equilibrium, then excess demand or a shortage of funds occurs in this market.
At an interest rate of 13%, the quantity of funds credit card borrowers demand increases to $700 billion, but
the quantity credit card firms are willing to supply is only $510 billion. In this situation, credit card firms will
perceive that they are overloaded with eager borrowers and conclude that they have an opportunity to raise
interest rates or fees. The interest rate will face economic pressures to creep up toward the equilibrium level.

The FRED database publishes some two dozen measures of interest rates, including interest rates on credit
cards, automobile loans, personal loans, mortgage loans, and more. You can find these at the FRED website
(https://openstax.org/l/FRED_stlouis).

Shifts in Demand and Supply in Financial Markets

Those who supply financial capital face two broad decisions: how much to save, and how to divide up their
savings among different forms of financial investments. We will discuss each of these in turn.

Participants in financial markets must decide when they prefer to consume goods: now or in the future.

Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                           4.2 · Demand and Supply in Financial Markets 99

Economists call this intertemporal decision making because it involves decisions across time. Unlike a
decision about what to buy from the grocery store, people make investment or savings decisions across a
period of time, sometimes a long period.

Most workers save for retirement because their income in the present is greater than their needs, while the
opposite will be true once they retire. Thus, they save today and supply financial markets. If their income
increases, they save more. If their perceived situation in the future changes, they change the amount of their
saving. For example, there is some evidence that Social Security, the program that workers pay into in order to
qualify for government checks after retirement, has tended to reduce the quantity of financial capital that
workers save. If this is true, Social Security has shifted the supply of financial capital at any interest rate to the
left.

By contrast, many college students need money today when their income is low (or nonexistent) to pay their
college expenses. As a result, they borrow today and demand from financial markets. Once they graduate and
become employed, they will pay back the loans. Individuals borrow money to purchase homes or cars. A
business seeks financial investment so that it has the funds to build a factory or invest in a research and
development project that will not pay off for five years, ten years, or even more. Thus, when consumers and
businesses have greater confidence that they will be able to repay in the future, the quantity demanded of
financial capital at any given interest rate will shift to the right.

For example, in the technology boom of the late 1990s, many businesses became extremely confident that
investments in new technology would have a high rate of return, and their demand for financial capital shifted
to the right. Conversely, during the 2008 and 2009 Great Recession, their demand for financial capital at any
given interest rate shifted to the left.

To this point, we have been looking at saving in total. Now let us consider what affects saving in different types
of financial investments. In deciding between different forms of financial investments, suppliers of financial
capital will have to consider the rates of return and the risks involved. Rate of return is a positive attribute of
investments, but risk is a negative. If Investment A becomes more risky, or the return diminishes, then savers
will shift their funds to Investment B--and the supply curve of financial capital for Investment A will shift back
to the left while the supply curve of capital for Investment B shifts to the right.

The United States as a Global Borrower

In the global economy, trillions of dollars of financial investment cross national borders every year. In the early
2000s, financial investors from foreign countries were investing several hundred billion dollars per year more
in the U.S. economy than U.S. financial investors were investing abroad. The following Work It Out deals with
one of the macroeconomic concerns for the U.S. economy in recent years.

                                                                                                          WORK IT OUT

 The Effect of Growing U.S. Debt

  Imagine that foreign investors viewed the U.S. economy as a less desirable place to put their money because of
  fears about the growth of the U.S. public debt. Using the four-step process for analyzing how changes in supply
  and demand affect equilibrium outcomes, how would increased U.S. public debt affect the equilibrium price and
  quantity for capital in U.S. financial markets?

  Step 1. Draw a diagram showing demand and supply for financial capital that represents the original scenario in
  which foreign investors are pouring money into the U.S. economy. Figure 4.6 shows a demand curve, D, and a
  supply curve, S, where the supply of capital includes the funds arriving from foreign investors. The original
  equilibrium E0 occurs at interest rate R0 and quantity of financial investment Q0.
100 4 · Labor and Financial Markets

         FIGURE 4.6 The United States as a Global Borrower Before U.S. Debt Uncertainty The graph shows the demand
         for financial capital from and supply of financial capital into the U.S. financial markets by the foreign sector
         before the increase in uncertainty regarding U.S. public debt. The original equilibrium (E0) occurs at an
         equilibrium rate of return (R0) and the equilibrium quantity is at Q0.
         Step 2. Will the diminished confidence in the U.S. economy as a place to invest affect demand or supply of
         financial capital? Yes, it will affect supply. Many foreign investors look to the U.S. financial markets to store their
         money in safe financial vehicles with low risk and stable returns. Diminished confidence means U.S. financial
         assets will be seen as more risky.
         Step 3. Will supply increase or decrease? When the enthusiasm of foreign investors' for investing their money in

The economy has experienced an enormous inflow of foreign capital. According to the U.S. Bureau of
Economic Analysis, by the third quarter of 2021, U.S. investors had accumulated $34.45 trillion of foreign
assets, but foreign investors owned a total of $50.53 trillion of U.S. assets. If foreign investors were to pull their
money out of the U.S. economy and invest elsewhere in the world, the result could be a significantly lower
quantity of financial investment in the United States, available only at a higher interest rate. This reduced
inflow of foreign financial investment could impose hardship on U.S. consumers and firms interested in
borrowing.
In a modern, developed economy, financial capital often moves invisibly through electronic transfers between
one bank account and another. Yet we can analyze these flows of funds with the same tools of demand and
supply as markets for goods or labor.

Price Ceilings in Financial Markets: Usury Laws

As we noted earlier, about 200 million Americans own credit cards, and their interest payments and fees total
tens of billions of dollars each year. It is little wonder that political pressures sometimes arise for setting limits
on the interest rates or fees that credit card companies charge. The firms that issue credit cards, including
banks, oil companies, phone companies, and retail stores, respond that the higher interest rates are necessary
to cover the losses created by those who borrow on their credit cards and who do not repay on time or at all.
These companies also point out that cardholders can avoid paying interest if they pay their bills on time.
Consider the credit card market as Figure 4.8 illustrates. In this financial market, the vertical axis shows the
interest rate (which is the price in the financial market). Demanders in the credit card market are households
and businesses. Suppliers are the companies that issue credit cards. This figure does not use specific
numbers, which would be hypothetical in any case, but instead focuses on the underlying economic
relationships. Imagine a law imposes a price ceiling that holds the interest rate charged on credit cards at the
rate Rc, which lies below the interest rate R0 that would otherwise have prevailed in the market. The horizontal
dashed line at interest rate Rc in Figure 4.8 shows the price ceiling. The demand and supply model predicts
that at the lower price ceiling interest rate, the quantity demanded of credit card debt will increase from its
original level of Q0 to Qd; however, the quantity supplied of credit card debt will decrease from the original Q0
to Qs. At the price ceiling (Rc), quantity demanded will exceed quantity supplied. Consequently, a number of
people who want to have credit cards and are willing to pay the prevailing interest rate will find that companies
are unwilling to issue cards to them. The result will be a credit shortage.

FIGURE 4.8 Credit Card Interest Rates: Another Price Ceiling Example The original intersection of demand D and
supply S occurs at equilibrium E0. However, a price ceiling is set at the interest rate Rc, below the equilibrium
interest rate R0, and so the interest rate cannot adjust upward to the equilibrium. At the price ceiling, the quantity
demanded, Qd, exceeds the quantity supplied, Qs. There is excess demand, also called a shortage.
102 4 · Labor and Financial Markets

       Many states do have usury laws, which impose an upper limit on the interest rate that lenders can charge.
       However, in many cases these upper limits are well above the market interest rate. For example, if the interest
       rate is not allowed to rise above 30% per year, it can still fluctuate below that level according to market forces.
       A price ceiling that is set at a relatively high level is nonbinding, and it will have no practical effect unless the
       equilibrium price soars high enough to exceed the price ceiling.

     4.3 The Market System as an Efficient Mechanism for Information

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Apply demand and supply models to analyze prices and quantities
         · Explain the effects of price controls on the equilibrium of prices and quantities

       Prices exist in markets for goods and services, for labor, and for financial capital. In all of these markets, prices
       serve as a remarkable social mechanism for collecting, combining, and transmitting information that is
       relevant to the market--namely, the relationship between demand and supply--and then serving as
       messengers to convey that information to buyers and sellers. In a market-oriented economy, no government
       agency or guiding intelligence oversees the set of responses and interconnections that result from a change in
       price. Instead, each consumer reacts according to that person's preferences and budget set, and each profit-
       seeking producer reacts to the impact on its expected profits. The following Clear It Up feature examines the
       demand and supply models.

                CLEAR IT UP

      Why are demand and supply curves important?

       The demand and supply model is the second fundamental diagram for this course. (The opportunity set model that
       we introduced in the Choice in a World of Scarcity chapter was the first.) Just as it would be foolish to try to learn the
       arithmetic of long division by memorizing every possible combination of numbers that can be divided by each other,
       it would be foolish to try to memorize every specific example of demand and supply in this chapter, this textbook, or
       this course. Demand and supply is not primarily a list of examples. It is a model to analyze prices and quantities.
       Even though demand and supply diagrams have many labels, they are fundamentally the same in their logic. Your
       goal should be to understand the underlying model so you can use it to analyze any market.

       Figure 4.9 displays a generic demand and supply curve. The horizontal axis shows the different measures of
       quantity: a quantity of a good or service, or a quantity of labor for a given job, or a quantity of financial capital. The
       vertical axis shows a measure of price: the price of a good or service, the wage in the labor market, or the rate of
       return (like the interest rate) in the financial market.

       The demand and supply model can explain the existing levels of prices, wages, and rates of return. To carry out such
       an analysis, think about the quantity that will be demanded at each price and the quantity that will be supplied at
       each price--that is, think about the shape of the demand and supply curves--and how these forces will combine to
       produce equilibrium.

       We can also use demand and supply to explain how economic events will cause changes in prices, wages, and rates
       of return. There are only four possibilities: the change in any single event may cause the demand curve to shift right
       or to shift left, or it may cause the supply curve to shift right or to shift left. The key to analyzing the effect of an
       economic event on equilibrium prices and quantities is to determine which of these four possibilities occurred. The
       way to do this correctly is to think back to the list of factors that shift the demand and supply curves. Note that if
       more than one variable is changing at the same time, the overall impact will depend on the degree of the shifts.
       When there are multiple variables, economists isolate each change and analyze it independently.

FIGURE 4.9 Demand and Supply Curves The figure displays a generic demand and supply curve. The horizontal axis
shows the different measures of quantity: a quantity of a good or service, a quantity of labor for a given job, or a
quantity of financial capital. The vertical axis shows a measure of price: the price of a good or service, the wage in
the labor market, or the rate of return (like the interest rate) in the financial market. We can use the demand and
supply curves explain how economic events will cause changes in prices, wages, and rates of return.

An increase in the price of some product signals consumers that there is a shortage; therefore, they may want
to economize on buying this product. For example, if you are thinking about taking a plane trip to Hawaii, but
the ticket turns out to be expensive during the week you intend to go, you might consider other weeks when the
ticket might be cheaper. The price could be high because you were planning to travel during a holiday when
demand for traveling is high. Maybe the cost of an input like jet fuel increased or the airline has raised the
price temporarily to see how many people are willing to pay it. Perhaps all of these factors are present at the
same time. You do not need to analyze the market and break down the price change into its underlying factors.
You just have to look at the ticket price and decide whether and when to fly.
In the same way, price changes provide useful information to producers. Imagine the situation of a farmer who
grows oats and learns that the price of oats has risen. The higher price could be due to an increase in demand
caused by a new scientific study proclaiming that eating oats is especially healthful. Perhaps the price of a
substitute grain, like corn, has risen, and people have responded by buying more oats. The oat farmer does not
need to know the details. The farmer only needs to know that the price of oats has risen and that it will be
profitable to expand production as a result.
The actions of individual consumers and producers as they react to prices overlap and interlock in markets for
goods, labor, and financial capital. A change in any single market is transmitted through these multiple
interconnections to other markets. The vision of the role of flexible prices helping markets to reach
equilibrium and linking different markets together helps to explain why price controls can be so
counterproductive. Price controls are government laws that serve to regulate prices rather than allow the
various markets to determine prices. There is an old proverb: "Don't kill the messenger." In ancient times,
messengers carried information between distant cities and kingdoms. When they brought bad news, there was
an emotional impulse to kill the messenger. However, killing the messenger did not kill the bad news.
Moreover, killing the messenger had an undesirable side effect: Other messengers would refuse to bring news
to that city or kingdom, depriving its citizens of vital information.
Those who seek price controls are trying to kill the messenger--or at least to stifle an unwelcome message that
prices are bringing about the equilibrium level of price and quantity. However, price controls do nothing to
affect the underlying forces of demand and supply, and this can have serious repercussions. During China's
104 4 · Labor and Financial Markets

       "Great Leap Forward" in the late 1950s, the government kept food prices artificially low, with the result that 30
       to 40 million people died of starvation because the low prices depressed farm production. This was communist
       party leader Mao Zedong's social and economic campaign to rapidly transform the country from an agrarian
       economy to a socialist society through rapid industrialization and collectivization. Changes in demand and
       supply will continue to reveal themselves through consumers' and producers' behavior. Immobilizing the price
       messenger through price controls will deprive everyone in the economy of critical information. Without this
       information, it becomes difficult for everyone--buyers and sellers alike--to react in a flexible and appropriate
       manner as changes occur throughout the economy.

      Baby Boomers Come of Age

       The theory of supply and demand can explain what happens in the labor markets and suggests that the demand for
       nurses will increase as healthcare needs of baby boomers increase, as Figure 4.10 shows. The impact of that
       increase will result in an average salary higher than the $75,330 earned in 2020 referenced in the first part of this
       case. The new equilibrium (E1) will be at the new equilibrium price (Pe1).Equilibrium quantity will also increase from
       Qe0 to Qe1.

       FIGURE 4.10 Impact of Increasing Demand for Nurses 2020-2030 In 2020, the median salary for nurses was
       $75,330. As demand for services increases, the demand curve shifts to the right (from D0 to D1) and the equilibrium
       quantity of nurses increases from Qe0 to Qe1. The equilibrium salary increases from Pe0 to Pe1.
       Suppose that as the demand for nurses increases, the supply shrinks due to an increasing number of nurses
       entering retirement and increases in the tuition of nursing degrees. The leftward shift of the supply curve in Figure
       4.11 captures the impact of a decreasing supply of nurses. The shifts in the two curves result in higher salaries for
       nurses, but the overall impact on the quantity of nurses is uncertain, as it depends on the relative shifts of supply
       and demand.

FIGURE 4.11 Impact of Decreasing Supply of Nurses between 2020 and 2030 The increase in demand for nurses
shown in Figure 4.10 leads to both higher prices and higher quantities demanded. As nurses retire from the work
force, the supply of nurses decreases, causing a leftward shift in the supply curve and higher salaries for nurses at
Pe2. The net effect on the equilibrium quantity of nurses is uncertain, which in this representation is less than Qe1,
but more than the initial Qe0.
While we do not know if the number of nurses will increase or decrease relative to their initial employment, we know
they will have higher salaries.

Key Concepts and Summary

4.1 Demand and Supply at Work in Labor Markets

In the labor market, households are on the supply side of the market and firms are on the demand side. In the
market for financial capital, households and firms can be on either side of the market: they are suppliers of
financial capital when they save or make financial investments, and demanders of financial capital when they
borrow or receive financial investments.

In the demand and supply analysis of labor markets, we can measure the price by the annual salary or hourly
wage received. We can measure the quantity of labor various ways, like number of workers or the number of
hours worked.

Factors that can shift the demand curve for labor include: a change in the quantity demanded of the product
that the labor produces; a change in the production process that uses more or less labor; and a change in
government policy that affects the quantity of labor that firms wish to hire at a given wage. Demand can also
increase or decrease (shift) in response to: workers' level of education and training, technology, the number of
companies, and availability and price of other inputs.

The main factors that can shift the supply curve for labor are: how desirable a job appears to workers relative
to the alternatives, government policy that either restricts or encourages the quantity of workers trained for
the job, the number of workers in the economy, and required education.

4.2 Demand and Supply in Financial Markets

In the demand and supply analysis of financial markets, the "price" is the rate of return or the interest rate
received. We measure the quantity by the money that flows from those who supply financial capital to those
who demand it.

Two factors can shift the supply of financial capital to a certain investment: if people want to alter their
existing levels of consumption, and if the riskiness or return on one investment changes relative to other
investments. Factors that can shift demand for capital include business confidence and consumer confidence
in the future--since financial investments received in the present are typically repaid in the future.

4.3 The Market System as an Efficient Mechanism for Information

The market price system provides a highly efficient mechanism for disseminating information about relative
scarcities of goods, services, labor, and financial capital. Market participants do not need to know why prices
have changed, only that the changes require them to revisit previous decisions they made about supply and
demand. Price controls hide information about the true scarcity of products and thereby cause misallocation
of resources.

       in--they faced a 60% price hike to retain the same service in 2011.

       In early 2011, Netflix consumers paid about $10 a month for a package consisting of streaming video and DVD
       rentals. In July 2011, the company announced a packaging change. Customers wishing to retain both streaming
       video and DVD rental would be charged $15.98 per month, a price increase of about 60%. In 2014, Netflix also
       raised its streaming video subscription price from $7.99 to $8.99 per month for new U.S. customers. The company
       also changed its policy of 4K streaming content from $9.00 to $12.00 per month that year.

       How would customers of the 18-year-old firm react? Would they abandon Netflix? Would the ease of access to other
       venues make a difference in how consumers responded to the Netflix price change? At the time, Netflix had few
       competitors; in the intervening years, the field has grown to ten major competitors and nearly 200 smaller ones. Is
       that likely to have a greater impact than the price changes? We will explore the answers to those questions in this
       chapter, which focuses on the change in quantity with respect to a change in price, a concept economists call
       elasticity.

       Anyone who has studied economics knows the law of demand: a higher price will lead to a lower quantity
       demanded. What you may not know is how much lower the quantity demanded will be. Similarly, the law of
       supply states that a higher price will lead to a higher quantity supplied. The question is: How much higher?
       This chapter will explain how to answer these questions and why they are critically important in the real world.

       To find answers to these questions, we need to understand the concept of elasticity. Elasticity is an economics
       concept that measures responsiveness of one variable to changes in another variable. Suppose you drop two
       items from a second-floor balcony. The first item is a tennis ball. The second item is a brick. Which will bounce
       higher? Obviously, the tennis ball. We would say that the tennis ball has greater elasticity.

       Consider an economic example. Cigarette taxes are an example of a "sin tax," a tax on something that is bad for
       you, like alcohol. Governments tax cigarettes at the state and national levels. As of 2021, state taxes ranged
       from a low of 17 cents per pack in Missouri to $4.35 per pack in Connecticut and New York. The average state
       cigarette tax is $1.76 per pack. The 2021 federal tax rate on cigarettes was $1.01 per pack. In 2015, the Obama
       Administration proposed raising the federal tax nearly a dollar to $1.95 per pack. The key question is: How
       much would cigarette purchases decline?

       Taxes on cigarettes serve two purposes: to raise tax revenue for government and to discourage cigarette
       consumption. However, if a higher cigarette tax discourages consumption considerably, meaning a greatly
       reduced quantity of cigarette sales, then the cigarette tax on each pack will not raise much revenue for the
       government. Alternatively, a higher cigarette tax that does not discourage consumption by much will actually
       raise more tax revenue for the government. Thus, when a government agency tries to calculate the effects of
       altering its cigarette tax, it must analyze how much the tax affects the quantity of cigarettes consumed. This
       issue reaches beyond governments and taxes. Every firm faces a similar issue. When a firm considers raising
       the sales price, it must consider how much a price increase will reduce the quantity demanded of what it sells.
       Conversely, when a firm puts its products on sale, it must expect (or hope) that the lower price will lead to a
       significantly higher quantity demanded.

       Both the demand and supply curve show the relationship between price and the number of units demanded or
       supplied. Price elasticity is the ratio between the percentage change in the quantity demanded (Qd) or
       supplied (Qs) and the corresponding percent change in price. The price elasticity of demand is the percentage

change in the quantity demanded of a good or service divided by the percentage change in the price. The price
elasticity of supply is the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price.

We can usefully divide elasticities into three broad categories: elastic, inelastic, and unitary. Because price and
quantity demanded move in opposite directions, price elasticity of demand is always a negative number.
Therefore, price elasticity of demand is usually reported as its absolute value, without a negative sign. The
summary in Table 5.1 is assuming absolute values for price elasticity of demand. An elastic demand or elastic
supply is one in which the elasticity is greater than one, indicating a high responsiveness to changes in price.
Elasticities that are less than one indicate low responsiveness to price changes and correspond to inelastic
demand or inelastic supply. Unitary elasticities indicate proportional responsiveness of either demand or
supply, as Table 5.1 summarizes.

To calculate elasticity along a demand or supply curve economists use the average percent change in both
quantity and price. This is called the Midpoint Method for Elasticity, and is represented in the following
equations:

The advantage of the Midpoint Method is that one obtains the same elasticity between two price points
whether there is a price increase or decrease. This is because the formula uses the same base (average
quantity and average price) for both cases.

Calculating Price Elasticity of Demand

Let's calculate the elasticity between points A and B and between points G and H as Figure 5.2 shows.
114 5 · Elasticity

FIGURE 5.2 Calculating the Price Elasticity of Demand We calculate the price elasticity of demand as the
percentage change in quantity divided by the percentage change in price.

First, apply the formula to calculate the elasticity as price decreases from $70 at point B to $60 at point A:

Therefore, the elasticity of demand between these two points is  which is 0.45, an amount smaller than

one, showing that the demand is inelastic in this interval. Price elasticities of demand are always negative
since price and quantity demanded always move in opposite directions (on the demand curve). By convention,
we always talk about price elasticities of demand as positive numbers. Mathematically, we take the absolute
value of the result. We will ignore this detail from now on, while remembering to interpret elasticities as
positive numbers.

This means that, along the demand curve between point B and A, if the price changes by 1%, the quantity
demanded will change by 0.45%. A change in the price will result in a smaller percentage change in the
quantity demanded. For example, a 10% increase in the price will result in only a 4.5% decrease in quantity
demanded. A 10% decrease in the price will result in only a 4.5% increase in the quantity demanded. Price
elasticities of demand are negative numbers indicating that the demand curve is downward sloping, but we
read them as absolute values. The following Work It Out feature will walk you through calculating the price
elasticity of demand.

 Finding the Price Elasticity of Demand

  Calculate the price elasticity of demand using the data in Figure 5.2 for an increase in price from G to H. Has the
  elasticity increased or decreased?
  Step 1. We know that:

  Step 2. From the Midpoint Formula we know that:

  Step 3. So we can use the values provided in the figure in each equation:

  Step 4. Then, we can use those values to determine the price elasticity of demand:

  Therefore, the elasticity of demand from G to is H 1.47. The magnitude of the elasticity has increased (in
  absolute value) as we moved up along the demand curve from points A to B. Recall that the elasticity between
  these two points was 0.45. Demand was inelastic between points A and B and elastic between points G and H.
  This shows us that price elasticity of demand changes at different points along a straight-line demand curve.

Calculating the Price Elasticity of Supply

Assume that an apartment rents for $650 per month and at that price the landlord rents 10,000 units as Figure
5.3 shows. When the price increases to $700 per month, the landlord supplies 13,000 units into the market. By
what percentage does apartment supply increase? What is the price sensitivity?
116 5 · Elasticity

       FIGURE 5.3 Price Elasticity of Supply We calculate the price elasticity of supply as the percentage change in
       quantity divided by the percentage change in price.
       Using the Midpoint Method,

       Again, as with the elasticity of demand, the elasticity of supply is not followed by any units. Elasticity is a ratio
       of one percentage change to another percentage change--nothing more--and we read it as an absolute value. In
       this case, a 1% rise in price causes an increase in quantity supplied of 3.5%. The greater than one elasticity of
       supply means that the percentage change in quantity supplied will be greater than a one percent price change.
       If you're starting to wonder if the concept of slope fits into this calculation, read the following Clear It Up box.

                CLEAR IT UP
      Is the elasticity the slope?

       It is a common mistake to confuse the slope of either the supply or demand curve with its elasticity. The slope is the
       rate of change in units along the curve, or the rise/run (change in y over the change in x). For example, in Figure 5.2,
       at each point shown on the demand curve, price drops by $10 and the number of units demanded increases by 200
       compared to the point to its left. The slope is -10/200 along the entire demand curve and does not change. The
       price elasticity, however, changes along the curve. Elasticity between points A and B was 0.45 and increased to 1.47
       between points G and H. Elasticity is the percentage change, which is a different calculation from the slope and has
       a different meaning.
       When we are at the upper end of a demand curve, where price is high and the quantity demanded is low, a small
       change in the quantity demanded, even in, say, one unit, is pretty big in percentage terms. A change in price of, say,
       a dollar, is going to be much less important in percentage terms than it would have been at the bottom of the

demand curve. Likewise, at the bottom of the demand curve, that one unit change when the quantity demanded is
high will be small as a percentage.
Thus, at one end of the demand curve, where we have a large percentage change in quantity demanded over a small
percentage change in price, the elasticity value would be high, or demand would be relatively elastic. Even with the
same change in the price and the same change in the quantity demanded, at the other end of the demand curve the
quantity is much higher, and the price is much lower, so the percentage change in quantity demanded is smaller and
the percentage change in price is much higher. That means at the bottom of the curve we'd have a small numerator
over a large denominator, so the elasticity measure would be much lower, or inelastic.
As we move along the demand curve, the values for quantity and price go up or down, depending on which way we
are moving, so the percentages for, say, a $1 difference in price or a one unit difference in quantity, will change as
well, which means the ratios of those percentages and hence the elasticity will change.

5.2 Polar Cases of Elasticity and Constant Elasticity

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Differentiate between infinite and zero elasticity
  · Analyze graphs in order to classify elasticity as constant unitary, infinite, or zero
There are two extreme cases of elasticity: when elasticity equals zero and when it is infinite. A third case of
interest is that of constant unitary elasticity. We will describe each case. Infinite elasticity or perfect elasticity
refers to the extreme case where either the quantity demanded (Qd) or supplied (Qs) changes by an infinite
amount in response to any change in price at all. In both cases, the supply and the demand curve are
horizontal as Figure 5.4 shows. While perfectly elastic supply curves are for the most part unrealistic, goods
with readily available inputs and whose production can easily expand will feature highly elastic supply curves.
Examples include pizza, bread, books, and pencils. Similarly, perfectly elastic demand is an extreme example.
However, luxury goods, items that take a large share of individuals' income, and goods with many substitutes
are likely to have highly elastic demand curves. Examples of such goods are Caribbean cruises and sports
vehicles.

FIGURE 5.4 Infinite Elasticity The horizontal lines show that an infinite quantity will be demanded or supplied at a
specific price. This illustrates the cases of a perfectly (or infinitely) elastic demand curve and supply curve. The
quantity supplied or demanded is extremely responsive to price changes, moving from zero for prices close to P to
infinite when prices reach P.
Zero elasticity or perfect inelasticity, as Figure 5.5 depicts, refers to the extreme case in which a percentage
change in price, no matter how large, results in zero change in quantity. While a perfectly inelastic supply is an
extreme example, goods with limited supply of inputs are likely to feature highly inelastic supply curves.
Examples include diamond rings or housing in prime locations such as apartments facing Central Park in New
118 5 · Elasticity

       York City. Similarly, while perfectly inelastic demand is an extreme case, necessities with no close substitutes
       are likely to have highly inelastic demand curves. This is the case of life-saving drugs and gasoline.

       FIGURE 5.5 Zero Elasticity The vertical supply curve and vertical demand curve show that there will be zero
       percentage change in quantity (a) demanded or (b) supplied, regardless of the price.
       Constant unitary elasticity, in either a supply or demand curve, occurs when a price change of one percent
       results in a quantity change of one percent. Figure 5.6 shows a demand curve with constant unit elasticity.
       Using the midpoint method, you can calculate that between points A and B on the demand curve, the price
       changes by 66.7% and quantity demanded also changes by 66.7%. Hence, the elasticity equals 1. Between
       points B and C, price again changes by 66.7% as does quantity, while between points C and D the
       corresponding percentage changes are again 66.7% for both price and quantity. In each case, then, the
       percentage change in price equals the percentage change in quantity, and consequently elasticity equals 1.
       Notice that in absolute value, the declines in price, as you step down the demand curve, are not identical.
       Instead, the price falls by $8.00 from A to B, by a smaller amount of $4.00 from B to C, and by a still smaller
       amount of $2.00 from C to D. As a result, a demand curve with constant unitary elasticity moves from a steeper
       slope on the left and a flatter slope on the right--and a curved shape overall.

FIGURE 5.6 A Constant Unitary Elasticity Demand Curve A demand curve with constant unitary elasticity will be a
curved line. Notice how price and quantity demanded change by an identical percentage amount between each pair
of points on the demand curve.
Unlike the demand curve with unitary elasticity, the supply curve with unitary elasticity is represented by a
straight line, and that line goes through the origin. In each pair of points on the supply curve there is an equal
difference in quantity of 30. However, in percentage value, using the midpoint method, the steps are
decreasing as one moves from left to right, from 28.6% to 22.2% to 18.2%, because the quantity points in each
percentage calculation are getting increasingly larger, which expands the denominator in the elasticity
calculation of the percentage change in quantity.
Consider the price changes moving up the supply curve in Figure 5.7. From points D to E to F and to G on the
supply curve, each step of $1.50 is the same in absolute value. However, if we measure the price changes in
percentage change terms, using the midpoint method, they are also decreasing, from 28.6% to 22.2% to
18.2%, because the original price points in each percentage calculation are getting increasingly larger in value,
increasing the denominator in the calculation of the percentage change in price. Along the constant unitary
elasticity supply curve, the percentage quantity increases on the horizontal axis exactly match the percentage
price increases on the vertical axis--so this supply curve has a constant unitary elasticity at all points.
120 5 · Elasticity

FIGURE 5.7 A Constant Unitary Elasticity Supply Curve A constant unitary elasticity supply curve is a straight line
reaching up from the origin. Between each pair of points, the percentage increase in quantity supplied is the same
as the percentage increase in price.

5.3 Elasticity and Pricing

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Analyze how price elasticities impact revenue
  · Evaluate how elasticity can cause shifts in demand and supply
  · Predict how the long-run and short-run impacts of elasticity affect equilibrium
  · Explain how the elasticity of demand and supply determine the incidence of a tax on buyers and sellers

Studying elasticities is useful for a number of reasons, pricing being most important. Let's explore how
elasticity relates to revenue and pricing, both in the long and short run. First, let's look at the elasticities of
some common goods and services.

Table 5.2 shows a selection of demand elasticities for different goods and services drawn from a variety of
different studies by economists, listed in order of increasing elasticity.

Note that demand for necessities such as housing and electricity is inelastic, while items that are not
necessities such as restaurant meals are more price-sensitive. If the price of a restaurant meal increases by
10%, the quantity demanded will decrease by 22.7%. A 10% increase in the price of housing will cause only a
slight decrease of 1.2% in the quantity of housing demanded.

Does Raising Price Bring in More Revenue?

Imagine that a band on tour is playing in an indoor arena with 15,000 seats. To keep this example simple,
assume that the band keeps all the money from ticket sales. Assume further that the band pays the costs for its
appearance, but that these costs, like travel, and setting up the stage, are the same regardless of how many
people are in the audience. Finally, assume that all the tickets have the same price. (The same insights apply if
ticket prices are more expensive for some seats than for others, but the calculations become more
complicated.) The band knows that it faces a downward-sloping demand curve; that is, if the band raises the
ticket price, it will sell fewer seats. How should the band set the ticket price to generate the most total revenue,
which in this example, because costs are fixed, will also mean the highest profits for the band? Should the band
sell more tickets at a lower price or fewer tickets at a higher price?

The key concept in thinking about collecting the most revenue is the price elasticity of demand. Total revenue
is price times the quantity of tickets sold. Imagine that the band starts off thinking about a certain price, which
will result in the sale of a certain quantity of tickets. The three possibilities are in Table 5.3. If demand is elastic
122 5 · Elasticity

at that price level, then the band should cut the price, because the percentage drop in price will result in an
even larger percentage increase in the quantity sold--thus raising total revenue. However, if demand is
inelastic at that original quantity level, then the band should raise the ticket price, because a certain
percentage increase in price will result in a smaller percentage decrease in the quantity sold--and total
revenue will rise. If demand has a unitary elasticity at that quantity, then an equal percentage change in
quantity will offset a moderate percentage change in the price--so the band will earn the same revenue
whether it (moderately) increases or decreases the ticket price.

TABLE 5.3 Will the Band Earn More Revenue by Changing Ticket Prices?

What if the band keeps cutting price, because demand is elastic, until it reaches a level where it sells all 15,000
seats in the available arena? If demand remains elastic at that quantity, the band might try to move to a bigger
arena, so that it could slash ticket prices further and see a larger percentage increase in the quantity of tickets
sold. However, if the 15,000-seat arena is all that is available or if a larger arena would add substantially to
costs, then this option may not work.

Conversely, a few bands are so famous, or have such fanatical followings, that demand for tickets may be
inelastic right up to the point where the arena is full. These bands can, if they wish, keep raising the ticket
price. Ironically, some of the most popular bands could make more revenue by setting prices so high that the
arena is not full--but those who buy the tickets would have to pay very high prices. However, bands sometimes
choose to sell tickets for less than the absolute maximum they might be able to charge, often in the hope that
fans will feel happier and spend more on recordings, T-shirts, and other paraphernalia.

Can Businesses Pass Costs on to Consumers?

Most businesses face a day-to-day struggle to figure out ways to produce at a lower cost, as one pathway to their
goal of earning higher profits. However, in some cases, the price of a key input over which the firm has no
control may rise. For example, many chemical companies use petroleum as a key input, but they have no
control over the world market price for crude oil. Coffee shops use coffee as a key input, but they have no
control over the world market price of coffee. If the cost of a key input rises, can the firm pass those higher
costs along to consumers in the form of higher prices? Conversely, if new and less expensive ways of producing
are invented, can the firm keep the benefits in the form of higher profits, or will the market pressure them to
pass the gains along to consumers in the form of lower prices? The price elasticity of demand plays a key role
in answering these questions.

Imagine that as a consumer of legal pharmaceutical products, you read a newspaper story that a technological
breakthrough in the production of aspirin has occurred, so that every aspirin factory can now produce aspirin
more cheaply. What does this discovery mean to you? Figure 5.8 illustrates two possibilities. In Figure 5.8 (a),
the demand curve is highly inelastic. In this case, a technological breakthrough that shifts supply to the right,

from S0 to S1, so that the equilibrium shifts from E0 to E1, creates a substantially lower price for the product
with relatively little impact on the quantity sold. In Figure 5.8 (b), the demand curve is highly elastic. In this
case, the technological breakthrough leads to a much greater quantity sold in the market at very close to the
original price. Consumers benefit more, in general, when the demand curve is more inelastic because the shift
in the supply results in a much lower price for consumers.

FIGURE 5.8 Passing along Cost Savings to Consumers Cost-saving gains cause supply to shift out to the right from
S0 to S1; that is, at any given price, firms will be willing to supply a greater quantity. If demand is inelastic, as in (a),
the result of this cost-saving technological improvement will be substantially lower prices. If demand is elastic, as in
(b), the result will be only slightly lower prices. Consumers benefit in either case, from a greater quantity at a lower
price, but the benefit is greater when demand is inelastic, as in (a).
Aspirin producers may find themselves in a nasty bind here. The situation in Figure 5.8, with extremely
inelastic demand, means that a new invention may cause the price to drop dramatically while quantity
changes little. As a result, the new production technology can lead to a drop in the revenue that firms earn
from aspirin sales. However, if strong competition exists between aspirin producers, each producer may have
little choice but to search for and implement any breakthrough that allows it to reduce production costs. After
all, if one firm decides not to implement such a cost-saving technology, other firms that do can drive them out
of business.
Since demand for food is generally inelastic, farmers may often face the situation in Figure 5.8 (a). That is, a
surge in production leads to a severe drop in price that can actually decrease the total revenue that farmers
receive. Conversely, poor weather or other conditions that cause a terrible year for farm production can
sharply raise prices so that the total revenue that the farmer receives increases. The Clear It Up box discusses
how these issues relate to coffee.

         CLEAR IT UP
How do coffee prices fluctuate?

Coffee is an international crop. The top five coffee-exporting nations are Brazil, Vietnam, Colombia, Indonesia, and
Ethiopia. In these nations and others, 20 million families depend on selling coffee beans as their main source of
income. These families are exposed to enormous risk, because the world price of coffee bounces up and down. For
example, in 1993, the world price of coffee was about 50 cents per pound. In 1995 it was four times as high, at $2
per pound. By 1997 it had fallen by half to $1.00 per pound. In 1998 it leaped back up to $2 per pound. By 2001 it
had fallen back to 46 cents a pound. By early 2011 it rose to about $2.31 per pound. By the end of 2012, the price
124 5 · Elasticity

       had fallen back to about $1.31 per pound. Since then, the price of coffee has continued to fluctuate.
       The reason for these price fluctuations lies in a combination of inelastic demand and shifts in supply. The elasticity
       of coffee demand is only about 0.3; that is, a 10% rise in the price of coffee leads to a decline of about 3% in the
       quantity of coffee consumed. When a major frost hit the Brazilian coffee crop in 1994, coffee supply shifted to the
       left with an inelastic demand curve, leading to much higher prices. Conversely, when Vietnam entered the world
       coffee market as a major producer in the late 1990s, the supply curve shifted out to the right. With a highly inelastic
       demand curve, coffee prices fell dramatically. Figure 5.8 (a) illustrates this situation.

       Elasticity also reveals whether firms can pass higher costs that they incur on to consumers. Addictive
       substances, for which demand is inelastic, are products for which producers can pass higher costs on to
       consumers. For example, the demand for cigarettes is relatively inelastic among regular smokers who are
       somewhat addicted. Economic research suggests that increasing cigarette prices by 10% leads to about a 3%
       reduction in the quantity of cigarettes that adults smoke, so the elasticity of demand for cigarettes is 0.3. If
       society increases taxes on companies that produce cigarettes, the result will be, as in Figure 5.9 (a), that the
       supply curve shifts from S0 to S1. However, as the equilibrium moves from E0 to E1, governments mainly pass
       along these taxes to consumers in the form of higher prices. These higher taxes on cigarettes will raise tax
       revenue for the government, but they will not much affect the quantity of smoking.
       If the goal is to reduce the quantity of cigarettes demanded, we must achieve it by shifting this inelastic
       demand back to the left, perhaps with public programs to discourage cigarette use or to help people to quit. For
       example, anti-smoking advertising campaigns have shown some ability to reduce smoking. However, if
       cigarette demand were more elastic, as in Figure 5.9 (b), then an increase in taxes that shifts supply from S0 to
       S1 and equilibrium from E0 to E1 would reduce the quantity of cigarettes smoked substantially. Youth smoking
       seems to be more elastic than adult smoking--that is, the quantity of youth smoking will fall by a greater
       percentage than the quantity of adult smoking in response to a given percentage increase in price.

       FIGURE 5.9 Passing along Higher Costs to Consumers Higher costs, like a higher tax on cigarette companies for
       the example we gave in the text, lead supply to shift to the left. This shift is identical in (a) and (b). However, in (a),
       where demand is inelastic, companies largely can pass the cost increase along to consumers in the form of higher
       prices, without much of a decline in equilibrium quantity. In (b), demand is elastic, so the shift in supply results
       primarily in a lower equilibrium quantity. Consumers do not benefit in either case, but in (a), they pay a higher price
       for the same quantity, while in (b), they must buy a lower quantity (and presumably needing to shift their
       consumption elsewhere).

Elasticity and Tax Incidence

The example of cigarette taxes demonstrated that because demand is inelastic, taxes are not effective at
reducing the equilibrium quantity of smoking, and they are mainly passed along to consumers in the form of
higher prices. The analysis, or manner, of how a tax burden is divided between consumers and producers is
called tax incidence. Typically, the tax incidence, or burden, falls both on the consumers and producers of the
taxed good. However, if one wants to predict which group will bear most of the burden, all one needs to do is
examine the elasticity of demand and supply. In the tobacco example, the tax burden falls on the most inelastic
side of the market.
If demand is more inelastic than supply, consumers bear most of the tax burden, and if supply is more
inelastic than demand, sellers bear most of the tax burden.
The intuition for this is simple. When the demand is inelastic, consumers are not very responsive to price
changes, and the quantity demanded reduces only modestly when the tax is introduced. In the case of
smoking, the demand is inelastic because consumers are addicted to the product. The government can then
pass the tax burden along to consumers in the form of higher prices, without much of a decline in the
equilibrium quantity.
Similarly, when a government introduces a tax in a market with an inelastic supply, such as, for example,
beachfront hotels, and sellers have no alternative than to accept lower prices for their business, taxes do not
greatly affect the equilibrium quantity. The tax burden now passes on to the sellers. If the supply was elastic
and sellers had the possibility of reorganizing their businesses to avoid supplying the taxed good, the tax
burden on the sellers would be much smaller. The tax would result in a much lower quantity sold instead of
lower prices received. Figure 5.10 illustrates this relationship between the tax incidence and elasticity of
demand and supply.

FIGURE 5.10 Elasticity and Tax Incidence An excise tax introduces a wedge between the price paid by consumers
(Pc) and the price received by producers (Pp). The vertical distance between Pc and Pp is the amount of the tax per
unit. Pe is the equilibrium price prior to introduction of the tax. (a) When the demand is more elastic than supply, the
tax incidence on consumers Pc - Pe is lower than the tax incidence on producers Pe - Pp. (b) When the supply is
more elastic than demand, the tax incidence on consumers Pc - Pe is larger than the tax incidence on producers Pe
- Pp. The more elastic the demand and supply curves, the lower the tax revenue.
In Figure 5.10 (a), the supply is inelastic and the demand is elastic, such as in the example of beachfront hotels.
While consumers may have other vacation choices, sellers can't easily move their businesses. By introducing a
tax, the government essentially creates a wedge between the price paid by consumers Pc and the price
received by producers Pp. In other words, of the total price paid by consumers, part is retained by the sellers
126 5 · Elasticity

       and part is paid to the government in the form of a tax. The distance between Pc and Pp is the tax rate. The new
       market price is Pc, but sellers receive only Pp per unit sold, as they pay Pc-Pp to the government. Since we can
       view a tax as raising the costs of production, this could also be represented by a leftward shift of the supply
       curve, where the new supply curve would intercept the demand at the new quantity Qt. For simplicity, Figure
       5.10 omits the shift in the supply curve.

       The tax revenue is given by the shaded area, which we obtain by multiplying the tax per unit by the total
       quantity sold Qt. The tax incidence on the consumers is given by the difference between the price paid Pc and
       the initial equilibrium price Pe. The tax incidence on the sellers is given by the difference between the initial
       equilibrium price Pe and the price they receive after the tax is introduced Pp. In Figure 5.10 (a), the tax burden
       falls disproportionately on the sellers, and a larger proportion of the tax revenue (the shaded area) is due to the
       resulting lower price received by the sellers than by the resulting higher prices paid by the buyers. Figure 5.10
       (b) describes the example of the tobacco excise tax where the supply is more elastic than demand. The tax
       incidence now falls disproportionately on consumers, as shown by the large difference between the price they
       pay, Pc, and the initial equilibrium price, Pe. Sellers receive a lower price than before the tax, but this
       difference is much smaller than the change in consumers' price. From this analysis one can also predict
       whether a tax is likely to create a large revenue or not. The more elastic the demand curve, the more likely that
       consumers will reduce quantity instead of paying higher prices. The more elastic the supply curve, the more
       likely that sellers will reduce the quantity sold, instead of taking lower prices. In a market where both the
       demand and supply are very elastic, the imposition of an excise tax generates low revenue.

       Some believe that excise taxes hurt mainly the specific industries they target. For example, the medical device
       excise tax, which was implemented in 2013, has been controversial for it can delay industry profitability and
       therefore hamper start-ups and medical innovation. The tax was repealed in late 2019. However, whether the
       tax burden falls mostly on the medical device industry or on the patients depends simply on the elasticity of
       demand and supply.

      Long-Run vs. Short-Run Impact

       Elasticities are often lower in the short run than in the long run. On the demand side of the market, it can
       sometimes be difficult to change Qd in the short run, but easier in the long run. Consumption of energy is a
       clear example. In the short run, it is not easy for a person to make substantial changes in energy consumption.
       Maybe you can carpool to work sometimes or adjust your home thermostat by a few degrees if the cost of
       energy rises, but that is about all. However, in the long run you can purchase a car that gets more miles to the
       gallon, choose a job that is closer to where you live, buy more energy-efficient home appliances, or install more
       insulation in your home. As a result, the elasticity of demand for energy is somewhat inelastic in the short run,
       but much more elastic in the long run.

       Figure 5.11 is an example, based roughly on historical experience, for the responsiveness of Qd to price
       changes. In 1973, the price of crude oil was $12 per barrel and total consumption in the U.S. economy was 17
       million barrels per day. That year, the nations who were members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
       Countries (OPEC) cut off oil exports to the United States for six months because the Arab members of OPEC
       disagreed with the U.S. support for Israel. OPEC did not bring exports back to their earlier levels until 1975--a
       policy that we can interpret as a shift of the supply curve to the left in the U.S. petroleum market. Figure 5.11
       (a) and Figure 5.11 (b) show the same original equilibrium point and the same identical shift of a supply curve
       to the left from S0 to S1.

FIGURE 5.11 How a Shift in Supply Can Affect Price or Quantity The intersection (E0) between demand curve D and
supply curve S0 is the same in both (a) and (b). The shift of supply to the left from S0 to S1 is identical in both (a) and
(b). The new equilibrium (E1) has a higher price and a lower quantity than the original equilibrium (E0) in both (a) and
(b). However, the shape of the demand curve D is different in (a) and (b), being more elastic in (b) than in (a). As a
result, the shift in supply can result either in a new equilibrium with a much higher price and an only slightly smaller
quantity, as in (a), with more inelastic demand, or in a new equilibrium with only a small increase in price and a
relatively larger reduction in quantity, as in (b), with more elastic demand.
Figure 5.11 (a) shows inelastic demand for oil in the short run similar to that which existed for the United
States in 1973. In Figure 5.11 (a), the new equilibrium (E1) occurs at a price of $25 per barrel, roughly double
the price before the OPEC shock, and an equilibrium quantity of 16 million barrels per day. Figure 5.11 (b)
shows what the outcome would have been if the U.S. demand for oil had been more elastic, a result more likely
over the long term. This alternative equilibrium (E1) would have resulted in a smaller price increase to $14 per
barrel and larger reduction in equilibrium quantity to 13 million barrels per day. In 1983, for example, U.S.
petroleum consumption was 15.3 million barrels a day, which was lower than in 1973 or 1975. U.S. petroleum
consumption was down even though the U.S. economy was about one-fourth larger in 1983 than it had been in
1973. The primary reason for the lower quantity was that higher energy prices spurred conservation efforts,
and after a decade of home insulation, more fuel-efficient cars, more efficient appliances and machinery, and
other fuel-conserving choices, the demand curve for energy had become more elastic.
On the supply side of markets, producers of goods and services typically find it easier to expand production in
the long term of several years rather than in the short run of a few months. After all, in the short run it can be
costly or difficult to build a new factory, hire many new workers, or open new stores. However, over a few years,
all of these are possible.
In most markets for goods and services, prices bounce up and down more than quantities in the short run, but
quantities often move more than prices in the long run. The underlying reason for this pattern is that supply
and demand are often inelastic in the short run, so that shifts in either demand or supply can cause a relatively
greater change in prices. However, since supply and demand are more elastic in the long run, the long-run
movements in prices are more muted, while quantity adjusts more easily in the long run.

     5.4 Elasticity in Areas Other Than Price

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Calculate the income elasticity of demand and the cross-price elasticity of demand
         · Calculate the elasticity in labor and financial capital markets through an understanding of the elasticity of

             labor supply and the elasticity of savings
         · Apply concepts of price elasticity to real-world situations

       The basic idea of elasticity--how a percentage change in one variable causes a percentage change in another
       variable--does not just apply to the responsiveness of quantity supplied and quantity demanded to changes in
       the price of a product. Recall that quantity demanded (Qd) depends on income, tastes and preferences, the
       prices of related goods, and so on, as well as price. Similarly, quantity supplied (Qs) depends on factors such as
       the cost of production, as well as price. We can measure elasticity for any determinant of quantity supplied and
       quantity demanded, not just the price.

      Income Elasticity of Demand

       The income elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage
       change in income.

       For most products, most of the time, the income elasticity of demand is positive: that is, a rise in income will
       cause an increase in the quantity demanded. This pattern is common enough that we refer to these goods as
       normal goods. However, for a few goods, an increase in income means that one might purchase less of the
       good. For example, those with a higher income might buy fewer hamburgers, because they are buying more
       steak instead, or those with a higher income might buy less cheap wine and more imported beer. When the
       income elasticity of demand is negative, we call the good an inferior good.

       We introduced the concepts of normal and inferior goods in Demand and Supply. A higher level of income
       causes a demand curve to shift to the right for a normal good, which means that the income elasticity of
       demand is positive. How far the demand shifts depends on the income elasticity of demand. A higher income
       elasticity means a larger shift. However, for an inferior good, that is, when the income elasticity of demand is
       negative, a higher level of income would cause the demand curve for that good to shift to the left. Again, how
       much it shifts depends on how large the (negative) income elasticity is.

      Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand

       A change in the price of one good can shift the quantity demanded for another good. If the two goods are
       complements, like bread and peanut butter, then a drop in the price of one good will lead to an increase in the
       quantity demanded of the other good. However, if the two goods are substitutes, like plane tickets and train
       tickets, then a drop in the price of one good will cause people to substitute toward that good, and to reduce
       consumption of the other good. Cheaper plane tickets lead to fewer train tickets, and vice versa.

       The cross-price elasticity of demand puts some meat on the bones of these ideas. The term "cross-price"
       refers to the idea that the price of one good is affecting the quantity demanded of a different good. Specifically,
       the cross-price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity of good A that is demanded as a
       result of a percentage change in the price of good B.

       Substitute goods have positive cross-price elasticities of demand: if good A is a substitute for good B, like coffee
       and tea, then a higher price for B will mean a greater quantity consumed of A. Complement goods have
       negative cross-price elasticities: if good A is a complement for good B, like coffee and sugar, then a higher price

for B will mean a lower quantity consumed of A.

Elasticity in Labor and Financial Capital Markets

The concept of elasticity applies to any market, not just markets for goods and services. In the labor market,
for example, the wage elasticity of labor supply--that is, the percentage change in hours worked divided by
the percentage change in wages--will reflect the shape of the labor supply curve. Specifically:

The wage elasticity of labor supply for teenage workers is generally fairly elastic: that is, a certain percentage
change in wages will lead to a larger percentage change in the quantity of hours worked. Conversely, the wage
elasticity of labor supply for adult workers in their thirties and forties is fairly inelastic. When wages move up
or down by a certain percentage amount, the quantity of hours that adults in their prime earning years are
willing to supply changes but by a lesser percentage amount.
In markets for financial capital, the elasticity of savings--that is, the percentage change in the quantity of
savings divided by the percentage change in interest rates--will describe the shape of the supply curve for
financial capital. That is:

Sometimes laws are proposed that seek to increase the quantity of savings by offering tax breaks so that the
return on savings is higher. Such a policy will have a comparatively large impact on increasing the quantity
saved if the supply curve for financial capital is elastic, because then a given percentage increase in the return
to savings will cause a higher percentage increase in the quantity of savings. However, if the supply curve for
financial capital is highly inelastic, then a percentage increase in the return to savings will cause only a small
increase in the quantity of savings. The evidence on the supply curve of financial capital is controversial but, at
least in the short run, the elasticity of savings with respect to the interest rate appears fairly inelastic.

Expanding the Concept of Elasticity

The elasticity concept does not even need to relate to a typical supply or demand curve at all. For example,
imagine that you are studying whether the Internal Revenue Service should spend more money on auditing tax
returns. We can frame the question in terms of the elasticity of tax collections with respect to spending on tax
enforcement; that is, what is the percentage change in tax collections derived from a given percentage change
in spending on tax enforcement?
With all of the elasticity concepts that we have just described, some of which are in Table 5.4, the possibility of
confusion arises. When you hear the phrases "elasticity of demand" or "elasticity of supply," they refer to the
elasticity with respect to price. Sometimes, either to be extremely clear or because economists are discussing a
wide variety of elasticities, we will call the elasticity of demand or the demand elasticity the price elasticity of
demand or the "elasticity of demand with respect to price." Similarly, economists sometimes use the term
elasticity of supply or the supply elasticity, to avoid any possibility of confusion, the price elasticity of supply or
"the elasticity of supply with respect to price." However, in whatever context, the idea of elasticity always refers
to percentage change in one variable, almost always a price or money variable, and how it causes a percentage
change in another variable, typically a quantity variable of some kind.

      That Will Be How Much?

       How did the 60% price increase in 2011 end up for Netflix? It has been a very bumpy ride.
       Before the price increase, there were about 24.6 million U.S. subscribers. After the price increase, 810,000
       infuriated U.S. consumers canceled their Netflix subscriptions, dropping the total number of subscribers to 23.79
       million. Fast forward to June 2013, when there were 36 million streaming Netflix subscribers in the United States.
       This was an increase of 11.4 million subscribers since the price increase--an average per quarter growth of about
       1.6 million. This growth is less than the 2 million per quarter increases Netflix experienced in the fourth quarter of
       2010 and the first quarter of 2011.
       During the first year after the price increase, the firm's stock price (a measure of future expectations for the firm) fell
       from about $33.60 per share per share to just under $7.80. By the end of 2016, however, the stock price was at
       $123 per share. By the end of 2021, the stock price was just over $600 per share, and Netflix had more than 214
       million subscribers in fifty countries.
       What happened? Obviously, Netflix company officials understood the law of demand. Company officials reported,
       when announcing the price increase, this could result in the loss of about 600,000 existing subscribers. Using the
       elasticity of demand formula, it is easy to see company officials expected an inelastic response:

       In addition, Netflix officials had anticipated the price increase would have little impact on attracting new customers.
       Netflix anticipated adding up to 1.29 million new subscribers in the third quarter of 2011. It is true this was slower
       growth than the firm had experienced--about 2 million per quarter.
       Why was the estimate of customers leaving so far off? In the more than two decades since Netflix had been
       founded, there was an increase in the number of close, but not perfect, substitutes. Consumers now had choices
       ranging from Vudu, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and Redbox, to retail stores. Jaime Weinman reported in Maclean's that
       Redbox kiosks are "a five-minute drive for less from 68 percent of Americans, and it seems that many people still
       find a five-minute drive more convenient than loading up a movie online." It seems that in 2012, many consumers
       still preferred a physical DVD disk over streaming video.
       What missteps did the Netflix management make? In addition to misjudging the elasticity of demand, by failing to
       account for close substitutes, it seems they may have also misjudged customers' preferences and tastes. However,

the very substantial increase over time in the number of Netflix subscribers suggests that the preference for
streaming video may well have overtaken the preference for physical DVD disks. Netflix, the source of numerous late

Key Concepts and Summary

5.1 Price Elasticity of Demand and Price Elasticity of Supply

Price elasticity measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded or supplied of a good to a change in its
price. We compute it as the percentage change in quantity demanded (or supplied) divided by the percentage
change in price. We can describe elasticity as elastic (or very responsive), unit elastic, or inelastic (not very
responsive). Elastic demand or supply curves indicate that quantity demanded or supplied respond to price
changes in a greater than proportional manner. An inelastic demand or supply curve is one where a given
percentage change in price will cause a smaller percentage change in quantity demanded or supplied. A
unitary elasticity means that a given percentage change in price leads to an equal percentage change in
quantity demanded or supplied.

5.2 Polar Cases of Elasticity and Constant Elasticity

Infinite or perfect elasticity refers to the extreme case where either the quantity demanded or supplied

changes by an infinite amount in response to any change in price at all. Zero elasticity refers to the extreme
case in which a percentage change in price, no matter how large, results in zero change in quantity. Constant
unitary elasticity in either a supply or demand curve refers to a situation where a price change of one percent
results in a quantity change of one percent.

5.3 Elasticity and Pricing

In the market for goods and services, quantity supplied and quantity demanded are often relatively slow to
react to changes in price in the short run, but react more substantially in the long run. As a result, demand and
supply often (but not always) tend to be relatively inelastic in the short run and relatively elastic in the long
run. A tax incidence depends on the relative price elasticity of supply and demand. When supply is more
elastic than demand, buyers bear most of the tax burden, and when demand is more elastic than supply,
producers bear most of the cost of the tax. Tax revenue is larger the more inelastic the demand and supply are.

5.4 Elasticity in Areas Other Than Price

Elasticity is a general term, that reflects responsiveness. It refers to the change of one variable divided by the
percentage change of a related variable that we can apply to many economic connections. For instance, the
income elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change
in income. The cross-price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity demanded of a good
divided by the percentage change in the price of another good. Elasticity applies in labor markets and financial
capital markets just as it does in markets for goods and services. The wage elasticity of labor supply is the
percentage change in the quantity of hours supplied divided by the percentage change in the wage. The
elasticity of savings with respect to interest rates is the percentage change in the quantity of savings divided by
the percentage change in interest rates.

Introduction to Consumer Choices

         BRING IT HOME

Making Choices

The 2008-2009 Great Recession touched families around the globe. In too many countries, workers found
themselves out of a job. In developed countries, unemployment compensation provided a safety net, but families
still saw a marked decrease in disposable income and had to make tough spending decisions. Of course, non-
essential, discretionary spending was the first to go.

Even so, there was one particular category that saw a universal increase in spending world-wide during that
time--an 18% uptick in the United States, specifically. You might guess that consumers began eating more meals at
home, increasing grocery store spending; however, the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Expenditure Survey,
which tracks U.S. food spending over time, showed "real total food spending by U.S. households declined five
percent between 2006 and 2009." So, it was not groceries. What product would people around the world demand
138 6 · Consumer Choices

more of during tough economic times, and more importantly, why? (Find out at chapter's end.)

That question leads us to this chapter's topic--analyzing how consumers make choices and how changes affect
those choices. For instance, do changes in prices matter more or less than changes in a consumer's income? Can a
small change in circumstances alter the consumers' perception of a product or even of their own resources? While
many choices may seem straightforward, there is often much more to consider.

Microeconomics seeks to understand the behavior of individual economic agents such as individuals and
businesses. Economists believe that we can analyze individuals' decisions, such as what goods and services to
buy, as choices we make within certain budget constraints. Generally, consumers are trying to get the most for
their limited budget. In economic terms they are trying to maximize total utility, or satisfaction, given their
budget constraint.

Everyone has their own personal tastes and preferences. The French say: Chacun à son goût, or "Each to his
own taste." An old Latin saying states, De gustibus non est disputandum or "There's no disputing about taste."
If people base their decisions on their own tastes and personal preferences, however, then how can economists
hope to analyze the choices consumers make?

An economic explanation for why people make different choices begins with accepting the proverbial wisdom
that tastes are a matter of personal preference. However, economists also believe that the choices people make
are influenced by their incomes, by the prices of goods and services they consume, and by factors like where
they live. This chapter introduces the economic theory of how consumers make choices about what goods and
services to buy with their limited income.

The analysis in this chapter will build on the budget constraint that we introduced in the Choice in a World of
Scarcity chapter. This chapter will also illustrate how economic theory provides a tool to systematically look at
the full range of possible consumption choices to predict how consumption responds to changes in prices or
incomes. After reading this chapter, consult the appendix Indifference Curves to learn more about
representing utility and choice through indifference curves.

6.1 Consumption Choices

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Calculate total utility
  · Propose decisions that maximize utility
  · Explain marginal utility and the significance of diminishing marginal utility

Information on the consumption choices of Americans is available from the Consumer Expenditure Survey
carried out by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Table 6.1 shows spending patterns for the average U.S.
household. The first row shows income and, after taxes and personal savings are subtracted, it shows that, in
2015, the average U.S. household spent $48,109 on consumption. The table then breaks down consumption
into various categories. The average U.S. household spent roughly one-third of its consumption on shelter and
other housing expenses, another one-third on food and vehicle expenses, and the rest on a variety of items, as
shown. These patterns will vary for specific households by differing levels of family income, by geography, and
by preferences.

Total Utility and Diminishing Marginal Utility

To understand how a household will make its choices, economists look at what consumers can afford, as
shown in a budget constraint (or budget line), and the total utility or satisfaction derived from those choices.
In a budget constraint line, the quantity of one good is on the horizontal axis and the quantity of the other good
on the vertical axis. The budget constraint line shows the various combinations of two goods that are
affordable given consumer income. Consider José's situation, shown in Figure 6.2. José likes to collect T-shirts
and watch movies.

In Figure 6.2 we show the quantity of T-shirts on the horizontal axis while we show the quantity of movies on
the vertical axis. If José had unlimited income or goods were free, then he could consume without limit.
However, José, like all of us, faces a budget constraint. José has a total of $56 to spend. The price of T-shirts is
$14 and the price of movies is $7. Notice that the vertical intercept of the budget constraint line is at eight
movies and zero T-shirts ($56/$7=8). The horizontal intercept of the budget constraint is four, where José
spends of all of his money on T-shirts and no movies ($56/14=4). The slope of the budget constraint line is rise/
run or -8/4=-2. The specific choices along the budget constraint line show the combinations of affordable T-
shirts and movies.
140 6 · Consumer Choices

       FIGURE 6.2 A Choice between Consumption Goods José has income of $56. Movies cost $7 and T-shirts cost $14.
       The points on the budget constraint line show the combinations of affordable movies and T-shirts.
       José wishes to choose the combination that will provide him with the greatest utility, which is the term
       economists use to describe a person's level of satisfaction or happiness with their choices.
       Let's begin with an assumption, which we will discuss in more detail later, that José can measure his own
       utility with something called utils. (It is important to note that you cannot make comparisons between the utils
       of individuals. If one person gets 20 utils from a cup of coffee and another gets 10 utils, this does not mean
       than the first person gets more enjoyment from the coffee than the other or that they enjoy the coffee twice as
       much. The reason why is that utils are subjective to an individual. The way one person measures utils is not
       the same as the way someone else does.) Table 6.2 shows how José's utility is connected with his T-shirt or
       movie consumption. The first column of the table shows the quantity of T-shirts consumed. The second
       column shows the total utility, or total amount of satisfaction, that José receives from consuming that number
       of T-shirts. The most common pattern of total utility, in this example, is that consuming additional goods leads
       to greater total utility, but at a decreasing rate. The third column shows marginal utility, which is the
       additional utility provided by one additional unit of consumption. This equation for marginal utility is:

       Notice that marginal utility diminishes as additional units are consumed, which means that each subsequent
       unit of a good consumed provides less additional utility. For example, the first T-shirt José picks is his favorite
       and it gives him an addition of 22 utils. The fourth T-shirt is just something to wear when all his other clothes
       are in the wash and yields only 18 additional utils. This is an example of the law of diminishing marginal
       utility, which holds that the additional utility decreases with each unit added. Diminishing marginal utility is
       another example of the more general law of diminishing returns we learned earlier in the chapter on Choice in
       a World of Scarcity.
       The rest of Table 6.2 shows the quantity of movies that José attends, and his total and marginal utility from
       seeing each movie. Total utility follows the expected pattern: it increases as the number of movies that José
       watches rises. Marginal utility also follows the expected pattern: each additional movie brings a smaller gain in
       utility than the previous one. The first movie José attends is the one he wanted to see the most, and thus
       provides him with the highest level of utility or satisfaction. The fifth movie he attends is just to kill time.
       Notice that total utility is also the sum of the marginal utilities. Read the next Work It Out feature for
       instructions on how to calculate total utility.

Calculating Total Utility

Let's look at how José makes his decision in more detail.
Step 1. Observe that, at point Q (for example), José consumes three T-shirts and two movies.
Step 2. Look at Table 6.2. You can see from the fourth row/second column that three T-shirts are worth 63 utils.
Similarly, the second row/fifth column shows that two movies are worth 31 utils.
Step 3. From this information, you can calculate that point Q has a total utility of 94 (63 + 31).
Step 4. You can repeat the same calculations for each point on Table 6.3, in which the total utility numbers are
shown in the last column.
142 6 · Consumer Choices

For José, the highest total utility for all possible combinations of goods occurs at point S, with a total utility of
103 from consuming one T-shirt and six movies.

Choosing with Marginal Utility

Most people approach their utility-maximizing combination of choices in a step-by-step way. This approach is
based on looking at the tradeoffs, measured in terms of marginal utility, of consuming less of one good and
more of another.

For example, say that José starts off thinking about spending all his money on T-shirts and choosing point P,
which corresponds to four T-shirts and no movies, as Figure 6.2 illustrates. José chooses this starting point
randomly as he has to start somewhere. Then he considers giving up the last T-shirt, the one that provides him
the least marginal utility, and using the money he saves to buy two movies instead. Table 6.4 tracks the step-

Decision Making by Comparing Marginal Utility

José could use the following thought process (if he thought in utils) to make his decision regarding how many T-
shirts and movies to purchase:

Step 1. From Table 6.2, José can see that the marginal utility of the fourth T-shirt is 18. If José gives up the
fourth T-shirt, then he loses 18 utils.

Step 2. Giving up the fourth T-shirt, however, frees up $14 (the price of a T-shirt), allowing José to buy the first
two movies (at $7 each).

  Step 3. José knows that the marginal utility of the first movie is 16 and the marginal utility of the second movie is
  15. Thus, if José moves from point P to point Q, he gives up 18 utils (from the T-shirt), but gains 31 utils (from the
  movies).

  Step 4. Gaining 31 utils and losing 18 utils is a net gain of 13. This is just another way of saying that the total
  utility at Q (94 according to the last column in Table 6.3) is 13 more than the total utility at P (81).

  Step 5. Thus, for José, it makes sense to give up the fourth T-shirt in order to buy two movies.

José clearly prefers point Q to point P. Now repeat this step-by-step process of decision making with marginal
utilities. José thinks about giving up the third T-shirt and surrendering a marginal utility of 20, in exchange for
purchasing two more movies that promise a combined marginal utility of 27. José prefers point R to point Q.
What if José thinks about going beyond R to point S? Giving up the second T-shirt means a marginal utility loss
of 21, and the marginal utility gain from the fifth and sixth movies would combine to make a marginal utility
gain of 23, so José prefers point S to R.

However, if José seeks to go beyond point S to point T, he finds that the loss of marginal utility from giving up
the first T-shirt is 22, while the marginal utility gain from the last two movies is only a total of 19. If José were
to choose point T, his utility would fall to 100. Through these stages of thinking about marginal tradeoffs, José
again concludes that S, with one T-shirt and six movies, is the choice that will provide him with the highest
level of total utility. This step-by-step approach will reach the same conclusion regardless of José's starting
point.

We can develop a more systematic way of using this approach by focusing on satisfaction per dollar. If an item
costing $5 yields 10 utils, then it's worth 2 utils per dollar spent. Marginal utility per dollar is the amount of
additional utility José receives divided by the product's price. Table 6.5 shows the marginal utility per dollar
for José's T shirts and movies.

If José wants to maximize the utility he gets from his limited budget, he will always purchase the item with the
greatest marginal utility per dollar of expenditure (assuming he can afford it with his remaining budget). José
starts with no purchases. If he purchases a T-shirt, the marginal utility per dollar spent will be 1.6. If he
purchases a movie, the marginal utility per dollar spent will be 2.3. Therefore, José's first purchase will be the
movie. Why? Because it gives him the highest marginal utility per dollar and is affordable. Next, José will
purchase another movie. Why? Because the marginal utility of the next movie (2.14) is greater than the
marginal utility of the next T-shirt (1.6). Note that when José has no T- shirts, the next one is the first one. José
will continue to purchase the next good with the highest marginal utility per dollar until he exhausts his
budget. He will continue purchasing movies because they give him a greater "bang for the buck" until the sixth
movie which gives the same marginal utility per dollar as the first T-shirt purchase. José has just enough
budget to purchase both. So in total, José will purchase six movies and one T-shirt.

TABLE 6.5 Marginal Utility per Dollar

A Rule for Maximizing Utility

This process of decision making suggests a rule to follow when maximizing utility. Since the price of T-shirts is
twice as high as the price of movies, to maximize utility the last T-shirt that José chose needs to provide exactly
twice the marginal utility (MU) of the last movie. If the last T-shirt provides less than twice the marginal utility
of the last movie, then the T-shirt is providing less "bang for the buck" (i.e., marginal utility per dollar spent)
than José would receive from spending the same money on movies. If this is so, José should trade the T-shirt
for more movies to increase his total utility.

If the last T-shirt provides more than twice the marginal utility of the last movie, then the T-shirt is providing
more "bang for the buck" or marginal utility per dollar, than if the money were spent on movies. As a result,
José should buy more T-shirts. Notice that at José's optimal choice of point S, the marginal utility from the first
T-shirt, of 22 is exactly twice the marginal utility of the sixth movie, which is 11. At this choice, the marginal
utility per dollar is the same for both goods. This is a tell-tale signal that José has found the point with highest
total utility.

We can write this argument as a general rule: If you always choose the item with the greatest marginal utility
per dollar spent, when your budget is exhausted, the utility maximizing choice should occur where the
marginal utility per dollar spent is the same for both goods.

A sensible economizer will pay twice as much for something only if, in the marginal comparison, the item
confers twice as much utility. Notice that the formula for the table above is:

The following Work It Out feature provides step by step guidance for this concept of utility-maximizing choices.

                                                                                       WORK IT OUT

Maximizing Utility

The general rule,                , means that the last dollar spent on each good provides exactly the same

marginal utility. This is the case at point S. So:

Step 1. If we traded a dollar more of movies for a dollar more of T-shirts, the marginal utility gained from T-shirts
would exactly offset the marginal utility lost from fewer movies. In other words, the net gain would be zero.

Step 2. Products, however, usually cost more than a dollar, so we cannot trade a dollar's worth of movies. The

  best we can do is trade two movies for another T-shirt, since in this example T-shirts cost twice what a movie
  does.

  Step 3. If we trade two movies for one T-shirt, we would end up at point R (two T-shirts and four movies).

  Step 4. Choice 4 in Table 6.4 shows that if we move to point R, we would gain 21 utils from one more T-shirt, but
  lose 23 utils from two fewer movies, so we would end up with less total utility at point R.

  In short, the general rule shows us the utility-maximizing choice, which is called the consumer equilibrium.

There is another equivalent way to think about this. We can also express the general rule as the ratio of the
prices of the two goods should be equal to the ratio of the marginal utilities. When we divide the price of good 1
by the price of good 2, at the utility-maximizing point this will equal the marginal utility of good 1 divided by
the marginal utility of good 2.

Along the budget constraint, the total price of the two goods remains the same, so the ratio of the prices does
not change. However, the marginal utility of the two goods changes with the quantities consumed. At the
optimal choice of one T-shirt and six movies, point S, the ratio of marginal utility to price for T-shirts (22:14)
matches the ratio of marginal utility to price for movies (of 11:7).

Measuring Utility with Numbers

This discussion of utility began with an assumption that it is possible to place numerical values on utility, an
assumption that may seem questionable. You can buy a thermometer for measuring temperature at the
hardware store, but what store sells a "utilimometer" for measuring utility? While measuring utility with
numbers is a convenient assumption to clarify the explanation, the key assumption is not that an outside party
can measure utility but only that individuals can decide which of two alternatives they prefer.

To understand this point, think back to the step-by-step process of finding the choice with highest total utility
by comparing the marginal utility you gain and lose from different choices along the budget constraint. As José
compares each choice along his budget constraint to the previous choice, what matters is not the specific
numbers that he places on his utility--or whether he uses any numbers at all--but only that he personally can
identify which choices he prefers.

In this way, the step-by-step process of choosing the highest level of utility resembles rather closely how many
people make consumption decisions. We think about what will make us the happiest. We think about what
things cost. We think about buying a little more of one item and giving up a little of something else. We choose
what provides us with the greatest level of satisfaction. The vocabulary of comparing the points along a budget
constraint and total and marginal utility is just a set of tools for discussing this everyday process in a clear and
specific manner. It is welcome news that specific utility numbers are not central to the argument, since a good
utilimometer is hard to find. Do not worry--while we cannot measure utils, by the end of the next module, we
will have transformed our analysis into something we can measure--demand.

6.2 How Changes in Income and Prices Affect Consumption Choices

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Explain how income, prices, and preferences affect consumer choices
  · Contrast the substitution effect and the income effect
  · Utilize concepts of demand to analyze consumer choices
  · Apply utility-maximizing choices to governments and businesses
146 6 · Consumer Choices

       Just as we can use utility and marginal utility to discuss making consumer choices along a budget constraint,
       we can also use these ideas to think about how consumer choices change when the budget constraint shifts in
       response to changes in income or price. Because we can use the budget constraint framework to analyze how
       quantities demanded change because of price movements, the budget constraint model can illustrate the
       underlying logic behind demand curves.

      How Changes in Income Affect Consumer Choices

       Let's begin with a concrete example illustrating how changes in income level affect consumer choices. Figure
       6.3 shows a budget constraint that represents Kimberly's choice between concert tickets at $50 each and
       getting away overnight to a bed-and-breakfast for $200 per night. Kimberly has $1,000 per year to spend
       between these two choices. After thinking about her total utility and marginal utility and applying the decision
       rule that the ratio of the marginal utilities to the prices should be equal between the two products, Kimberly
       chooses point M, with eight concerts and three overnight getaways as her utility-maximizing choice.

       FIGURE 6.3 How a Change in Income Affects Consumption Choices The utility-maximizing choice on the original
       budget constraint is M. The dashed horizontal and vertical lines extending through point M allow you to see at a
       glance whether the quantity consumed of goods on the new budget constraint is higher or lower than on the original
       budget constraint. On the new budget constraint, Kimberly will make a choice like N if both goods are normal goods.
       If overnight stays is an inferior good, Kimberly will make a choice like P. If concert tickets are an inferior good,
       Kimberly will make a choice like Q.
       Now, assume that the income Kimberly has to spend on these two items rises to $2,000 per year, causing her
       budget constraint to shift out to the right. How does this rise in income alter her utility-maximizing choice?
       Kimberly will again consider the utility and marginal utility that she receives from concert tickets and
       overnight getaways and seek her utility-maximizing choice on the new budget line, but how will her new choice
       relate to her original choice?
       We can replace the possible choices along the new budget constraint into three groups, which the dashed
       horizontal and vertical lines that pass through the original choice M in the figure divide. All choices on the
       upper left of the new budget constraint that are to the left of the vertical dashed line, like choice P with two
       overnight stays and 32 concert tickets, involve less of the good on the horizontal axis but much more of the
       good on the vertical axis. All choices to the right of the vertical dashed line and above the horizontal dashed
       line--like choice N with five overnight getaways and 20 concert tickets--have more consumption of both goods.
       Finally, all choices that are to the right of the vertical dashed line but below the horizontal dashed line, like
       choice Q with four concerts and nine overnight getaways, involve less of the good on the vertical axis but much
       more of the good on the horizontal axis.
       All of these choices are theoretically possible, depending on Kimberly's personal preferences as expressed

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                           6.2 · How Changes in Income and Prices Affect Consumption Choices 147

through the total and marginal utility she would receive from consuming these two goods. When income rises,
the most common reaction is to purchase more of both goods, like choice N, which is to the upper right relative
to Kimberly's original choice M, although exactly how much more of each good will vary according to personal
taste. Conversely, when income falls, the most typical reaction is to purchase less of both goods. As we defined
in the chapter on Demand and Supply and again in the chapter on Elasticity, we call goods and services normal
goods when a rise in income leads to a rise in the quantity consumed of that good and a fall in income leads to
a fall in quantity consumed.
However, depending on Kimberly's preferences, a rise in income could cause consumption of one good to
increase while consumption of the other good declines. A choice like P means that a rise in income caused her
quantity consumed of overnight stays to decline, while a choice like Q would mean that a rise in income caused
her quantity of concerts to decline. Goods where demand declines as income rises (or conversely, where the
demand rises as income falls) are called "inferior goods." An inferior good occurs when people trim back on a
good as income rises, because they can now afford the more expensive choices that they prefer. For example, a
higher-income household might eat fewer hamburgers or be less likely to buy a used car, and instead eat more
steak and buy a new car.

How Price Changes Affect Consumer Choices

For analyzing the possible effect of a change in price on consumption, let's again use a concrete example.
Figure 6.4 represents Sergei's consumer choice, who chooses between purchasing baseball bats and cameras.
A price increase for baseball bats would have no effect on the ability to purchase cameras, but it would reduce
the number of bats Sergei could afford to buy. Thus a price increase for baseball bats, the good on the
horizontal axis, causes the budget constraint to rotate inward, as if on a hinge, from the vertical axis. As in the
previous section, the point labeled M represents the originally preferred point on the original budget
constraint, which Sergei has chosen after contemplating his total utility and marginal utility and the tradeoffs
involved along the budget constraint. In this example, the units along the horizontal and vertical axes are not
numbered, so the discussion must focus on whether Sergei will consume more or less of certain goods, not on
numerical amounts.

FIGURE 6.4 How a Change in Price Affects Consumption Choices The original utility-maximizing choice is M. When
the price rises, the budget constraint rotates clockwise. The dashed lines make it possible to see at a glance
whether the new consumption choice involves less of both goods, or less of one good and more of the other. The
new possible choices would be fewer baseball bats and more cameras, like point H, or less of both goods, as at
point J. Choice K would mean that the higher price of bats led to exactly the same quantity of bat consumption, but
fewer cameras. Theoretically possible, but unlikely in the real world, we rule out choices like L because they would
mean that a higher price for baseball bats means a greater consumption of baseball bats.
After the price increase, Sergei will make a choice along the new budget constraint. Again, we can divide his
choices into three segments by the dashed vertical and horizontal lines. In the upper left portion of the new
148 6 · Consumer Choices

       budget constraint, at a choice like H, Sergei consumes more cameras and fewer bats. In the central portion of
       the new budget constraint, at a choice like J, he consumes less of both goods. At the right-hand end, at a choice
       like L, he consumes more bats but fewer cameras.
       The typical response to higher prices is that a person chooses to consume less of the product with the higher
       price. This occurs for two reasons, and both effects can occur simultaneously. The substitution effect occurs
       when a price changes and consumers have an incentive to consume less of the good with a relatively higher
       price and more of the good with a relatively lower price. The income effect is that a higher price means, in
       effect, the buying power of income has been reduced (even though actual income has not changed), which
       leads to buying less of the good (when the good is normal). In this example, the higher price for baseball bats
       would cause Sergei to buy fewer bats for both reasons. Exactly how much will a higher price for bats cause
       Sergei's bat consumption to fall? Figure 6.4 suggests a range of possibilities. Sergei might react to a higher
       price for baseball bats by purchasing the same quantity of bats, but cutting his camera consumption. This
       choice is the point K on the new budget constraint, straight below the original choice M. Alternatively, Sergei
       might react by dramatically reducing his bat purchases and instead buy more cameras.
       The key is that it would be imprudent to assume that a change in the price of one good will only affect
       consumption of that good. In our example, since Sergei purchases all his products out of the same budget, a
       change in the price of baseball bats can also have a range of effects, either positive or negative, on his
       purchases of cameras. Since Sergei purchases all his products out of the same budget, a change in the price of
       baseball bats can also have a range of effects, either positive or negative, on his purchases of cameras.
       In short, a higher price typically causes reduced consumption of the good in question, but it can affect the
       consumption of other goods as well.

      The Foundations of Demand Curves

       Changes in the price of a good lead the budget constraint to rotate. A rotation in the budget constraint means
       that when individuals are seeking their highest utility, the quantity that is demanded of that good will change.
       In this way, the logical foundations of demand curves--which show a connection between prices and quantity
       demanded--are based on the underlying idea of individuals seeking utility. Figure 6.5 (a) shows a budget
       constraint with a choice between housing and "everything else." (Putting "everything else" on the vertical axis
       can be a useful approach in some cases, especially when the focus of the analysis is on one particular good.)
       We label the preferred choice on the original budget constraint that provides the highest possible utility M0.
       The other three budget constraints represent successively higher prices for housing of P1, P2, and P3. As the
       budget constraint rotates in, and in, and in again, we label the utility-maximizing choices M1, M2, and M3, and
       the quantity demanded of housing falls from Q0 to Q1 to Q2 to Q3.

changes from M0 to M1 to M2 to M3. As a result, the quantity demanded of housing shifts from Q0 to Q1 to Q2 to Q3,
ceteris paribus. (b) The demand curve graphs each combination of the price of housing and the quantity of housing
demanded, ceteris paribus. The quantities of housing are the same at the points on both (a) and (b). Thus, the
original price of housing (P0) and the original quantity of housing (Q0) appear on the demand curve as point E0. The
higher price of housing (P1) and the corresponding lower quantity demanded of housing (Q1) appear on the demand
curve as point E1.
Thus, as the price of housing rises, the budget constraint rotates clockwise and the quantity consumed of
housing falls, ceteris paribus (meaning, with all other things being the same). We graph this relationship--the
price of housing rising from P0 to P1 to P2 to P3, while the quantity of housing demanded falls from Q0 to Q1 to
Q2 to Q3--on the demand curve in Figure 6.5 (b). The vertical dashed lines stretching between the top and
bottom of Figure 6.5 show that the quantity of housing demanded at each point is the same in both (a) and (b).
We ultimately determine the shape of a demand curve by the underlying choices about maximizing utility
subject to a budget constraint. While economists may not be able to measure "utils," they can certainly
measure price and quantity demanded.

Applications in Government and Business

The budget constraint framework for making utility-maximizing choices offers a reminder that people can
react to a change in price or income in a range of different ways. For example, in the winter months of 2005,
costs for heating homes increased significantly in many parts of the country as prices for natural gas and
electricity soared, due in large part to the disruption caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Some people
150 6 · Consumer Choices

       reacted by reducing the quantity demanded of energy; for example, by turning down the thermostats in their
       homes by a few degrees and wearing a heavier sweater inside. Even so, many home heating bills rose, so
       people adjusted their consumption in other ways, too. As you learned in the chapter on Elasticity, the short run
       demand for home heating is generally inelastic. Each household cut back on what it valued least on the
       margin. For some it might have been some dinners out, or a vacation, or postponing buying a new refrigerator
       or a new car. Sharply higher energy prices can have effects beyond the energy market, leading to a widespread
       reduction in purchasing throughout the rest of the economy.

       A similar issue arises when the government imposes taxes on certain products, such as on gasoline, cigarettes,
       and alcohol. Say that a tax on alcohol leads to a higher price at the liquor store. The higher price of alcohol
       causes the budget constraint to pivot left, and alcoholic beverage consumption is likely to decrease. However,
       people may also react to the higher price of alcoholic beverages by cutting back on other purchases. For
       example, they might cut back on snacks at restaurants like chicken wings and nachos. It would be unwise to
       assume that the liquor industry is the only one affected by the tax on alcoholic beverages. Read the next Clear
       It Up to learn about how who controls the household income influences buying decisions.

      The Unifying Power of the Utility-Maximizing Budget Set Framework

       An interaction between prices, budget constraints, and personal preferences determine household choices.
       The flexible and powerful terminology of utility-maximizing gives economists a vocabulary for bringing these
       elements together.

       Not even economists believe that people walk around mumbling about their marginal utilities before they walk
       into a shopping mall, accept a job, or make a deposit in a savings account. However, economists do believe that
       individuals seek their own satisfaction or utility and that people often decide to try a little less of one thing and
       a little more of another. If we accept these assumptions, then the idea of utility-maximizing households facing
       budget constraints becomes highly plausible.

                CLEAR IT UP

      Does who controls household income make a difference?

       In the mid-1970s, the United Kingdom made an interesting policy change in its "child allowance" policy. This
       program provides a fixed amount of money per child to every family, regardless of family income. Traditionally, the
       child allowance had been distributed to families by withholding less in taxes from the paycheck of the family wage
       earner--typically the father in this time period. The new policy instead provided the child allowance as a cash
       payment to the mother. As a result of this change, households have the same level of income and face the same
       prices in the market, but the money is more likely to be in the mother's purse than in the father's wallet.

       Should this change in policy alter household consumption patterns? Basic models of consumption decisions, of the
       sort that we examined in this chapter, assume that it does not matter which parent or guardian receives the money,
       because both seek to maximize the family's utility as a whole. In effect, this model assumes that everyone in the
       family has the same makeup or has the same preferences.

       There has not been extensive research on diverse family structures and guardian/parent sex and gender related to
       spending. However, the older research on families with one man and one woman parent indicates that gender does
       affect spending decisions. When the mother controls a larger share of family income a number of studies, in the
       United Kingdom and in a wide variety of other countries, have found that the family tends to spend more on
       restaurant meals, child care, and women's clothing, and less on alcohol and tobacco. As the mother controls a larger
       share of household resources, children's health improves, too. These findings suggest that when providing
       assistance to families, in high-income countries and low-income countries alike, the monetary amount of assistance
       is not all that matters: it also matters which family member actually receives the money.

arise from changes in income or price, not just effects on the one product that might seem most immediately
affected.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Evaluate the reasons for making intertemporal choices
  · Interpret an intertemporal budget constraint
  · Analyze why people in America tend to save such a small percentage of their income

As we know, people sometimes make decisions that seem "irrational" and not in their own best interest.
People's decisions can seem inconsistent from one day to the next and they even deliberately ignore ways to
save money or time. The traditional economic models assume rationality, which means that people take all
available information and make consistent and informed decisions that are in their best interest. (In fact,
economics professors often delight in pointing out so-called "irrational behavior" each semester to their new
students, and present economics as a way to become more rational.)

However, a new group of economists, known as behavioral economists, argue that the traditional method omits
something important: people's state of mind. For example, one can think differently about money if one is
feeling revenge, optimism, or loss. These are not necessarily irrational states of mind, but part of a range of
emotions that can affect anyone on a given day. In addition, actions under these conditions are predictable, if
one better understands the underlying environment. Behavioral economics seeks to enrich our
understanding of decision-making by integrating the insights of psychology into economics. It does this by
investigating how given dollar amounts can mean different things to individuals depending on the situation.
This can lead to decisions that appear outwardly inconsistent, or irrational, to the outside observer.

The way the mind works, according to this view, may seem inconsistent to traditional economists but is
actually far more complex than an unemotional cost-benefit adding machine. For example, a traditional
economist would say that if you lost a $10 bill today, and also received an extra $10 in your paycheck, you
should feel perfectly neutral. After all, -$10 + $10 = $0. You are the same financially as you were before.
However, behavioral economists have conducted research that shows many people will feel some negative
emotion, such as anger or frustration, after those two things happen. We tend to focus more on the loss than
the gain. We call this loss aversion, where a $1 loss pains us 2.25 times more than a $1 gain helps us, according
to the economists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in a famous 1979 article in the journal Econometrica.
This insight has implications for investing, as people tend to "overplay" the stock market by reacting more to
losses than to gains. This behavior looks irrational to traditional economists, but is consistent once we
understand better how the mind works, these economists argue.

Traditional economists also assume human beings have complete self control, but, for instance, people will
buy cigarettes by the pack instead of the carton even though the carton saves them money, to keep usage
down. They purchase locks for their refrigerators and overpay on taxes to force themselves to save. In other
words, we protect ourselves from our worst temptations but pay a price to do so. One way behavioral
economists are responding to this is by establishing ways for people to keep themselves free of these
temptations. This includes what we call "nudges" toward more rational behavior rather than mandatory
regulations from government. For example, up to 20 percent of new employees do not enroll in retirement
savings plans immediately, because of procrastination or feeling overwhelmed by the different choices. Some
companies are now moving to a new system, where employees are automatically enrolled unless they "opt
out." Almost no-one opts out in this program and employees begin saving at the early years, which are most
critical for retirement.

Another area that seems illogical is the idea of mental accounting, or putting dollars in different mental
152 6 · Consumer Choices

       categories where they take different values. Economists typically consider dollars to be fungible, or having
       equal value to the individual, regardless of the situation.
       You might, for instance, think of the $25 you found in the street differently from the $25 you earned from three
       hours working in a fast food restaurant. You might treat the street money as "mad money" with little rational
       regard to getting the best value. This is in one sense strange, since it is still equivalent to three hours of hard
       work in the restaurant. Yet the "easy come-easy go" mentality replaces the rational economizer because of the
       situation, or context, in which you attained the money.
       In another example of mental accounting that seems inconsistent to a traditional economist, a person could
       carry a credit card debt of $1,000 that has a 15% yearly interest cost, and simultaneously have a $2,000
       savings account that pays only 2% per year. That means she pays $150 a year to the credit card company, while
       collecting only $40 annually in bank interest, so she loses $110 a year. That doesn't seem wise.
       The "rational" decision would be to pay off the debt, since a $1,000 savings account with $0 in debt is the
       equivalent net worth, and she would now net $20 per year. Curiously, it is not uncommon for people to ignore
       this advice, since they will treat a loss to their savings account as higher than the benefit of paying off their
       credit card. They do not treat the dollars as fungible so it looks irrational to traditional economists.
       Which view is right, the behavioral economists' or the traditional view? Both have their advantages, but
       behavioral economists have at least identified trying to describe and explain behavior that economists have
       historically dismissed as irrational. If most of us are engaged in some "irrational behavior," perhaps there are
       deeper underlying reasons for this behavior in the first place.

      Making Choices

       In what category did consumers worldwide increase their spending during the Great Recession? Higher education.
       According to the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), enrollment in colleges
       and universities rose one-third in China and almost two-thirds in Saudi Arabia, nearly doubled in Pakistan, tripled in
       Uganda, and surged by three million--18 percent--in the United States. Why were consumers willing to spend on
       education during lean times? Both individuals and countries view higher education as the way to prosperity. Many
       feel that increased earnings are a significant benefit of attending college.
       U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data from May 2012 supports this view, as Figure 6.6 shows. They show a positive
       correlation between earnings and education. The data also indicate that unemployment rates fall with higher levels
       of education and training.
       Why spend the money to go to college during recession? Because if you are unemployed (or underemployed,
       working fewer hours than you would like), the opportunity cost of your time is low. If you're unemployed, you don't
       have to give up work hours and income by going to college.

Key Concepts and Summary

6.1 Consumption Choices

Economic analysis of household behavior is based on the assumption that people seek the highest level of
utility or satisfaction. Individuals are the only judge of their own utility. In general, greater consumption of a
good brings higher total utility. However, the additional utility people receive from each unit of greater
consumption tends to decline in a pattern of diminishing marginal utility.

We can find the utility-maximizing choice on a consumption budget constraint in several ways. You can add up
total utility of each choice on the budget line and choose the highest total. You can select a starting point at
random and compare the marginal utility gains and losses of moving to neighboring points--and thus
eventually seek out the preferred choice. Alternatively, you can compare the ratio of the marginal utility to
price of good 1 with the marginal utility to price of good 2 and apply the rule that at the optimal choice, the two
ratios should be equal:

6.2 How Changes in Income and Prices Affect Consumption Choices

The budget constraint framework suggest that when income or price changes, a range of responses are
possible. When income rises, households will demand a higher quantity of normal goods, but a lower quantity
of inferior goods. When the price of a good rises, households will typically demand less of that good--but
whether they will demand a much lower quantity or only a slightly lower quantity will depend on personal
preferences. Also, a higher price for one good can lead to more or less demand of the other good.

6.3 Behavioral Economics: An Alternative Framework for Consumer Choice

People regularly make decisions that seem less than rational, decisions that contradict traditional consumer
theory. This is because traditional theory ignores people's state of mind or feelings, which can influence
behavior. For example, people tend to value a dollar lost more than a dollar gained, even though the amounts

are the same. Similarly, many people over withhold on their taxes, essentially giving the government a free
loan until they file their tax returns, so that they are more likely to get money back than have to pay money on
their taxes.

Self-Check Questions

 1. Jeremy is deeply in love with Jasmine. Jasmine lives where cell phone coverage is poor, so he can either
     call her on the land-line phone for five cents per minute or he can drive to see her, at a round-trip cost of
     $2 in gasoline money. He has a total of $10 per week to spend on staying in touch. To make his preferred
     choice, Jeremy uses a handy utilimometer that measures his total utility from personal visits and from
     phone minutes. Using the values in Table 6.6, figure out the points on Jeremy's consumption choice
     budget constraint (it may be helpful to do a sketch) and identify his utility-maximizing point.

 3. Explain all the reasons why a decrease in a product's price would lead to an increase in purchases.
 4. As a college student you work at a part-time job, but your parents also send you a monthly "allowance."

     Suppose one month your parents forgot to send the check. Show graphically how your budget constraint is
     affected. Assuming you only buy normal goods, what would happen to your purchases of goods?

Review Questions

 5. Who determines how much utility an individual will receive from consuming a good?
 6. Would you expect total utility to rise or fall with additional consumption of a good? Why?
 7. Would you expect marginal utility to rise or fall with additional consumption of a good? Why?
 8. Is it possible for total utility to increase while marginal utility diminishes? Explain.
156 6 · Critical Thinking Questions

 9. If people do not have a complete mental picture of total utility for every level of consumption, how can they
     find their utility-maximizing consumption choice?

10. What is the rule relating the ratio of marginal utility to prices of two goods at the optimal choice? Explain
      why, if this rule does not hold, the choice cannot be utility-maximizing.

11. As a general rule, is it safe to assume that a change in the price of a good will always have its most
      significant impact on the quantity demanded of that good, rather than on the quantity demanded of other
      goods? Explain.

12. Why does a change in income cause a parallel shift in the budget constraint?

Critical Thinking Questions

13. Think back to a purchase that you made recently. How would you describe your thinking before you made
      that purchase?

14. The rules of politics are not always the same as the rules of economics. In discussions of setting budgets
      for government agencies, there is a strategy called "closing the Washington Monument." When an agency
      faces the unwelcome prospect of a budget cut, it may decide to close a high-visibility attraction enjoyed by
      many people (like the Washington Monument). Explain in terms of diminishing marginal utility why the
      Washington Monument strategy is so misleading. Hint: If you are really trying to make the best of a budget
      cut, should you cut the items in your budget with the highest marginal utility or the lowest marginal
      utility? Does the Washington Monument strategy cut the items with the highest marginal utility or the
      lowest marginal utility?

15. Income effects depend on the income elasticity of demand for each good that you buy. If one of the goods
      you buy has a negative income elasticity, that is, it is an inferior good, what must be true of the income
      elasticity of the other good you buy?

Problems

16. Praxilla, who lived in ancient Greece, derives utility from reading poems and from eating cucumbers.
      Praxilla gets 30 units of marginal utility from her first poem, 27 units of marginal utility from her second
      poem, 24 units of marginal utility from her third poem, and so on, with marginal utility declining by three
      units for each additional poem. Praxilla gets six units of marginal utility for each of her first three
      cucumbers consumed, five units of marginal utility for each of her next three cucumbers consumed, four
      units of marginal utility for each of the following three cucumbers consumed, and so on, with marginal
      utility declining by one for every three cucumbers consumed. A poem costs three bronze coins but a
      cucumber costs only one bronze coin. Praxilla has 18 bronze coins. Sketch Praxilla's budget set between
      poems and cucumbers, placing poems on the vertical axis and cucumbers on the horizontal axis. Start off
      with the choice of zero poems and 18 cucumbers, and calculate the changes in marginal utility of moving
      along the budget line to the next choice of one poem and 15 cucumbers. Using this step-by-step process
      based on marginal utility, create a table and identify Praxilla's utility-maximizing choice. Compare the
      marginal utility of the two goods and the relative prices at the optimal choice to see if the expected
      relationship holds. Hint: Label the table columns: 1) Choice, 2) Marginal Gain from More Poems, 3)
      Marginal Loss from Fewer Cucumbers, 4) Overall Gain or Loss, 5) Is the previous choice optimal? Label the
      table rows: 1) 0 Poems and 18 Cucumbers, 2) 1 Poem and 15 Cucumbers, 3) 2 Poems and 12 Cucumbers,
      4) 3 Poems and 9 Cucumbers, 5) 4 Poems and 6 Cucumbers, 6) 5 Poems and 3 Cucumbers, 7) 6 Poems and
      0 Cucumbers.

17. If a 10% decrease in the price of one product that you buy causes an 8% increase in quantity demanded of
      that product, will another 10% decrease in the price cause another 8% increase (no more and no less) in
      quantity demanded?

Introduction to Production, Costs, and Industry Structure

Amazon

In less than two decades, Amazon.com has transformed the way consumers sell, buy, and even read. Prior to
Amazon, independent bookstores with limited inventories in small retail locations primarily sold books. There were
exceptions, of course. Borders and Barnes & Noble offered larger stores in urban areas. In the last decade, however,
independent bookstores have mostly disappeared, Borders has gone out of business, and Barnes & Noble is
struggling. Online delivery and purchase of books has overtaken the more traditional business models. How has
158 7 · Production, Costs, and Industry Structure

       Amazon changed the book selling industry? How has it managed to crush its competition?
       A major reason for the giant retailer's success is its production model and cost structure, which has enabled
       Amazon to undercut the competitors' prices even when factoring in the cost of shipping. Read on to see how firms
       great (like Amazon) and small (like your corner deli) determine what to sell, at what output, and price.

       This chapter is the first of four chapters that explores the theory of the firm. This theory explains how firms
       behave. What does that mean? Let's define what we mean by the firm. A firm (or producer or business)
       combines inputs of labor, capital, land, and raw or finished component materials to produce outputs. If the
       firm is successful, the outputs are more valuable than the inputs. This activity of production goes beyond
       manufacturing (i.e., making things). It includes any process or service that creates value, including
       transportation, distribution, wholesale and retail sales.
       Production involves a number of important decisions that define a firm's behavior. These decisions include,
       but are not limited to:

         · What product or products should the firm produce?
         · How should the firm produce the products (i.e., what production process should the firm use)?
         · How much output should the firm produce?
         · What price should the firm charge for its products?
         · How much labor should the firm employ?
       The answers to these questions depend on the production and cost conditions facing each firm. That is the
       subject of this chapter. The answers also depend on the market structure for the product(s) in question. Market
       structure is a multidimensional concept that involves how competitive the industry is. We define it by
       questions such as these:
         · How much market power does each firm in the industry possess?
         · How similar is each firm's product to the products of other firms in the industry?
         · How difficult is it for new firms to enter the industry?
         · Do firms compete on the basis of price, advertising, or other product differences?
       Figure 7.2 illustrates the range of different market structures, which we will explore in Perfect Competition,
       Monopoly, and Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly.

       FIGURE 7.2 The Spectrum of Competition Firms face different competitive situations. At one extreme--perfect
       competition--many firms are all trying to sell identical products. At the other extreme--monopoly--only one firm is
       selling the product, and this firm faces no competition. Monopolistic competition and oligopoly fall between the
       extremes of perfect competition and monopoly. Monopolistic competition is a situation with many firms selling
       similar, but not identical products. Oligopoly is a situation with few firms that sell identical or similar products.
       Let's examine how firms determine their costs and desired profit levels. Then we will discuss the origins of
       cost, both in the short and long run. Private enterprise, which can be private individual or group business
       ownership, characterizes the U.S. economy. In the U.S. system, we have the option to organize private
       businesses as sole proprietorships (one owner), partners (more than one owner), and corporations (legal

entitles separate from the owners.

When people think of businesses, often corporate giants like Wal-Mart, Microsoft, or General Motors come to
mind. However, firms come in all sizes, as Table 7.1 shows. The vast majority of American firms have fewer
than 20 employees. As of 2010, the U.S. Census Bureau counted 5.7 million firms with employees in the U.S.
economy. Slightly less than half of all the workers in private firms are at the 17,000 large firms, meaning they
employ more than 500 workers. Another 35% of workers in the U.S. economy are at firms with fewer than 100

lawns or clean houses. Table 7.1 does not include a separate category for the millions of small "non-employer"
businesses where a single owner or a few partners are not officially paid wages or a salary, but simply receive
whatever they can earn.

7.1 Explicit and Implicit Costs, and Accounting and Economic Profit

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Explain the difference between explicit costs and implicit costs
  · Understand the relationship between cost and revenue

Each business, regardless of size or complexity, tries to earn a profit:

Total revenue is the income the firm generates from selling its products. We calculate it by multiplying the
price of the product times the quantity of output sold:

We will see in the following chapters that revenue is a function of the demand for the firm's products.

Total cost is what the firm pays for producing and selling its products. Recall that production involves the firm
converting inputs to outputs. Each of those inputs has a cost to the firm. The sum of all those costs is total cost.
We will learn in this chapter that short run costs are different from long run costs.

We can distinguish between two types of cost: explicit and implicit. Explicit costs are out-of-pocket costs, that
is, actual payments. Wages that a firm pays its employees or rent that a firm pays for its office are explicit costs.
Implicit costs are more subtle, but just as important. They represent the opportunity cost of using resources
that the firm already owns. Often for small businesses, they are resources that the owners contribute. For
example, working in the business while not earning a formal salary, or using the ground floor of a home as a
retail store are both implicit costs. (See the Work It Out feature for an extended example.)
160 7 · Production, Costs, and Industry Structure

       These two definitions of cost are important for distinguishing between two conceptions of profit, accounting
       profit, and economic profit. Accounting profit is a cash concept. It means total revenue minus explicit
       costs--the difference between dollars brought in and dollars paid out. Economic profit is total revenue minus
       total cost, including both explicit and implicit costs. The difference is important because even though a
       business pays income taxes based on its accounting profit, whether or not it is economically successful
       depends on its economic profit.

                                                                                                                WORK IT OUT
        Calculating Implicit Costs

         Consider the following example. Eryn currently works for a corporate law firm. She is considering opening her
         own legal practice, where she expects to earn $200,000 per year once she establishes herself. To run her own
         firm, she would need an office and a law clerk. She has found the perfect office, which rents for $50,000 per year.
         She could hire a law clerk for $35,000 per year. If these figures are accurate, would Eryn's legal practice be
         profitable?
         Step 1. First you have to calculate the costs. You can take what you know about explicit costs and total them:

         Step 2. Subtracting the explicit costs from the revenue gives you the accounting profit.

         However, these calculations consider only the explicit costs. To open her own practice, Eryn would have to quit
         her current job, where she is earning an annual salary of $125,000. This would be an implicit cost of opening her
         own firm.
         Step 3. You need to subtract both the explicit and implicit costs to determine the true economic profit:

         Eryn would be losing $10,000 per year. That does not mean she would not want to open her own business, but it
         does mean she would be earning $10,000 less than if she worked for the corporate firm.
         Implicit costs can include other things as well. Maybe Eryn values her leisure time, and starting her own firm
         would require her to put in more hours than at the corporate firm. In this case, the lost leisure would also be an
         implicit cost that would subtract from economic profits.

       Now that we have an idea about the different types of costs, let's look at cost structures. A firm's cost structure
       in the long run may be different from that in the short run. We turn to that distinction in the next few sections.

7.2 Production in the Short Run

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Understand the concept of a production function
  · Differentiate between the different types of inputs or factors in a production function
  · Differentiate between fixed and variable inputs
  · Differentiate between production in the short run and in the long run
  · Differentiate between total and marginal product
  · Understand the concept of diminishing marginal productivity
In this chapter, we want to explore the relationship between the quantity of output a firm produces, and the
cost of producing that output. We mentioned that the cost of the product depends on how many inputs are
required to produce the product and what those inputs cost. We can answer the former question by looking at
the firm's production function.

FIGURE 7.3 The production process for pizza includes inputs such as ingredients, the efforts of the pizza maker, and
tools and materials for cooking and serving. (Credit: "Grilled gluten-free BBQ chicken pizza" by Keith McDuffee/
Flickr, CC BY 2.0)
Production is the process (or processes) a firm uses to transform inputs (e.g., labor, capital, raw materials) into
outputs, i.e. the goods or services the firm wishes to sell. Consider pizza making. The pizzaiolo (pizza maker)
takes flour, water, and yeast to make dough. Similarly, the pizzaiolo may take tomatoes, spices, and water to
make pizza sauce. The cook rolls out the dough, brushes on the pizza sauce, and adds cheese and other
toppings. The pizzaiolo uses a peel--the shovel-like wooden tool--to put the pizza into the oven to cook. Once
baked, the pizza goes into a box (if it's for takeout) and the customer pays for the good. What are the inputs (or
factors of production) in the production process for this pizza?
Economists divide factors of production into several categories:
162 7 · Production, Costs, and Industry Structure

         · Natural Resources (Land and Raw Materials) - The ingredients for the pizza are raw materials. These
             include the flour, yeast, and water for the dough, the tomatoes, herbs, and water for the sauce, the cheese,
             and the toppings. If the pizza place uses a wood-burning oven, we would include the wood as a raw
             material. If the establishment heats the oven with natural gas, we would count this as a raw material. Don't
             forget electricity for lights. If, instead of pizza, we were looking at an agricultural product, like wheat, we
             would include the land the farmer used for crops here.

         · Labor - When we talk about production, labor means human effort, both physical and mental. The
             pizzaiolo was the primary example of labor here. They need to be strong enough to roll out the dough and
             to insert and retrieve the pizza from the oven, but they also must know how to make the pizza, how long it
             cooks in the oven and a myriad of other aspects of pizza-making. The business may also have one or more
             people to work the counter, take orders, and receive payment.

         · Capital - When economists uses the term capital, they do not mean financial capital (money); rather, they
             mean physical capital, the machines, equipment, and buildings that one uses to produce the product. In
             the case of pizza, the capital includes the peel, the oven, the building, and any other necessary equipment
             (for example, tables and chairs).

         · Technology - Technology refers to the process or processes for producing the product. How does the
             pizzaiolo combine ingredients to make pizza? How hot should the oven be? How long should the pizza
             cook? What is the best oven to use? Gas or wood burning? Should the restaurant make its own dough,
             sauce, cheese, toppings, or should it buy them?

         · Entrepreneurship - Production involves many decisions and much knowledge, even for something as
             simple as pizza. Who makes those decisions? Ultimately, it is the entrepreneur, the person who creates the
             business, whose idea it is to combine the inputs to produce the outputs.

       The cost of producing pizza (or any output) depends on the amount of labor capital, raw materials, and other
       inputs required and the price of each input to the entrepreneur. Let's explore these ideas in more detail.

       We can summarize the ideas so far in terms of a production function, a mathematical expression or equation
       that explains the engineering relationship between inputs and outputs:

       The production function gives the answer to the question, how much output can the firm produce given
       different amounts of inputs? Production functions are specific to the product. Different products have different
       production functions. The amount of labor a farmer uses to produce a bushel of wheat is likely different than
       that required to produce an automobile. Firms in the same industry may have somewhat different production
       functions, since each firm may produce a little differently. One pizza restaurant may make its own dough and
       sauce, while another may buy those pre-made. A sit-down pizza restaurant probably uses more labor (to
       handle table service) than a purely take-out restaurant.

       We can describe inputs as either fixed or variable.

       Fixed inputs are those that can't easily be increased or decreased in a short period of time. In the pizza
       example, the building is a fixed input. The restaurant owner signs a lease and is stuck in the building until the
       lease expires. Fixed inputs define the firm's maximum output capacity. This is analogous to the potential real
       GDP shown by society's production possibilities curve, i.e., the maximum quantities of outputs a society can
       produce at a given time with its available resources.

       Variable inputs are those that can easily be increased or decreased in a short period of time. The pizzaiolo can
       order more ingredients with a phone call, so ingredients would be variable inputs. The owner could hire a new
       person to work the counter pretty quickly as well.

       Economists often use a short-hand form for the production function:

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                                              7.2 · Production in the Short Run 163

where L represents all the variable inputs, and K represents all the fixed inputs.
Economists differentiate between short and long run production.
The short run is the period of time during which at least some factors of production are fixed. During the
period of the pizza restaurant lease, the pizza restaurant is operating in the short run, because it is limited to
using the current building--the owner can't choose a larger or smaller building.
The long run is the period of time during which all factors are variable. Once the lease expires for the pizza
restaurant, the shop owner can move to a larger or smaller place.
Let's explore production in the short run using a specific example: tree cutting (for lumber) with a two-person
crosscut saw.

FIGURE 7.4 Production in the short run may be explored through the example of lumberjacks using a two-person
saw. (Credit: "DO - Apple Day Civilian Conservation Corps Demonstration Crosscut Saw (Gladden)" by Virginia State
Parks/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)

Since by definition capital is fixed in the short run, our production function becomes

This equation simply indicates that since capital is fixed, the amount of output (e.g., trees cut down per day)
depends only on the amount of labor employed (e.g., number of lumberjacks working). We can express this
production function numerically as Table 7.2 below shows.

# Lumberjacks 1 2 3 4 5

# Trees (TP) 4 10 12 13 13

MP  46 2 1 0

TABLE 7.2 Short Run Production
Function for Trees
164 7 · Production, Costs, and Industry Structure

Note that we have introduced some new language. We also call Output (Q) Total Product (TP), which means the
amount of output produced with a given amount of labor and a fixed amount of capital. In this example, one
lumberjack using a two-person saw can cut down four trees in an hour. Two lumberjacks using a two-person
saw can cut down ten trees in an hour.

We should also introduce a critical concept: marginal product. Marginal product is the additional output of

one more worker. Mathematically, Marginal Product is the change in total product divided by the change in

labor:  . In the table above, since 0 workers produce 0 trees, the marginal product of the first

worker is four trees per day, but the marginal product of the second worker is six trees per day. Why might that

be the case? It's because of the nature of the capital the workers are using. A two-person saw works much

better with two persons than with one. Suppose we add a third lumberjack to the story. What will that person's

marginal product be? What will that person contribute to the team? Perhaps they can oil the saw's teeth to

keep it sawing smoothly or they could bring water to the two people sawing. What you see in the table is a

critically important conclusion about production in the short run: It may be that as we add workers, the

marginal product increases at first, but sooner or later additional workers will have decreasing marginal

product. In fact, there may eventually be no effect or a negative effect on output. This is called the Law of

Diminishing Marginal Product and it's a characteristic of production in the short run. Diminishing marginal

productivity is very similar to the concept of diminishing marginal utility that we learned about in the chapter

on consumer choice. Both concepts are examples of the more general concept of diminishing marginal

returns. Why does diminishing marginal productivity occur? It's because of fixed capital. We will see this more

clearly when we discuss production in the long run.

We can show these concepts graphically as Figure 7.5 and Figure 7.6 illustrate. Figure 7.5 graphically shows
the data from Table 7.2. Figure 7.6 shows the more general cases of total product and marginal product curves.

7.3 Costs in the Short Run

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Understand the relationship between production and costs
  · Understand that every factor of production has a corresponding factor price
  · Analyze short-run costs in terms of total cost, fixed cost, variable cost, marginal cost, and average cost
  · Calculate average profit
  · Evaluate patterns of costs to determine potential profit
We've explained that a firm's total costs depend on the quantities of inputs the firm uses to produce its output
and the cost of those inputs to the firm. The firm's production function tells us how much output the firm will
produce with given amounts of inputs. However, if we think about that backwards, it tells us how many inputs
the firm needs to produce a given quantity of output, which is the first thing we need to determine total cost.
Let's move to the second factor we need to determine.
For every factor of production (or input), there is an associated factor payment. Factor payments are what the
firm pays for the use of the factors of production. From the firm's perspective, factor payments are costs. From
the owner of each factor's perspective, factor payments are income. Factor payments include:
  · Raw materials prices for raw materials
  · Rent for land or buildings
  · Wages and salaries for labor
  · Interest and dividends for the use of financial capital (loans and equity investments)
  · Profit for entrepreneurship. Profit is the residual, what's left over from revenues after the firm pays all the

      other costs. While it may seem odd to treat profit as a "cost", it is what entrepreneurs earn for taking the
      risk of starting a business. You can see this correspondence between factors of production and factor
      payments in the inside loop of the circular flow diagram in Figure 1.7.
We now have all the information necessary to determine a firm's costs.
A cost function is a mathematical expression or equation that shows the cost of producing different levels of
output.

                                                   Producing Widgets

What we observe is that the cost increases as the firm produces higher quantities of output. This is pretty
intuitive, since producing more output requires greater quantities of inputs, which cost more dollars to
acquire.

What is the origin of these cost figures? They come from the production function and the factor payments. The
discussion of costs in the short run above, Costs in the Short Run, was based on the following production
function, which is similar to Table 7.2 except for "widgets" instead of trees.

 Workers (L) 1 2 3 3.25 4.4 5.2 6 7 8 9
 Widgets (Q) 0.2 0.4 0.8 1 2 3 3.5 3.8 3.95 4
TABLE 7.4

We can use the information from the production function to determine production costs. What we need to

know is how many workers are required to produce any quantity of output. If we flip the order of the rows, we

"invert" the production function so it shows             .

 Widgets (Q) 0.2 0.4 0.8 1 2 3 3.5 3.8 3.95 4
 Workers (L) 1 2 3 3.25 4.4 5.2 6 7 8 9
TABLE 7.5

Now focus on the whole number quantities of output. We'll eliminate the fractions from the table:

                                 Widgets (Q)             1 23                         4

                                 TABLE 7.6

Suppose widget workers receive $10 per hour. Multiplying the Workers row by $10 (and eliminating the
blanks) gives us the cost of producing different levels of output.

 Widgets (Q)                                             1.00  2.00             3.00     4.00

                      TABLE 7.7

This is same cost function with which we began! (shown in Table 7.3)

Now that we have the basic idea of the cost origins and how they are related to production, let's drill down into
the details.

Average and Marginal Costs

The cost of producing a firm's output depends on how much labor and physical capital the firm uses. A list of
the costs involved in producing cars will look very different from the costs involved in producing computer
software or haircuts or fast-food meals.

We can measure costs in a variety of ways. Each way provides its own insight into costs. Sometimes firms need

to look at their cost per unit of output, not just their total cost. There are two ways to measure per unit costs.

The most intuitive way is average cost. Average cost is the cost on average of producing a given quantity. We

define average cost as total cost divided by the quantity of output produced.     If producing two

widgets costs a total of $44, the average cost per widget is          per widget. The other way of measuring

cost per unit is marginal cost. If average cost is the cost of the average unit of output produced, marginal cost is

the cost of each individual unit produced. More formally, marginal cost is the cost of producing one more unit

of output. Mathematically, marginal cost is the change in total cost divided by the change in output:

. If the cost of the first widget is $32.50 and the cost of two widgets is $44, the marginal cost of

the second widget is                We can see the Widget Cost table redrawn below with average and

marginal cost added.

                                 Q  1                         2  3             4

                      Total Cost $32.50 $44.00 $52.00 $90.00

                      Average Cost $32.50 $22.00 $17.33 $22.50

                      Marginal Cost $32.50 $11.50 $8.00 $38.00

                      TABLE 7.8 Extended Cost Function for Producing
                      Widgets

Note that the marginal cost of the first unit of output is always the same as total cost.

Fixed and Variable Costs

We can decompose costs into fixed and variable costs. Fixed costs are the costs of the fixed inputs (e.g., capital).
Because fixed inputs do not change in the short run, fixed costs are expenditures that do not change regardless
of the level of production. Whether you produce a great deal or a little, the fixed costs are the same. One
example is the rent on a factory or a retail space. Once you sign the lease, the rent is the same regardless of
how much you produce, at least until the lease expires. Fixed costs can take many other forms: for example,
the cost of machinery or equipment to produce the product, research and development costs to develop new
products, even an expense like advertising to popularize a brand name. The amount of fixed costs varies
according to the specific line of business: for instance, manufacturing computer chips requires an expensive
factory, but a local moving and hauling business can get by with almost no fixed costs at all if it rents trucks by
168 7 · Production, Costs, and Industry Structure

the day when needed.

Variable costs are the costs of the variable inputs (e.g., labor). The only way to increase or decrease output is
by increasing or decreasing the variable inputs. Therefore, variable costs increase or decrease with output. We
treat labor as a variable cost, since producing a greater quantity of a good or service typically requires more
workers or more work hours. Variable costs would also include raw materials.

Total costs are the sum of fixed plus variable costs. Let's look at another example. Consider the barber shop
called "The Clip Joint" in Figure 7.7. The data for output and costs are in Table 7.9. The fixed costs of operating
the barber shop, including the space and equipment, are $160 per day. The variable costs are the costs of
hiring barbers, which in our example is $80 per barber each day. The first two columns of the table show the
quantity of haircuts the barbershop can produce as it hires additional barbers. The third column shows the
fixed costs, which do not change regardless of the level of production. The fourth column shows the variable
costs at each level of output. We calculate these by taking the amount of labor hired and multiplying by the
wage. For example, two barbers cost: 2 × $80 = $160. Adding together the fixed costs in the third column and
the variable costs in the fourth column produces the total costs in the fifth column. For example, with two
barbers the total cost is: $160 + $160 = $320.

Labor Quantity Fixed Cost Variable Cost Total Cost

1  16                                              $160  $80   $240

quantity of output produced and the cost of producing that output. We always show the fixed costs as the
vertical intercept of the total cost curve; that is, they are the costs incurred when output is zero so there are no
variable costs.

You can see from the graph that once production starts, total costs and variable costs rise. While variable costs
may initially increase at a decreasing rate, at some point they begin increasing at an increasing rate. This is
caused by diminishing marginal productivity which we discussed earlier in the Production in the Short Run
section of this chapter, which is easiest to see with an example. As the number of barbers increases from zero
to one in the table, output increases from 0 to 16 for a marginal gain (or marginal product) of 16. As the
number rises from one to two barbers, output increases from 16 to 40, a marginal gain of 24. From that point
on, though, the marginal product diminishes as we add each additional barber. For example, as the number of
barbers rises from two to three, the marginal product is only 20; and as the number rises from three to four,
the marginal product is only 12.

To understand the reason behind this pattern, consider that a one-man barber shop is a very busy operation.
The single barber needs to do everything: say hello to people entering, answer the phone, cut hair, sweep, and
run the cash register. A second barber reduces the level of disruption from jumping back and forth between
these tasks, and allows a greater division of labor and specialization. The result can be increasing marginal
productivity. However, as the shop adds other barbers, the advantage of each additional barber is less, since
the specialization of labor can only go so far. The addition of a sixth or seventh or eighth barber just to greet
people at the door will have less impact than the second one did. This is the pattern of diminishing marginal
productivity. As a result, the total costs of production will begin to rise more rapidly as output increases. At
some point, you may even see negative returns as the additional barbers begin bumping elbows and getting in
each other's way. In this case, the addition of still more barbers would actually cause output to decrease, as the
last row of Table 7.9 shows.

This pattern of diminishing marginal productivity is common in production. As another example, consider the
problem of irrigating a crop on a farmer's field. The plot of land is the fixed factor of production, while the
water that the farmer can add to the land is the key variable cost. As the farmer adds water to the land, output
increases. However, adding increasingly more water brings smaller increases in output, until at some point the
water floods the field and actually reduces output. Diminishing marginal productivity occurs because, with
fixed inputs (land in this example), each additional unit of input (e.g., water) contributes less to overall
production.

Average Total Cost, Average Variable Cost, Marginal Cost

The breakdown of total costs into fixed and variable costs can provide a basis for other insights as well. The
first five columns of Table 7.10 duplicate the previous table, but the last three columns show average total
costs, average variable costs, and marginal costs. These new measures analyze costs on a per-unit (rather than
a total) basis and are reflected in the curves in Figure 7.8.
170 7 · Production, Costs, and Industry Structure

FIGURE 7.8 Cost Curves at the Clip Joint We can also present the information on total costs, fixed cost, and variable
cost on a per-unit basis. We calculate average total cost (ATC) by dividing total cost by the total quantity produced.
The average total cost curve is typically U-shaped. We calculate average variable cost (AVC) by dividing variable cost
by the quantity produced. The average variable cost curve lies below the average total cost curve and is also
typically U-shaped. We calculate marginal cost (MC) by taking the change in total cost between two levels of output
and dividing by the change in output. The marginal cost curve is upward-sloping.

TABLE 7.10 Different Types of Costs

Average total cost (sometimes referred to simply as average cost) is total cost divided by the quantity of
output. Since the total cost of producing 40 haircuts is $320, the average total cost for producing each of 40
haircuts is $320/40, or $8 per haircut. Average cost curves are typically U-shaped, as Figure 7.8 shows.
Average total cost starts off relatively high, because at low levels of output total costs are dominated by the
fixed cost. Mathematically, the denominator is so small that average total cost is large. Average total cost then
declines, as the fixed costs are spread over an increasing quantity of output. In the average cost calculation, the
rise in the numerator of total costs is relatively small compared to the rise in the denominator of quantity
produced. However, as output expands still further, the average cost begins to rise. At the right side of the
average cost curve, total costs begin rising more rapidly as diminishing returns come into effect.

We obtain average variable cost when we divide variable cost by quantity of output. For example, the variable
cost of producing 80 haircuts is $400, so the average variable cost is $400/80, or $5 per haircut. Note that at
any level of output, the average variable cost curve will always lie below the curve for average total cost, as
Figure 7.8 shows. The reason is that average total cost includes average variable cost and average fixed cost.
Thus, for Q = 80 haircuts, the average total cost is $8 per haircut, while the average variable cost is $5 per

                                                                                                                                                      7.3 · Costs in the Short Run 171

haircut. However, as output grows, fixed costs become relatively less important (since they do not rise with
output), so average variable cost sneaks closer to average cost.

Average total and variable costs measure the average costs of producing some quantity of output. Marginal cost
is somewhat different. Marginal cost is the additional cost of producing one more unit of output. It is not the
cost per unit of all units produced, but only the next one (or next few). We calculate marginal cost by taking the
change in total cost and dividing it by the change in quantity. For example, as quantity produced increases
from 40 to 60 haircuts, total costs rise by 400 - 320, or 80. Thus, the marginal cost for each of those marginal
20 units will be 80/20, or $4 per haircut. The marginal cost curve is generally upward-sloping, because
diminishing marginal returns implies that additional units are more costly to produce. We can see small range
of increasing marginal returns in the figure as a dip in the marginal cost curve before it starts rising. There is a
point at which marginal and average costs meet, as the following Clear it Up feature discusses.

         CLEAR IT UP

Where do marginal and average costs meet?

The marginal cost line intersects the average cost line exactly at the bottom of the average cost curve--which occurs
at a quantity of 72 and cost of $6.60 in Figure 7.8. The reason why the intersection occurs at this point is built into
the economic meaning of marginal and average costs. If the marginal cost of production is below the average cost
for producing previous units, as it is for the points to the left of where MC crosses ATC, then producing one more
additional unit will reduce average costs overall--and the ATC curve will be downward-sloping in this zone.
Conversely, if the marginal cost of production for producing an additional unit is above the average cost for
producing the earlier units, as it is for points to the right of where MC crosses ATC, then producing a marginal unit
will increase average costs overall--and the ATC curve must be upward-sloping in this zone. The point of transition,
between where MC is pulling ATC down and where it is pulling it up, must occur at the minimum point of the ATC
curve.

This idea of the marginal cost "pulling down" the average cost or "pulling up" the average cost may sound abstract,
but think about it in terms of your own grades. If the score on the most recent quiz you take is lower than your
average score on previous quizzes, then the marginal quiz pulls down your average. If your score on the most recent
quiz is higher than the average on previous quizzes, the marginal quiz pulls up your average. In this same way, low
marginal costs of production first pull down average costs and then higher marginal costs pull them up.

The numerical calculations behind average cost, average variable cost, and marginal cost will change from
firm to firm. However, the general patterns of these curves, and the relationships and economic intuition
behind them, will not change.

Lessons from Alternative Measures of Costs

Breaking down total costs into fixed cost, marginal cost, average total cost, and average variable cost is useful
because each statistic offers its own insights for the firm.

Whatever the firm's quantity of production, total revenue must exceed total costs if it is to earn a profit. As
explored in the chapter Choice in a World of Scarcity, fixed costs are often sunk costs that a firm cannot
recoup. In thinking about what to do next, typically you should ignore sunk costs, since you have already spent
this money and cannot make any changes. However, you can change variable costs, so they convey information
about the firm's ability to cut costs in the present and the extent to which costs will increase if production rises.
172 7 · Production, Costs, and Industry Structure

                CLEAR IT UP
      Why are total cost and average cost not on the same graph?

       Total cost, fixed cost, and variable cost each reflect different aspects of the cost of production over the entire
       quantity of output produced. We measure these costs in dollars. In contrast, marginal cost, average cost, and
       average variable cost are costs per unit. In the previous example, we measured them as dollars per haircut. Thus, it
       would not make sense to put all of these numbers on the same graph, since we measure them in different units ($
       versus $ per unit of output).
       It would be as if the vertical axis measured two different things. In addition, as a practical matter, if they were on the
       same graph, the lines for marginal cost, average cost, and average variable cost would appear almost flat against the
       horizontal axis, compared to the values for total cost, fixed cost, and variable cost. Using the figures from the
       previous example, the total cost of producing 40 haircuts is $320. However, the average cost is $320/40, or $8. If
       you graphed both total and average cost on the same axes, the average cost would hardly show.

       Average cost tells a firm whether it can earn profits given the current price in the market. If we divide profit by
       the quantity of output produced we get average profit, also known as the firm's profit margin. Expanding the
       equation for profit gives:

       However, note that:

       Thus:

       This is the firm's profit margin. This definition implies that if the market price is above average cost, average
       profit, and thus total profit, will be positive. If price is below average cost, then profits will be negative.
       We can compare this marginal cost of producing an additional unit with the marginal revenue gained by
       selling that additional unit to reveal whether the additional unit is adding to total profit--or not. Thus, marginal
       cost helps producers understand how increasing or decreasing production affects profits.

      A Variety of Cost Patterns

       The pattern of costs varies among industries and even among firms in the same industry. Some businesses
       have high fixed costs, but low marginal costs. Consider, for example, an internet company that provides
       medical advice to customers. Consumers might pay such a company directly, or perhaps hospitals or
       healthcare practices might subscribe on behalf of their patients. Setting up the website, collecting the
       information, writing the content, and buying or leasing the computer space to handle the web traffic are all
       fixed costs that the company must undertake before the site can work. However, when the website is up and
       running, it can provide a high quantity of service with relatively low variable costs, like the cost of monitoring
       the system and updating the information. In this case, the total cost curve might start at a high level, because of
       the high fixed costs, but then might appear close to flat, up to a large quantity of output, reflecting the low
       variable costs of operation. If the website is popular, however, a large rise in the number of visitors will

                                                                           7.4 · Production in the Long Run 173

overwhelm the website, and increasing output further could require a purchase of additional computer space.

For other firms, fixed costs may be relatively low. For example, consider firms that rake leaves in the fall or
shovel snow off sidewalks and driveways in the winter. For fixed costs, such firms may need little more than a
car to transport workers to homes of customers and some rakes and shovels. Still other firms may find that
diminishing marginal returns set in quite sharply. If a manufacturing plant tried to run 24 hours a day, seven
days a week, little time remains for routine equipment maintenance, and marginal costs can increase
dramatically as the firm struggles to repair and replace overworked equipment.

Every firm can gain insight into its task of earning profits by dividing its total costs into fixed and variable
costs, and then using these calculations as a basis for average total cost, average variable cost, and marginal
cost. However, making a final decision about the profit-maximizing quantity to produce and the price to charge
will require combining these perspectives on cost with an analysis of sales and revenue, which in turn requires
looking at the market structure in which the firm finds itself. Before we turn to the analysis of market structure
in other chapters, we will analyze the firm's cost structure from a long-run perspective.

7.4 Production in the Long Run

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Understand how long run production differs from short run production.

In the long run, all factors (including capital) are variable, so our production function is  .

Consider a secretarial firm that does typing for hire using typists for labor and personal computers for capital.
To start, the firm has just enough business for one typist and one PC to keep busy for a day. Say that's five
documents. Now suppose the firm receives a rush order from a good customer for 10 documents tomorrow.
Ideally, the firm would like to use two typists and two PCs to produce twice their normal output of five
documents. However, in the short turn, the firm has fixed capital, i.e. only one PC. The table below shows the
situation:

# Typists (L) 1 2 3 4 5 6

Letters/hr (TP) 5 7 8 8 8 8 For K = 1PC

MP                              521000

TABLE 7.11 Short Run Production Function for
Typing

In the short run, the only variable factor is labor so the only way the firm can produce more output is by hiring
additional workers. What could the second worker do? What can they contribute to the firm? Perhaps they can
answer the phone, which is a major impediment to completing the typing assignment. What about a third
worker? Perhaps the third worker could bring coffee to the first two workers. You can see both total product
and marginal product for the firm above. Now here's something to think about: At what point (e.g., after how
many workers) does diminishing marginal productivity kick in, and more importantly, why?

In this example, marginal productivity starts to decline after the second worker. This is because capital is fixed.
The production process for typing works best with one worker and one PC. If you add more than one typist, you
get seriously diminishing marginal productivity.

Consider the long run. Suppose the firm's demand increases to 15 documents per day. What might the firm do
to operate more efficiently? If demand has tripled, the firm could acquire two more PCs, which would give us a
new short run production function as Table 7.12 below shows.
174 7 · Production, Costs, and Industry Structure

                                 # Typists (L) 1 2 3 4 5 5

                                 TABLE 7.12 Long Run Production Function for Typing

With more capital, the firm can hire three workers before diminishing productivity comes into effect. More
generally, because all factors are variable, the long run production function shows the most efficient way of
producing any level of output.

7.5 Costs in the Long Run

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Calculate long run total cost
  · Identify economies of scale, diseconomies of scale, and constant returns to scale
  · Interpret graphs of long-run average cost curves and short-run average cost curves
  · Analyze cost and production in the long run and short run

The long run is the period of time when all costs are variable. The long run depends on the specifics of the firm
in question--it is not a precise period of time. If you have a one-year lease on your factory, then the long run is
any period longer than a year, since after a year you are no longer bound by the lease. No costs are fixed in the
long run. A firm can build new factories and purchase new machinery, or it can close existing facilities. In
planning for the long run, the firm will compare alternative production technologies (or processes).

In this context, technology refers to all alternative methods of combining inputs to produce outputs. It does not
refer to a specific new invention like the tablet computer. The firm will search for the production technology
that allows it to produce the desired level of output at the lowest cost. After all, lower costs lead to higher
profits--at least if total revenues remain unchanged. Moreover, each firm must fear that if it does not seek out
the lowest-cost methods of production, then it may lose sales to competitor firms that find a way to produce
and sell for less.

Choice of Production Technology

A firm can perform many tasks with a range of combinations of labor and physical capital. For example, a firm
can have human beings answering phones and taking messages, or it can invest in an automated voicemail
system. A firm can hire file clerks and secretaries to manage a system of paper folders and file cabinets, or it
can invest in a computerized recordkeeping system that will require fewer employees. A firm can hire workers
to push supplies around a factory on rolling carts, it can invest in motorized vehicles, or it can invest in robots
that carry materials without a driver. Firms often face a choice between buying a many small machines, which
need a worker to run each one, or buying one larger and more expensive machine, which requires only one or
two workers to operate it. In short, physical capital and labor can often substitute for each other.

Consider the example of local governments hiring a private firm to clean up public parks. Three different
combinations of labor and physical capital for cleaning up a single average-sized park appear in Table 7.13.
The first production technology is heavy on workers and light on machines, while the next two technologies
substitute machines for workers. Since all three of these production methods produce the same thing--one
cleaned-up park--a profit-seeking firm will choose the production technology that is least expensive, given the

prices of labor and machines.

                                Production technology 1 10 workers 2 machines
                                Production technology 2 7 workers 4 machines
                                Production technology 3 3 workers 7 machines
                               TABLE 7.13 Three Ways to Clean a Park

Production technology 1 uses the most labor and least machinery, while production technology 3 uses the least
labor and the most machinery. Table 7.14 outlines three examples of how the total cost will change with each
production technology as the cost of labor changes. As the cost of labor rises from example A to B to C, the firm
will choose to substitute away from labor and use more machinery.

Example A: Workers cost $40, machines cost $80

                               Labor Cost  Machine Cost Total Cost

Cost of technology 1 10 × $40 = $400 2 × $80 = $160 $560

Cost of technology 2 7 × $40 = $280 4 × $80 = $320 $600

Cost of technology 3 3 × $40 = $120 7 × $80 = $560 $680

Example B: Workers cost $55, machines cost $80

                               Labor Cost  Machine Cost Total Cost

Cost of technology 1 10 × $55 = $550 2 × $80 = $160 $710

Cost of technology 2 7 × $55 = $385 4 × $80 = $320 $705

Cost of technology 3 3 × $55 = $165 7 × $80 = $560 $725

Example C: Workers cost $90, machines cost $80

                               Labor Cost  Machine Cost Total Cost

Cost of technology 1 10 × $90 = $900 2 × $80 = $160 $1,060

Cost of technology 2 7 × $90 = $630 4 × $80 = $320 $950

Cost of technology 3 3 × $90 = $270 7 × $80 = $560 $830

TABLE 7.14 Total Cost with Rising Labor Costs

Example A shows the firm's cost calculation when wages are $40 and machines costs are $80. In this case,
technology 1 is the low-cost production technology. In example B, wages rise to $55, while the cost of machines
does not change, in which case technology 2 is the low-cost production technology. If wages keep rising up to
$90, while the cost of machines remains unchanged, then technology 3 clearly becomes the low-cost form of
production, as example C shows.

This example shows that as an input becomes more expensive (in this case, the labor input), firms will attempt
176 7 · Production, Costs, and Industry Structure

       to conserve on using that input and will instead shift to other inputs that are relatively less expensive. This
       pattern helps to explain why the demand curve for labor (or any input) slopes down; that is, as labor becomes
       relatively more expensive, profit-seeking firms will seek to substitute the use of other inputs. When a
       multinational employer like Coca-Cola or McDonald's sets up a bottling plant or a restaurant in a high-wage
       economy like the United States, Canada, Japan, or Western Europe, it is likely to use production technologies
       that conserve on the number of workers and focuses more on machines. However, that same employer is likely
       to use production technologies with more workers and less machinery when producing in a lower-wage
       country like Mexico, China, or South Africa.

      Economies of Scale

       Once a firm has determined the least costly production technology, it can consider the optimal scale of
       production, or quantity of output to produce. Many industries experience economies of scale. Economies of
       scale refers to the situation where, as the quantity of output goes up, the cost per unit goes down. This is the
       idea behind "warehouse stores" like Costco or Walmart. In everyday language: a larger factory can produce at a
       lower average cost than a smaller factory.
       Figure 7.9 illustrates the idea of economies of scale, showing the average cost of producing an alarm clock
       falling as the quantity of output rises. For a small-sized factory like S, with an output level of 1,000, the average
       cost of production is $12 per alarm clock. For a medium-sized factory like M, with an output level of 2,000, the
       average cost of production falls to $8 per alarm clock. For a large factory like L, with an output of 5,000, the
       average cost of production declines still further to $4 per alarm clock.

       FIGURE 7.9 Economies of Scale A small factory like S produces 1,000 alarm clocks at an average cost of $12 per
       clock. A medium factory like M produces 2,000 alarm clocks at a cost of $8 per clock. A large factory like L produces
       5,000 alarm clocks at a cost of $4 per clock. Economies of scale exist when the larger scale of production leads to
       lower average costs.
       The average cost curve in Figure 7.9 may appear similar to the average cost curves we presented earlier in this
       chapter, although it is downward-sloping rather than U-shaped. However, there is one major difference. The
       economies of scale curve is a long-run average cost curve, because it allows all factors of production to change.
       The short-run average cost curves we presented earlier in this chapter assumed the existence of fixed costs,
       and only variable costs were allowed to change.
       One prominent example of economies of scale occurs in the chemical industry. Chemical plants have many
       pipes. The cost of the materials for producing a pipe is related to the circumference of the pipe and its length.
       However, the cross-section area of the pipe determines the volume of chemicals that can flow through it. The
       calculations in Table 7.15 show that a pipe which uses twice as much material to make (as shown by the
       circumference) can actually carry four times the volume of chemicals because the pipe's cross-section area
       rises by a factor of four (as the Area column below shows).

TABLE 7.15 Comparing Pipes: Economies of Scale in the
Chemical Industry

A doubling of the cost of producing the pipe allows the chemical firm to process four times as much material.
This pattern is a major reason for economies of scale in chemical production, which uses a large quantity of
pipes. Of course, economies of scale in a chemical plant are more complex than this simple calculation
suggests. However, the chemical engineers who design these plants have long used what they call the "six-
tenths rule," a rule of thumb which holds that increasing the quantity produced in a chemical plant by a
certain percentage will increase total cost by only six-tenths as much.

Shapes of Long-Run Average Cost Curves

While in the short run firms are limited to operating on a single average cost curve (corresponding to the level
of fixed costs they have chosen), in the long run when all costs are variable, they can choose to operate on any
average cost curve. Thus, the long-run average cost (LRAC) curve is actually based on a group of short-run
average cost (SRAC) curves, each of which represents one specific level of fixed costs. More precisely, the
long-run average cost curve will be the least expensive average cost curve for any level of output. Figure 7.10
shows how we build the long-run average cost curve from a group of short-run average cost curves. Five short-
run-average cost curves appear on the diagram. Each SRAC curve represents a different level of fixed costs. For
example, you can imagine SRAC1 as a small factory, SRAC2 as a medium factory, SRAC3 as a large factory, and
SRAC4 and SRAC5 as very large and ultra-large. Although this diagram shows only five SRAC curves,
presumably there are an infinite number of other SRAC curves between the ones that we show. Think of this
family of short-run average cost curves as representing different choices for a firm that is planning its level of
investment in fixed cost physical capital--knowing that different choices about capital investment in the
present will cause it to end up with different short-run average cost curves in the future.

FIGURE 7.10 From Short-Run Average Cost Curves to Long-Run Average Cost Curves The five different short-run
average cost (SRAC) curves each represents a different level of fixed costs, from the low level of fixed costs at
SRAC1 to the high level of fixed costs at SRAC5. Other SRAC curves, not in the diagram, lie between the ones that are
178 7 · Production, Costs, and Industry Structure

       here. The long-run average cost (LRAC) curve shows the lowest cost for producing each quantity of output when
       fixed costs can vary, and so it is formed by the bottom edge of the family of SRAC curves. If a firm wished to produce
       quantity Q3, it would choose the fixed costs associated with SRAC3.

       The long-run average cost curve shows the cost of producing each quantity in the long run, when the firm can
       choose its level of fixed costs and thus choose which short-run average costs it desires. If the firm plans to
       produce in the long run at an output of Q3, it should make the set of investments that will lead it to locate on
       SRAC3, which allows producing q3 at the lowest cost. A firm that intends to produce Q3 would be foolish to
       choose the level of fixed costs at SRAC2 or SRAC4. At SRAC2 the level of fixed costs is too low for producing Q3 at
       lowest possible cost, and producing q3 would require adding a very high level of variable costs and make the
       average cost very high. At SRAC4, the level of fixed costs is too high for producing q3 at lowest possible cost,
       and again average costs would be very high as a result.

       The shape of the long-run cost curve, in Figure 7.10, is fairly common for many industries. The left-hand
       portion of the long-run average cost curve, where it is downward- sloping from output levels Q1 to Q2 to Q3,
       illustrates the case of economies of scale. In this portion of the long-run average cost curve, larger scale leads
       to lower average costs. We illustrated this pattern earlier in Figure 7.9.

       In the middle portion of the long-run average cost curve, the flat portion of the curve around Q3, economies of
       scale have been exhausted. In this situation, allowing all inputs to expand does not much change the average
       cost of production. We call this constant returns to scale. In this LRAC curve range, the average cost of
       production does not change much as scale rises or falls. The following Clear It Up feature explains where
       diminishing marginal returns fit into this analysis.

                CLEAR IT UP

      How do economies of scale compare to diminishing marginal returns?

       The concept of economies of scale, where average costs decline as production expands, might seem to conflict with
       the idea of diminishing marginal returns, where marginal costs rise as production expands. However, diminishing
       marginal returns refers only to the short-run average cost curve, where one variable input (like labor) is increasing,
       but other inputs (like capital) are fixed. Economies of scale refers to the long-run average cost curve where all inputs
       are allowed to increase together. Thus, it is quite possible and common to have an industry that has both
       diminishing marginal returns when only one input is allowed to change, and at the same time has economies of
       scale when all inputs change together to produce a larger-scale operation.

       Finally, the right-hand portion of the long-run average cost curve, running from output level Q4 to Q5, shows a
       situation where, as the level of output and the scale rises, average costs rise as well. We call this situation
       diseconomies of scale. A firm or a factory can grow so large that it becomes very difficult to manage, resulting
       in unnecessarily high costs as many layers of management try to communicate with workers and with each
       other, and as failures to communicate lead to disruptions in the flow of work and materials. Not many overly
       large factories exist in the real world, because with their very high production costs, they are unable to
       compete for long against plants with lower average costs of production. However, in some planned economies,
       like the economy of the old Soviet Union, plants that were so large as to be grossly inefficient were able to
       continue operating for a long time because government economic planners protected them from competition
       and ensured that they would not make losses.

       Diseconomies of scale can also be present across an entire firm, not just a large factory. The leviathan effect
       can hit firms that become too large to run efficiently, across the entirety of the enterprise. Firms that shrink
       their operations are often responding to finding itself in the diseconomies region, thus moving back to a lower
       average cost at a lower output level.

The Size and Number of Firms in an Industry

The shape of the long-run average cost curve has implications for how many firms will compete in an industry,
and whether the firms in an industry have many different sizes, or tend to be the same size. For example, say
that the appliance industry sells one million dishwashers every year at a price of $500 each and the long-run
average cost curve for dishwashers is in Figure 7.11 (a). In Figure 7.11 (a), the lowest point of the LRAC curve
occurs at a quantity of 10,000 produced. Thus, the market for dishwashers will consist of 100 different
manufacturing plants of this same size. If some firms built a plant that produced 5,000 dishwashers per year
or 25,000 dishwashers per year, the average costs of production at such plants would be well above $500, and
the firms would not be able to compete.

FIGURE 7.11 The LRAC Curve and the Size and Number of Firms (a) Low-cost firms will produce at output level R.
When the LRAC curve has a clear minimum point, then any firm producing a different quantity will have higher costs.
In this case, a firm producing at a quantity of 10,000 will produce at a lower average cost than a firm producing, say,
5,000 or 20,000 units. (b) Low-cost firms will produce between output levels R and S. When the LRAC curve has a
flat bottom, then firms producing at any quantity along this flat bottom can compete. In this case, any firm
producing a quantity between 5,000 and 20,000 can compete effectively, although firms producing less than 5,000
or more than 20,000 would face higher average costs and be unable to compete.

         CLEAR IT UP
How can we view cities as examples of economies of scale?

Why are people and economic activity concentrated in cities, rather than distributed evenly across a country? The
fundamental reason must be related to the idea of economies of scale--that grouping economic activity is more
productive in many cases than spreading it out. For example, cities provide a large group of nearby customers, so
that businesses can produce at an efficient economy of scale. They also provide a large group of workers and
suppliers, so that business can hire easily and purchase whatever specialized inputs they need. Many of the
attractions of cities, like sports stadiums and museums, can operate only if they can draw on a large nearby
population base. Cities are big enough to offer a wide variety of products, which is what appeals to many shoppers.
These factors are not exactly economies of scale in the narrow sense of the production function of a single firm, but
they are related to growth in the overall size of population and market in an area. Cities are sometimes called
"agglomeration economies."
180 7 · Production, Costs, and Industry Structure

       These agglomeration factors help to explain why every economy, as it develops, has an increasing proportion of its
       population living in urban areas. In the United States, about 80% of the population now lives in metropolitan areas
       (which include the suburbs around cities), compared to just 40% in 1900. However, in poorer nations of the world,
       including much of Africa, the proportion of the population in urban areas is only about 30%. One of the great
       challenges for these countries as their economies grow will be to manage the growth of the great cities that will
       arise.

       If cities offer economic advantages that are a form of economies of scale, then why don't all or most people live in
       one giant city? At some point, agglomeration economies must turn into diseconomies. For example, traffic
       congestion may reach a point where the gains from being geographically nearby are counterbalanced by how long it
       takes to travel. High densities of people, cars, and factories can mean more garbage and air and water pollution.
       Facilities like parks or museums may become overcrowded. There may be economies of scale for negative activities
       like crime, because high densities of people and businesses, combined with the greater impersonality of cities,
       make it easier for illegal activities as well as legal ones. The future of cities, both in the United States and in other
       countries around the world, will be determined by their ability to benefit from the economies of agglomeration and
       to minimize or counterbalance the corresponding diseconomies.

       We illustrate a more common case in Figure 7.11 (b), where the LRAC curve has a flat-bottomed area of
       constant returns to scale. In this situation, any firm with a level of output between 5,000 and 20,000 will be
       able to produce at about the same level of average cost. Given that the market will demand one million
       dishwashers per year at a price of $500, this market might have as many as 200 producers (that is, one million
       dishwashers divided by firms making 5,000 each) or as few as 50 producers (one million dishwashers divided
       by firms making 20,000 each). The producers in this market will range in size from firms that make 5,000
       units to firms that make 20,000 units. However, firms that produce below 5,000 units or more than 20,000 will
       be unable to compete, because their average costs will be too high. Thus, if we see an industry where almost all
       plants are the same size, it is likely that the long-run average cost curve has a unique bottom point as in Figure
       7.11 (a). However, if the long-run average cost curve has a wide flat bottom like Figure 7.11 (b), then firms of a
       variety of different sizes will be able to compete with each other.

       We can interpret the flat section of the long-run average cost curve in Figure 7.11 (b) in two different ways. One
       interpretation is that a single manufacturing plant producing a quantity of 5,000 has the same average costs as
       a single manufacturing plant with four times as much capacity that produces a quantity of 20,000. The other
       interpretation is that one firm owns a single manufacturing plant that produces a quantity of 5,000, while
       another firm owns four separate manufacturing plants, which each produce a quantity of 5,000. This second
       explanation, based on the insight that a single firm may own a number of different manufacturing plants, is
       especially useful in explaining why the long-run average cost curve often has a large flat segment--and thus
       why a seemingly smaller firm may be able to compete quite well with a larger firm. At some point, however, the
       task of coordinating and managing many different plants raises the cost of production sharply, and the long-
       run average cost curve slopes up as a result.

       In the examples to this point, the quantity demanded in the market is quite large (one million) compared with
       the quantity produced at the bottom of the long-run average cost curve (5,000, 10,000 or 20,000). In such a
       situation, the market is set for competition between many firms. However, what if the bottom of the long-run
       average cost curve is at a quantity of 10,000 and the total market demand at that price is only slightly higher
       than that quantity--or even somewhat lower?

       Return to Figure 7.11 (a), where the bottom of the long-run average cost curve is at 10,000, but now imagine
       that the total quantity of dishwashers demanded in the market at that price of $500 is only 30,000. In this
       situation, the total number of firms in the market would be three. We call a handful of firms in a market an
       "oligopoly," and the chapter on Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly will discuss the range of competitive
       strategies that can occur when oligopolies compete.

Alternatively, consider a situation, again in the setting of Figure 7.11 (a), where the bottom of the long-run
average cost curve is 10,000, but total demand for the product is only 5,000. (For simplicity, imagine that this
demand is highly inelastic, so that it does not vary according to price.) In this situation, the market may well
end up with a single firm--a monopoly--producing all 5,000 units. If any firm tried to challenge this monopoly
while producing a quantity lower than 5,000 units, the prospective competitor firm would have a higher
average cost, and so it would not be able to compete in the longer term without losing money. The chapter on
Monopoly discusses the situation of a monopoly firm.

Thus, the shape of the long-run average cost curve reveals whether competitors in the market will be different
sizes. If the LRAC curve has a single point at the bottom, then the firms in the market will be about the same
size, but if the LRAC curve has a flat-bottomed segment of constant returns to scale, then firms in the market
may be a variety of different sizes.

The relationship between the quantity at the minimum of the long-run average cost curve and the quantity
demanded in the market at that price will predict how much competition is likely to exist in the market. If the
quantity demanded in the market far exceeds the quantity at the minimum of the LRAC, then many firms will
compete. If the quantity demanded in the market is only slightly higher than the quantity at the minimum of
the LRAC, a few firms will compete. If the quantity demanded in the market is less than the quantity at the
minimum of the LRAC, a single-producer monopoly is a likely outcome.

Shifting Patterns of Long-Run Average Cost

New developments in production technology can shift the long-run average cost curve in ways that can alter
the size distribution of firms in an industry.

For much of the twentieth century, the most common change had been to see alterations in technology, like the
assembly line or the large department store, where large-scale producers seemed to gain an advantage over
smaller ones. In the long-run average cost curve, the downward-sloping economies of scale portion of the
curve stretched over a larger quantity of output.

However, new production technologies do not inevitably lead to a greater average size for firms. For example,
in recent years some new technologies for generating electricity on a smaller scale have appeared. The
traditional coal-burning electricity plants needed to produce 300 to 600 megawatts of power to exploit
economies of scale fully. However, high-efficiency turbines to produce electricity from burning natural gas can
produce electricity at a competitive price while producing a smaller quantity of 100 megawatts or less. These
new technologies create the possibility for smaller companies or plants to generate electricity as efficiently as
large ones. Another example of a technology-driven shift to smaller plants may be taking place in the tire
industry. A traditional mid-size tire plant produces about six million tires per year. However, in 2000, the
Italian company Pirelli introduced a new tire factory that uses many robots. The Pirelli tire plant produced
only about one million tires per year, but did so at a lower average cost than a traditional mid-sized tire plant.

Controversy has simmered in recent years over whether the new information and communications
technologies will lead to a larger or smaller size for firms. On one side, the new technology may make it easier
for small firms to reach out beyond their local geographic area and find customers across a state, or the nation,
or even across international boundaries. This factor might seem to predict a future with a larger number of
small competitors. On the other side, perhaps the new information and communications technology will create
"winner-take-all" markets where one large company will tend to command a large share of total sales, as
Microsoft has done producing of software for personal computers or Amazon has done in online bookselling.
Moreover, improved information and communication technologies might make it easier to manage many
different plants and operations across the country or around the world, and thus encourage larger firms. This
ongoing battle between the forces of smallness and largeness will be of great interest to economists,
businesspeople, and policymakers.

Key Concepts and Summary

7.1 Explicit and Implicit Costs, and Accounting and Economic Profit

Privately owned firms are motivated to earn profits. Profit is the difference between revenues and costs. While
accounting profit considers only explicit costs, economic profit considers both explicit and implicit costs.
184 7 · Key Concepts and Summary

7.2 Production in the Short Run

Production is the process a firm uses to transform inputs (e.g., labor, capital, raw materials, etc.) into outputs. It
is not possible to vary fixed inputs (e.g., capital) in a short period of time. Thus, in the short run the only way to
change output is to change the variable inputs (e.g., labor). Marginal product is the additional output a firm
obtains by employing more labor in production. At some point, employing additional labor leads to
diminishing marginal productivity, meaning the additional output obtained is less than for the previous
increment to labor. Mathematically, marginal product is the slope of the total product curve.

7.3 Costs in the Short Run

For every input (e.g., labor), there is an associated factor payment (e.g., wages and salaries). The cost of
production for a given quantity of output is the sum of the amount of each input required to produce that
quantity of output times the associated factor payment.

In a short-run perspective, we can divide a firm's total costs into fixed costs, which a firm must incur before
producing any output, and variable costs, which the firm incurs in the act of producing. Fixed costs are sunk
costs; that is, because they are in the past and the firm cannot alter them, they should play no role in economic
decisions about future production or pricing. Variable costs typically show diminishing marginal returns, so
that the marginal cost of producing higher levels of output rises.

We calculate marginal cost by taking the change in total cost (or the change in variable cost, which will be the
same thing) and dividing it by the change in output, for each possible change in output. Marginal costs are
typically rising. A firm can compare marginal cost to the additional revenue it gains from selling another unit
to find out whether its marginal unit is adding to profit.

We calculate average total cost by taking total cost and dividing by total output at each different level of output.
Average costs are typically U-shaped on a graph. If a firm's average cost of production is lower than the market
price, a firm will be earning profits.

We calculate average variable cost by taking variable cost and dividing by the total output at each level of
output. Average variable costs are typically U-shaped. If a firm's average variable cost of production is lower
than the market price, then the firm would be earning profits if fixed costs are left out of the picture.

7.4 Production in the Long Run

In the long run, all inputs are variable. Since diminishing marginal productivity is caused by fixed capital,
there are no diminishing returns in the long run. Firms can choose the optimal capital stock to produce their
desired level of output.

7.5 Costs in the Long Run

A production technology refers to a specific combination of labor, physical capital, and technology that makes
up a particular method of production.

In the long run, firms can choose their production technology, and so all costs become variable costs. In
making this choice, firms will try to substitute relatively inexpensive inputs for relatively expensive inputs
where possible, so as to produce at the lowest possible long-run average cost.

Economies of scale refers to a situation where as the level of output increases, the average cost decreases.
Constant returns to scale refers to a situation where average cost does not change as output increases.
Diseconomies of scale refers to a situation where as output increases, average costs also increase.

The long-run average cost curve shows the lowest possible average cost of production, allowing all the inputs
to production to vary so that the firm is choosing its production technology. A downward-sloping LRAC shows
economies of scale; a flat LRAC shows constant returns to scale; an upward-sloping LRAC shows diseconomies
of scale. If the long-run average cost curve has only one quantity produced that results in the lowest possible

average cost, then all of the firms competing in an industry should be the same size. However, if the LRAC has a
flat segment at the bottom, so that a firm can produce a range of different quantities at the lowest average cost,
the firms competing in the industry will display a range of sizes. The market demand in conjunction with the
long-run average cost curve determines how many firms will exist in a given industry.

If the quantity demanded in the market of a certain product is much greater than the quantity found at the
bottom of the long-run average cost curve, where the cost of production is lowest, the market will have many
firms competing. If the quantity demanded in the market is less than the quantity at the bottom of the LRAC,
there will likely be only one firm.

Introduction to Perfect Competition

         BRING IT HOME
A Dime a Dozen

When you were younger did you babysit, deliver papers, or mow the lawn for money? If so, you faced stiff
competition from many other competitors who offered identical services. There was nothing to stop others from
also offering their services.
All of you charged the "going rate." If you tried to charge more, your customers would simply buy from someone
else. These conditions are very similar to the conditions agricultural growers face.
190 8 · Perfect Competition

       Growing a crop may be more difficult to start than a babysitting or lawn mowing service, but growers face the same
       fierce competition. In the grand scale of world agriculture, farmers face competition from thousands of others
       because they sell an identical product. After all, winter wheat is winter wheat, but if they find it hard to make money
       with that crop, it is relatively easy for farmers to leave the marketplace for another crop. In this case, they do not sell
       the family farm, they switch crops.

       Take the case of the upper Midwest region of the United States--for many generations the area was called "King
       Wheat." According to the United States Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics Service, statistics
       by state, in 1997, 11.6 million acres of wheat and 780,000 acres of corn were planted in North Dakota. In the
       intervening 25 or so years has the mix of crops changed? Since it is relatively easy to switch crops, did farmers
       change what they planted in response to changes in relative crop prices? We will find out at chapter's end.

       In the meantime, let's consider the topic of this chapter--the perfectly competitive market. This is a market in which
       entry and exit are relatively easy and competitors are "a dime a dozen."

       Most businesses face two realities: no one is required to buy their products, and even customers who might
       want those products may buy from other businesses instead. Firms that operate in perfectly competitive
       markets face this reality. In this chapter, you will learn how such firms make decisions about how much to
       produce, how much profit they make, whether to stay in business or not, and many others. Industries differ
       from one another in terms of how many sellers there are in a specific market, how easy or difficult it is for a
       new firm to enter, and the type of products that they sell. Economists refer to this as an industry's market
       structure. In this chapter, we focus on perfect competition. However, in other chapters we will examine other
       industry types: Monopoly and Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly.

     8.1 Perfect Competition and Why It Matters

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain the characteristics of a perfectly competitive market
         · Discuss how perfectly competitive firms react in the short run and in the long run

       Firms are in perfect competition when the following conditions occur: (1) many firms produce identical
       products; (2) many buyers are available to buy the product, and many sellers are available to sell the product;
       (3) sellers and buyers have all relevant information to make rational decisions about the product that they are
       buying and selling; and (4) firms can enter and leave the market without any restrictions--in other words, there
       is free entry and exit into and out of the market.

       A perfectly competitive firm is known as a price taker, because the pressure of competing firms forces it to
       accept the prevailing equilibrium price in the market. If a firm in a perfectly competitive market raises the
       price of its product by so much as a penny, it will lose all of its sales to competitors. When a wheat grower, as
       we discussed in the Bring It Home feature, wants to know the going price of wheat, they have to check on the
       computer or listen to the radio. Supply and demand in the entire market solely determine the market price, not
       the individual farmer. A perfectly competitive firm must be a very small player in the overall market, so that it
       can increase or decrease output without noticeably affecting the overall quantity supplied and price in the
       market.

       A perfectly competitive market is a hypothetical extreme; however, producers in a number of industries do
       face many competitor firms selling highly similar goods, in which case they must often act as price takers.
       Economists often use agricultural markets as an example. The same crops that different farmers grow are
       largely interchangeable. According to the United States Department of Agriculture monthly reports, in
       December 2021, U.S. corn farmers received an average of $5.47 per bushel. A corn farmer who attempted to
       sell at $6.00 per bushel would not have found any buyers. A perfectly competitive firm will not sell below the
       equilibrium price either. Why should they when they can sell all they want at the higher price? Other examples

This chapter examines how profit-seeking firms decide how much to produce in perfectly competitive
markets. Such firms will analyze their costs as we discussed in the chapter on Production, Costs and Industry
Structure. In the short run, the perfectly competitive firm will seek the quantity of output where profits are
highest or, if profits are not possible, where losses are lowest.

In the long run, positive economic profits will attract competition as other firms enter the market. Economic
losses will cause firms to exit the market. Ultimately, perfectly competitive markets will attain long-run
equilibrium when no new firms want to enter the market and existing firms do not want to leave the market, as
economic profits have been driven down to zero.

8.2 How Perfectly Competitive Firms Make Output Decisions

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Calculate profits by comparing total revenue and total cost
  · Identify profits and losses with the average cost curve
  · Explain the shutdown point
  · Determine the price at which a firm should continue producing in the short run

A perfectly competitive firm has only one major decision to make--namely, what quantity to produce. To
understand this, consider a different way of writing out the basic definition of profit:

Since a perfectly competitive firm must accept the price for its output as determined by the product's market
demand and supply, it cannot choose the price it charges. This is already determined in the profit equation,
and so the perfectly competitive firm can sell any number of units at exactly the same price. It implies that the
firm faces a perfectly elastic demand curve for its product: buyers are willing to buy any number of units of
output from the firm at the market price. When the perfectly competitive firm chooses what quantity to
produce, then this quantity--along with the prices prevailing in the market for output and inputs--will
determine the firm's total revenue, total costs, and ultimately, level of profits.

Determining the Highest Profit by Comparing Total Revenue and Total Cost

A perfectly competitive firm can sell as large a quantity as it wishes, as long as it accepts the prevailing market
price. The formula above shows that total revenue depends on the quantity sold and the price charged. If the
firm sells a higher quantity of output, then total revenue will increase. If the market price of the product
increases, then total revenue also increases whatever the quantity of output sold. As an example of how a
perfectly competitive firm decides what quantity to produce, consider the case of a small farmer who produces
raspberries and sells them frozen for $4 per pack. Sales of one pack of raspberries will bring in $4, two packs
will be $8, three packs will be $12, and so on. If, for example, the price of frozen raspberries doubles to $8 per
pack, then sales of one pack of raspberries will be $8, two packs will be $16, three packs will be $24, and so on.

Table 8.1 shows total revenue and total costs for the raspberry farm; these data also appear in Figure 8.2. The
horizontal axis shows the quantity of frozen raspberries produced in packs. The vertical axis shows both total
revenue and total costs, measured in dollars. The total cost curve intersects with the vertical axis at a value
that shows the level of fixed costs, and then slopes upward. All these cost curves follow the same
192 8 · Perfect Competition

       characteristics as the curves that we covered in the Production, Costs and Industry Structure chapter.

FIGURE 8.2 Total Cost and Total Revenue at the Raspberry Farm Total revenue for a perfectly competitive firm is a
straight line sloping up. The slope is equal to the price of the good. Total cost also slopes up, but with some
curvature. At higher levels of output, total cost begins to slope upward more steeply because of diminishing
marginal returns. The maximum profit will occur at the quantity where the difference between total revenue and
total cost is largest.

Based on its total revenue and total cost curves, a perfectly competitive firm like the raspberry farm can
calculate the quantity of output that will provide the highest level of profit. At any given quantity, total revenue
minus total cost will equal profit. One way to determine the most profitable quantity to produce is to see at
what quantity total revenue exceeds total cost by the largest amount. Figure 8.2 shows total revenue, total cost
and profit using the data from Table 8.1. The vertical gap between total revenue and total cost is profit, for
example, at Q = 60, TR = 240 and TC = 165. The difference is 75, which is the height of the profit curve at that
output level. The firm doesn't make a profit at every level of output. In this example, total costs will exceed total
revenues at output levels from 0 to approximately 30, and so over this range of output, the firm will be making
losses. At output levels from 40 to 100, total revenues exceed total costs, so the firm is earning profits.
However, at any output greater than 100, total costs again exceed total revenues and the firm is making
increasing losses. Total profits appear in the final column of Table 8.1. Maximum profit occurs at an output
between 70 and 80, when profit equals $90.

A higher price would mean that total revenue would be higher for every quantity sold. A lower price would
mean that total revenue would be lower for every quantity sold. What happens if the price drops low enough so
that the total revenue line is completely below the total cost curve; that is, at every level of output, total costs
are higher than total revenues? In this instance, the best the firm can do is to suffer losses. However, a profit-
maximizing firm will prefer the quantity of output where total revenues come closest to total costs and thus
where the losses are smallest.

(Later we will see that sometimes it will make sense for the firm to close, rather than stay in operation
producing output.)

Comparing Marginal Revenue and Marginal Costs

The approach that we described in the previous section, using total revenue and total cost, is not the only
approach to determining the profit maximizing level of output. In this section, we provide an alternative
approach which uses marginal revenue and marginal cost.

Firms often do not have the necessary data they need to draw a complete total cost curve for all levels of
production. They cannot be sure of what total costs would look like if they, say, doubled production or cut
production in half, because they have not tried it. Instead, firms experiment. They produce a slightly greater or
lower quantity and observe how it affects profits. In economic terms, this practical approach to maximizing
profits means examining how changes in production affect marginal revenue and marginal cost.

Figure 8.3 presents the marginal revenue and marginal cost curves based on the total revenue and total cost in
Table 8.1. The marginal revenue curve shows the additional revenue gained from selling one more unit. As
mentioned before, a firm in perfect competition faces a perfectly elastic demand curve for its product--that is,
the firm's demand curve is a horizontal line drawn at the market price level. This also means that the firm's
marginal revenue curve is the same as the firm's demand curve: Every time a consumer demands one more
unit, the firm sells one more unit and revenue increases by exactly the same amount equal to the market price.
In this example, every time the firm sells a pack of frozen raspberries, the firm's revenue increases by $4.
Table 8.2 shows an example of this. This condition only holds for price taking firms in perfect competition
where:

The formula for marginal revenue is:
194 8 · Perfect Competition

                             Price Quantity Total Revenue Marginal Revenue

                             $4 1       $4   -

                             $4 2       $8   $4

                             $4 3       $12  $4

                             $4 4       $16  $4

                             TABLE 8.2

Notice that marginal revenue does not change as the firm produces more output. That is because under
perfect competition, the price is determined through the interaction of supply and demand in the market and
does not change as the farmer produces more (keeping in mind that, due to the relative small size of each firm,
increasing their supply has no impact on the total market supply where price is determined).

Since a perfectly competitive firm is a price taker, it can sell whatever quantity it wishes at the market-
determined price. We calculate marginal cost, the cost per additional unit sold, by dividing the change in total
cost by the change in quantity. The formula for marginal cost is:

Ordinarily, marginal cost changes as the firm produces a greater quantity.

In the raspberry farm example, in Figure 8.3 and Table 8.3, marginal cost at first declines as production
increases from 10 to 20 to 30 to 40 packs of raspberries--which represents the area of increasing marginal
returns that is not uncommon at low levels of production. At some point, though, marginal costs start to
increase, displaying the typical pattern of diminishing marginal returns. If the firm is producing at a quantity
where MR > MC, like 40 or 50 packs of raspberries, then it can increase profit by increasing output because the
marginal revenue is exceeding the marginal cost. If the firm is producing at a quantity where MC > MR, like 90
or 100 packs, then it can increase profit by reducing output because the reductions in marginal cost will
exceed the reductions in marginal revenue. The firm's profit-maximizing choice of output will occur where MR
= MC (or at a choice close to that point).

TABLE 8.3 Marginal Revenues and Marginal Costs at the Raspberry Farm

In this example, the marginal revenue and marginal cost curves cross at a price of $4 and a quantity of 80
produced. If the farmer started out producing at a level of 60, and then experimented with increasing
production to 70, marginal revenues from the increase in production would exceed marginal costs--and so
196 8 · Perfect Competition

       profits would rise. The farmer has an incentive to keep producing. At a level of output of 80, marginal cost and
       marginal revenue are equal so profit doesn't change. If the farmer then experimented further with increasing
       production from 80 to 90, he would find that marginal costs from the increase in production are greater than
       marginal revenues, and so profits would decline.
       The profit-maximizing choice for a perfectly competitive firm will occur at the level of output where marginal
       revenue is equal to marginal cost--that is, where MR = MC. This occurs at Q = 80 in the figure.

                                                                                                                WORK IT OUT
        Does Profit Maximization Occur at a Range of Output or a Specific Level of Output?

         Table 8.1 shows that maximum profit occurs at any output level between 70 and 80 units of output. But MR = MC
         occurs only at 80 units of output. How can we explain this slight discrepancy? As long as MR > MC, a profit-
         seeking firm should keep expanding production. Expanding production into the zone where MR < MC reduces
         economic profits. It's true that profit is the same at Q = 70 and Q = 80, but it's only when the firm goes beyond
         that Q that it will see that profits fall. Thus, MR = MC is the signal to stop expanding, so that is the level of output
         they should target.

       Because the marginal revenue received by a perfectly competitive firm is equal to the price P, we can also write
       the profit-maximizing rule for a perfectly competitive firm as a recommendation to produce at the quantity of
       output where P = MC.

      Profits and Losses with the Average Cost Curve

       Does maximizing profit (producing where MR = MC) imply an actual economic profit? The answer depends on
       the relationship between price and average total cost, which is the average profit or profit margin. If the
       market price is higher than the firm's average cost of production for that quantity produced, then the profit
       margin is positive and the firm will earn profits. Conversely, if the market price is lower than the average cost
       of production, the profit margin is negative and the firm will suffer losses. You might think that, in this
       situation, the firm may want to shut down immediately. Remember, however, that the firm has already paid for
       fixed costs, such as equipment, so it may continue to produce for a while and incur a loss. Table 8.3 continues
       the raspberry farm example. Figure 8.5 illustrates the three possible scenarios: (a) where price intersects
       marginal cost at a level above the average cost curve, (b) where price intersects marginal cost at a level equal to
       the average cost curve, and (c) where price intersects marginal cost at a level below the average cost curve.

FIGURE 8.5 Price and Average Cost at the Raspberry Farm In (a), price intersects marginal cost above the average
cost curve. Since price is greater than average cost, the firm is making a profit. In (b), price intersects marginal cost
at the minimum point of the average cost curve. Since price is equal to average cost, the firm is breaking even. In (c),
price intersects marginal cost below the average cost curve. Since price is less than average cost, the firm is making
a loss.
First consider a situation where the price is equal to $5 for a pack of frozen raspberries. The rule for a profit-
maximizing perfectly competitive firm is to produce the level of output where Price= MR = MC, so the
raspberry farmer will produce a quantity of approximately 85, which is labeled as E' in Figure 8.5 (a).
Remember that the area of a rectangle is equal to its base multiplied by its height. The farm's total revenue at
this price will be shown by the rectangle from the origin over to a quantity of 85 packs (the base) up to point E'
(the height), over to the price of $5, and back to the origin. The average cost of producing 80 packs is shown by
point C or about $3.50. Total costs will be the quantity of 85 times the average cost of $3.50, which is shown by
the area of the rectangle from the origin to a quantity of 90, up to point C, over to the vertical axis and down to
the origin. The difference between total revenues and total costs is profits. Thus, profits will be the blue shaded
rectangle on top.
We calculate this as:
198 8 · Perfect Competition

       Or, we can calculate it as:

       Now consider Figure 8.5 (b), where the price has fallen to $2.75 for a pack of frozen raspberries. Again, the
       perfectly competitive firm will choose the level of output where Price = MR = MC, but in this case, the quantity
       produced will be 75. At this price and output level, where the marginal cost curve is crossing the average cost
       curve, the price the firm receives is exactly equal to its average cost of production. We call this the break even
       point.
       The farm's total revenue at this price will be shown by the large shaded rectangle from the origin over to a
       quantity of 75 packs (the base) up to point E (the height), over to the price of $2.75, and back to the origin. The
       height of the average cost curve at Q = 75, i.e. point E, shows the average cost of producing this quantity. Total
       costs will be the quantity of 75 times the average cost of $2.75, which is shown by the area of the rectangle
       from the origin to a quantity of 75, up to point E, over to the vertical axis and down to the origin. It should be
       clear that the rectangles for total revenue and total cost are the same. Thus, the firm is making zero profit. The
       calculations are as follows:

       Or, we can calculate it as:

       In Figure 8.5 (c), the market price has fallen still further to $2.00 for a pack of frozen raspberries. At this price,
       marginal revenue intersects marginal cost at a quantity of 65. The farm's total revenue at this price will be
       shown by the large shaded rectangle from the origin over to a quantity of 65 packs (the base) up to point E" (the
       height), over to the price of $2, and back to the origin. The average cost of producing 65 packs is shown by
       Point C" or shows the average cost of producing 50 packs is about $2.73. Total costs will be the quantity of 65
       times the average cost of $2.73, which the area of the rectangle from the origin to a quantity of 50, up to point
       C", over to the vertical axis and down to the origin shows. It should be clear from examining the two rectangles
       that total revenue is less than total cost. Thus, the firm is losing money and the loss (or negative profit) will be
       the rose-shaded rectangle.

If the market price that perfectly competitive firm receives leads it to produce at a quantity where the price is
greater than average cost, the firm will earn profits. If the price the firm receives causes it to produce at a
quantity where price equals average cost, which occurs at the minimum point of the AC curve, then the firm
earns zero profits. Finally, if the price the firm receives leads it to produce at a quantity where the price is less
than average cost, the firm will earn losses. Table 8.4 summarizes this.

If...      Then...

Price > ATC Firm earns an economic profit

Price = ATC Firm earns zero economic profit

Price < ATC Firm earns a loss

TABLE 8.4

         CLEAR IT UP

Which intersection should a firm choose?

At a price of $2, MR intersects MC at two points: Q = 20 and Q = 65. It never makes sense for a firm to choose a level
of output on the downward sloping part of the MC curve, because the profit is lower (the loss is bigger). Thus, the
correct choice of output is Q = 65.

The Shutdown Point

The possibility that a firm may earn losses raises a question: Why can the firm not avoid losses by shutting
down and not producing at all? The answer is that shutting down can reduce variable costs to zero, but in the
short run, the firm has already paid for fixed costs. As a result, if the firm produces a quantity of zero, it would
still make losses because it would still need to pay for its fixed costs. Therefore when a firm is experiencing
losses, it must face a question: should it continue producing or should it shut down?

As an example, consider the situation of the Yoga Center, which has signed a contract to rent space that costs
$10,000 per month. If the firm decides to operate, its marginal costs for hiring yoga teachers is $15,000 for the
month. If the firm shuts down, it must still pay the rent, but it would not need to hire labor. Table 8.5 shows
three possible scenarios. In the first scenario, the Yoga Center does not have any clients, and therefore does not
make any revenues, in which case it faces losses of $10,000 equal to the fixed costs. In the second scenario, the
Yoga Center has clients that earn the center revenues of $10,000 for the month, but ultimately experiences
losses of $15,000 due to having to hire yoga instructors to cover the classes. In the third scenario, the Yoga
Center earns revenues of $20,000 for the month, but experiences losses of $5,000.

In all three cases, the Yoga Center loses money. In all three cases, when the rental contract expires in the long
run, assuming revenues do not improve, the firm should exit this business. In the short run, though, the
decision varies depending on the level of losses and whether the firm can cover its variable costs. In scenario 1,
the center does not have any revenues, so hiring yoga teachers would increase variable costs and losses, so it
should shut down and only incur its fixed costs. In scenario 2, the center's losses are greater because it does
not make enough revenue to offset the increased variable costs, so it should shut down immediately and only
incur its fixed costs. If price is below the minimum average variable cost, the firm must shut down. In contrast,
in scenario 3 the revenue that the center can earn is high enough that the losses diminish when it remains
open, so the center should remain open in the short run.
200 8 · Perfect Competition

         Scenario 1
         If the center shuts down now, revenues are zero but it will not incur any variable costs and would only need to pay
         fixed costs of $10,000.

         Scenario 2
         The center earns revenues of $10,000, and variable costs are $15,000. The center should shut down now.

         Scenario 3
         The center earns revenues of $20,000, and variable costs are $15,000. The center should continue in business.

       TABLE 8.5 Should the Yoga Center Shut Down Now or Later?
       Figure 8.6 illustrates the lesson that remaining open requires the price to exceed the firm's average variable
       cost. When the firm is operating below the break-even point, where price equals average cost, it is operating at
       a loss so it faces two options: continue to produce and lose money or shutdown. Which option is preferable?
       The one that loses the least money is the best choice.
       At a price of $2.00 per pack, as Figure 8.6 (a) illustrates, if the farm stays in operation it will produce at a level
       of 65 packs of raspberries, and it will make losses of $47.45 (as explained earlier). The alternative would be to
       shut down and lose all the fixed costs of $62.00. Since losing $47.45 is preferable to losing $62.00, the profit
       maximizing (or in this case the loss minimizing) choice is to stay in operation. The key reason is because price
       is above average variable cost. This means that at the current price the farm can pay all its variable costs, and
       have some revenue left over to pay some of the fixed costs. So the loss represents the part of the fixed costs the
       farm can't pay, which is less than the entire fixed costs. However, if the price declined to $1.50 per pack, as
       Figure 8.6 (b) shows, and if the firm applied its rule of producing where P = MR = MC, it would produce a
       quantity of 60. This price is below average variable cost for this level of output. If the farmer cannot pay
       workers (the variable costs), then it has to shut down. At this price and output, total revenues would be $90
       (quantity of 60 times price of $1.50) and total cost would be $165, for overall losses of $75. If the farm shuts
       down, it must pay only its fixed costs of $62, so shutting down is preferable to selling at a price of $1.50 per
       pack.

FIGURE 8.6 The Shutdown Point for the Raspberry Farm In (a), the farm produces at a level of 65. It is making
losses of $47.50, but price is above average variable cost, so it continues to operate. In (b), total revenues are $90
and total cost is $165, for overall losses of $75. If the farm shuts down, it must pay only its fixed costs of $62.
Shutting down is preferable to selling at a price of $1.50 per pack.

Looking at Table 8.6, if the price falls below about $1.72, the minimum average variable cost, the firm must
shut down.

202 8 · Perfect Competition

       The intersection of the average variable cost curve and the marginal cost curve, which shows the price below
       which the firm would lack enough revenue to cover its variable costs, is called the shutdown point. If the
       perfectly competitive firm faces a market price above the shutdown point, then the firm is at least covering its
       average variable costs. At a price above the shutdown point, the firm is also making enough revenue to cover at
       least a portion of fixed costs, so it should limp ahead even if it is making losses in the short run, since at least
       those losses will be smaller than if the firm shuts down immediately and incurs a loss equal to total fixed costs.
       However, if the firm is receiving a price below the price at the shutdown point, then the firm is not even
       covering its variable costs. In this case, staying open is making the firm's losses larger, and it should shut down
       immediately. To summarize, if:

         · price < minimum average variable cost, then firm shuts down
         · price > minimum average variable cost, then firm stays in business

      Short-Run Outcomes for Perfectly Competitive Firms

       The average cost and average variable cost curves divide the marginal cost curve into three segments, as
       Figure 8.7 shows. At the market price, which the perfectly competitive firm accepts as given, the profit-
       maximizing firm chooses the output level where price or marginal revenue, which are the same thing for a
       perfectly competitive firm, is equal to marginal cost: P = MR = MC.

       FIGURE 8.7 Profit, Loss, Shutdown We can divide the marginal cost curve into three zones, based on where it is
       crossed by the average cost and average variable cost curves. We call the point where MC crosses AC the break even
       point. If the firm is operating where the market price is at a level higher than the break even point, then price will be
       greater than average cost and the firm is earning profits. If the price is exactly at the break even point, then the firm
       is making zero profits. If price falls in the zone between the shutdown point and the break even point, then the firm
       is making losses but will continue to operate in the short run, since it is covering its variable costs, and more if price
       is above the shutdown-point price. However, if price falls below the price at the shutdown point, then the firm will
       shut down immediately, since it is not even covering its variable costs.
       First consider the upper zone, where prices are above the level where marginal cost (MC) crosses average cost
       (AC) at the zero profit point. At any price above that level, the firm will earn profits in the short run. If the price
       falls exactly on the break even point where the MC and AC curves cross, then the firm earns zero profits. If a
       price falls into the zone between the break even point, where MC crosses AC, and the shutdown point, where
       MC crosses AVC, the firm will be making losses in the short run--but since the firm is more than covering its

variable costs, the losses are smaller than if the firm shut down immediately. Finally, consider a price at or
below the shutdown point where MC crosses AVC. At any price like this one, the firm will shut down
immediately, because it cannot even cover its variable costs.

Marginal Cost and the Firm's Supply Curve

For a perfectly competitive firm, the marginal cost curve is identical to the firm's supply curve starting from
the minimum point on the average variable cost curve. To understand why this perhaps surprising insight
holds true, first think about what the supply curve means. A firm checks the market price and then looks at its
supply curve to decide what quantity to produce. Now, think about what it means to say that a firm will
maximize its profits by producing at the quantity where P = MC. This rule means that the firm checks the
market price, and then looks at its marginal cost to determine the quantity to produce--and makes sure that
the price is greater than the minimum average variable cost. In other words, the marginal cost curve above the
minimum point on the average variable cost curve becomes the firm's supply curve.

As we discussed in the chapter on Demand and Supply, many of the reasons that supply curves shift relate to
underlying changes in costs. For example, a lower price of key inputs or new technologies that reduce
production costs cause supply to shift to the right. In contrast, bad weather or added government regulations
can add to costs of certain goods in a way that causes supply to shift to the left. We can also interpret these
shifts in the firm's supply curve as shifts of the marginal cost curve. A shift in costs of production that
increases marginal costs at all levels of output--and shifts MC upward and to the left--will cause a perfectly
competitive firm to produce less at any given market price. Conversely, a shift in costs of production that
decreases marginal costs at all levels of output will shift MC downward and to the right and as a result, a
competitive firm will choose to expand its level of output at any given price. The following Work It Out feature
will walk you through an example.

TABLE 8.8

Step 2. Determine the market price that the firm receives for its product. Since the firm in perfect competition
is a price taker, the market price is constant. With the given price, calculate total revenue as equal to price
multiplied by quantity for all output levels produced. In this example, the given price is $28. You can see that in
the second column of Table 8.9.

                                 Quantity Price Total Revenue (P × Q)

                                 0          $28 $28×0=$0

                                 1          $28 $28×1=$28

                                 2          $28 $28×2=$56

                                 3          $28 $28×3=$84

                                 4          $28 $28×4=$112

                                 5          $28 $28×5=$140

                                 TABLE 8.9

Step 3. Calculate profits as total cost subtracted from total revenue, as Table 8.10 shows.

Step 4. To find the profit-maximizing output level, look at the Marginal Cost column (at every output level
produced), as Table 8.11 shows, and determine where it is equal to the market price. The output level where
price equals the marginal cost is the output level that maximizes profits.

0 $28 $20 $0 $20 -        -  - $0 -$20

5 $28 $20 $80 $100 $16.40 $20.40 $28 $140 $40

TABLE 8.11

Step 5. Once you have determined the profit-maximizing output level (in this case, output quantity 5), you can
look at the amount of profits made (in this case, $40).

Step 6. If the firm is making economic losses, the firm needs to determine whether it produces the output level
where price equals marginal revenue and equals marginal cost or it shuts down and only incurs its fixed costs.

Step 7. For the output level where marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost, check if the market price is
greater than the average variable cost of producing that output level.

  · If P > AVC but P < ATC, then the firm continues to produce in the short-run, making economic losses.
  · If P < AVC, then the firm stops producing and only incurs its fixed costs.

In this example, the price of $28 is greater than the AVC ($16.40) of producing 5 units of output, so the firm
continues producing.

     8.3 Entry and Exit Decisions in the Long Run

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain how entry and exit lead to zero profits in the long run
         · Discuss the long-run adjustment process

       It is impossible to precisely define the line between the short run and the long run with a stopwatch, or even
       with a calendar. It varies according to the specific business. Therefore, the distinction between the short run
       and the long run is more technical: in the short run, firms cannot change the usage of fixed inputs, while in the
       long run, the firm can adjust all factors of production.

       In a competitive market, profits are a red cape that incites businesses to charge. If a business is making a profit
       in the short run, it has an incentive to expand existing factories or to build new ones. New firms may start
       production, as well. When new firms enter the industry in response to increased industry profits it is called
       entry.

       Losses are the black thundercloud that causes businesses to flee. If a business is making losses in the short
       run, it will either keep limping along or just shut down, depending on whether its revenues are covering its
       variable costs. But in the long run, firms that are facing losses will cease production altogether. The long-run
       process of reducing production in response to a sustained pattern of losses is called exit. The following Clear It
       Up feature discusses where some of these losses might come from, and the reasons why some firms go out of
       business.

                CLEAR IT UP

      Why do firms cease to exist?

       Can we say anything about what causes a firm to exit an industry? Profits are the measurement that determines
       whether a business stays operating or not. Individuals start businesses with the purpose of making profits. They
       invest their money, time, effort, and many other resources to produce and sell something that they hope will give
       them something in return. Unfortunately, not all businesses are successful, and many new startups soon realize that
       their "business venture" must eventually end.

       In the model of perfectly competitive firms, those that consistently cannot make money will "exit," which is a nice,
       bloodless word for a more painful process. When a business fails, after all, workers lose their jobs, investors lose
       their money, and owners and managers can lose their dreams. Many businesses fail. The U.S. Small Business
       Administration indicates that in 2011, 534,907 new firms "entered," and 575,691 firms failed.

       Sometimes a business fails because of poor management or workers who are not very productive, or because of
       tough domestic or foreign competition. Businesses also fail from a variety of causes. For example, conditions of
       demand and supply in the market may shift in an unexpected way, so that the prices that a business charges for
       outputs fall or the prices for inputs rise. With millions of businesses in the U.S. economy, even a small fraction of
       them failing will affect many people--and business failures can be very hard on the workers and managers directly
       involved. However, from the standpoint of the overall economic system, business exits are sometimes a necessary
       evil if a market-oriented system is going to offer a flexible mechanism for satisfying customers, keeping costs low,
       and inventing new products.

      How Entry and Exit Lead to Zero Profits in the Long Run

       No perfectly competitive firm acting alone can affect the market price. However, the combination of many
       firms entering or exiting the market will affect overall supply in the market. In turn, a shift in supply for the
       market as a whole will affect the market price. Entry and exit to and from the market are the driving forces
       behind a process that, in the long run, pushes the price down to minimum average total costs so that all firms

                                                                                                                            8.3 · Entry and Exit Decisions in the Long Run 207

are earning a zero profit.

To understand how short-run profits for a perfectly competitive firm will evaporate in the long run, imagine
the following situation. The market is in long-run equilibrium, where all firms earn zero economic profits
producing the output level where P = MR = MC and P = AC. No firm has the incentive to enter or leave the
market. Let's say that the product's demand increases, and with that, the market price goes up. The existing
firms in the industry are now facing a higher price than before, so they will increase production to the new
output level where P = MR = MC.

This will temporarily make the market price rise above the minimum point on the average cost curve, and
therefore, the existing firms in the market will now be earning economic profits. However, these economic
profits attract other firms to enter the market. Entry of many new firms causes the market supply curve to shift
to the right. As the supply curve shifts to the right, the market price starts decreasing, and with that, economic
profits fall for new and existing firms. As long as there are still profits in the market, entry will continue to shift
supply to the right. This will stop whenever the market price is driven down to the zero-profit level, where no
firm is earning economic profits.

Short-run losses will fade away by reversing this process. Say that the market is in long-run equilibrium. This
time, instead, demand decreases, and with that, the market price starts falling. The existing firms in the
industry are now facing a lower price than before, and as it will be below the average cost curve, they will now
be making economic losses. Some firms will continue producing where the new P = MR = MC, as long as they
are able to cover their average variable costs. Some firms will have to shut down immediately as they will not
be able to cover their average variable costs, and will then only incur their fixed costs, minimizing their losses.
Exit of many firms causes the market supply curve to shift to the left. As the supply curve shifts to the left, the
market price starts rising, and economic losses start to be lower. This process ends whenever the market price
rises to the zero-profit level, where the existing firms are no longer losing money and are at zero profits again.
Thus, while a perfectly competitive firm can earn profits in the short run, in the long run the process of entry
will push down prices until they reach the zero-profit level. Conversely, while a perfectly competitive firm may
earn losses in the short run, firms will not continually lose money. In the long run, firms making losses are
able to escape from their fixed costs, and their exit from the market will push the price back up to the zero-
profit level. In the long run, this process of entry and exit will drive the price in perfectly competitive markets
to the zero-profit point at the bottom of the AC curve, where marginal cost crosses average cost.

The Long-Run Adjustment and Industry Types

Whenever there are expansions in an industry, costs of production for the existing and new firms could either
stay the same, increase, or even decrease. Therefore, we can categorize an industry as being (1) a constant-cost
industry (as demand increases, the cost of production for firms stays the same), (2) an increasing-cost industry
(as demand increases, the cost of production for firms increases), or (3) a decreasing-cost industry (as demand
increases the costs of production for the firms decreases).

For a constant-cost industry, whenever there is an increase in market demand and price, then the supply
curve shifts to the right with new firms' entry and stops at the point where the new long-run equilibrium
intersects at the same market price as before. This is the case of constant returns to scale, which we discussed
earlier in the chapter on Production, Costs, and Industry Structure. However, why will costs remain the same?
In this type of industry, the supply curve is very elastic. Firms can easily supply any quantity that consumers
demand. In addition, there is a perfectly elastic supply of inputs--firms can easily increase their demand for
employees, for example, with no increase to wages. Tying in to our Bring it Home discussion, an increased
demand for ethanol in recent years has caused the demand for corn to increase. Consequently, many farmers
switched from growing wheat to growing corn. Agricultural markets are generally good examples of constant-
cost industries.

For an increasing-cost industry, as the market expands, the old and new firms experience increases in their
208 8 · Perfect Competition

       costs of production, which makes the new zero-profit level intersect at a higher price than before. Here
       companies may have to deal with limited inputs, such as skilled labor. As the demand for these workers rises,
       wages rise and this increases the cost of production for all firms. The industry supply curve in this type of
       industry is more inelastic.
       For a decreasing-cost industry, as the market expands, the old and new firms experience lower costs of
       production, which makes the new zero-profit level intersect at a lower price than before. In this case, the
       industry and all the firms in it are experiencing falling average total costs. This can be due to an improvement
       in technology in the entire industry or an increase in the education of employees. High-tech industries may be
       a good example of a decreasing-cost market.
       Figure 8.8 (a) presents the case of an adjustment process in a constant-cost industry. Whenever there are
       output expansions in this type of industry, the long-run outcome implies more output produced at exactly the
       same original price. Note that supply was able to increase to meet the increased demand. When we join the
       before and after long-run equilibriums, the resulting line is the long run supply (LRS) curve in perfectly
       competitive markets. In this case, it is a flat curve. Figure 8.8 (b) and Figure 8.8 (c) present the cases for an
       increasing-cost and decreasing-cost industry, respectively. For an increasing-cost industry, the LRS is upward
       sloping, while for a decreasing-cost industry, the LRS is downward sloping.

       FIGURE 8.8 Adjustment Process in a Constant-Cost Industry In (a), demand increased and supply met it. Notice
       that the supply increase is equal to the demand increase. The result is that the equilibrium price stays the same as
       quantity sold increases. In (b), notice that sellers were not able to increase supply as much as demand. Some inputs
       were scarce, or wages were rising. The equilibrium price rises. In (c), sellers easily increased supply in response to
       the demand increase. Here, new technology or economies of scale caused the large increase in supply, resulting in
       declining equilibrium price.

     8.4 Efficiency in Perfectly Competitive Markets

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Apply concepts of productive efficiency and allocative efficiency to perfectly competitive markets
         · Compare the model of perfect competition to real-world markets
       When profit-maximizing firms in perfectly competitive markets combine with utility-maximizing consumers,
       something remarkable happens: the resulting quantities of outputs of goods and services demonstrate both
       productive and allocative efficiency (terms that we first introduced in (Choice in a World of Scarcity) .
       Productive efficiency means producing without waste, so that the choice is on the production possibility
       frontier. In the long run in a perfectly competitive market, because of the process of entry and exit, the price in
       the market is equal to the minimum of the long-run average cost curve. In other words, firms produce and sell
       goods at the lowest possible average cost.
       Allocative efficiency means that among the points on the production possibility frontier, the chosen point is

                                                                                                                        8.4 · Efficiency in Perfectly Competitive Markets 209

socially preferred--at least in a particular and specific sense. In a perfectly competitive market, price will be
equal to the marginal cost of production. Think about the price that one pays for a good as a measure of the
social benefit one receives for that good; after all, willingness to pay conveys what the good is worth to a buyer.
Then think about the marginal cost of producing the good as representing not just the cost for the firm, but
more broadly as the social cost of producing that good. When perfectly competitive firms follow the rule that
profits are maximized by producing at the quantity where price is equal to marginal cost, they are thus
ensuring that the social benefits they receive from producing a good are in line with the social costs of
production.

To explore what economists mean by allocative efficiency, it is useful to walk through an example. Begin by
assuming that the market for wholesale flowers is perfectly competitive, and so P = MC. Now, consider what it
would mean if firms in that market produced a lesser quantity of flowers. At a lesser quantity, marginal costs
will not yet have increased as much, so that price will exceed marginal cost; that is, P > MC. In that situation,
the benefit to society as a whole of producing additional goods, as measured by the willingness of consumers
to pay for marginal units of a good, would be higher than the cost of the inputs of labor and physical capital
needed to produce the marginal good. In other words, the gains to society as a whole from producing
additional marginal units will be greater than the costs.

Conversely, consider what it would mean if, compared to the level of output at the allocatively efficient choice
when P = MC, firms produced a greater quantity of flowers. At a greater quantity, marginal costs of production
will have increased so that P < MC. In that case, the marginal costs of producing additional flowers is greater
than the benefit to society as measured by what people are willing to pay. For society as a whole, since the costs
are outstripping the benefits, it will make sense to produce a lower quantity of such goods.

When perfectly competitive firms maximize their profits by producing the quantity where P = MC, they also
assure that the benefits to consumers of what they are buying, as measured by the price they are willing to pay,
is equal to the costs to society of producing the marginal units, as measured by the marginal costs the firm
must pay--and thus that allocative efficiency holds.

We should view the statements that a perfectly competitive market in the long run will feature both productive
and allocative efficiency with a degree of skepticism about its truth. Remember, economists are using the
concept of "efficiency" in a particular and specific sense, not as a synonym for "desirable in every way." For
one thing, consumers' ability to pay reflects the income distribution in a particular society. For example, a
person with a low income may not be able to purchase their own car because they have insufficient income.

Perfect competition, in the long run, is a hypothetical benchmark. For market structures such as monopoly,
monopolistic competition, and oligopoly, which are more frequently observed in the real world than perfect
competition, firms will not always produce at the minimum of average cost, nor will they always set price equal
to marginal cost. Thus, these other competitive situations will not produce productive and allocative efficiency.

Moreover, real-world markets include many issues that are assumed away in the model of perfect competition,
including pollution, inventions of new technology, poverty which may make some people unable to pay for
basic necessities of life, government programs like national defense or education, discrimination in labor
markets, and buyers and sellers who must deal with imperfect and unclear information. We explore these
issues in other chapters. However, the theoretical efficiency of perfect competition does provide a useful
benchmark for comparing the issues that arise from these real-world problems.

       Historically, wheat prices have been higher than corn prices, offsetting wheat's lower yield per acre. However, in
       recent years wheat and corn prices have been converging. In April 2013, Agweek reported the gap was just 71 cents
       per bushel. As the difference in price narrowed, switching to the production of higher yield per acre of corn simply
       made good business sense. Erik Younggren, president of the National Association of Wheat Growers said in the
       Agweek article, "I don't think we're going to see mile after mile of waving amber fields [of wheat] anymore." (Until

Key Concepts and Summary

8.1 Perfect Competition and Why It Matters

A perfectly competitive firm is a price taker, which means that it must accept the equilibrium price at which it
sells goods. If a perfectly competitive firm attempts to charge even a tiny amount more than the market price,
it will be unable to make any sales. In a perfectly competitive market there are thousands of sellers, easy entry,
and identical products. A short-run production period is when firms are producing with some fixed inputs.
Long-run equilibrium in a perfectly competitive industry occurs after all firms have entered and exited the
industry and seller profits are driven to zero.

Perfect competition means that there are many sellers, there is easy entry and exiting of firms, products are
identical from one seller to another, and sellers are price takers.

8.2 How Perfectly Competitive Firms Make Output Decisions

As a perfectly competitive firm produces a greater quantity of output, its total revenue steadily increases at a
constant rate determined by the given market price. Profits will be highest (or losses will be smallest) at the
quantity of output where total revenues exceed total costs by the greatest amount (or where total revenues fall
short of total costs by the smallest amount). Alternatively, profits will be highest where marginal revenue,
which is price for a perfectly competitive firm, is equal to marginal cost. If the market price faced by a perfectly
competitive firm is above average cost at the profit-maximizing quantity of output, then the firm is making
profits. If the market price is below average cost at the profit-maximizing quantity of output, then the firm is
making losses.

If the market price is equal to average cost at the profit-maximizing level of output, then the firm is making
zero profits. We call the point where the marginal cost curve crosses the average cost curve, at the minimum of
the average cost curve, the "zero profit point." If the market price that a perfectly competitive firm faces is
below average variable cost at the profit-maximizing quantity of output, then the firm should shut down
operations immediately. If the market price that a perfectly competitive firm faces is above average variable
cost, but below average cost, then the firm should continue producing in the short run, but exit in the long run.
We call the point where the marginal cost curve crosses the average variable cost curve the shutdown point.

8.3 Entry and Exit Decisions in the Long Run

In the long run, firms will respond to profits through a process of entry, where existing firms expand output
and new firms enter the market. Conversely, firms will react to losses in the long run through a process of exit,
in which existing firms cease production altogether. Through the process of entry in response to profits and
exit in response to losses, the price level in a perfectly competitive market will move toward the zero-profit

point, where the marginal cost curve crosses the AC curve at the minimum of the average cost curve.

The long-run supply curve shows the long-run output supplied by firms in three different types of industries:
constant cost, increasing cost, and decreasing cost.

8.4 Efficiency in Perfectly Competitive Markets

Long-run equilibrium in perfectly competitive markets meets two important conditions: allocative efficiency
and productive efficiency. These two conditions have important implications. First, resources are allocated to
their best alternative use. Second, they provide the maximum satisfaction attainable by society.

Self-Check Questions

 1. Firms in a perfectly competitive market are said to be "price takers"--that is, once the market determines
     an equilibrium price for the product, firms must accept this price. If you sell a product in a perfectly
     competitive market, but you are not happy with its price, would you raise the price, even by a cent?

 2. Would independent trucking fit the characteristics of a perfectly competitive industry?

 3. Look at Table 8.13. What would happen to the firm's profits if the market price increases to $6 per pack of
     raspberries?

FIGURE 9.1 Political Power from a Cotton Monopoly In the mid-nineteenth century, the United States, specifically
the Southern states, had a near monopoly in the cotton that they supplied to Great Britain. These states attempted
to leverage this economic power into political power--trying to sway Great Britain to formally recognize the
Confederate States of America. (Credit: modification of "cotton!" by ashley/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)

Introduction to a Monopoly

         BRING IT HOME

The Rest is History

Many of the opening case studies have focused on current events. This one steps into the past to observe how
monopoly, or near monopolies, have helped shape history. In spring 1773, the East India Company, a firm that, in its
time, was designated "too big to fail," was experiencing financial difficulties. To help shore up the failing firm, the
British Parliament authorized the Tea Act. The act continued the tax on teas and made the East India Company the
sole legal supplier of tea to the American colonies. By November, the citizens of Boston had had enough. They
refused to permit the unloading of tea, citing their main complaint: "No taxation without representation." Several
newspapers, including The Massachusetts Gazette, warned arriving tea-bearing ships, "We are prepared, and shall
not fail to pay them an unwelcome visit by The Mohawks."
218 9 · Monopoly

       Step forward in time to 1860--the eve of the American Civil War--to another near monopoly supplier of historical
       significance: the U.S. cotton industry. At that time, the Southern states provided the majority of the cotton Britain
       imported. The South, wanting to secede from the Union, hoped to leverage Britain's high dependency on its cotton
       into formal diplomatic recognition of the Confederate States of America.

       This leads us to this chapter's topic: a firm that controls all (or nearly all) of the supply of a good or service--a
       monopoly. How do monopoly firms behave in the marketplace? Do they have "power?" Does this power potentially
       have unintended consequences? We'll return to this case at the end of the chapter to see how the tea and cotton
       monopolies influenced U.S. history.

       Many believe that top executives at firms are the strongest supporters of market competition, but this belief is
       far from the truth. Think about it this way: If you very much wanted to win an Olympic gold medal, would you
       rather be far better than everyone else, or locked in competition with many athletes just as good as you?
       Similarly, if you would like to attain a very high level of profits, would you rather manage a business with little
       or no competition, or struggle against many tough competitors who are trying to sell to your customers? By
       now, you might have read the chapter on Perfect Competition. In this chapter, we explore the opposite extreme:
       monopoly.

       If perfect competition is a market where firms have no market power and they simply respond to the market
       price, monopoly is a market with no competition at all, and firms have a great deal of market power. In the case
       of monopoly, one firm produces all of the output in a market. Since a monopoly faces no significant
       competition, it can charge any price it wishes, subject to the demand curve. While a monopoly, by definition,
       refers to a single firm, in practice people often use the term to describe a market in which one firm merely has
       a very high market share. This tends to be the definition that the U.S. Department of Justice uses.

       Even though there are very few true monopolies in existence, we do deal with some of those few every day,
       often without realizing it: The U.S. Postal Service, your electric, and garbage collection companies are a few
       examples. Some new drugs are produced by only one pharmaceutical firm--and no close substitutes for that
       drug may exist.

       From the mid-1990s until 2004, the U.S. Department of Justice prosecuted the Microsoft Corporation for
       including Internet Explorer as the default web browser with its operating system. The Justice Department's
       argument was that, since Microsoft possessed an extremely high market share in the industry for operating
       systems, the inclusion of a free web browser constituted unfair competition to other browsers, such as
       Netscape Navigator. Since nearly everyone was using Windows, including Internet Explorer eliminated the
       incentive for consumers to explore other browsers and made it impossible for competitors to gain a foothold in
       the market. In 2013, the Windows system ran on more than 90% of the most commonly sold personal
       computers. In 2015, a U.S. federal court tossed out antitrust charges that Google had an agreement with mobile
       device makers to set Google as the default search engine.

       This chapter begins by describing how monopolies are protected from competition, including laws that
       prohibit competition, technological advantages, and certain configurations of demand and supply. It then
       discusses how a monopoly will choose its profit-maximizing quantity to produce and what price to charge.
       While a monopoly must be concerned about whether consumers will purchase its products or spend their
       money on something altogether different, the monopolist need not worry about the actions of other competing
       firms producing its products. As a result, a monopoly is not a price taker like a perfectly competitive firm, but
       instead exercises some power to choose its market price.

9.1 How Monopolies Form: Barriers to Entry

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Distinguish between a natural monopoly and a legal monopoly.
  · Explain how economies of scale and the control of natural resources led to the necessary formation of legal

      monopolies
  · Analyze the importance of trademarks and patents in promoting innovation
  · Identify examples of predatory pricing

Because of the lack of competition, monopolies tend to earn significant economic profits. These profits should
attract vigorous competition as we described in Perfect Competition, and yet, because of one particular
characteristic of monopoly, they do not. Barriers to entry are the legal, technological, or market forces that
discourage or prevent potential competitors from entering a market. Barriers to entry can range from the
simple and easily surmountable, such as the cost of renting retail space, to the extremely restrictive. For
example, there are a finite number of radio frequencies available for broadcasting. Once an entrepreneur or
firm has purchased the rights to all of them, no new competitors can enter the market.

In some cases, barriers to entry may lead to monopoly. In other cases, they may limit competition to a few
firms. Barriers may block entry even if the firm or firms currently in the market are earning profits. Thus, in
markets with significant barriers to entry, it is not necessarily true that abnormally high profits will attract new
firms, and that this entry of new firms will eventually cause the price to decline so that surviving firms earn
only a normal level of profit in the long run.

There are five types of monopoly, based on the types of barriers to entry they exploit.

Natural Monopoly

Economies of scale can combine with the size of the market to limit competition. (We introduced this theme in
Production, Cost and Industry Structure). Figure 9.2 presents a long-run average cost curve for the airplane
manufacturing industry. It shows economies of scale up to an output of 8,000 planes per year and a price of P0,
then constant returns to scale from 8,000 to 20,000 planes per year, and diseconomies of scale at a quantity of
production greater than 20,000 planes per year.

Now consider the market demand curve in the diagram, which intersects the long-run average cost (LRAC)
curve at an output level of 5,000 planes per year and at a price P1, which is higher than P0. In this situation, the
market has room for only one producer. If a second firm attempts to enter the market at a smaller size, say by
producing a quantity of 4,000 planes, then its average costs will be higher than those of the existing firm, and it
will be unable to compete. If the second firm attempts to enter the market at a larger size, like 8,000 planes per
year, then it could produce at a lower average cost--but it could not sell all 8,000 planes that it produced
because of insufficient demand in the market.
220 9 · Monopoly

       FIGURE 9.2 Economies of Scale and Natural Monopoly In this market, the demand curve intersects the long-run
       average cost (LRAC) curve at its downward-sloping part. A natural monopoly occurs when the quantity demanded is
       less than the minimum quantity it takes to be at the bottom of the long-run average cost curve.
       Economists call this situation, when economies of scale are large relative to the quantity demanded in the
       market, a natural monopoly. Natural monopolies often arise in industries where the marginal cost of adding an
       additional customer is very low, once the fixed costs of the overall system are in place. This results in situations
       where there are substantial economies of scale. For example, once a water company lays the main water pipes
       through a neighborhood, the marginal cost of providing water service to another home is fairly low. Once the
       electric company installs lines in a new subdivision, the marginal cost of providing additional electrical service
       to one more home is minimal. It would be costly and duplicative for a second water company to enter the
       market and invest in a whole second set of main water pipes, or for a second electricity company to enter the
       market and invest in a whole new set of electrical wires. These industries offer an example where, because of
       economies of scale, one producer can serve the entire market more efficiently than a number of smaller
       producers that would need to make duplicate physical capital investments.
       A natural monopoly can also arise in smaller local markets for products that are difficult to transport. For
       example, cement production exhibits economies of scale, and the quantity of cement demanded in a local area
       may not be much larger than what a single plant can produce. Moreover, the costs of transporting cement over
       land are high, and so a cement plant in an area without access to water transportation may be a natural
       monopoly.

      Control of a Physical Resource

       Another type of monopoly occurs when a company has control of a scarce physical resource. In the U.S.
       economy, one historical example of this pattern occurred when ALCOA--the Aluminum Company of
       America--controlled most of the supply of bauxite, a key mineral used in making aluminum. Back in the
       1930s, when ALCOA controlled most of the bauxite, other firms were simply unable to produce enough
       aluminum to compete.
       As another example, the majority of global diamond production is controlled by DeBeers, a multi-national
       company that has mining and production operations in South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, and Canada. It also
       has exploration activities on four continents, while directing a worldwide distribution network of rough cut
       diamonds. Although in recent years they have experienced growing competition, their impact on the rough

diamond market is still considerable.

Legal Monopoly

For some products, the government erects barriers to entry by prohibiting or limiting competition. Under U.S.
law, no organization but the U.S. Postal Service is legally allowed to deliver first-class mail. Many states or cities
have laws or regulations that allow households a choice of only one electric company, one water company, and
one company to pick up the garbage. Most legal monopolies are utilities--products necessary for everyday
life--that are socially beneficial. As a consequence, the government allows producers to become regulated
monopolies, to ensure that customers have access to an appropriate amount of these products or services.
Additionally, legal monopolies are often subject to economies of scale, so it makes sense to allow only one
provider.

Promoting Innovation

Innovation takes time and resources to achieve. Suppose a company invests in research and development and
finds the cure for the common cold. In this world of near ubiquitous information, other companies could take
the formula, produce the drug, and because they did not incur the costs of research and development (R&D),
undercut the price of the company that discovered the drug. Given this possibility, many firms would choose
not to invest in research and development, and as a result, the world would have less innovation. To prevent
this from happening, the Constitution of the United States specifies in Article I, Section 8: "The Congress shall
have Power . . . to Promote the Progress of Science and Useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors
and Inventors the Exclusive Right to their Writings and Discoveries." Congress used this power to create the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, as well as the U.S. Copyright Office. A patent gives the inventor the exclusive
legal right to make, use, or sell the invention for a limited time. In the United States, exclusive patent rights last
for 20 years. The idea is to provide limited monopoly power so that innovative firms can recoup their
investment in R&D, but then to allow other firms to produce the product more cheaply once the patent expires.

A trademark is an identifying symbol or name for a particular good, like Chiquita bananas, Chevrolet cars, or
the Nike "swoosh" that appears on shoes and athletic gear. Between 2003 and 2019, roughly 6.8 million
trademarks were registered with the U.S. government. A firm can renew a trademark repeatedly, as long as it
remains in active use.

A copyright, according to the U.S. Copyright Office, "is a form of protection provided by the laws of the United
States for `original works of authorship' including literary, dramatic, musical, architectural, cartographic,
choreographic, pantomimic, pictorial, graphic, sculptural, and audiovisual creations." No one can reproduce,
display, or perform a copyrighted work without the author's permission. Copyright protection ordinarily lasts
for the life of the author plus 70 years.

Roughly speaking, patent law covers inventions and copyright protects books, songs, and art. However, in
certain areas, like the invention of new software, it has been unclear whether patent or copyright protection
should apply. There is also a body of law known as trade secrets. Even if a company does not have a patent on
an invention, competing firms are not allowed to steal their secrets. One famous trade secret is the formula for
Coca-Cola, which is not protected under copyright or patent law, but is simply kept secret by the company.

Taken together, we call this combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secret law intellectual
property, because it implies ownership over an idea, concept, or image, not a physical piece of property like a
house or a car. Countries around the world have enacted laws to protect intellectual property, although the
time periods and exact provisions of such laws vary across countries. There are ongoing negotiations, both
through the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and through international treaties, to bring
greater harmony to the intellectual property laws of different countries to determine the extent to which those
in other countries will respect patents and copyrights of those in other countries.

Government limitations on competition used to be more common in the United States. For most of the
222 9 · Monopoly

       twentieth century, only one phone company--AT&T--was legally allowed to provide local and long distance
       service. From the 1930s to the 1970s, one set of federal regulations limited which destinations airlines could
       choose to fly to and what fares they could charge. Another set of regulations limited the interest rates that
       banks could pay to depositors; yet another specified how much trucking firms could charge customers.

       What products we consider utilities depends, in part, on the available technology. Fifty years ago, telephone
       companies provided local and long distance service over wires. It did not make much sense to have many
       companies building multiple wiring systems across towns and the entire country. AT&T lost its monopoly on
       long distance service when the technology for providing phone service changed from wires to microwave and
       satellite transmission, so that multiple firms could use the same transmission mechanism. The same thing
       happened to local service, especially in recent years, with the growth in cellular phone systems.

       The combination of improvements in production technologies and a general sense that the markets could
       provide services adequately led to a wave of deregulation, starting in the late 1970s and continuing into the
       1990s. This wave eliminated or reduced government restrictions on the firms that could enter, the prices that
       they could charge, and the quantities that many industries could produce, including telecommunications,
       airlines, trucking, banking, and electricity.

       Around the world, from Europe to Latin America to Africa and Asia, many governments continue to control
       and limit competition in what those governments perceive to be key industries, including airlines, banks, steel
       companies, oil companies, and telephone companies.

      Intimidating Potential Competition

       Businesses have developed a number of schemes for creating barriers to entry by deterring potential
       competitors from entering the market. One method is known as predatory pricing, in which a firm uses the
       threat of sharp price cuts to discourage competition. Predatory pricing is a violation of U.S. antitrust law, but it
       is difficult to prove.

       Consider a large airline that provides most of the flights between two particular cities. A new, small start-up
       airline decides to offer service between these two cities. The large airline immediately slashes prices on this
       route to the bone, so that the new entrant cannot make any money. After the new entrant has gone out of
       business, the incumbent firm can raise prices again.

       After the company repeats this pattern once or twice, potential new entrants may decide that it is not wise to
       try to compete. Small airlines often accuse larger airlines of predatory pricing: in the early 2000s, for example,
       ValuJet accused Delta of predatory pricing, Frontier accused United, and Reno Air accused Northwest. In 2015,
       the Justice Department ruled against American Express and Mastercard for imposing restrictions on retailers
       that encouraged customers to use lower swipe fees on credit transactions.

       In some cases, large advertising budgets can also act as a way of discouraging the competition. If the only way
       to launch a successful new national cola drink is to spend more than the promotional budgets of Coca-Cola and
       Pepsi Cola, not too many companies will try. A firmly established brand name can be difficult to dislodge.

      Summing Up Barriers to Entry

       Table 9.1 lists the barriers to entry that we have discussed. This list is not exhaustive, since firms have proved
       to be highly creative in inventing business practices that discourage competition. When barriers to entry exist,
       perfect competition is no longer a reasonable description of how an industry works. When barriers to entry are
       high enough, monopoly can result.

9.2 How a Profit-Maximizing Monopoly Chooses Output and Price

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Explain the perceived demand curve for a perfect competitor and a monopoly
  · Analyze a demand curve for a monopoly and determine the output that maximizes profit and revenue
  · Calculate marginal revenue and marginal cost
  · Explain allocative efficiency as it pertains to the efficiency of a monopoly

Consider a monopoly firm, comfortably surrounded by barriers to entry so that it need not fear competition
from other producers. How will this monopoly choose its profit-maximizing quantity of output, and what price
will it charge? Profits for the monopolist, like any firm, will be equal to total revenues minus total costs. We can
analyze the pattern of costs for the monopoly within the same framework as the costs of a perfectly
competitive firm--that is, by using total cost, fixed cost, variable cost, marginal cost, average cost, and average
variable cost. However, because a monopoly faces no competition, its situation and its decision process will
differ from that of a perfectly competitive firm. (The Clear It Up feature discusses how hard it is sometimes to
define "market" in a monopoly situation.)

Demand Curves Perceived by a Perfectly Competitive Firm and by a Monopoly

A perfectly competitive firm acts as a price taker, so we calculate total revenue taking the given market price
and multiplying it by the quantity of output that the firm chooses. The demand curve as it is perceived by a
perfectly competitive firm appears in Figure 9.3 (a). The flat perceived demand curve means that, from the
viewpoint of the perfectly competitive firm, it could sell either a relatively low quantity like Ql or a relatively
high quantity like Qh at the market price P.
224 9 · Monopoly

       FIGURE 9.3 The Perceived Demand Curve for a Perfect Competitor and a Monopolist (a) A perfectly competitive
       firm perceives the demand curve that it faces to be flat. The flat shape means that the firm can sell either a low
       quantity (Ql) or a high quantity (Qh) at exactly the same price (P). (b) A monopolist perceives the demand curve that
       it faces to be the same as the market demand curve, which for most goods is downward-sloping. Thus, if the
       monopolist chooses a high level of output (Qh), it can charge only a relatively low price (PI). Conversely, if the
       monopolist chooses a low level of output (Ql), it can then charge a higher price (Ph). The challenge for the
       monopolist is to choose the combination of price and quantity that maximizes profits.

                CLEAR IT UP
      What defines the market?

       A monopoly is a firm that sells all or nearly all of the goods and services in a given market. However, what defines
       the "market"?
       In a famous 1947 case, the federal government accused the DuPont company of having a monopoly in the
       cellophane market, pointing out that DuPont produced 75% of the cellophane in the United States. DuPont
       countered that even though it had a 75% market share in cellophane, it had less than a 20% share of the "flexible
       packaging materials," which includes all other moisture-proof papers, films, and foils. In 1956, after years of legal
       appeals, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the broader market definition was more appropriate, and it dismissed the
       case against DuPont.
       Questions over how to define the market continue today. True, Microsoft in the 1990s had a dominant share of the
       software for computer operating systems, but in the total market for all computer software and services, including
       everything from games to scientific programs, the Microsoft share was only about 14% in 2014. The Greyhound bus
       company may have a near-monopoly on the market for intercity bus transportation, but it is only a small share of the
       market for intercity transportation if that market includes private cars, airplanes, and railroad service. DeBeers has a
       monopoly in diamonds, but it is a much smaller share of the total market for precious gemstones and an even
       smaller share of the total market for jewelry. A small town in the country may have only one gas station: is this gas
       station a "monopoly," or does it compete with gas stations that might be five, 10, or 50 miles away?
       In general, if a firm produces a product without close substitutes, then we can consider the firm a monopoly
       producer in a single market. However, if buyers have a range of similar--even if not identical--options available from
       other firms, then the firm is not a monopoly. Still, arguments over whether substitutes are close or not close can be
       controversial.

       While a monopolist can charge any price for its product, nonetheless the demand for the firm's product
       constrains the price. No monopolist, even one that is thoroughly protected by high barriers to entry, can

require consumers to purchase its product. Because the monopolist is the only firm in the market, its demand
curve is the same as the market demand curve, which is, unlike that for a perfectly competitive firm,
downward-sloping.
Figure 9.3 illustrates this situation. The monopolist can either choose a point like R with a low price (Pl) and
high quantity (Qh), or a point like S with a high price (Ph) and a low quantity (Ql), or some intermediate point.
Setting the price too high will result in a low quantity sold, and will not bring in much revenue. Conversely,
setting the price too low may result in a high quantity sold, but because of the low price, it will not bring in
much revenue either. The challenge for the monopolist is to strike a profit-maximizing balance between the
price it charges and the quantity that it sells. However, why isn't the perfectly competitive firm's demand curve
also the market demand curve? See the following Clear It Up feature for the answer to this question.

         CLEAR IT UP
What is the difference between perceived demand and market demand?

The demand curve as perceived by a perfectly competitive firm is not the overall market demand curve for that
product. However, the firm's demand curve as perceived by a monopoly is the same as the market demand curve.
The reason for the difference is that each perfectly competitive firm perceives the demand for its products in a
market that includes many other firms. In effect, the demand curve perceived by a perfectly competitive firm is a
tiny slice of the entire market demand curve. In contrast, a monopoly perceives demand for its product in a market
where the monopoly is the only producer.

Total Cost and Total Revenue for a Monopolist

We can illustrate profits for a monopolist with a graph of total revenues and total costs, with the example of the
hypothetical HealthPill firm in Figure 9.4. The total cost curve has its typical shape that we learned about in
Production, Costs and Industry Structure, and that we used in Perfect Competition; that is, total costs rise and
the curve grows steeper as output increases, as the final column of Table 9.2 shows.

FIGURE 9.4 Total Revenue and Total Cost for the HealthPill Monopoly Total revenue for the monopoly firm called
HealthPill first rises, then falls. Low levels of output bring in relatively little total revenue, because the quantity is
low. High levels of output bring in relatively less revenue, because the high quantity pushes down the market price.
The total cost curve is upward-sloping. Profits will be highest at the quantity of output where total revenue is most
above total cost. The profit-maximizing level of output is not the same as the revenue-maximizing level of output,
which should make sense, because profits take costs into account and revenues do not.

                                 HealthPill

Total revenue, though, is different. Since a monopolist faces a downward sloping demand curve, the only way it
can sell more output is by reducing its price. Selling more output raises revenue, but lowering price reduces it.
Thus, the shape of total revenue isn't clear. Let's explore this using the data in Table 9.2, which shows
quantities along the demand curve and the price at each quantity demanded, and then calculates total revenue
by multiplying price times quantity at each level of output. (In this example, we give the output as 1, 2, 3, 4, and
so on, for the sake of simplicity. If you prefer a dash of greater realism, you can imagine that the
pharmaceutical company measures these output levels and the corresponding prices per 1,000 or 10,000
pills.) As the figure illustrates, total revenue for a monopolist has the shape of a hill, first rising, next flattening
out, and then falling. In this example, total revenue is highest at a quantity of 6 or 7.

However, the monopolist is not seeking to maximize revenue, but instead to earn the highest possible profit. In
the HealthPill example in Figure 9.4, the highest profit will occur at the quantity where total revenue is the
farthest above total cost. This looks to be somewhere in the middle of the graph, but where exactly? It is easier
to see the profit maximizing level of output by using the marginal approach, to which we turn next.

Marginal Revenue and Marginal Cost for a Monopolist

In the real world, a monopolist often does not have enough information to analyze its entire total revenues or
total costs curves. After all, the firm does not know exactly what would happen if it were to alter production
dramatically. However, a monopolist often has fairly reliable information about how changing output by small
or moderate amounts will affect its marginal revenues and marginal costs, because it has had experience with
such changes over time and because modest changes are easier to extrapolate from current experience. A
monopolist can use information on marginal revenue and marginal cost to seek out the profit-maximizing
combination of quantity and price.

Table 9.3 expands Table 9.2 using the figures on total costs and total revenues from the HealthPill example to
calculate marginal revenue and marginal cost. This monopoly faces typical upward-sloping marginal cost and
downward-sloping marginal revenue curves, as Figure 9.5 shows.

Notice that marginal revenue is zero at a quantity of 7, and turns negative at quantities higher than 7. It may
seem counterintuitive that marginal revenue could ever be zero or negative: after all, doesn't an increase in
quantity sold not always mean more revenue? For a perfect competitor, each additional unit sold brought a

positive marginal revenue, because marginal revenue was equal to the given market price. However, a
monopolist can sell a larger quantity and see a decline in total revenue. When a monopolist increases sales by
one unit, it gains some marginal revenue from selling that extra unit, but also loses some marginal revenue
because it must now sell every other unit at a lower price. As the quantity sold becomes higher, at some point
the drop in price is proportionally more than the increase in greater quantity of sales, causing a situation
where more sales bring in less revenue. In other words, marginal revenue is negative.

FIGURE 9.5 Marginal Revenue and Marginal Cost for the HealthPill Monopoly For a monopoly like HealthPill,
marginal revenue decreases as it sells additional units of output. The marginal cost curve is upward-sloping. The
profit-maximizing choice for the monopoly will be to produce at the quantity where marginal revenue is equal to
marginal cost: that is, MR = MC. If the monopoly produces a lower quantity, then MR > MC at those levels of output,
and the firm can make higher profits by expanding output. If the firm produces at a greater quantity, then MC > MR,
and the firm can make higher profits by reducing its quantity of output.

TABLE 9.3 Costs and Revenues of HealthPill

A monopolist can determine its profit-maximizing price and quantity by analyzing the marginal revenue and
marginal costs of producing an extra unit. If the marginal revenue exceeds the marginal cost, then the firm
should produce the extra unit.

For example, at an output of 4 in Figure 9.5, marginal revenue is 600 and marginal cost is 250, so producing
this unit will clearly add to overall profits. At an output of 5, marginal revenue is 400 and marginal cost is 400,
228 9 · Monopoly

       so producing this unit still means overall profits are unchanged. However, expanding output from 5 to 6 would
       involve a marginal revenue of 200 and a marginal cost of 850, so that sixth unit would actually reduce profits.
       Thus, the monopoly can tell from the marginal revenue and marginal cost that of the choices in the table, the
       profit-maximizing level of output is 5.
       The monopoly could seek out the profit-maximizing level of output by increasing quantity by a small amount,
       calculating marginal revenue and marginal cost, and then either increasing output as long as marginal
       revenue exceeds marginal cost or reducing output if marginal cost exceeds marginal revenue. This process
       works without any need to calculate total revenue and total cost. Thus, a profit-maximizing monopoly should
       follow the rule of producing up to the quantity where marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost--that is, MR =
       MC. This quantity is easy to identify graphically, where MR and MC intersect.

                                                                                                                WORK IT OUT

        Maximizing Profits

         If you find it counterintuitive that producing where marginal revenue equals marginal cost will maximize profits,
         working through the numbers will help.
         Step 1. Remember, we define marginal cost as the change in total cost from producing a small amount of
         additional output.

         Step 2. Note that in Table 9.3, as output increases from 1 to 2 units, total cost increases from $500 to $775. As a
         result, the marginal cost of the second unit will be:

         Step 3. Remember that, similarly, marginal revenue is the change in total revenue from selling a small amount of
         additional output.

         Step 4. Note that in Table 9.3, as output increases from 1 to 2 units, total revenue increases from $1200 to
         $2200. As a result, the marginal revenue of the second unit will be:

TABLE 9.4 Marginal Revenue, Marginal Cost, Marginal and Total Profit

Table 9.4 repeats the marginal cost and marginal revenue data from Table 9.3, and adds two more columns:
Marginal profit is the profitability of each additional unit sold. We define it as marginal revenue minus marginal
cost. Finally, total profit is the sum of marginal profits. As long as marginal profit is positive, producing more
output will increase total profits. When marginal profit turns negative, producing more output will decrease total
profits. Total profit is maximized where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. In this example, maximum profit
occurs at 5 units of output.

A perfectly competitive firm will also find its profit-maximizing level of output where MR = MC. The key difference
with a perfectly competitive firm is that in the case of perfect competition, marginal revenue is equal to price (MR
= P), while for a monopolist, marginal revenue is not equal to the price, because changes in quantity of output
affect the price.

Illustrating Monopoly Profits

It is straightforward to calculate profits of given numbers for total revenue and total cost. However, the size of
monopoly profits can also be illustrated graphically with Figure 9.6, which takes the marginal cost and
marginal revenue curves from the previous exhibit and adds an average cost curve and the monopolist's
perceived demand curve. Table 9.5 shows the data for these curves.

FIGURE 9.6 Illustrating Profits at the HealthPill Monopoly This figure begins with the same marginal revenue and
marginal cost curves from the HealthPill monopoly from Figure 9.5. It then adds an average cost curve and the
demand curve that the monopolist faces. The HealthPill firm first chooses the quantity where MR = MC. In this
example, the quantity is 5. The monopolist then decides what price to charge by looking at the demand curve it
faces. The large box, with quantity on the horizontal axis and demand (which shows the price) on the vertical axis,
shows total revenue for the firm. The lighter-shaded box, which is quantity on the horizontal axis and average cost of
production on the vertical axis shows the firm's total costs. The large total revenue box minus the smaller total cost
box leaves the darkly shaded box that shows total profits. Since the price charged is above average cost, the firm is
earning positive profits.

Figure 9.7 illustrates the three-step process where a monopolist: selects the profit-maximizing quantity to
produce; decides what price to charge; determines total revenue, total cost, and profit.

Step 1: The Monopolist Determines Its Profit-Maximizing Level of Output

The firm can use the points on the demand curve D to calculate total revenue, and then, based on total
revenue, calculate its marginal revenue curve. The profit-maximizing quantity will occur where MR = MC--or at
the last possible point before marginal costs start exceeding marginal revenue. On Figure 9.6, MR = MC occurs
at an output of 5.

Step 2: The Monopolist Decides What Price to Charge

The monopolist will charge what the market is willing to pay. A dotted line drawn straight up from the profit-
maximizing quantity to the demand curve shows the profit-maximizing price which, in Figure 9.6, is $800.
This price is above the average cost curve, which shows that the firm is earning profits.

Total revenue is the overall shaded box, where the width of the box is the quantity sold and the height is the
price. In Figure 9.6, this is 5 x $800 = $4000. In Figure 9.6, the bottom part of the shaded box, which is shaded
more lightly, shows total costs; that is, quantity on the horizontal axis multiplied by average cost on the vertical
axis or 5 x $330 = $1650. The larger box of total revenues minus the smaller box of total costs will equal profits,
which the darkly shaded box shows. Using the numbers gives $4000 - $1650 = $2350. In a perfectly
competitive market, the forces of entry would erode this profit in the long run. However, a monopolist is
protected by barriers to entry. In fact, one obvious sign of a possible monopoly is when a firm earns profits
year after year, while doing more or less the same thing, without ever seeing increased competition eroding
those profits.

FIGURE 9.7 How a Profit-Maximizing Monopoly Decides Price In Step 1, the monopoly chooses the profit-
maximizing level of output Q1, by choosing the quantity where MR = MC. In Step 2, the monopoly decides how much
to charge for output level Q1 by drawing a line straight up from Q1 to point R on its perceived demand curve. Thus,
the monopoly will charge a price (P1). In Step 3, the monopoly identifies its profit. Total revenue will be Q1
multiplied by P1. Total cost will be Q1 multiplied by the average cost of producing Q1, which point S shows on the
average cost curve to be P2. Profits will be the total revenue rectangle minus the total cost rectangle, which the
shaded zone in the figure shows.

         CLEAR IT UP
Why is a monopolist's marginal revenue always less than the price?

The marginal revenue curve for a monopolist always lies beneath the market demand curve. To understand why,
think about increasing the quantity along the demand curve by one unit, so that you take one step down the demand
curve to a slightly higher quantity but a slightly lower price. A demand curve is not sequential: It is not that first we
sell Q1 at a higher price, and then we sell Q2 at a lower price. Rather, a demand curve is conditional: If we charge the
higher price, we would sell Q1. If, instead, we charge a lower price (on all the units that we sell), we would sell Q2.
When we think about increasing the quantity sold by one unit, marginal revenue is affected in two ways. First, we
sell one additional unit at the new market price. Second, all the previous units, which we sold at the higher price,
now sell for less. Because of the lower price on all units sold, the marginal revenue of selling a unit is less than the
price of that unit--and the marginal revenue curve is below the demand curve. Tip: For a straight-line demand curve,
MR and demand have the same vertical intercept. As output increases, marginal revenue decreases twice as fast as
demand, so that the horizontal intercept of MR is halfway to the horizontal intercept of demand. You can see this in
the Figure 9.8.
232 9 · Monopoly

       FIGURE 9.8 The Monopolist's Marginal Revenue Curve versus Demand Curve Because the market demand curve is
       conditional, the marginal revenue curve for a monopolist lies beneath the demand curve.

      The Inefficiency of Monopoly

       Most people criticize monopolies because they charge too high a price, but what economists object to is that
       monopolies do not supply enough output to be allocatively efficient. To understand why a monopoly is
       inefficient, it is useful to compare it with the benchmark model of perfect competition.
       Allocative efficiency is an economic concept regarding efficiency at the social or societal level. It refers to
       producing the optimal quantity of some output, the quantity where the marginal benefit to society of one more
       unit just equals the marginal cost. The rule of profit maximization in a world of perfect competition was for
       each firm to produce the quantity of output where P = MC, where the price (P) is a measure of how much buyers
       value the good and the marginal cost (MC) is a measure of what marginal units cost society to produce.
       Following this rule assures allocative efficiency. If P > MC, then the marginal benefit to society (as measured by
       P) is greater than the marginal cost to society of producing additional units, and a greater quantity should be
       produced. However, in the case of monopoly, price is always greater than marginal cost at the profit-
       maximizing level of output, as you can see by looking back at Figure 9.6. Thus, consumers do not benefit from
       a monopoly because it will sell a lower quantity in the market, at a higher price, than would have been the case
       in a perfectly competitive market.
       The problem of inefficiency for monopolies often runs even deeper than these issues, and also involves
       incentives for efficiency over longer periods of time. There are counterbalancing incentives here. On one side,
       firms may strive for new inventions and new intellectual property because they want to become monopolies
       and earn high profits--at least for a few years until the competition catches up. In this way, monopolies may
       come to exist because of competitive pressures on firms. However, once a barrier to entry is in place, a
       monopoly that does not need to fear competition can just produce the same old products in the same old
       way--while still ringing up a healthy rate of profit. John Hicks, who won the Nobel Prize for economics in 1972,
       wrote in 1935: "The best of all monopoly profits is a quiet life." He did not mean the comment in a
       complimentary way. He meant that monopolies may bank their profits and slack off on trying to please their
       customers.
       When AT&T provided all of the local and long-distance phone service in the United States, along with
       manufacturing most of the phone equipment, the payment plans and types of phones did not change much.
       The old joke was that you could have any color phone you wanted, as long as it was black. However, in 1982,
       government litigation split up AT&T into a number of local phone companies, a long-distance phone company,
       and a phone equipment manufacturer. An explosion of innovation followed. Services like call waiting, caller ID,
       three-way calling, voice mail through the phone company, mobile phones, and wireless connections to the

internet all became available. Companies offered a wide range of payment plans, as well. It was no longer true
that all phones were black. Instead, phones came in a wide variety of shapes and colors. The end of the
telephone monopoly brought lower prices, a greater quantity of services, and also a wave of innovation aimed
at attracting and pleasing customers.

The Rest is History

In the opening case, we presented the East India Company and the Confederate States as a monopoly or near
monopoly provider of a good. Nearly every American schoolchild knows the result of the "unwelcome visit" the
"Mohawks" bestowed upon Boston Harbor's tea-bearing ships--the Boston Tea Party. Regarding the cotton industry,
we also know Great Britain remained neutral during the Civil War, taking neither side during the conflict.

Did the monopoly nature of these business have unintended and historical consequences? Might the American
Revolution have been deterred, if the East India Company had sailed the tea-bearing ships back to England? Might
the southern states have made different decisions had they not been so confident "King Cotton" would force
diplomatic recognition of the Confederate States of America? Of course, it is not possible to definitively answer
these questions. We cannot roll back the clock and try a different scenario. We can, however, consider the monopoly
nature of these businesses and the roles they played and hypothesize about what might have occurred under
different circumstances.

Perhaps if there had been legal free tea trade, the colonists would have seen things differently. There was smuggled
Dutch tea in the colonial market. If the colonists had been able to freely purchase Dutch tea, they would have paid
lower prices and avoided the tax.

What about the cotton monopoly? With one in five jobs in Great Britain depending on Southern cotton and the
Confederate States as nearly the sole provider of that cotton, why did Great Britain remain neutral during the Civil
War? At the beginning of the war, Britain simply drew down massive stores of cotton. These stockpiles lasted until
near the end of 1862. Why did Britain not recognize the Confederacy at that point? Two reasons: The Emancipation
Proclamation and new sources of cotton. Having outlawed slavery throughout the United Kingdom in 1833, it was
politically impossible for Great Britain, empty cotton warehouses or not, to recognize, diplomatically, the
Confederate States. In addition, during the two years it took to draw down the stockpiles, Britain expanded cotton
imports from India, Egypt, and Brazil.

Monopoly sellers often see no threats to their superior marketplace position. In these examples did the power of the
monopoly hide other possibilities from the decision makers? Perhaps. As a result of their actions, this is how history
unfolded.

Key Concepts and Summary

9.1 How Monopolies Form: Barriers to Entry

Barriers to entry prevent or discourage competitors from entering the market. These barriers include:
economies of scale that lead to natural monopoly; control of a physical resource; legal restrictions on
competition; patent, trademark and copyright protection; and practices to intimidate the competition like
predatory pricing. Intellectual property refers to legally guaranteed ownership of an idea, rather than a
physical item. The laws that protect intellectual property include patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade
secrets. A natural monopoly arises when economies of scale persist over a large enough range of output that if
one firm supplies the entire market, no other firm can enter without facing a cost disadvantage.

9.2 How a Profit-Maximizing Monopoly Chooses Output and Price

A monopolist is not a price taker, because when it decides what quantity to produce, it also determines the
market price. For a monopolist, total revenue is relatively low at low quantities of output, because it is not
selling much. Total revenue is also relatively low at very high quantities of output, because a very high quantity
will sell only at a low price. Thus, total revenue for a monopolist will start low, rise, and then decline. The
marginal revenue for a monopolist from selling additional units will decline. Each additional unit a monopolist
sells will push down the overall market price, and as it sells more units, this lower price applies to increasingly
more units.

The monopolist will select the profit-maximizing level of output where MR = MC, and then charge the price for
that quantity of output as determined by the market demand curve. If that price is above average cost, the
monopolist earns positive profits.

Monopolists are not productively efficient, because they do not produce at the minimum of the average cost
curve. Monopolists are not allocatively efficient, because they do not produce at the quantity where P = MC. As
a result, monopolists produce less, at a higher average cost, and charge a higher price than would a
combination of firms in a perfectly competitive industry. Monopolists also may lack incentives for innovation,

26. Why are generic pharmaceuticals significantly cheaper than name brand ones?

27. For many years, the Justice Department has tried to break up large firms like IBM, Microsoft, and most

28. Intellectual property laws are intended to promote innovation, but some economists, such as Michele

29. Imagine that you are managing a small firm and thinking about entering the market of a monopolist. The

      what the new firm's average cost of producing output would be. If the incumbent continues to produce
      6,000 units, how much output would the two firms supply to the market? Estimate what would happen to
      the market price as a result of the supply of both the incumbent firm and the new entrant. Approximately
      how much profit would each firm earn?

Introduction to Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly

         BRING IT HOME
The Temptation to Defy the Law

Laundry detergent and bags of ice--products of industries that seem pretty mundane, maybe even boring. Hardly!
Both have been the center of clandestine meetings and secret deals worthy of a spy novel. In France, between 1997
and 2004, the top four laundry detergent producers (Proctor & Gamble, Henkel, Unilever, and Colgate-Palmolive)
controlled about 90 percent of the French soap market. Officials from the soap firms were meeting secretly, in out-
of-the-way, small cafés around Paris. Their goals: Stamp out competition and set prices.
Around the same time, the top five Midwest ice makers (Home City Ice, Lang Ice, Tinley Ice, Sisler's Dairy, and
Products of Ohio) had similar goals in mind when they secretly agreed to divide up the bagged ice market.
If both groups could meet their goals, it would enable each to act as though they were a single firm--in essence, a
240 10 · Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly

       monopoly--and enjoy monopoly-size profits. The problem? In many parts of the world, including the European Union
       and the United States, it is illegal for firms to divide markets and set prices collaboratively.

       These two cases provide examples of markets that are characterized neither as perfect competition nor monopoly.
       Instead, these firms are competing in market structures that lie between the extremes of monopoly and perfect
       competition. How do they behave? Why do they exist? We will revisit this case later, to find out what happened.

       Perfect competition and monopoly are at opposite ends of the competition spectrum. A perfectly competitive
       market has many firms selling identical products, who all act as price takers in the face of the competition. If
       you recall, price takers are firms that have no market power. They simply have to take the market price as
       given.

       Monopoly arises when a single firm sells a product for which there are no close substitutes. We consider
       Microsoft, for instance, as a monopoly because it dominates the operating systems market.

       What about the vast majority of real world firms and organizations that fall between these extremes, firms that
       we could describe as imperfectly competitive? What determines their behavior? They have more influence
       over the price they charge than perfectly competitive firms, but not as much as a monopoly. What will they do?

       One type of imperfectly competitive market is monopolistic competition. Monopolistically competitive
       markets feature a large number of competing firms, but the products that they sell are not identical. Consider,
       as an example, the Mall of America in Minnesota, the largest shopping mall in the United States. In 2010, the
       Mall of America had 24 stores that sold women's "ready-to-wear" clothing (like Ann Taylor and Urban
       Outfitters), another 50 stores that sold clothing for both men and women (like Banana Republic, J. Crew, and
       Nordstrom's), plus 14 more stores that sold women's specialty clothing (like Motherhood Maternity and
       Victoria's Secret). Most of the markets that consumers encounter at the retail level are monopolistically
       competitive.

       The other type of imperfectly competitive market is oligopoly. Oligopolistic markets are those which a small
       number of firms dominate. Commercial aircraft provides a good example: Boeing and Airbus each produce
       slightly less than 50% of the large commercial aircraft in the world. Another example is the U.S. soft drink
       industry, which Coca-Cola and Pepsi dominate. We characterize oligopolies by high barriers to entry with firms
       choosing output, pricing, and other decisions strategically based on the decisions of the other firms in the
       market. In this chapter, we first explore how monopolistically competitive firms will choose their profit-
       maximizing level of output. We will then discuss oligopolistic firms, which face two conflicting temptations: to
       collaborate as if they were a single monopoly, or to individually compete to gain profits by expanding output
       levels and cutting prices. Oligopolistic markets and firms can also take on elements of monopoly and of perfect
       competition.

     10.1 Monopolistic Competition

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain the significance of differentiated products
         · Describe how a monopolistic competitor chooses price and quantity
         · Discuss entry, exit, and efficiency as they pertain to monopolistic competition
         · Analyze how advertising can impact monopolistic competition

       Monopolistic competition involves many firms competing against each other, but selling products that are
       distinctive in some way. Examples include stores that sell different styles of clothing; restaurants or grocery
       stores that sell a variety of food; and even products like golf balls or beer that may be at least somewhat similar

and brand names. The term "monopolistic competition" captures this mixture of mini-monopoly and tough
competition, and the following Clear It Up feature introduces its derivation.

Who invented the theory of imperfect competition?

Two economists independently but simultaneously developed the theory of imperfect competition in 1933. The first
was Edward Chamberlin of Harvard University who published The Economics of Monopolistic Competition. The
second was Joan Robinson of Cambridge University who published The Economics of Imperfect Competition.
Robinson subsequently became interested in macroeconomics and she became a prominent Keynesian, and later a
post-Keynesian economist. (See the Welcome to Economics! and The Keynesian Perspective chapters for more on
Keynes.)

Differentiated Products

A firm can try to make its products different from those of its competitors in several ways: physical aspects of
the product, location from which it sells the product, intangible aspects of the product, and perceptions of the
product. We call products that are distinctive in one of these ways differentiated products.

Physical aspects of a product include all the phrases you hear in advertisements: unbreakable bottle, nonstick
surface, freezer-to-microwave, non-shrink, extra spicy, newly redesigned for your comfort. A firm's location
can also create a difference between producers. For example, a gas station located at a heavily traveled
intersection can probably sell more gas, because more cars drive by that corner. A supplier to an automobile
manufacturer may find that it is an advantage to locate close to the car factory.

Intangible aspects can differentiate a product, too. Some intangible aspects may be promises like a guarantee
of satisfaction or money back, a reputation for high quality, services like free delivery, or offering a loan to
purchase the product. Finally, product differentiation may occur in the minds of buyers. For example, many
people could not tell the difference in taste between common varieties of ketchup or mayonnaise if they were
blindfolded but, because of past habits and advertising, they have strong preferences for certain brands.
Advertising can play a role in shaping these intangible preferences.

The concept of differentiated products is closely related to the degree of variety that is available. If everyone in
the economy wore only blue jeans, ate only white bread, and drank only tap water, then the markets for
clothing, food, and drink would be much closer to perfectly competitive. The variety of styles, flavors, locations,
and characteristics creates product differentiation and monopolistic competition.

Perceived Demand for a Monopolistic Competitor

A monopolistically competitive firm perceives a demand for its goods that is an intermediate case between
monopoly and competition. Figure 10.2 offers a reminder that the demand curve that a perfectly competitive
firm faces is perfectly elastic or flat, because the perfectly competitive firm can sell any quantity it wishes at
the prevailing market price. In contrast, the demand curve, as faced by a monopolist, is the market demand
curve, since a monopolist is the only firm in the market, and hence is downward sloping.
242 10 · Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly

       FIGURE 10.2 Perceived Demand for Firms in Different Competitive Settings The demand curve that a perfectly
       competitive firm faces is perfectly elastic, meaning it can sell all the output it wishes at the prevailing market price.
       The demand curve that a monopoly faces is the market demand. It can sell more output only by decreasing the price
       it charges. The demand curve that a monopolistically competitive firm faces falls in between.
       The demand curve as a monopolistic competitor faces is not flat, but rather downward-sloping, which means
       that the monopolistic competitor can raise its price without losing all of its customers or lower the price and
       gain more customers. Since there are substitutes, the demand curve facing a monopolistically competitive
       firm is more elastic than that of a monopoly where there are no close substitutes. If a monopolist raises its
       price, some consumers will choose not to purchase its product--but they will then need to buy a completely
       different product. However, when a monopolistic competitor raises its price, some consumers will choose not
       to purchase the product at all, but others will choose to buy a similar product from another firm. If a
       monopolistic competitor raises its price, it will not lose as many customers as would a perfectly competitive
       firm, but it will lose more customers than would a monopoly that raised its prices.
       At a glance, the demand curves that a monopoly and a monopolistic competitor face look similar--that is, they
       both slope down. However, the underlying economic meaning of these perceived demand curves is different,
       because a monopolist faces the market demand curve and a monopolistic competitor does not. Rather, a
       monopolistically competitive firm's demand curve is but one of many firms that make up the "before" market
       demand curve. Are you following? If so, how would you categorize the market for golf balls? Take a swing, then
       see the following Clear It Up feature.

      Are golf balls really differentiated products?

       Monopolistic competition refers to an industry that has more than a few firms, each offering a product which, from
       the consumer's perspective, is different from its competitors. The U.S. Golf Association runs a laboratory that tests
       20,000 golf balls a year. There are strict rules for what makes a golf ball legal. A ball's weight cannot exceed 1.620
       ounces and its diameter cannot be less than 1.680 inches (which is a weight of 45.93 grams and a diameter of
       42.67 millimeters, in case you were wondering). The Association also tests the balls by hitting them at different
       speeds. For example, the distance test involves having a mechanical golfer hit the ball with a titanium driver and a
       swing speed of 120 miles per hour. As the testing center explains: "The USGA system then uses an array of sensors
       that accurately measure the flight of a golf ball during a short, indoor trajectory from a ball launcher. From this flight
       data, a computer calculates the lift and drag forces that are generated by the speed, spin, and dimple pattern of the
       ball. ... The distance limit is 317 yards."
       Over 1800 golf balls made by more than 100 companies meet the USGA standards. The balls do differ in various
       ways, such as the pattern of dimples on the ball, the types of plastic on the cover and in the cores, and other factors.

Since all balls need to conform to the USGA tests, they are much more alike than different. In other words, golf ball
manufacturers are monopolistically competitive.

However, retail sales of golf balls are about $500 million per year, which means that many large companies have a
powerful incentive to persuade players that golf balls are highly differentiated and that it makes a huge difference
which one you choose. Sure, Tiger Woods can tell the difference. For the average amateur golfer who plays a few
times a summer--and who loses many golf balls to the woods and lake and needs to buy new ones--most golf balls
are pretty much indistinguishable.

How a Monopolistic Competitor Chooses Price and Quantity

The monopolistically competitive firm decides on its profit-maximizing quantity and price in much the same
way as a monopolist. A monopolistic competitor, like a monopolist, faces a downward-sloping demand curve,
and so it will choose some combination of price and quantity along its perceived demand curve.

As an example of a profit-maximizing monopolistic competitor, consider the Authentic Chinese Pizza store,
which serves pizza with cheese, sweet and sour sauce, and your choice of vegetables and meats. Although
Authentic Chinese Pizza must compete against other pizza businesses and restaurants, it has a differentiated
product. The firm's perceived demand curve is downward sloping, as Figure 10.3 shows and the first two
columns of Table 10.1.

FIGURE 10.3 How a Monopolistic Competitor Chooses its Profit Maximizing Output and Price To maximize profits,
the Authentic Chinese Pizza shop would choose a quantity where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, or Q where
MR = MC. Here it would choose a quantity of 40 and a price of $16.

TABLE 10.1 Revenue and Cost Schedule

We can multiply the combinations of price and quantity at each point on the demand curve to calculate the
total revenue that the firm would receive, which is in the third column of Table 10.1. We calculate marginal
revenue, in the fourth column, as the change in total revenue divided by the change in quantity. The final
columns of Table 10.1 show total cost, marginal cost, and average cost. As always, we calculate marginal cost
by dividing the change in total cost by the change in quantity, while we calculate average cost by dividing total
cost by quantity. The following Work It Out feature shows how these firms calculate how much of their
products to supply at what price.

                                                                                                          WORK IT OUT

 How a Monopolistic Competitor Determines How Much to Produce and at What Price

  The process by which a monopolistic competitor chooses its profit-maximizing quantity and price resembles
  closely how a monopoly makes these decisions process. First, the firm selects the profit-maximizing quantity to
  produce. Then the firm decides what price to charge for that quantity.

  Step 1. The monopolistic competitor determines its profit-maximizing level of output. In this case, the Authentic
  Chinese Pizza company will determine the profit-maximizing quantity to produce by considering its marginal
  revenues and marginal costs. Two scenarios are possible:

    · If the firm is producing at a quantity of output where marginal revenue exceeds marginal cost, then the firm
        should keep expanding production, because each marginal unit is adding to profit by bringing in more
        revenue than its cost. In this way, the firm will produce up to the quantity where MR = MC.

    · If the firm is producing at a quantity where marginal costs exceed marginal revenue, then each marginal unit
        is costing more than the revenue it brings in, and the firm will increase its profits by reducing the quantity of
        output until MR = MC.

  In this example, MR and MC intersect at a quantity of 40, which is the profit-maximizing level of output for the
  firm.

  Step 2. The monopolistic competitor decides what price to charge. When the firm has determined its profit-
  maximizing quantity of output, it can then look to its perceived demand curve to find out what it can charge for
  that quantity of output. On the graph, we show this process as a vertical line reaching up through the profit-
  maximizing quantity until it hits the firm's perceived demand curve. For Authentic Chinese Pizza, it should charge
  a price of $16 per pizza for a quantity of 40.

  Once the firm has chosen price and quantity, it's in a position to calculate total revenue, total cost, and profit. At a
  quantity of 40, the price of $16 lies above the average cost curve, so the firm is making economic profits. From
  Table 10.1 we can see that, at an output of 40, the firm's total revenue is $640 and its total cost is $580, so
  profits are $60. In Figure 10.3, the firm's total revenues are the rectangle with the quantity of 40 on the
  horizontal axis and the price of $16 on the vertical axis. The firm's total costs are the light shaded rectangle with
  the same quantity of 40 on the horizontal axis but the average cost of $14.50 on the vertical axis. Profits are total
  revenues minus total costs, which is the shaded area above the average cost curve.

Although the process by which a monopolistic competitor makes decisions about quantity and price is similar
to the way in which a monopolist makes such decisions, two differences are worth remembering. First,
although both a monopolist and a monopolistic competitor face downward-sloping demand curves, the
monopolist's perceived demand curve is the market demand curve, while the perceived demand curve for a
monopolistic competitor is based on the extent of its product differentiation and how many competitors it
faces. Second, a monopolist is surrounded by barriers to entry and need not fear entry, but a monopolistic
competitor who earns profits must expect the entry of firms with similar, but differentiated, products.

Monopolistic Competitors and Entry

If one monopolistic competitor earns positive economic profits, other firms will be tempted to enter the
market. A gas station with a great location must worry that other gas stations might open across the street or
down the road--and perhaps the new gas stations will sell coffee or have a carwash or some other attraction to
lure customers. A successful restaurant with a unique barbecue sauce must be concerned that other
restaurants will try to copy the sauce or offer their own unique recipes. A laundry detergent with a great
reputation for quality must take note that other competitors may seek to build their own reputations.
The entry of other firms into the same general market (like gas, restaurants, or detergent) shifts the demand
curve that a monopolistically competitive firm faces. As more firms enter the market, the quantity demanded
at a given price for any particular firm will decline, and the firm's perceived demand curve will shift to the left.
As a firm's perceived demand curve shifts to the left, its marginal revenue curve will shift to the left, too. The
shift in marginal revenue will change the profit-maximizing quantity that the firm chooses to produce, since
marginal revenue will then equal marginal cost at a lower quantity.
Figure 10.4 (a) shows a situation in which a monopolistic competitor was earning a profit with its original
perceived demand curve (D0). The intersection of the marginal revenue curve (MR0) and marginal cost curve
(MC) occurs at point S, corresponding to quantity Q0, which is associated on the demand curve at point T with
price P0. The combination of price P0 and quantity Q0 lies above the average cost curve, which shows that the
firm is earning positive economic profits.

FIGURE 10.4 Monopolistic Competition, Entry, and Exit (a) At P0 and Q0, the monopolistically competitive firm in
this figure is making a positive economic profit. This is clear because if you follow the dotted line above Q0, you can
see that price is above average cost. Positive economic profits attract competing firms to the industry, driving the
original firm's demand down to D1. At the new equilibrium quantity (P1, Q1), the original firm is earning zero
economic profits, and entry into the industry ceases. In (b) the opposite occurs. At P0 and Q0, the firm is losing
money. If you follow the dotted line above Q0, you can see that average cost is above price. Losses induce firms to
leave the industry. When they do, demand for the original firm rises to D1, where once again the firm is earning zero
economic profit.
246 10 · Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly

       Unlike a monopoly, with its high barriers to entry, a monopolistically competitive firm with positive economic
       profits will attract competition. When another competitor enters the market, the original firm's perceived
       demand curve shifts to the left, from D0 to D1, and the associated marginal revenue curve shifts from MR0 to
       MR1. The new profit-maximizing output is Q1, because the intersection of the MR1 and MC now occurs at point
       U. Moving vertically up from that quantity on the new demand curve, the optimal price is at P1.

       As long as the firm is earning positive economic profits, new competitors will continue to enter the market,
       reducing the original firm's demand and marginal revenue curves. The long-run equilibrium is in the figure at
       point Y, where the firm's perceived demand curve touches the average cost curve. When price is equal to
       average cost, economic profits are zero. Thus, although a monopolistically competitive firm may earn positive
       economic profits in the short term, the process of new entry will drive down economic profits to zero in the
       long run. Remember that zero economic profit is not equivalent to zero accounting profit. A zero economic
       profit means the firm's accounting profit is equal to what its resources could earn in their next best use. Figure
       10.4 (b) shows the reverse situation, where a monopolistically competitive firm is originally losing money. The
       adjustment to long-run equilibrium is analogous to the previous example. The economic losses lead to firms
       exiting, which will result in increased demand for this particular firm, and consequently lower losses. Firms
       exit up to the point where there are no more losses in this market, for example when the demand curve
       touches the average cost curve, as in point Z.

       Monopolistic competitors can make an economic profit or loss in the short run, but in the long run, entry and
       exit will drive these firms toward a zero economic profit outcome. However, the zero economic profit outcome
       in monopolistic competition looks different from the zero economic profit outcome in perfect competition in
       several ways relating both to efficiency and to variety in the market.

      Monopolistic Competition and Efficiency

       The long-term result of entry and exit in a perfectly competitive market is that all firms end up selling at the
       price level determined by the lowest point on the average cost curve. This outcome is why perfect competition
       displays productive efficiency: goods are produced at the lowest possible average cost. However, in
       monopolistic competition, the end result of entry and exit is that firms end up with a price that lies on the
       downward-sloping portion of the average cost curve, not at the very bottom of the AC curve. Thus, monopolistic
       competition will not be productively efficient.

       In a perfectly competitive market, each firm produces at a quantity where price is set equal to marginal cost,
       both in the short and long run. This outcome is why perfect competition displays allocative efficiency: the
       social benefits of additional production, as measured by the marginal benefit, which is the same as the price,
       equal the marginal costs to society of that production. In a monopolistically competitive market, the rule for
       maximizing profit is to set MR = MC--and price is higher than marginal revenue, not equal to it because the
       demand curve is downward sloping. When P > MC, which is the outcome in a monopolistically competitive
       market, the benefits to society of providing additional quantity, as measured by the price that people are
       willing to pay, exceed the marginal costs to society of producing those units. A monopolistically competitive
       firm does not produce more, which means that society loses the net benefit of those extra units. This is the
       same argument we made about monopoly, but in this case the allocative inefficiency will be smaller. Thus, a
       monopolistically competitive industry will produce a lower quantity of a good and charge a higher price for it
       than would a perfectly competitive industry. See the following Clear It Up feature for more detail on the impact
       of demand shifts.

      Why does a shift in perceived demand cause a shift in marginal revenue?

       We use the combinations of price and quantity at each point on a firm's perceived demand curve to calculate total
       revenue for each combination of price and quantity. We then use this information on total revenue to calculate

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                                               10.1 · Monopolistic Competition 247

marginal revenue, which is the change in total revenue divided by the change in quantity. A change in perceived
demand will change total revenue at every quantity of output and in turn, the change in total revenue will shift
marginal revenue at each quantity of output. Thus, when entry occurs in a monopolistically competitive industry, the
perceived demand curve for each firm will shift to the left, because a smaller quantity will be demanded at any given
price. Another way of interpreting this shift in demand is to notice that, for each quantity sold, the firm will charge a
lower price. Consequently, the marginal revenue will be lower for each quantity sold--and the marginal revenue
curve will shift to the left as well. Conversely, exit causes the perceived demand curve for a monopolistically
competitive firm to shift to the right and the corresponding marginal revenue curve to shift right, too.

A monopolistically competitive industry does not display productive or allocative efficiency in either the short
run, when firms are making economic profits and losses, nor in the long run, when firms are earning zero
profits.

The Benefits of Variety and Product Differentiation

Even though monopolistic competition does not provide productive efficiency or allocative efficiency, it does
have benefits of its own. Product differentiation is based on variety and innovation. Most people would prefer
to live in an economy with many kinds of clothes, foods, and car styles; not in a world of perfect competition
where everyone will always wear blue jeans and white shirts, eat only spaghetti with plain red sauce, and drive
an identical model of car. Most people would prefer to live in an economy where firms are struggling to figure
out ways of attracting customers by methods like friendlier service, free delivery, guarantees of quality,
variations on existing products, and a better shopping experience.

Economists have struggled, with only partial success, to address the question of whether a market-oriented
economy produces the optimal amount of variety. Critics of market-oriented economies argue that society
does not really need dozens of different athletic shoes or breakfast cereals or automobiles. They argue that
much of the cost of creating such a high degree of product differentiation, and then of advertising and
marketing this differentiation, is socially wasteful--that is, most people would be just as happy with a smaller
range of differentiated products produced and sold at a lower price. Defenders of a market-oriented economy
respond that if people do not want to buy differentiated products or highly advertised brand names, no one is
forcing them to do so. Moreover, they argue that consumers benefit substantially when firms seek short-term
profits by providing differentiated products. This controversy may never be fully resolved, in part because
deciding on the optimal amount of variety is very difficult, and in part because the two sides often place
different values on what variety means for consumers. Read the following Clear It Up feature for a discussion
on the role that advertising plays in monopolistic competition.

         CLEAR IT UP

How does advertising impact monopolistic competition?

The U.S. economy spent about $180.12 billion on advertising in 2014, according to eMarketer.com. Roughly one
third of this was television advertising, and another third was divided roughly equally between internet, newspapers,
and radio. The remaining third was divided between direct mail, magazines, telephone directory yellow pages, and
billboards. Mobile devices are increasing the opportunities for advertisers.

Advertising is all about explaining to people, or making people believe, that the products of one firm are
differentiated from another firm's products. In the framework of monopolistic competition, there are two ways to
conceive of how advertising works: either advertising causes a firm's perceived demand curve to become more
inelastic (that is, it causes the perceived demand curve to become steeper); or advertising causes demand for the
firm's product to increase (that is, it causes the firm's perceived demand curve to shift to the right). In either case, a
successful advertising campaign may allow a firm to sell either a greater quantity or to charge a higher price, or both,
248 10 · Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly

       and thus increase its profits.

       However, economists and business owners have also long suspected that much of the advertising may only offset
       other advertising. Economist A. C. Pigou wrote the following back in 1920 in his book, The Economics of Welfare:

             It may happen that expenditures on advertisement made by competing monopolists [that is, what we now
             call monopolistic competitors] will simply neutralise one another, and leave the industrial position exactly
             as it would have been if neither had expended anything. For, clearly, if each of two rivals makes equal
             efforts to attract the favour of the public away from the other, the total result is the same as it would have
             been if neither had made any effort at all.

     10.2 Oligopoly

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain why and how oligopolies exist
         · Contrast collusion and competition
         · Interpret and analyze the prisoner's dilemma diagram
         · Evaluate the tradeoffs of imperfect competition

       Many purchases that individuals make at the retail level are produced in markets that are neither perfectly
       competitive, monopolies, nor monopolistically competitive. Rather, they are oligopolies. Oligopoly arises when
       a small number of large firms have all or most of the sales in an industry. Examples of oligopoly abound and
       include the auto industry, cable television, and commercial air travel. Oligopolistic firms are like cats in a bag.
       They can either scratch each other to pieces or cuddle up and get comfortable with one another. If oligopolists
       compete hard, they may end up acting very much like perfect competitors, driving down costs and leading to
       zero profits for all. If oligopolists collude with each other, they may effectively act like a monopoly and succeed
       in pushing up prices and earning consistently high levels of profit. We typically characterize oligopolies by
       mutual interdependence where various decisions such as output, price, and advertising depend on other
       firm(s)' decisions. Analyzing the choices of oligopolistic firms about pricing and quantity produced involves
       considering the pros and cons of competition versus collusion at a given point in time.

      Why Do Oligopolies Exist?

       A combination of the barriers to entry that create monopolies and the product differentiation that
       characterizes monopolistic competition can create the setting for an oligopoly. For example, when a
       government grants a patent for an invention to one firm, it may create a monopoly. When the government
       grants patents to, for example, three different pharmaceutical companies that each has its own drug for
       reducing high blood pressure, those three firms may become an oligopoly.

       Similarly, a natural monopoly will arise when the quantity demanded in a market is only large enough for a
       single firm to operate at the minimum of the long-run average cost curve. In such a setting, the market has
       room for only one firm, because no smaller firm can operate at a low enough average cost to compete, and no
       larger firm could sell what it produced given the quantity demanded in the market.

       Quantity demanded in the market may also be two or three times the quantity needed to produce at the
       minimum of the average cost curve--which means that the market would have room for only two or three
       oligopoly firms (and they need not produce differentiated products). Again, smaller firms would have higher
       average costs and be unable to compete, while additional large firms would produce such a high quantity that
       they would not be able to sell it at a profitable price. This combination of economies of scale and market
       demand creates the barrier to entry, which led to the Boeing-Airbus oligopoly (also called a duopoly) for large
       passenger aircraft.

       The product differentiation at the heart of monopolistic competition can also play a role in creating oligopoly.

For example, firms may need to reach a certain minimum size before they are able to spend enough on
advertising and marketing to create a recognizable brand name. The problem in competing with, say, Coca-
Cola or Pepsi is not that producing fizzy drinks is technologically difficult, but rather that creating a brand
name and marketing effort to equal Coke or Pepsi is an enormous task.

Collusion or Competition?

When oligopoly firms in a certain market decide what quantity to produce and what price to charge, they face a
temptation to act as if they were a monopoly. By acting together, oligopolistic firms can hold down industry
output, charge a higher price, and divide the profit among themselves. When firms act together in this way to
reduce output and keep prices high, it is called collusion. A group of firms that have a formal agreement to
collude to produce the monopoly output and sell at the monopoly price is called a cartel. See the following
Clear It Up feature for a more in-depth analysis of the difference between the two.

         CLEAR IT UP

Collusion versus cartels: How to differentiate

In the United States, as well as many other countries, it is illegal for firms to collude since collusion is anti-
competitive behavior, which is a violation of antitrust law. Both the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department and
the Federal Trade Commission have responsibilities for preventing collusion in the United States.

The problem of enforcement is finding hard evidence of collusion. Cartels are formal agreements to collude.
Because cartel agreements provide evidence of collusion, they are rare in the United States. Instead, most collusion
is tacit, where firms implicitly reach an understanding that competition is bad for profits.

Economists have understood for a long time the desire of businesses to avoid competing so that they can
instead raise the prices that they charge and earn higher profits. Adam Smith wrote in Wealth of Nations in
1776: "People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation
ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices."

Even when oligopolists recognize that they would benefit as a group by acting like a monopoly, each individual
oligopoly faces a private temptation to produce just a slightly higher quantity and earn slightly higher
profit--while still counting on the other oligopolists to hold down their production and keep prices high. If at
least some oligopolists give in to this temptation and start producing more, then the market price will fall. A
small handful of oligopoly firms may end up competing so fiercely that they all find themselves earning zero
economic profits--as if they were perfect competitors.

The Prisoner's Dilemma

Because of the complexity of oligopoly, which is the result of mutual interdependence among firms, there is no
single, generally-accepted theory of how oligopolies behave, in the same way that we have theories for all the
other market structures. Instead, economists use game theory, a branch of mathematics that analyzes
situations in which players must make decisions and then receive payoffs based on what other players decide
to do. Game theory has found widespread applications in the social sciences, as well as in business, law, and
military strategy.

The prisoner's dilemma is a scenario in which the gains from cooperation are larger than the rewards from
pursuing self-interest. It applies well to oligopoly. (Note that the term "prisoner" is not typically an accurate
term for someone who has recently been arrested, but we will use the term here, since this scenario is widely
used and referenced in economic, business, and social contexts.) The story behind the prisoner's dilemma
goes like this:

      Two co-conspirators are arrested. When they are taken to the police station, they refuse to say
250 10 · Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly

      anything and are put in separate interrogation rooms. Eventually, a police officer enters the room
      where Prisoner A is being held and says: "You know what? Your partner in the other room is
      confessing. Your partner is going to get a light prison sentence of just one year, and because you're
      remaining silent, the judge is going to stick you with eight years in prison. Why don't you get smart? If
      you confess, too, we'll cut your jail time down to five years, and your partner will get five years, also."
      Over in the next room, another police officer is giving exactly the same speech to Prisoner B. What the
      police officers do not say is that if both prisoners remain silent, the evidence against them is not
      especially strong, and the prisoners will end up with only two years in jail each.

The game theory situation facing the two prisoners is in Table 10.2. To understand the dilemma, first consider
the choices from Prisoner A's point of view. If A believes that B will confess, then A should confess, too, so as to
not get stuck with the eight years in prison. However, if A believes that B will not confess, then A will be
tempted to act selfishly and confess, so as to serve only one year. The key point is that A has an incentive to
confess regardless of what choice B makes! B faces the same set of choices, and thus will have an incentive to
confess regardless of what choice A makes. To confess is called the dominant strategy. It is the strategy an
individual (or firm) will pursue regardless of the other individual's (or firm's) decision. The result is that if
prisoners pursue their own self-interest, both are likely to confess, and end up being sentenced to a total of 10
years of jail time between them.

                                                                                Prisoner B

TABLE 10.2 The Prisoner's Dilemma Problem

The game is called a dilemma because if the two prisoners had cooperated by both remaining silent, they
would only have been incarcerated for two years each, for a total of four years between them. If the two
prisoners can work out some way of cooperating so that neither one will confess, they will both be better off
than if they each follow their own individual self-interest, which in this case leads straight into longer terms.

The Oligopoly Version of the Prisoner's Dilemma

The members of an oligopoly can face a prisoner's dilemma, also. If each of the oligopolists cooperates in
holding down output, then high monopoly profits are possible. Each oligopolist, however, must worry that
while it is holding down output, other firms are taking advantage of the high price by raising output and
earning higher profits. Table 10.3 shows the prisoner's dilemma for a two-firm oligopoly--known as a duopoly.
If Firms A and B both agree to hold down output, they are acting together as a monopoly and will each earn
$1,000 in profits. However, both firms' dominant strategy is to increase output, in which case each will earn
$400 in profits.

      Increase Output (do not cooperate
      with other firm)

TABLE 10.3 A Prisoner's Dilemma for Oligopolists

Can the two firms trust each other? Consider the situation of Firm A:

  · If A thinks that B will cheat on their agreement and increase output, then A will increase output, too,
      because for A the profit of $400 when both firms increase output (the bottom right-hand choice in Table
      10.3) is better than a profit of only $200 if A keeps output low and B raises output (the upper right-hand
      choice in the table).

  · If A thinks that B will cooperate by holding down output, then A may seize the opportunity to earn higher
      profits by raising output. After all, if B is going to hold down output, then A can earn $1,500 in profits by
      expanding output (the bottom left-hand choice in the table) compared with only $1,000 by holding down
      output as well (the upper left-hand choice in the table).

Thus, firm A will reason that it makes sense to expand output if B holds down output and that it also makes
sense to expand output if B raises output. Again, B faces a parallel set of decisions that will lead B also to
expand output.

The result of this prisoner's dilemma is often that even though A and B could make the highest combined
profits by cooperating in producing a lower level of output and acting like a monopolist, the two firms may well
end up in a situation where they each increase output and earn only $400 each in profits. The following Clear It
Up feature discusses one cartel scandal in particular.

         CLEAR IT UP

What is the Lysine cartel?

Lysine, a $600 million-a-year industry, is an amino acid that farmers use as a feed additive to ensure the proper
growth of swine and poultry. The primary U.S. producer of lysine is Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), but several other
large European and Japanese firms are also in this market. For a time in the first half of the 1990s, the world's major
lysine producers met together in hotel conference rooms and decided exactly how much each firm would sell and
what it would charge. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), however, had learned of the cartel and placed
wire taps on a number of their phone calls and meetings.

From FBI surveillance tapes, following is a comment that Terry Wilson, president of the corn processing division at
ADM, made to the other lysine producers at a 1994 meeting in Mona, Hawaii:

      I wanna go back and I wanna say something very simple. If we're going to trust each other, okay, and if I'm
      assured that I'm gonna get 67,000 tons by the year's end, we're gonna sell it at the prices we agreed to . . .
      The only thing we need to talk about there because we are gonna get manipulated by these [expletive]
      buyers--they can be smarter than us if we let them be smarter. . . . They [the customers] are not your friend.
      They are not my friend. And we gotta have `em, but they are not my friends. You are my friend. I wanna be
      closer to you than I am to any customer. Cause you can make us ... money. ... And all I wanna tell you again
252 10 · Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly

             is let's--let's put the prices on the board. Let's all agree that's what we're gonna do and then walk out of
             here and do it.

       The price of lysine doubled while the cartel was in effect. Confronted by the FBI tapes, Archer Daniels Midland pled
       guilty in 1996 and paid a fine of $100 million. A number of top executives, both at ADM and other firms, later paid
       fines of up to $350,000 and were sentenced to 24-30 months in prison.

       In another one of the FBI recordings, the president of Archer Daniels Midland told an executive from another
       competing firm that ADM had a slogan that, in his words, had "penetrated the whole company." The company
       president stated the slogan this way: "Our competitors are our friends. Our customers are the enemy." That slogan
       could stand as the motto of cartels everywhere.

      How to Enforce Cooperation

       How can parties who find themselves in a prisoner's dilemma situation avoid the undesired outcome and
       cooperate with each other? The way out of a prisoner's dilemma is to find a way to penalize those who do not
       cooperate.

       Perhaps the easiest approach for colluding oligopolists, as you might imagine, would be to sign a contract with
       each other that they will hold output low and keep prices high. If a group of U.S. companies signed such a
       contract, however, it would be illegal. Certain international organizations, like the nations that are members of
       the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), have signed international agreements to act like a
       monopoly, hold down output, and keep prices high so that all of the countries can make high profits from oil
       exports. Such agreements, however, because they fall in a gray area of international law, are not legally
       enforceable. If Nigeria, for example, decides to start cutting prices and selling more oil, Saudi Arabia cannot
       sue Nigeria in court and force it to stop.

           LINK IT UP

       Visit the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries website (http://openstax.org/l/OPEC) and learn
       more about its history and how it defines itself.

       Because oligopolists cannot sign a legally enforceable contract to act like a monopoly, the firms may instead
       keep close tabs on what other firms are producing and charging. Alternatively, oligopolists may choose to act
       in a way that generates pressure on each firm to stick to its agreed quantity of output.

       One example of the pressure these firms can exert on one another is the kinked demand curve, in which
       competing oligopoly firms commit to match price cuts, but not price increases. Figure 10.5 shows this
       situation. Say that an oligopoly airline has agreed with the rest of a cartel to provide a quantity of 10,000 seats
       on the New York to Los Angeles route, at a price of $500. This choice defines the kink in the firm's perceived
       demand curve. The reason that the firm faces a kink in its demand curve is because of how the other
       oligopolists react to changes in the firm's price. If the oligopoly decides to produce more and cut its price, the
       other members of the cartel will immediately match any price cuts--and therefore, a lower price brings very
       little increase in quantity sold.

       If one firm cuts its price to $300, it will be able to sell only 11,000 seats. However, if the airline seeks to raise
       prices, the other oligopolists will not raise their prices, and so the firm that raised prices will lose a
       considerable share of sales. For example, if the firm raises its price to $550, its sales drop to 5,000 seats sold.
       Thus, if oligopolists always match price cuts by other firms in the cartel, but do not match price increases, then
       none of the oligopolists will have a strong incentive to change prices, since the potential gains are minimal.
       This strategy can work like a silent form of cooperation, in which the cartel successfully manages to hold down
       output, increase price, and share a monopoly level of profits even without any legally enforceable agreement.

FIGURE 10.5 A Kinked Demand Curve Consider a member firm in an oligopoly cartel that is supposed to produce a
quantity of 10,000 and sell at a price of $500. The other members of the cartel can encourage this firm to honor its
commitments by acting so that the firm faces a kinked demand curve. If the oligopolist attempts to expand output
and reduce price slightly, other firms also cut prices immediately--so if the firm expands output to 11,000, the price
per unit falls dramatically, to $300. On the other side, if the oligopoly attempts to raise its price, other firms will not
do so, so if the firm raises its price to $550, its sales decline sharply to 5,000. Thus, the members of a cartel can
discipline each other to stick to the pre-agreed levels of quantity and price through a strategy of matching all price
cuts but not matching any price increases.
Many real-world oligopolies, prodded by economic changes, legal and political pressures, and the egos of their
top executives, go through episodes of cooperation and competition. If oligopolies could sustain cooperation
with each other on output and pricing, they could earn profits as if they were a single monopoly. However, each
firm in an oligopoly has an incentive to produce more and grab a bigger share of the overall market; when
firms start behaving in this way, the market outcome in terms of prices and quantity can be similar to that of a
highly competitive market.

Tradeoffs of Imperfect Competition

Monopolistic competition is probably the single most common market structure in the U.S. economy. It
provides powerful incentives for innovation, as firms seek to earn profits in the short run, while entry assures
that firms do not earn economic profits in the long run. However, monopolistically competitive firms do not
produce at the lowest point on their average cost curves. In addition, the endless search to impress consumers
through product differentiation may lead to excessive social expenses on advertising and marketing.
Oligopoly is probably the second most common market structure. When oligopolies result from patented
innovations or from taking advantage of economies of scale to produce at low average cost, they may provide
considerable benefit to consumers. Oligopolies are often buffered by significant barriers to entry, which enable
the oligopolists to earn sustained profits over long periods of time. Oligopolists also do not typically produce at
the minimum of their average cost curves. When they lack vibrant competition, they may lack incentives to
provide innovative products and high-quality service.
The task of public policy with regard to competition is to sort through these multiple realities, attempting to
encourage behavior that is beneficial to the broader society and to discourage behavior that only adds to the
profits of a few large companies, with no corresponding benefit to consumers. Monopoly and Antitrust Policy
discusses the delicate judgments that go into this task.

                BRING IT HOME
      The Temptation to Defy the Law

       Oligopolistic firms have been called "cats in a bag," as this chapter mentioned. The French detergent makers chose
       to "cozy up" with each other. The result? An uneasy and tenuous relationship. When the Wall Street Journal reported
       on the matter, it wrote: "According to a statement a Henkel manager made to the [French anti-trust] commission,
       the detergent makers wanted `to limit the intensity of the competition between them and clean up the market.'
       Nevertheless, by the early 1990s, a price war had broken out among them." During the soap executives' meetings,
       sometimes lasting more than four hours, the companies established complex pricing structures. "One [soap]
       executive recalled `chaotic' meetings as each side tried to work out how the other had bent the rules." Like many
       cartels, the soap cartel disintegrated due to the very strong temptation for each member to maximize its own
       individual profits.
       How did this soap opera end? After an investigation, French antitrust authorities fined Colgate-Palmolive, Henkel,
       and Proctor & Gamble a total of 361 million ($484 million). A similar fate befell the icemakers. Bagged ice is a
       commodity, a perfect substitute, generally sold in 7- or 22-pound bags. No one cares what label is on the bag. By
       agreeing to carve up the ice market, control broad geographic swaths of territory, and set prices, the icemakers
       moved from perfect competition to a monopoly model. After the agreements, each firm was the sole supplier of
       bagged ice to a region. There were profits in both the long run and the short run. According to the courts: "These
       companies illegally conspired to manipulate the marketplace." Fines totaled about $600,000--a steep fine
       considering a bag of ice sells for under $3 in most parts of the United States.
       Even though it is illegal in many parts of the world for firms to set prices and carve up a market, the temptation to
       earn higher profits makes it extremely tempting to defy the law.

Key Concepts and Summary

10.1 Monopolistic Competition

Monopolistic competition refers to a market where many firms sell differentiated products. Differentiated
products can arise from characteristics of the good or service, location from which the firm sells the product,
intangible aspects of the product, and perceptions of the product.

The perceived demand curve for a monopolistically competitive firm is downward-sloping, which shows that it
is a price maker and chooses a combination of price and quantity. However, the perceived demand curve for a
monopolistic competitor is more elastic than the perceived demand curve for a monopolist, because the
monopolistic competitor has direct competition, unlike the pure monopolist. A profit-maximizing
monopolistic competitor will seek out the quantity where marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost. The
monopolistic competitor will produce that level of output and charge the price that the firm's demand curve
indicates.

If the firms in a monopolistically competitive industry are earning economic profits, the industry will attract
entry until profits are driven down to zero in the long run. If the firms in a monopolistically competitive
industry are suffering economic losses, then the industry will experience exit of firms until economic losses
are driven up to zero in the long run.

A monopolistically competitive firm is not productively efficient because it does not produce at the minimum
of its average cost curve. A monopolistically competitive firm is not allocatively efficient because it does not
produce where P = MC, but instead produces where P > MC. Thus, a monopolistically competitive firm will tend
to produce a lower quantity at a higher cost and to charge a higher price than a perfectly competitive firm.

Monopolistically competitive industries do offer benefits to consumers in the form of greater variety and
incentives for improved products and services. There is some controversy over whether a market-oriented
economy generates too much variety.

10.2 Oligopoly

An oligopoly is a situation where a few firms sell most or all of the goods in a market. Oligopolists earn their
highest profits if they can band together as a cartel and act like a monopolist by reducing output and raising
price. Since each member of the oligopoly can benefit individually from expanding output, such collusion
often breaks down--especially since explicit collusion is illegal.
256 10 · Self-Check Questions

The prisoner's dilemma is an example of the application of game theory to analysis of oligopoly. It shows how,
in certain situations, all sides can benefit from cooperative behavior rather than self-interested behavior.
However, the challenge for the parties is to find ways to encourage cooperative behavior.

Self-Check Questions

 1. Suppose that, due to a successful advertising campaign, a monopolistic competitor experiences an
     increase in demand for its product. How will that affect the price it charges and the quantity it supplies?

 2. Continuing with the scenario in question 1, in the long run, the positive economic profits that the
     monopolistic competitor earns will attract a response either from existing firms in the industry or firms
     outside. As those firms capture the original firm's profit, what will happen to the original firm's profit-
     maximizing price and output levels?

 3. Consider the curve in the figure below, which shows the market demand, marginal cost, and marginal
     revenue curve for firms in an oligopolistic industry. In this example, we assume firms have zero fixed
     costs.

                                                                 FIGURE 10.6

a. Suppose the firms collude to form a cartel. What price will the cartel charge? What quantity will the
     cartel supply? How much profit will the cartel earn?

b. Suppose now that the cartel breaks up and the oligopolistic firms compete as vigorously as possible by
     cutting the price and increasing sales. What will be the industry quantity and price? What will be the
     collective profits of all firms in the industry?

c. Compare the equilibrium price, quantity, and profit for the cartel and cutthroat competition outcomes.

4. Sometimes oligopolies in the same industry are very different in size. Suppose we have a duopoly where
    one firm (Firm A) is large and the other firm (Firm B) is small, as the prisoner's dilemma box in Table 10.4
    shows.

                                 Firm B colludes with Firm A Firm B cheats by selling more output

Firm A colludes with Firm B      A gets $1,000, B gets $100 A gets $800, B gets $200

Firm A cheats by selling more output A gets $1,050, B gets $50 A gets $500, B gets $20

Review Questions

 5. What is the relationship between product differentiation and monopolistic competition?

 6. How is the perceived demand curve for a monopolistically competitive firm different from the perceived
     demand curve for a monopoly or a perfectly competitive firm?

 7. How does a monopolistic competitor choose its profit-maximizing quantity of output and price?

 8. How can a monopolistic competitor tell whether the price it is charging will cause the firm to earn profits
     or experience losses?

 9. If the firms in a monopolistically competitive market are earning economic profits or losses in the short
     run, would you expect them to continue doing so in the long run? Why?

10. Is a monopolistically competitive firm productively efficient? Is it allocatively efficient? Why or why not?

11. Will the firms in an oligopoly act more like a monopoly or more like competitors? Briefly explain.

12. Does each individual in a prisoner's dilemma benefit more from cooperation or from pursuing self-
      interest? Explain briefly.

13. What stops oligopolists from acting together as a monopolist and earning the highest possible level of
      profits?

Critical Thinking Questions

14. Aside from advertising, how can monopolistically competitive firms increase demand for their products?

15. Make a case for why monopolistically competitive industries never reach long-run equilibrium.

16. Would you rather have efficiency or variety? That is, one opportunity cost of the variety of products we
      have is that each product costs more per unit than if there were only one kind of product of a given type,
      like shoes. Perhaps a better question is, "What is the right amount of variety? Can there be too many
      varieties of shoes, for example?"

17. Would you expect the kinked demand curve to be more extreme (like a right angle) or less extreme (like a
      normal demand curve) if each firm in the cartel produces a near-identical product like OPEC and
      petroleum? What if each firm produces a somewhat different product? Explain your reasoning.

18. When OPEC raised the price of oil dramatically in the mid-1970s, experts said it was unlikely that the
      cartel could stay together over the long term--that the incentives for individual members to cheat would
      become too strong. More than forty years later, OPEC still exists. Why do you think OPEC has been able to
      beat the odds and continue to collude? Hint: You may wish to consider non-economic reasons.

Problems

19. Andrea's Day Spa began to offer a relaxing aromatherapy treatment. The firm asks you how much to
      charge to maximize profits. The first two columns in Table 10.5 provide the price and quantity for the
      demand curve for treatments. The third column shows its total costs. For each level of output, calculate
      total revenue, marginal revenue, average cost, and marginal cost. What is the profit-maximizing level of
      output for the treatments and how much will the firm earn in profits?

Introduction to Monopoly and Antitrust Policy

         BRING IT HOME

More than Cooking, Heating, and Cooling

If you live in the United States, there is a slightly better than 50-50 chance your home is heated and cooled using
natural gas. You may even use natural gas for cooking. However, those uses are not the primary uses of natural gas
in the U.S. In late 2021, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, home heating, cooling, and
cooking accounted for nearly 20% of natural gas usage. What accounts for the rest? The greatest uses for natural
gas are the generation of electric power (almost 37%) and in industry (30%). Together these three uses for natural
gas touch many areas of our lives, so why would there be any opposition to a merger of two natural gas firms? After
all, a merger could mean increased efficiencies and reduced costs to people like you and me.

In October 2011, Kinder Morgan and El Paso Corporation, two natural gas firms, announced they were merging. The
announcement stated the combined firm would link "nearly every major production region with markets," cut costs
by "eliminating duplication in pipelines and other assets," and that "the savings could be passed on to consumers."

The objection? The $21.1 billion deal would give Kinder Morgan control of more than 80,000 miles of pipeline,
making the new firm the third largest energy producer in North America. Policymakers and the public wondered
262 11 · Monopoly and Antitrust Policy

       whether the new conglomerate really would pass on cost savings to consumers, or would the merger give Kinder
       Morgan a strong oligopoly position in the natural gas marketplace?

       That brings us to the central questions this chapter poses: What should the balance be between corporate size and
       a larger number of competitors in a marketplace, and what role should the government play in this balancing act?

       The previous chapters on the theory of the firm identified three important lessons: First, that competition, by
       providing consumers with lower prices and a variety of innovative products, is a good thing; second, that large-
       scale production can dramatically lower average costs; and third, that markets in the real world are rarely
       perfectly competitive. As a consequence, government policymakers must determine how much to intervene to
       balance the potential benefits of large-scale production against the potential loss of competition that can occur
       when businesses grow in size, especially through mergers.

       For example, in 2006, AT&T and BellSouth proposed a merger. At the time, there were very few mobile phone
       service providers. Both the Justice Department and the FCC blocked the proposal.

       The two companies argued that the merger would benefit consumers, who would be able to purchase better
       telecommunications services at a cheaper price because the newly created firm would take advantage of
       economies of scale and eliminate duplicate investments. However, a number of activist groups like the
       Consumer Federation of America and Public Knowledge expressed fears that the merger would reduce
       competition and lead to higher prices for consumers for decades to come. In December 2006, the federal
       government allowed the merger to proceed. By 2009, the new post-merger AT&T was the eighth largest
       company by revenues in the United States, and by that measure the largest telecommunications company in
       the world. Economists have spent - and will still spend - years trying to determine whether the merger of
       AT&T and BellSouth, as well as other smaller mergers of telecommunications companies at about this same
       time, helped consumers, hurt them, or did not make much difference.

       This chapter discusses public policy issues about competition. How can economists and governments
       determine when mergers of large companies like AT&T and BellSouth should be allowed and when they should
       be blocked? The government also plays a role in policing anticompetitive behavior other than mergers, like
       prohibiting certain kinds of contracts that might restrict competition. In the case of natural monopoly,
       however, trying to preserve competition probably will not work very well, and so government will often resort
       to regulation of price and/or quantity of output. In recent decades, there has been a global trend toward less
       government intervention in the price and output decisions of businesses.

     11.1 Corporate Mergers

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain antitrust law and its significance
         · Calculate concentration ratios
         · Calculate the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI)
         · Evaluate methods of antitrust regulation

       A corporate merger occurs when two formerly separate firms combine to become a single firm. When one firm
       purchases another, it is called an acquisition. An acquisition may not look just like a merger, since the newly
       purchased firm may continue to operate under its former company name. Mergers can also be lateral, where
       two firms of similar sizes combine to become one. However, both mergers and acquisitions lead to two
       formerly separate firms operating under common ownership, and so they are commonly grouped together.

      Regulations for Approving Mergers

       Since a merger combines two firms into one, it can reduce the extent of competition between firms. Therefore,
       when two U.S. firms announce a merger or acquisition where at least one of the firms is above a minimum size

of sales (a threshold that moves up gradually over time, and was at $101 million in 2022), or certain other
conditions are met, they are required under law to notify the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The left-
hand panel of Figure 11.2 (a) shows the number of mergers submitted for review to the FTC each year from
1999 to 2012. Mergers follow the business cycle, falling after the 2001 recession, peaking in 2007 as the Great
Recession struck, and then rising since 2009. The right-hand panel of Figure 11.2 (b) shows the distribution of
those mergers submitted for review in 2015 as measured by the size of the transaction. It is important to
remember that this total leaves out many small mergers under $50 million, which companies only need to
report in certain limited circumstances. In 2012, 26 percent of all reported merger and acquisition
transactions exceeded $500 million, while 11 percent exceeded $1 billion.

FIGURE 11.2 Number and Size of Mergers (a) The number of mergers grew from 2003 to 2007, then fell
dramatically during the 2008-2009 Great Recession, before recovering since. (b) In 2012, the greatest number of
mergers submitted for review by the Federal Trade Commission was for transactions between $100-$150 million.
The laws that give government the power to block certain mergers, and even in some cases to break up large
firms into smaller ones, are called antitrust laws. Before a large merger happens, the antitrust regulators at
the FTC, the FCC, the U.S. Department of Justice, or other regulatory agencies can allow the merger, prohibit it,
or allow it if certain conditions are met. One common condition is that the merger will be allowed if the firm
agrees to sell off certain parts. For example, in 2006, Johnson & Johnson bought the Pfizer's "consumer health"
division, which included well-known brands like Listerine mouthwash and Sudafed cold medicine. As a
condition of allowing the merger, Johnson & Johnson was required to sell off six brands to other firms,
including Zantac® heartburn relief medication, Cortizone anti-itch cream, and Balmex diaper rash medication,
to preserve a greater degree of competition in these markets.
The U.S. government approves most proposed mergers. In a market-oriented economy, firms have the freedom
to make their own choices. Private firms generally have the freedom to:

  · expand or reduce production
  · set the price they choose
  · open new factories or sales facilities or close them
  · hire workers or to lay them off
  · start selling new products or stop selling existing ones
If the owners want to acquire a firm or be acquired, or to merge with another firm, this decision is just one of
many that firms are free to make. In these conditions, the managers of private firms will sometimes make
mistakes. They may close down a factory which, it later turns out, would have been profitable. They may start
selling a product that ends up losing money. A merger between two companies can sometimes lead to a clash
264 11 · Monopoly and Antitrust Policy

       of corporate personalities that makes both firms worse off. However, the fundamental belief behind a market-
       oriented economy is that firms, not governments, are in the best position to know if their actions will lead to
       attracting more customers or producing more efficiently.

       Government regulators agree that most mergers are beneficial to consumers. As the Federal Trade
       Commission has noted on its website (as of November, 2013): "Most mergers actually benefit competition and
       consumers by allowing firms to operate more efficiently." At the same time, the FTC recognizes, "Some
       [mergers] are likely to lessen competition. That, in turn, can lead to higher prices, reduced availability of goods
       or services, lower quality of products, and less innovation. Some mergers create a concentrated market, while
       others enable a single firm to raise prices." The challenge for the antitrust regulators at the FTC and the U.S.
       Department of Justice is to figure out when a merger may hinder competition. This decision involves both
       numerical tools and some judgments that are difficult to quantify. The following Clear It Up explains the
       origins of U.S. antitrust law.

                CLEAR IT UP

      What is U.S. antitrust law?

       In the closing decades of the 1800s, many industries in the U.S. economy were dominated by a single firm that had
       most of the sales for the entire country. Supporters of these large firms argued that they could take advantage of
       economies of scale and careful planning to provide consumers with products at low prices. However, critics pointed
       out that when competition was reduced, these firms were free to charge more and make permanently higher profits,
       and that without the goading of competition, it was not clear that they were as efficient or innovative as they could
       be.

       In many cases, these large firms were organized in the legal form of a "trust," in which a group of formerly
       independent firms were consolidated by mergers and purchases, and a group of "trustees" then ran the companies
       as if they were a single firm. Thus, when the U.S. government sought to limit the power of these trusts, it passed the
       Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890 - the nation's first antitrust law. In an early demonstration of the law's power, the
       U.S. Supreme Court in 1911 upheld the government's right to break up Standard Oil, which had controlled about
       90% of the country's oil refining, into 34 independent firms, including Exxon, Mobil, Amoco, and Chevron. In 1914,
       the Clayton Antitrust Act outlawed mergers and acquisitions (where the outcome would be to "substantially lessen
       competition" in an industry), price discrimination (where different customers are charged different prices for the
       same product), and tied sales (where purchase of one product commits the buyer to purchase some other product).
       Also in 1914, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) was created to define more specifically what competition was
       unfair. In 1950, the Celler-Kefauver Act extended the Clayton Act by restricting vertical and conglomerate mergers.
       A vertical merger occurs when two or more firms, operating at different levels within an industry's supply chain,
       merge operations. A conglomerate merger is a merger between firms that are involved in totally unrelated business
       activities. In the twenty-first century, the FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice continue to enforce antitrust laws.

      The Four-Firm Concentration Ratio

       Regulators have struggled for decades to measure the degree of monopoly power in an industry. An early tool
       was the concentration ratio, which measures the combined market share (or percent of total industry sales)
       which is accounted for by the largest firms (typically the top four to eight). For an explanation of how high
       market concentrations can create inefficiencies in an economy, refer to Monopoly.

       Say that the market for replacing broken automobile windshields in a certain city has 18 firms with the market
       shares in Table 11.1, where the market share is each firm's proportion of total sales in that market. We
       calculate the four-firm concentration ratio by adding the market shares of the four largest firms: in this case,
       16 + 10 + 8 + 6 = 40. We do not consider this concentration ratio especially high, because the largest four firms
       have less than half the market.

                                                                 11.1 · Corporate Mergers 265

If the market shares for replacing automobile windshields are:

Smooth as Glass Repair Company  16% of the market

The Auto Glass Doctor Company   10% of the market

Your Car Shield Company         8% of the market

Seven firms that each have 6% of the market 42% of the market, combined

Eight firms that each have 3% of the market 24% of the market, combined

Then the four-firm concentration ratio is 16 + 10 + 8 + 6 = 40.

TABLE 11.1 Calculating Concentration Ratios from Market Shares

The concentration ratio approach can help to clarify some of the fuzziness over deciding when a merger might
affect competition. For instance, if two of the smallest firms in the hypothetical market for repairing
automobile windshields merged, the four-firm concentration ratio would not change--which implies that there
is not much worry that the degree of competition in the market has notably diminished. However, if the top two
firms merged, then the four-firm concentration ratio would become 46 (that is, 26 + 8 + 6 + 6). While this
concentration ratio is modestly higher, the four-firm concentration ratio would still be less than half, so such a
proposed merger might barely raise an eyebrow among antitrust regulators.

The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index

A four-firm concentration ratio is a simple tool, which may reveal only part of the story. For example, consider
two industries that both have a four-firm concentration ratio of 80. However, in one industry five firms each
control 20% of the market, while in the other industry, the top firm holds 77% of the market and all the other
firms have 1% each. Although the four-firm concentration ratios are identical, it would be reasonable to worry
more about the extent of competition in the second case--where the largest firm is nearly a monopoly--than in
the first.

Another approach to measuring industry concentration that can distinguish between these two cases is called
the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI). We calculate HHI by summing the squares of the market share of
each firm in the industry, as the following Work It Out shows.

                                                                                                          WORK IT OUT

 Calculating HHI

  Step 1. Calculate the HHI for a monopoly with a market share of 100%. Because there is only one firm, it has
  100% market share. The HHI is 1002 = 10,000.

  Step 2. For an extremely competitive industry, with dozens or hundreds of extremely small competitors, the HHI
  value might drop as low as 100 or even less. Calculate the HHI for an industry with 100 firms that each have 1%
  of the market. In this case, the HHI is 100(12) = 100.
  Step 3. Calculate the HHI for the industry in Table 11.1. In this case, the HHI is 162 + 102 + 82 + 7(62) + 8(32) =
  744.
266 11 · Monopoly and Antitrust Policy

Step 4. Note that the HHI gives greater weight to large firms.

Step 5. Consider the earlier example, comparing one industry where five firms each have 20% of the market with
an industry where one firm has 77% and the other 23 firms have 1% each. The two industries have the same
four-firm concentration ratio of 80. However, the HHI for the first industry is 5(202) = 2,000, while the HHI for the
second industry is much higher at 772 + 23(12) = 5,952.

Step 6. Note that the near-monopolist in the second industry drives up the HHI measure of industrial
concentration.

Step 7. Review Table 11.2 which gives some examples of the four-firm concentration ratio and the HHI in various
U.S. industries in 2016. (You can find market share data from multiple industry sources. Data in the table are
from: Statista.com (for wireless), The Wall Street Journal (for automobiles), Gartner.com (for computers) and the
U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics (for airlines).)

TABLE 11.2 Examples of Concentration Ratios and HHIs in the U.S. Economy, 2016

In the 1980s, the FTC followed these guidelines: If a merger would result in an HHI of less than 1,000, the FTC
would probably approve it. If a merger would result in an HHI of more than 1,800, the FTC would probably
challenge it. If a merger would result in an HHI between 1,000 and 1,800, then the FTC would scrutinize the
plan and make a case-by-case decision. However, in the last several decades, the antitrust enforcement
authorities have moved away from relying as heavily on measures of concentration ratios and HHIs to
determine whether they will allow a merger, and instead they carry out more case-by-case analysis on the
extent of competition in different industries.

New Directions for Antitrust

Both the four-firm concentration ratio and the Herfindahl-Hirschman index share some weaknesses. First,
they begin from the assumption that the "market" under discussion is well-defined, and the only question is
measuring how sales are divided in that market. Second, they are based on an implicit assumption that
competitive conditions across industries are similar enough that a broad measure of concentration in the
market is enough to make a decision about the effects of a merger. These assumptions, however, are not always
correct. In response to these two problems, the antitrust regulators have been changing their approach in the
last decade or two.

Defining a market is often controversial. For example, Microsoft in the early 2000s had a dominant share of
the software for computer operating systems. However, in the total market for all computer software and
services, including everything from games to scientific programs, the Microsoft share was only about 14% in
2014. A narrowly defined market will tend to make concentration appear higher, while a broadly defined
market will tend to make it appear smaller.

In recent decades, there have been two especially important shifts affecting how we define markets: one
centers on technology and the other centers on globalization. In addition, these two shifts are interconnected.
With the vast improvement in communications technologies, including the development of the internet, a
consumer can order books or pet supplies from all over the country or the world. As a result, the degree of
competition many local retail businesses face has increased. The same effect may operate even more strongly
in markets for business supplies, where so-called "business-to-business" websites can allow buyers and
suppliers from anywhere in the world to find each other.

Globalization has changed the market boundaries. As recently as the 1970s, it was common for measurements
of concentration ratios and HHIs to stop at national borders. Now, many industries find that their competition
comes from the global market. A few decades ago, three companies, General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler,
dominated the U.S. auto market. By 2014, however, production of these three firms accounted for less than half
of U.S. auto sales, although by 2021, with the emergence of COVID-19, the three firms accounted for essentially
half of U.S. auto sales. The three firms face competition from well-known car manufacturers such as Toyota,
Honda, Nissan, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi, and Mazda. When analysts calculate HHIs with a global perspective,
concentration in most major industries--including cars--is lower than in a purely domestic context.

Because attempting to define a particular market can be difficult and controversial, the Federal Trade
Commission has begun to look less at market share and more at the data on actual competition between
businesses. For example, in February 2007, Whole Foods Market and Wild Oats Market announced that they
wished to merge. These were the two largest companies in the market that the government defined as
"premium natural and organic supermarket chains." However, one could also argue that they were two
relatively small companies in the broader market for all stores that sell groceries or specialty food products.

Rather than relying on a market definition, the government antitrust regulators looked at detailed evidence on
profits and prices for specific stores in different cities, both before and after other competitive stores entered
or exited. Based on that evidence, the Federal Trade Commission decided to block the merger. After two years
of legal battles, the FTC eventually allowed the merger in 2009 under the conditions that Whole Foods sell off
the Wild Oats brand name and a number of individual stores, to preserve competition in certain local markets.
For more on the difficulties of defining markets, refer to Monopoly.

This new approach to antitrust regulation involves detailed analysis of specific markets and companies,
instead of defining a market and counting up total sales. A common starting point is for antitrust regulators to
use statistical tools and real-world evidence to estimate the demand curves and supply curves the firms
proposing a merger face. A second step is to specify how competition occurs in this specific industry. Some
possibilities include competing to cut prices, to raise output, to build a brand name through advertising, and to
build a reputation for good service or high quality. With these pieces of the puzzle in place, it is then possible to
build a statistical model that estimates the likely outcome for consumers if the two firms are allowed to merge.
These models do require some degree of subjective judgment, and so they can become the subject of legal
disputes between the antitrust authorities and the companies that wish to merge.

     11.2 Regulating Anticompetitive Behavior

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Analyze restrictive practices
         · Explain tying sales, bundling, and predatory pricing
         · Evaluate a real-world situation of possible anticompetitive and restrictive practices

       The U.S. antitrust laws reach beyond blocking mergers that would reduce competition to include a wide array
       of anticompetitive practices. For example, it is illegal for competitors to form a cartel to collude to make
       pricing and output decisions, as if they were a monopoly firm. The Federal Trade Commission and the U.S.
       Department of Justice prohibit firms from agreeing to fix prices or output, rigging bids, or sharing or dividing
       markets by allocating customers, suppliers, territories, or lines of commerce.

       In the late 1990s, for example, the antitrust regulators prosecuted an international cartel of vitamin
       manufacturers, including the Swiss firm Hoffman-La Roche, the German firm BASF, and the French firm
       Rhone-Poulenc. These firms reached agreements on how much to produce, how much to charge, and which
       firm would sell to which customers. Firms like General Mills, Kellogg, Purina Mills, and Proctor and Gamble
       bought the high-priced vitamins, which pushed up the prices more. Hoffman-La Roche pleaded guilty in May
       1999 and agreed both to pay a fine of $500 million and to have at least one top executive be incarcerated for
       four months.

       Under U.S. antitrust laws, monopoly itself is not illegal. If a firm has a monopoly because of a newly patented
       invention, for example, the law explicitly allows a firm to earn higher-than-normal profits for a time as a
       reward for innovation. If a firm achieves a large share of the market by producing a better product at a lower
       price, such behavior is not prohibited by antitrust law.

      Restrictive Practices

       Antitrust law includes rules against restrictive practices--practices that do not involve outright agreements to
       raise price or to reduce the quantity produced, but that might have the effect of reducing competition.
       Antitrust cases involving restrictive practices are often controversial, because they delve into specific
       contracts or agreements between firms that are allowed in some cases but not in others.

       For example, an exclusive dealing agreement between a manufacturer and a dealer can be legal or illegal. It is
       legal if the purpose of the contract is to encourage competition between dealers. For example, it is legal for the
       Ford Motor Company to sell its cars to only Ford dealers, and for General Motors to sell to only GM dealers, and
       so on. However, exclusive deals may also limit competition. If one large retailer obtained the exclusive rights to
       be the sole distributor of televisions, computers, and audio equipment made by a number of companies, then
       this exclusive contract would have an anticompetitive effect on other retailers.

       Tying sales happen when a customer is allowed to buy one product only if the customer also buys a second
       product. Tying sales are controversial because they force consumers to purchase a product that they may not
       actually want or need. Further, the additional, required products are not necessarily advantageous to the
       customer. Suppose that to purchase a popular DVD, the store required that you also purchase a certain
       portable TV model. These products are only loosely related, thus there is no reason to make the purchase of
       one contingent on the other. Even if a customer were interested in a portable TV, the tying to a particular
       model prevents the customer from having the option of selecting one from the numerous types available in the
       market.

       A related, but not identical, concept is bundling, where a firm sells two or more products as one. Bundling
       typically offers an advantage for consumers by allowing them to acquire multiple products or services for a
       better price. For example, several cable companies allow customers to buy products like cable, internet, and a
       phone line through a special price available through bundling. Customers are also welcome to purchase these

                                                                                                                               11.2 · Regulating Anticompetitive Behavior 269

products separately, but the price of bundling is usually more appealing.

In some cases, we can view tying sales and bundling as anticompetitive. However, in other cases they may be
legal and even common. It is common for people to purchase season tickets to a sports team or a set of
concerts so as to guarantee tickets to the few contests or shows that are most popular and likely to sell out.
Computer software manufacturers may often bundle a number of different programs, even when the buyer
wants only a few. Think about the software that is included in a new computer purchase, for example.

Recall from the chapter on Monopoly that predatory pricing occurs when the existing firm (or firms) reacts to a
new firm by dropping prices very low, until the new firm is driven out of the market, at which point the existing
firm raises prices again. This pattern of pricing is aimed at deterring new firms from entering the market.
However, in practice, it can be hard to figure out when pricing is predatory. Say that American Airlines is flying
between two cities, and a new airline starts flying between the same two cities, at a lower price. If American
Airlines cuts its price to match the new entrant, is this predatory pricing or is it just market competition at
work? A commonly proposed rule is that if a firm is selling for less than its average variable cost--that is, at a
price where it should be shutting down--then there is evidence for predatory pricing. However, calculating in
the real world what costs are variable and what costs are fixed is often not obvious, either.

The Microsoft antitrust case embodies many of these gray areas in restrictive practices, as the next Clear It Up
shows.

         CLEAR IT UP
Did Microsoft® engage in anticompetitive and restrictive practices?

The most famous restrictive practices case of recent years was a series of lawsuits by the U.S. government against
Microsoft--lawsuits that some of Microsoft's competitors encouraged. All sides admitted that Microsoft's Windows
program had a near-monopoly position in the market for the software used in general computer operating systems.
All sides agreed that the software had many satisfied customers and that the computer software capabilities were
compatible with Windows. Software that Microsoft and other companies produced had expanded dramatically in the
1990s. Having a monopoly or a near-monopoly is not necessarily illegal in and of itself, but in cases where one
company controls a great deal of the market, antitrust regulators look at any allegations of restrictive practices with
special care.

The antitrust regulators argued that Microsoft had gone beyond profiting from its software innovations and its
dominant position in the software market for operating systems, and had tried to use its market power in operating
systems software to take over other parts of the software industry. For example, the government argued that
Microsoft had engaged in an anticompetitive form of exclusive dealing by threatening computer makers that, if they
did not leave another firm's software off their machines (specifically, Netscape's Internet browser), then Microsoft
would not sell them its operating system software. Government antitrust regulators accused Microsoft of tying
together its Windows operating system software, where it had a monopoly, with its Internet Explorer browser
software, where it did not have a monopoly, and thus using this bundling as an anticompetitive tool. The government
also accused Microsoft of a form of predatory pricing; namely, giving away certain additional software products for
free as part of Windows, as a way of driving out the competition from other software makers.

In April 2000, a federal court held that Microsoft's behavior had crossed the line into unfair competition, and
recommended that the company be split into two competing firms. However, the court overturned that penalty on
appeal, and in November 2002 Microsoft reached a settlement with the government that it would end its restrictive
practices.

The concept of restrictive practices is continually evolving, as firms seek new ways to earn profits and
government regulators define what is permissible. A situation where the law is evolving and changing is always
somewhat troublesome, since laws are most useful and fair when firms know what they are in advance. In
270 11 · Monopoly and Antitrust Policy

       addition, since the law is open to interpretation, competitors who are losing out in the market can accuse
       successful firms of anticompetitive restrictive practices, and try to win through government regulation what
       they have failed to accomplish in the market. Officials at the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of
       Justice are, of course, aware of these issues, but there is no easy way to resolve them.

     11.3 Regulating Natural Monopolies

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Evaluate the appropriate competition policy for a natural monopoly
         · Interpret a graph of regulatory choices
         · Contrast cost-plus and price cap regulation
       Most true monopolies today in the U.S. are regulated, natural monopolies. A natural monopoly poses a difficult
       challenge for competition policy, because the structure of costs and demand makes competition unlikely or
       costly. A natural monopoly arises when average costs are declining over the range of production that satisfies
       market demand. This typically happens when fixed costs are large relative to variable costs. As a result, one
       firm is able to supply the total quantity demanded in the market at lower cost than two or more firms--so
       splitting up the natural monopoly would raise the average cost of production and force customers to pay more.
       Public utilities, the companies that have traditionally provided water and electrical service across much of the
       United States, are leading examples of natural monopoly. It would make little sense to argue that a local water
       company should be divided into several competing companies, each with its own separate set of pipes and
       water supplies. Installing four or five identical sets of pipes under a city, one for each water company, so that
       each household could choose its own water provider, would be terribly costly. The same argument applies to
       the idea of having many competing companies for delivering electricity to homes, each with its own set of
       wires. Before the advent of wireless phones, the argument also applied to the idea of many different phone
       companies, each with its own set of phone wires running through the neighborhood.

      The Choices in Regulating a Natural Monopoly

       What then is the appropriate competition policy for a natural monopoly? Figure 11.3 illustrates the case of
       natural monopoly, with a market demand curve that cuts through the downward-sloping portion of the
       average cost curve. Points A, B, C, and F illustrate four of the main choices for regulation. Table 11.3 outlines
       the regulatory choices for dealing with a natural monopoly.

       FIGURE 11.3 Regulatory Choices in Dealing with Natural Monopoly A natural monopoly will maximize profits by
       producing at the quantity where marginal revenue (MR) equals marginal costs (MC) and by then looking to the
       market demand curve to see what price to charge for this quantity. This monopoly will produce at point A, with a
       quantity of 4 and a price of 9.3. If antitrust regulators split this company exactly in half, then each half would

produce at point B, with average costs of 9.75 and output of 2. The regulators might require the firm to produce
where marginal cost crosses the market demand curve at point C. However, if the firm is required to produce at a
quantity of 8 and sell at a price of 3.5, the firm will incur losses. The most likely choice is point F, where the firm is
required to produce a quantity of 6 and charge a price of 6.5.

9  2.0 18.0   -10.0  49.5  4.0  5.5

TABLE 11.3 Regulatory Choices in Dealing with Natural Monopoly (*We obtain total revenue by
multiplying price and quantity. However, we have rounded some of the price values in this table for
ease of presentation.)

The first possibility is to leave the natural monopoly alone. In this case, the monopoly will follow its normal
approach to maximizing profits. It determines the quantity where MR = MC, which happens at point P at a
quantity of 4. The firm then looks to point A on the demand curve to find that it can charge a price of 9.3 for
that profit-maximizing quantity. Since the price is above the average cost curve, the natural monopoly would
earn economic profits.

While unlikely, a second outcome may arise if antitrust authorities decide to divide the company, so that the
new firms can compete. As a simple example, imagine that the company is cut in half. Thus, instead of one
large firm producing a quantity of 4, two half-size firms each produce a quantity of 2. Because of the declining
average cost curve (AC), the average cost of production for each of the half-size companies producing 2, as
point B shows, would be 9.75, while the average cost of production for a larger firm producing 4 would only be
7.75. Thus, the economy would become less productively efficient, since the good is produced at a higher
average cost. In a situation with a downward-sloping average cost curve, two smaller firms will always have
higher average costs of production than one larger firm for any quantity of total output. In addition, the
antitrust authorities must worry that splitting the natural monopoly into pieces may be only the start of their
problems. If one of the two firms grows larger than the other, it will have lower average costs and may be able to
drive its competitor out of the market. Alternatively, two firms in a market may discover subtle ways of
coordinating their behavior and keeping prices high. Either way, the result will not be the greater competition
that was desired.

A third alternative is that regulators may decide to set prices and quantities produced for this industry. The
regulators will try to choose a point along the market demand curve that benefits both consumers and the
broader social interest. Point C illustrates one tempting choice: the regulator requires that the firm produce
the quantity of output where marginal cost crosses the demand curve at an output of 8, and charge the price of
272 11 · Monopoly and Antitrust Policy

       3.5, which is equal to marginal cost at that point. This rule is appealing because it requires price to be set
       equal to marginal cost, which is what would occur in a perfectly competitive market, and it would assure
       consumers a higher quantity and lower price than at the monopoly choice A. In fact, efficient allocation of
       resources would occur at point C, since the value to the consumers of the last unit bought and sold in this
       market is equal to the marginal cost of producing it.

       Attempting to bring about point C through force of regulation, however, runs into a severe difficulty. At point C,
       with an output of 8, a price of 3.5 is below the average cost of production, which is 5.7, so if the firm charges a
       price of 3.5, it will be suffering losses. Unless the regulators or the government offer the firm an ongoing public
       subsidy (and there are numerous political problems with that option), the firm will lose money and go out of
       business.

       Perhaps the most plausible option for the regulator is point F; that is, to set the price where AC crosses the
       demand curve at an output of 6 and a price of 6.5. This plan makes some sense at an intuitive level: let the
       natural monopoly charge enough to cover its average costs and earn a normal rate of profit, so that it can
       continue operating, but prevent the firm from raising prices and earning abnormally high monopoly profits, as
       it would at the monopoly choice A. Determining this level of output and price with the political pressures, time
       constraints, and limited information of the real world is much harder than identifying the point on a graph. For
       more on the problems that can arise from a centrally determined price, see the discussion of price floors and
       price ceilings in Demand and Supply.

      Cost-Plus versus Price Cap Regulation

       Regulators of public utilities for many decades followed the general approach of attempting to choose a point
       like F in Figure 11.3. They calculated the average cost of production for the water or electricity companies,
       added in an amount for the normal rate of profit the firm should expect to earn, and set the price for
       consumers accordingly. This method was known as cost-plus regulation.

       Cost-plus regulation raises difficulties of its own. If producers receive reimbursement for their costs, plus a bit
       more, then at a minimum, producers have less reason to be concerned with high costs--because they can just
       pass them along in higher prices. Worse, firms under cost-plus regulation even have an incentive to generate
       high costs by building huge factories or employing many staff, because what they can charge is linked to the
       costs they incur.

       Thus, in the 1980s and 1990s, some public utility regulators began to use price cap regulation, where the
       regulator sets a price that the firm can charge over the next few years. A common pattern was to require a price
       that declined slightly over time. If the firm can find ways of reducing its costs more quickly than the price caps,
       it can make a high level of profits. However, if the firm cannot keep up with the price caps or suffers bad luck in
       the market, it may suffer losses. A few years down the road, the regulators will then set a new series of price
       caps based on the firm's performance.

       Price cap regulation requires delicacy. It will not work if the price regulators set the price cap unrealistically
       low. It may not work if the market changes dramatically so that the firm is doomed to incurring losses no
       matter what it does--say, if energy prices rise dramatically on world markets, then the company selling natural
       gas or heating oil to homes may not be able to meet price caps that seemed reasonable a year or two ago.
       However, if the regulators compare the prices with producers of the same good in other areas, they can, in
       effect, pressure a natural monopoly in one area to compete with the prices charged in other areas. Moreover,
       the possibility of earning greater profits or experiencing losses--instead of having an average rate of profit
       locked in every year by cost-plus regulation--can provide the natural monopoly with incentives for efficiency
       and innovation.

       With natural monopoly, market competition is unlikely to take root, so if consumers are not to suffer the high
       prices and restricted output of an unrestricted monopoly, government regulation will need to play a role. In
       attempting to design a system of price cap regulation with flexibility and incentive, government regulators do

not have an easy task.

11.4 The Great Deregulation Experiment

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Evaluate the effectiveness of price regulation and antitrust policy
  · Explain regulatory capture and its significance

Governments at all levels across the United States have regulated prices in a wide range of industries. In some
cases, like water and electricity that have natural monopoly characteristics, there is some room in economic
theory for such regulation. However, once politicians are given a basis to intervene in markets and to choose
prices and quantities, it is hard to know where to stop.

Doubts about Regulation of Prices and Quantities

Beginning in the 1970s, it became clear to policymakers of all political leanings that the existing price
regulation was not working well. The United States carried out a great policy experiment--the deregulation
that we discussed in Monopoly--removing government controls over prices and quantities produced in
airlines, railroads, trucking, intercity bus travel, natural gas, and bank interest rates. The Clear It Up discusses
the outcome of deregulation in one industry in particular--airlines.

         CLEAR IT UP

What are the results of airline deregulation?

Why did the pendulum swing in favor of deregulation? Consider the airline industry. In the early days of air travel, no
airline could make a profit just by flying passengers. Airlines needed something else to carry and the Postal Service
provided that something with airmail. Thus, the first U.S. government regulation of the airline industry happened
through the Postal Service, when in 1926 the Postmaster General began giving airlines permission to fly certain
routes based on mail delivery needs--and the airlines took some passengers along for the ride. In 1934, the
antitrust authorities charged the Postmaster General with colluding with the major airlines of that day to monopolize
the nation's airways. In 1938, the U.S. government created the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) to regulate airfares
and routes instead. For 40 years, from 1938 to 1978, the CAB approved all fares, controlled all entry and exit, and
specified which airlines could fly which routes. There was zero entry of new airlines on the main routes across the
country for 40 years, because the CAB did not think it was necessary.

In 1978, the Airline Deregulation Act took the government out of the business of determining airfares and
schedules. The new law shook up the industry. Famous old airlines like Pan American, Eastern, and Braniff went
bankrupt and disappeared. Some new airlines like People Express were created--and then vanished.

The greater competition from deregulation reduced airfares by about one-third over the next two decades, saving
consumers billions of dollars a year. The average flight used to take off with just half its seats full; now it is two-
thirds full, which is far more efficient. Airlines have also developed hub-and-spoke systems, where planes all fly into
a central hub city at a certain time and then depart. As a result, one can fly between any of the spoke cities with just
one connection--and there is greater service to more cities than before deregulation. With lower fares and more
service, the number of air passengers doubled from the late 1970s to the start of the 2000s--an increase that, in
turn, doubled the number of jobs in the airline industry. Meanwhile, with the watchful oversight of government
safety inspectors, commercial air travel has continued to get safer over time.

The U.S. airline industry is far from perfect. For example, a string of mergers in recent years has raised concerns over
how competition might be compromised.

One difficulty with government price regulation is what economists call regulatory capture, in which the firms
274 11 · Monopoly and Antitrust Policy

       that are supposedly regulated end up playing a large role in setting the regulations that they will follow. When
       the airline industry was regulated, for example, it suggested appointees to the regulatory board, sent lobbyists
       to argue with the board, provided most of the information on which the board made decisions, and offered
       well-paid jobs to at least some of the people leaving the board. In this situation, it is easy for regulators to
       poorly represent consumers. The result of regulatory capture is that government price regulation can often
       become a way for existing competitors to work together to reduce output, keep prices high, and limit
       competition.

      The Effects of Deregulation

       Deregulation, both of airlines and of other industries, has its negatives. The greater pressure of competition led
       to entry and exit. When firms went bankrupt or contracted substantially in size, they laid off workers who had
       to find other jobs. Market competition is, after all, a full-contact sport.

       A number of major accounting scandals involving prominent corporations such as Enron, Tyco International,
       and WorldCom led to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002. The government designed Sarbanes-Oxley to increase
       confidence in financial information provided by public corporations to protect investors from accounting
       fraud.

       The Great Recession, which began in late 2007, was caused at least in part by a global financial crisis, which
       began in the United States. The key component of the crisis was the creation and subsequent failure of several
       types of unregulated financial assets, such as collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs, a type of mortgage-
       backed security), and credit default swaps (CDSs, insurance contracts on assets like CMOs that provided a
       payoff even if the holder of the CDS did not own the CMO). Private credit rating agencies such as Standard &
       Poors, Moody's, and Fitch rated many of these assets very safe.

       The collapse of the markets for these assets precipitated the financial crisis and led to the failure of Lehman
       Brothers, a major investment bank, numerous large commercial banks, such as Wachovia, and even the
       Federal National Mortgage Corporation (Fannie Mae), which had to be nationalized--that is, taken over by the
       federal government. One response to the financial crisis was the Dodd-Frank Act, which majorly attempted to
       reform the financial system. The legislation's purpose, as noted on dodd-frank.com is:

             To promote the financial stability of the United States by improving accountability and transparency
             in the financial system, to end "too big to fail," to protect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts,
             [and] to protect consumers from abusive financial services practices. . .

       All market-based economies operate against a background of laws and regulations, including laws about
       enforcing contracts, collecting taxes, and protecting health and the environment. The government policies that
       we discussed in this chapter--like blocking certain anticompetitive mergers, ending restrictive practices,
       imposing price cap regulation on natural monopolies, and deregulation--demonstrate the role of government
       to strengthen the incentives that come with a greater degree of competition.

       What did the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) decide on the Kinder Morgan / El Paso Corporation merger? After
       careful examination, federal officials decided there was only one area of significant overlap that might provide the
       merged firm with strong market power. The FTC approved the merger, provided Kinder Morgan divest itself of the
       overlap area. Tallgrass purchased Kinder Morgan Interstate Gas Transmission, Trailblazer Pipeline Co. LLC, two
       processing facilities in Wyoming, and Kinder Morgan's 50 percent interest in the Rockies Express Pipeline to meet
       the FTC requirements. The FTC was attempting to strike a balance between potential cost reductions resulting from
       economies of scale and concentration of market power.

Did the price of natural gas decrease? Yes, rather significantly. In 2010, the wellhead price of natural gas was $4.48
per thousand cubic foot. In 2012 the price had fallen to just $2.66. Was the merger responsible for the large drop in
price? The answer is uncertain. The larger contributor to the sharp drop in price was the overall increase in the
supply of natural gas. Increasingly, more natural gas was able to be recovered by fracturing shale deposits, a
process called fracking. Fracking, which is controversial for environmental reasons, enabled the recovery of known
reserves of natural gas that previously were not economically feasible to tap. Kinder Morgan's control of
80,000-plus miles of pipeline likely made moving the gas from wellheads to end users smoother and allowed for an
even greater benefit from the increased supply.

Key Concepts and Summary

11.1 Corporate Mergers

A corporate merger involves two private firms joining together. An acquisition refers to one firm buying
another firm. In either case, two formerly independent firms become one firm. Antitrust laws seek to ensure
active competition in markets, sometimes by preventing large firms from forming through mergers and
acquisitions, sometimes by regulating business practices that might restrict competition, and sometimes by
breaking up large firms into smaller competitors.

A four-firm concentration ratio is one way of measuring the extent of competition in a market. We calculate it
by adding the market shares--that is, the percentage of total sales--of the four largest firms in the market. A
Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) is another way of measuring the extent of competition in a market. We
calculate it by taking the market shares of all firms in the market, squaring them, and then summing the total.

The forces of globalization and new communications and information technology have increased the level of
competition that many firms face by increasing the amount of competition from other regions and countries.

11.2 Regulating Anticompetitive Behavior

Antitrust firms block authorities from openly colluding to form a cartel that will reduce output and raise
prices. Companies sometimes attempt to find other ways around these restrictions and, consequently, many
antitrust cases involve restrictive practices that can reduce competition in certain circumstances, like tie-in
sales, bundling, and predatory pricing.

11.3 Regulating Natural Monopolies

In the case of a natural monopoly, market competition will not work well and so, rather than allowing an
unregulated monopoly to raise price and reduce output, the government may wish to regulate price and/or
output. Common examples of regulation are public utilities, the regulated firms that often provide electricity
and water service.

Cost-plus regulation refers to government regulating a firm which sets the price that a firm can charge over a
period of time by looking at the firm's accounting costs and then adding a normal rate of profit. Price cap
regulation refers to government regulation of a firm where the government sets a price level several years in
advance. In this case, the firm can either earn high profits if it manages to produce at lower costs or sell a
higher quantity than expected or suffer low profits or losses if costs are high or it sells less than expected.

11.4 The Great Deregulation Experiment

The U.S. economy experienced a wave of deregulation in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when the government
eliminated a number of regulations that had set prices and quantities produced in a number of industries.
Major accounting scandals in the early 2000s and, more recently, the Great Recession have spurred new
regulation to prevent similar occurrences in the future. Regulatory capture occurs when the regulated
industries end up having a strong influence over what regulations exist.

Self-Check Questions

 1. Is it true that a merger between two firms that are not already in the top four by size can affect both the
     four-firm concentration ratio and the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index? Explain briefly.

 2. Is it true that the four-firm concentration ratio puts more emphasis on one or two very large firms, while
     the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index puts more emphasis on all the firms in the entire market? Explain
     briefly.

 3. Some years ago, two intercity bus companies, Greyhound Lines, Inc. and Trailways Transportation System,
     wanted to merge. One possible definition of the market in this case was "the market for intercity bus
     service." Another possible definition was "the market for intercity transportation, including personal cars,
     car rentals, passenger trains, and commuter air flights." Which definition do you think the bus companies
     preferred, and why?

 4. As a result of globalization and new information and communications technology, would you expect that
     the definitions of markets that antitrust authorities use will become broader or narrower?

 5. Why would a firm choose to use one or more of the anticompetitive practices described in Regulating
     Anticompetitive Behavior?

 6. Urban transit systems, especially those with rail systems, typically experience significant economies of
     scale in operation. Consider the transit system data in Table 11.4. Note that the quantity is in millions of
     riders.

 7. From the graph you drew to answer Exercise 11.6, would you say this transit system is a natural
     monopoly? Justify.

Use the following information to answer the next three questions. In the years before wireless phones, when
telephone technology required having a wire running to every home, it seemed plausible that telephone
service had diminishing average costs and might require regulation like a natural monopoly. For most of the
twentieth century, the national U.S. phone company was AT&T, and the company functioned as a regulated
monopoly. Think about the deregulation of the U.S. telecommunications industry that has occurred over the
last few decades. (This is not a research assignment, but a thought assignment based on what you have learned

Introduction to Environmental Protection and Negative
Externalities

         BRING IT HOME

Keystone XL

You might have heard about Keystone XL in the news. It was a pipeline system designed to bring oil from Canada to
the refineries near the Gulf of Mexico, as well as to boost crude oil production in the United States. While a private
company, TransCanada, planned to build and own the pipeline, U.S. government approval was required because of
its size and location. There were four phases in plans to build the pipeline, and the first two of these had been in
operation.

Sounds like a great idea, right? A pipeline that would move much needed crude oil to the Gulf refineries would
increase oil production for manufacturing needs, reduce price pressure at the gas pump, and increase overall
economic growth. Supporters argued that the pipeline would be one of the safest pipelines built yet, and would
reduce America's dependence on politically vulnerable Middle Eastern oil imports.
284 12 · Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities

       Not so fast, said its critics. The Keystone XL would be constructed over an enormous aquifer (one of the largest in
       the world) in the Midwest, and through an environmentally fragile area in Nebraska, causing great concern among
       environmentalists about possible destruction to the natural surroundings. They argued that leaks could taint
       valuable water sources and pipeline construction could disrupt and even harm indigenous species. Environmentalist
       groups fought government approval of the proposed pipeline construction, and in November 2015, the Obama
       administration refused to grant the cross-border permit necessary to build the Keystone XL pipeline. In 2017, the
       Trump administration sought to grant the necessary cross-border permit, and legal challenges emerged. In 2021,
       President Biden, on his first day in office, canceled the cross-border permit, effectively ending (for now) the
       Keystone XL pipeline.

       Environmental concerns matter when discussing issues related to economic growth. However, how much should
       economists factor in these issues when deciding policy? In the case of the pipeline, how do we know how much
       damage it would cause when we do not know how to put a value on the environment? Would the pipeline's benefits
       outweigh the opportunity cost? The issue of how to balance economic progress with unintended effects on our
       planet is the subject of this chapter.

       In 1969, the Cuyahoga River in Ohio was so polluted that it spontaneously burst into flame. Air pollution was so
       bad at that time that Chattanooga, Tennessee was a city where, as an article from Sports Illustrated put it: "the
       death rate from tuberculosis was double that of the rest of Tennessee and triple that of the rest of the United
       States, a city in which the filth in the air was so bad it melted nylon stockings off women's legs, in which
       executives kept supplies of clean white shirts in their offices so they could change when a shirt became too
       gray to be presentable, in which headlights were turned on at high noon because the sun was eclipsed by the
       gunk in the sky."

       The problem of pollution arises for every economy in the world, whether high-income or low-income, and
       whether market-oriented or command-oriented. Every country needs to strike some balance between
       production and environmental quality. This chapter begins by discussing how firms may fail to take certain
       social costs, like pollution, into their planning if they do not need to pay these costs. Traditionally, policies for
       environmental protection have focused on governmental limits on how much of each pollutant could be
       emitted. While this approach has had some success, economists have suggested a range of more flexible,
       market-oriented policies that reduce pollution at a lower cost. We will consider both approaches, but first let's
       see how economists frame and analyze these issues.

     12.1 The Economics of Pollution

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain and give examples of positive and negative externalities
         · Identify equilibrium price and quantity
         · Evaluate how firms can contribute to market failure

       From 1970 to 2020, the U.S. population increased by 63 percent, and the size of the U.S. economy increased by
       more than 3.8-fold. Since the 1970s, however, the United States, using a variety of anti-pollution policies, has
       made genuine progress against a number of pollutants. Table 12.1 lists the change in carbon dioxide
       emissions by energy users (from residential to industrial) according to the U.S. Energy Information
       Administration (EIA). The table shows that emissions of certain key air pollutants declined substantially from
       2007 to 2012. They dropped 740 million metric tons (MMT) a year--a 12% reduction. This seems to indicate
       that there has been progress made in the United States in reducing overall carbon dioxide emissions, which
       contribute to the greenhouse effect.

Despite the gradual reduction in emissions from fossil fuels, many important environmental issues remain.
Along with the still high levels of air and water pollution, other issues include hazardous waste disposal,
destruction of wetlands and other wildlife habitats, and the impact on human health from pollution.

Externalities

Private markets, such as the cell phone industry, offer an efficient way to put buyers and sellers together and
determine what goods they produce, how they produce them and who gets them. The principle that voluntary
exchange benefits both buyers and sellers is a fundamental building block of the economic way of thinking.
However, what happens when a voluntary exchange affects a third party who is neither the buyer nor the
seller?

As an example, consider a concert producer who wants to build an outdoor arena that will host country music
concerts a half-mile from your neighborhood. You will be able to hear these outdoor concerts while sitting on
your back porch--or perhaps even in your dining room. In this case, the sellers and buyers of concert tickets
may both be quite satisfied with their voluntary exchange, but you have no voice in their market transaction.
The effect of a market exchange on a third party who is outside or "external" to the exchange is called an
externality. Because externalities that occur in market transactions affect other parties beyond those
involved, they are sometimes called spillovers.

Externalities can be negative or positive. If you hate country music, then having it waft into your house every
night would be a negative externality. If you love country music, then what amounts to a series of free
concerts would be a positive externality.

Pollution as a Negative Externality

Pollution is a negative externality. Economists illustrate the social costs of production with a demand and
supply diagram. The social costs include the private costs of production that a company incurs and the
external costs of pollution that pass on to society. Figure 12.2 shows the demand and supply for manufacturing
refrigerators. The demand curve (D) shows the quantity demanded at each price. The supply curve (Sprivate)
shows the quantity of refrigerators that all firms in the industry supply at each price assuming they are taking
only their private costs into account and they are allowed to emit pollution at zero cost. The market
equilibrium (E0), where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded, is at a price of $650 per refrigerator and
a quantity of 45,000 refrigerators. Table 12.2 reflects this information in the first three columns.
286 12 · Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities

FIGURE 12.2 Taking Social Costs into Account: A Supply Shift If the firm takes only its own costs of production into

account, then its supply curve will be Sprivate, and the market equilibrium will occur at E0. Accounting for additional
external costs of $100 for every unit produced, the firm's supply curve will be Ssocial. The new equilibrium will occur

TABLE 12.2 A Supply Shift Caused by Pollution Costs

However, as a by-product of the metals, plastics, chemicals and energy that refrigerator manufacturers use,
some pollution is created. Let's say that, if these pollutants were emitted into the air and water, they would
create costs of $100 per refrigerator produced. These costs might occur because of adverse effects on human
health, property values, or wildlife habitat, reduction of recreation possibilities, or because of other negative
impacts. In a market with no anti-pollution restrictions, firms can dispose of certain wastes absolutely free.
Now imagine that firms which produce refrigerators must factor in these external costs of pollution--that is,
the firms have to consider not only labor and material costs, but also the broader costs to society of harm to
health and other costs caused by pollution. If the firm is required to pay $100 for the additional external costs
of pollution each time it produces a refrigerator, production becomes more costly and the entire supply curve
shifts up by $100.

As Table 12.2 and Figure 12.2 illustrate, the firm will need to receive a price of $700 per refrigerator and
produce a quantity of 40,000--and the firm's new supply curve will be Ssocial. The new equilibrium will occur at

quantity of production, and a lower quantity of pollution. The following Work It Out feature will walk you

TABLE 12.3 Supply and Demand Conditions for a Trumpet-Playing Firm

Step 1. Determine the negative externality in this situation. To do this, you must think about the situation and
consider all parties that might be impacted. A negative externality might be the increase in noise pollution in the
area where the firm is playing.

Step 2. Identify the initial equilibrium price and quantity only taking private costs into account. Next, identify the
new equilibrium taking into account social costs as well as private costs. Remember that equilibrium is where the
quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied.

Step 3. Look down the columns to where the quantity demanded (the second column) is equal to the "quantity
supplied without paying the costs of the externality" (the third column). Then refer to the first column of that row
to determine the equilibrium price. In this case, the equilibrium price and quantity would be at a price of $10 and
a quantity of five when we only take into account private costs.

Step 4. Identify the equilibrium price and quantity when we take into account the additional external costs. Look
down the columns of quantity demanded (the second column) and the "quantity supplied after paying the costs
of the externality" (the fourth column) then refer to the first column of that row to determine the equilibrium
price. In this case, the equilibrium will be at a price of $12 and a quantity of four.

Step 5. Consider how taking into account the externality affects the equilibrium price and quantity. Do this by
comparing the two equilibrium situations. If the firm is forced to pay its additional external costs, then
production of trumpet songs becomes more costly, and the supply curve will shift up.

Remember that the supply curve is based on choices about production that firms make while looking at their
marginal costs, while the demand curve is based on the benefits that individuals perceive while maximizing
utility. If no externalities existed, private costs would be the same as the costs to society as a whole, and private
288 12 · Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities

       benefits would be the same as the benefits to society as a whole. Thus, if no externalities existed, the
       interaction of demand and supply will coordinate social costs and benefits.

       However, when the externality of pollution exists, the supply curve no longer represents all social costs.
       Because externalities represent a case where markets no longer consider all social costs, but only some of
       them, economists commonly refer to externalities as an example of market failure. When there is market
       failure, the private market fails to achieve efficient output, because either firms do not account for all costs
       incurred in the production of output and/or consumers do not account for all benefits obtained (a positive
       externality). In the case of pollution, at the market output, social costs of production exceed social benefits to
       consumers, and the market produces too much of the product.

       We can see a general lesson here. If firms were required to pay the social costs of pollution, they would create
       less pollution but produce less of the product and charge a higher price. In the next module, we will explore
       how governments require firms to account for the social costs of pollution.

     12.2 Command-and-Control Regulation

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain command-and-control regulation
         · Evaluate the effectiveness of command-and-control regulation

       When the United States started passing comprehensive environmental laws in the late 1960s and early 1970s,
       a typical law specified to companies how much pollution their smokestacks or drainpipes could emit and
       imposed penalties if companies exceeded the limit. Other laws required that companies install certain
       equipment--for example, on automobile tailpipes or on smokestacks--to reduce pollution. These types of laws,
       which specify allowable quantities of pollution and which also may detail which pollution-control technologies
       companies must use, fall under the category of command-and-control regulation. In effect, command-and-
       control regulation requires that firms increase their costs by installing anti-pollution equipment. Thus, firms
       are required to account for the social costs of pollution in deciding how much output to produce.

       Command-and-control regulation has been highly successful in protecting and cleaning up the U.S.
       environment. In 1970, the Federal government created the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to oversee
       all environmental laws. In the same year, Congress enacted the Clean Air Act to address air pollution. Just two
       years later, in 1972, Congress passed and the president signed the far-reaching Clean Water Act. These
       command-and-control environmental laws, and their amendments and updates, have been largely responsible
       for America's cleaner air and water in recent decades. However, economists have pointed out three difficulties
       with command-and-control environmental regulation.

       First, command-and-control regulation offers no incentive to improve the quality of the environment beyond
       the standard set by a particular law. Once firms meet the standard, polluters have zero incentive to do better.

       Second, command-and-control regulation is inflexible. It usually requires the same standard for all polluters,
       and often the same pollution-control technology as well. This means that command-and-control regulation
       draws no distinctions between firms that would find it easy and inexpensive to meet the pollution standard--or
       to reduce pollution even further--and firms that might find it difficult and costly to meet the standard. Firms
       have no reason to rethink their production methods in fundamental ways that might reduce pollution even
       more and at lower cost.

       Third, legislators and EPA analysts write the command-and-control regulations, and so they are subject to
       compromises in the political process. Existing firms often argue (and lobby) that stricter environmental
       standards should not apply to them, only to new firms that wish to start production. Consequently, real-world
       environmental laws are full of fine print, loopholes, and exceptions.

       Although critics accept the goal of reducing pollution, they question whether command-and-control regulation

is the best way to design policy tools for accomplishing that goal. A different approach is the use of market-
oriented tools, which we discussed in the next section.

12.3 Market-Oriented Environmental Tools

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Show how pollution charges impact firm decisions
  · Suggest other laws and regulations that could fall under pollution charges
  · Explain the significance of marketable permits and property rights
  · Evaluate which policies are most appropriate for various situations
Market-oriented environmental policies create incentives to allow firms some flexibility in reducing pollution.
The three main categories of market-oriented approaches to pollution control are pollution charges,
marketable permits, and better-defined property rights. All of these policy tools which we discuss, below,
address the shortcomings of command-and-control regulation--albeit in different ways.

Pollution Charges

A pollution charge is a tax imposed on the quantity of pollution that a firm emits. A pollution charge gives a
profit-maximizing firm an incentive to determine ways to reduce its emissions--as long as the marginal cost of
reducing the emissions is less than the tax.
For example, consider a small firm that emits 50 pounds per year of small particles, such as soot, into the air.
This particulate matter causes respiratory illnesses and also imposes costs on firms and individuals.
Figure 12.3 illustrates the marginal costs that a firm faces in reducing pollution. The marginal cost of pollution
reduction, like most marginal cost curves, increases with output, at least in the short run. Reducing the first 10
pounds of particulate emissions costs the firm $300. Reducing the second 10 pounds would cost $500;
reducing the third ten pounds would cost $900; reducing the fourth 10 pounds would cost $1,500; and the fifth
10 pounds would cost $2,500. This pattern for the costs of reducing pollution is common, because the firm can
use the cheapest and easiest method to make initial reductions in pollution, but additional reductions in
pollution become more expensive.

FIGURE 12.3 A Pollution Charge If a pollution charge is set equal to $1,000, then the firm will have an incentive to
reduce pollution by 30 pounds because the $900 cost of these reductions would be less than the cost of paying the
pollution charge.
290 12 · Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities

       Imagine the firm now faces a pollution tax of $1,000 for every 10 pounds of particulates it emits. The firm has
       the choice of either polluting and paying the tax, or reducing the amount of particulates it emits and paying the
       cost of abatement as the figure shows. How much will the firm pollute and how much will the firm abate? The
       first 10 pounds would cost the firm $300 to abate. This is substantially less than the $1,000 tax, so the firm will
       choose to abate. The second 10 pounds would cost $500 to abate, which is still less than the tax, so it will
       choose to abate. The third 10 pounds would cost $900 to abate, which is slightly less than the $1,000 tax. The
       fourth 10 pounds would cost $1,500, which is much more costly than paying the tax. As a result, the firm will
       decide to reduce pollutants by 30 pounds, because the marginal cost of reducing pollution by this amount is
       less than the pollution tax. With a tax of $1,000, the firm has no incentive to reduce pollution more than 30
       pounds.

       A firm that has to pay a pollution tax will have an incentive to figure out the least expensive technologies for
       reducing pollution. Firms that can reduce pollution cheaply and easily will do so to minimize their pollution
       taxes; whereas firms that will incur high costs for reducing pollution will end up paying the pollution tax
       instead. If the pollution tax applies to every source of pollution, then there are no special favoritism or
       loopholes for politically well-connected producers.

       For an example of a pollution charge at the household level, consider two ways of charging for garbage
       collection. One method is to have a flat fee per household, no matter how much garbage a household produces.
       An alternative approach is to have several levels of fees, depending on how much garbage the household
       produces--and to offer lower or free charges for recyclable materials. As of 2006 (latest statistics available), the
       EPA had recorded over 7,000 communities that have implemented "pay as you throw" programs. When people
       have a financial incentive to put out less garbage and to increase recycling, they find ways to make it happen.

       A number of environmental policies are really pollution charges, although they often do not travel under that
       name. For example, the federal government and many state governments impose taxes on gasoline. We can
       view this tax as a charge on the air pollution that cars generate as well as a source of funding for maintaining
       roads. Gasoline taxes are far higher in most other countries than in the United States.

       Similarly, the refundable charge of five or 10 cents that only 10 states have for returning recyclable cans and
       bottles works like a pollution tax that provides an incentive to avoid littering or throwing bottles in the trash.
       Compared with command-and-control regulation, a pollution tax reduces pollution in a more flexible and cost-
       effective way.

       that have active campaigns for new bottle bills. You can also view current and proposed bills in Canada and
       other countries around the world.

      Marketable Permits

       When a city or state government sets up a marketable permit program (e.g., cap-and-trade), it must start by
       determining the overall quantity of pollution it will allow as it tries to meet national pollution standards. Then,
       it divides a number of permits allowing only this quantity of pollution among the firms that emit that pollutant.
       The government can sell or provide these permits to pollute free to firms.

       Now, add two more conditions. Imagine that these permits are designed to reduce total emissions over time.
       For example, a permit may allow emission of 10 units of pollution one year, but only nine units the next year,
       then eight units the year after that, and so on down to some lower level. In addition, imagine that these are
       marketable permits, meaning that firms can buy and sell them.

       To see how marketable permits can work to reduce pollution, consider the four firms in Table 12.4. The table
       shows current emissions of lead from each firm. At the start of the marketable permit program, each firm

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                  12.3 · Market-Oriented Environmental Tools 291

receives permits to allow this level of pollution. However, these permits are shrinkable, and next year the
permits allow the firms to emit only half as much pollution. Let's say that in a year, Firm Gamma finds it easy
and cheap to reduce emissions from 600 tons of lead to 200 tons, which means that it has permits that it is not
using that allow emitting 100 tons of lead. Firm Beta reduces its lead pollution from 400 tons to 200 tons, so it
does not need to buy any permits, and it does not have any extra permits to sell. However, although Firm Alpha
can easily reduce pollution from 200 tons to 150 tons, it finds that it is cheaper to purchase permits from
Gamma rather than to reduce its own emissions to 100. Meanwhile, Firm Delta did not even exist in the first
period, so the only way it can start production is to purchase permits to emit 50 tons of lead.

The total quantity of pollution will decline. However, buying and selling the marketable permits will determine
exactly which firms reduce pollution and by how much. With a system of marketable permits, the firms that
find it least expensive to do so will reduce pollution the most.

TABLE 12.4 How Marketable Permits Work

Another application of marketable permits occurred when the U.S. government amended the Clean Air Act in
1990. The revised law sought to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from electric power plants to half of the 1980
levels out of concern that sulfur dioxide was causing acid rain, which harms forests as well as buildings. In this
case, the marketable permits the federal government issued were free of charge (no pun intended) to
electricity-generating plants across the country, especially those that were burning coal (which produces
sulfur dioxide). These permits were of the "shrinkable" type; that is, the amount of pollution allowed by a given
permit declined with time.

Better-Defined Property Rights

A clarified and strengthened idea of property rights can also strike a balance between economic activity and
pollution. Ronald Coase (1910-2013), who won the 1991 Nobel Prize in economics, offered a vivid illustration
of an externality: a railroad track running beside a farmer's field where the railroad locomotive sometimes
emits sparks and sets the field ablaze. Coase asked whose responsibility it was to address this spillover. Should
the farmer be required to build a tall fence alongside the field to block the sparks, or should the railroad be
required to place a gadget on the locomotive's smokestack to reduce the number of sparks?

Coase pointed out that one cannot resolve this issue until one clearly defines property rights--that is, the legal
rights of ownership on which others are not allowed to infringe without paying compensation. Does the farmer
have a property right not to have a field burned? Does the railroad have a property right to run its own trains
on its own tracks? If neither party has a property right, then the two sides may squabble endlessly, doing
nothing, and sparks will continue to set the field aflame. However, if either the farmer or the railroad has a
well-defined legal responsibility, then that party will seek out and pay for the least costly method of reducing
the risk that sparks will hit the field. The property right determines whether the farmer or the railroad pays the
292 12 · Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities

       bills.

       The property rights approach is highly relevant in cases involving endangered species. The U.S. government's
       endangered species list includes about 1,000 plants and animals, and about 90% of these species live on
       privately owned land. The protection of these endangered species requires careful thinking about incentives
       and property rights. The discovery of an endangered species on private land has often triggered an automatic
       reaction from the government to prohibit the landowner from using that land for any purpose that might
       disturb the imperiled creatures. Consider the incentives of that policy: If you admit to the government that you
       have an endangered species, the government effectively prohibits you from using your land. As a result,
       rumors abounded of landowners who followed a policy of "shoot, shovel, and shut up" when they found an
       endangered animal on their land. Other landowners have deliberately cut trees or managed land in a way that
       they knew would discourage endangered animals from locating there.

                CLEAR IT UP

      How effective are market-oriented environmental policy tools?

       Environmentalists sometimes fear that market-oriented environmental tools are an excuse to weaken or eliminate
       strict limits on pollution emissions and instead to allow more pollution. It is true that if pollution charges are set very
       low or if marketable permits do not reduce pollution by very much then market-oriented tools will not work well.
       However, command-and-control environmental laws can also be full of loopholes or have exemptions that do not
       reduce pollution by much, either. The advantage of market-oriented environmental tools is not that they reduce
       pollution by more or less, but because of their incentives and flexibility, they can achieve any desired reduction in
       pollution at a lower cost to society.

       A more productive policy would consider how to provide private landowners with an incentive to protect the
       endangered species that they find and to provide a habitat for additional endangered species. For example, the
       government might pay landowners who provide and maintain suitable habitats for endangered species or who
       restrict the use of their land to protect an endangered species. Again, an environmental law built on incentives
       and flexibility offers greater promise than a command-and-control approach when trying to oversee millions
       of acres of privately owned land.

      Applying Market-Oriented Environmental Tools

       Market-oriented environmental policies are a tool kit. Specific policy tools will work better in some situations
       than in others. For example, marketable permits work best when a few dozen or a few hundred parties are
       highly interested in trading, as in the cases of oil refineries that trade lead permits or electrical utilities that
       trade sulfur dioxide permits. However, for cases in which millions of users emit small amounts of
       pollution--such as emissions from car engines or unrecycled soda cans--and have no strong interest in
       trading, pollution charges will typically offer a better choice. We can also combine market-oriented
       environmental tools. We can view marketable permits as a form of improved property rights. Alternatively, the
       government could combine marketable permits with a pollution tax on any emissions not covered by a permit.

Benefits and Costs of Clean Air and Clean Water

We can divide the benefits of a cleaner environment into four areas: (1) people may stay healthier and live
longer; (2) certain industries that rely on clean air and water, such as farming, fishing, and tourism, may
benefit; (3) property values may be higher; and (4) people may simply enjoy a cleaner environment in a way
that does not need to involve a market transaction. Some of these benefits, such as gains to tourism or farming,
are relatively easy to value in economic terms. It is harder to assign a monetary value to others, such as the
value of clean air for someone with asthma. It seems difficult to put a clear-cut monetary value on still others,
such as the satisfaction you might feel from knowing that the air is clear over the Grand Canyon, even if you
have never visited the Grand Canyon, but advanced techniques in economics allow one to generate estimates.

Although estimates of environmental benefits are not precise, they can still be revealing. For example, a study
by the Environmental Protection Agency looked at the costs and benefits of the Clean Air Act from 1970 to
1990. It found that total costs over that time period were roughly $500 billion--a huge amount. However, it also
found that a middle-range estimate of the health and other benefits from cleaner air was $22 trillion--about 44
times higher than the costs. A more recent EPA study estimated that the environmental benefits to Americans
from the Clean Air Act will exceed their costs by a margin of four to one. The EPA estimated that "in 2010 the
benefits of Clean Air Act programs will total about $110 billion. This estimate represents the value of avoiding
increases in illness and premature death which would have prevailed." Saying that overall benefits of
environmental regulation have exceeded costs in the past, however, is very different from saying that every
environmental regulation makes sense. For example, studies suggest that when breaking down emission
reductions by type of contaminants, the benefits of air pollution control outweigh the costs primarily for
particulates and lead, but when looking at other air pollutants, the costs of reducing them may be comparable
to or greater than the benefits. Just because some environmental regulations have had benefits much higher
than costs does not prove that every individual regulation is a sensible idea.

Ecotourism: Making Environmentalism Pay

The definition of ecotourism is a little vague. Does it mean sleeping on the ground, eating roots, and getting
close to wild animals? Does it mean flying in a helicopter to shoot anesthetic darts at African wildlife, or a little
of both? The definition may be fuzzy, but tourists who hope to appreciate the ecology of their destination--"eco
tourists"--are the impetus to a big and growing business. The International Ecotourism Society estimates that
international tourists interested in seeing nature or wildlife would take 1.56 billion trips by 2020. While
COVID-19 prevented this from happening in 2020, it is clear that there is a strong demand for ecotourism.

development.

Realizing the attraction of ecotourism, the residents of low-income countries may come to see that preserving
wildlife habitats is more lucrative than, say, cutting down forests or grazing livestock. In South Africa, Namibia,
and Zimbabwe, for example, ecotourism has given local communities an economic interest in protecting
elephant and rhinoceros populations. Some of the leading ecotourism destinations include Costa Rica and
Panama in Central America; the Caribbean; Malaysia, and other South Pacific destinations; New Zealand; the
Serengeti in Tanzania; the Amazon rain forests; and the Galapagos Islands. In many of these countries and
regions, governments have enacted policies whereby they share revenues from ecotourism with local
communities, to give people in those local communities a kind of property right that encourages them to
conserve their local environment.

Ecotourism needs careful management, so that the combination of eager tourists and local entrepreneurs does
not destroy what the visitors are coming to see. And recent research indicates that wild animals that are
294 12 · Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities

       continually exposed to tourists and vehicles exhibit stress and atypical behaviors. In general, however, well-
       managed ecotourism is viewed as a net positive, which provides an alternative to damaging the local
       environment.

      Marginal Benefits and Marginal Costs

       We can use the tools of marginal analysis to illustrate the marginal costs and the marginal benefits of reducing
       pollution. Figure 12.4 illustrates a theoretical model of this situation. When the quantity of environmental
       protection is low so that pollution is extensive--for example, at quantity Qa--there are usually numerous
       relatively cheap and easy ways to reduce pollution, and the marginal benefits of doing so are quite high. At Qa,
       it makes sense to allocate more resources to fight pollution. However, as the extent of environmental
       protection increases, the cheap and easy ways of reducing pollution begin to decrease, and one must use more
       costly methods. The marginal cost curve rises. Also, as environmental protection increases, one achieves the
       largest marginal benefits first, followed by reduced marginal benefits. As the quantity of environmental
       protection increases to, say, Qb, the gap between marginal benefits and marginal costs narrows. At point Qc the
       marginal costs will exceed the marginal benefits. At this level of environmental protection, society is not
       allocating resources efficiently, because it is forfeiting too many resources to reduce pollution.

       FIGURE 12.4 Marginal Costs and Marginal Benefits of Environmental Protection Reducing pollution is costly--one
       must sacrifice resources. The marginal costs of reducing pollution are generally increasing, because one can first
       make the least expensive and easiest reductions, leaving the more expensive methods for later. The marginal
       benefits of reducing pollution are generally declining, because one can take the steps that provide the greatest
       benefit first, and steps that provide less benefit can wait until later.
       As society draws closer to Qb, some might argue that it becomes more important to use market-oriented
       environmental tools to hold down the costs of reducing pollution. Their objective would be to avoid
       environmental rules that would provide the quantity of environmental protection at Qc, where marginal costs
       exceed marginal benefits. The following Clear It Up feature delves into how the EPA measures its policies - and
       the monetary value of our lives.

                CLEAR IT UP
      What's a life worth?

       The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must estimate the value of saving lives by reducing pollution
       against the additional costs. In measuring the benefits of government environmental policies, the EPA's National

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                                 12.5 · International Environmental Issues 295

Center for Environmental Economics (NCEE) values a statistical human life at $7.4 million (in 2006 U.S. dollars,
which corresponds to a little more than $10.5 million in February 2022.)

Economists value a human life on the basis of studies of the value that people actually place on human lives in their
own decisions. For example, some jobs have a higher probability of death than others, and these jobs typically pay
more to compensate for the risk. Examples are ocean fishery as opposed to fish farming, and ice trucking in Alaska
as opposed to truck driving in the "lower forty-eight" states.

Government regulators use estimates such as these when deciding what proposed regulations are "reasonable,"
which means deciding which proposals have high enough benefits to justify their cost. For example, when the U.S.
Department of Transportation makes decisions about what safety systems should be required in cars or airplanes, it
will approve rules only where the estimated cost per life saved is $3 million or less.

Resources that we spend on life-saving regulations create a tradeoff. A study by W. Kip Viscusi of Vanderbilt
University estimated that when a regulation costs $50 million, it diverts enough spending in the rest of the economy
from health care and safety expenditures that it costs a life. This finding suggests that any regulation that costs
more than $50 million per life saved actually costs lives, rather than saving them.

12.5 International Environmental Issues

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Explain biodiversity
  · Analyze the partnership of high-income and low-income countries in efforts to address international

      externalities

Many countries around the world have become more aware of the benefits of environmental protection. Yet
even if most nations individually took steps to address their environmental issues, no nation acting alone can
solve certain environmental problems which spill over national borders. No nation by itself can reduce
emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases by enough to solve the problem of global warming--not without
the cooperation of other nations. Another issue is the challenge of preserving biodiversity, which includes the
full spectrum of animal and plant genetic material. Although a nation can protect biodiversity within its own
borders, no nation acting alone can protect biodiversity around the world. Global warming and biodiversity are
examples of international externalities.

Bringing the nations of the world together to address environmental issues requires a difficult set of
negotiations between countries with different income levels and different sets of priorities. If nations such as
China, India, Brazil, Mexico, and others are developing their economies by burning vast amounts of fossil fuels
or by stripping their forest and wildlife habitats, then the world's high-income countries acting alone will not
296 12 · Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities

       be able to reduce greenhouse gases. However, low-income countries, with some understandable exasperation,
       point out that high-income countries do not have much moral standing to lecture them on the necessities of
       putting environmental protection ahead of economic growth. After all, high-income countries have historically
       been the primary contributors to greenhouse warming by burning fossil fuels--and still are today. It is hard to
       tell people who are living in a low-income country, where adequate diet, health care, and education are
       lacking, that they should sacrifice an improved quality of life for a cleaner environment.

       Can rich and poor countries come together to address global environmental spillovers? At the initiative of the
       European Union and the most vulnerable developing nations, the Durban climate conference in December
       2011 launched negotiations to develop a new international climate change agreement that covers all countries.
       The outcome of these negotiations was the Paris Climate Agreement, passed in 2015. The Paris Agreement
       committed participating countries to significant limits on CO2 emissions. To date, 196 entities have signed on,
       including the two biggest emitters of greenhouse gases--China and the United States. The U.S. contribution to
       the agreement was the Clean Power Plan, which planned to reduce power plant CO2 emissions across the U.S.
       by 17% to pre-2005 levels by 2020, and to further reduce emissions by a cumulative 32% by 2030. In early
       2017, the Trump Administration announced plans to back out of the Paris Climate Agreement. Trump opposed
       the Clean Power plan, opting instead to shift focus to the use of natural gas. This represented a significant blow
       to the success of the Paris Agreement. However, on his first day in office, President Biden, on behalf of the
       United States, rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement.

       If high-income countries want low-income countries to reduce their emission of greenhouse gases, then the
       high-income countries may need to pay some of the costs. Perhaps some of these payments will happen
       through private markets. For example, some tourists from rich countries will pay handsomely to vacation near
       the natural treasures of low-income countries. Perhaps some of the transfer of resources can happen through
       making modern pollution-control technology available to poorer countries.

       The practical details of what such an international system might look like and how it would operate across
       international borders are forbiddingly complex. However, it seems highly unlikely that some form of world
       government will impose a detailed system of environmental command-and-control regulation around the
       world. As a result, a decentralized and market-oriented approach may be the only practical way to address
       international issues such as global warming and biodiversity.

     12.6 The Tradeoff between Economic Output and Environmental Protection

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Apply the production possibility frontier to evaluate the tradeoff between economic output and the
             environment

         · Interpret a graphic representation of the tradeoff between economic output and environmental protection

       We can analyze the tradeoff between economic output and the environment with a production possibility
       frontier (PPF) such as the one in Figure 12.5. At one extreme, at a choice like P, a country would be selecting a
       high level of economic output but very little environmental protection. At the other extreme, at a choice like T,
       a country would be selecting a high level of environmental protection but little economic output. According to
       the graph, an increase in environmental protection involves an opportunity cost of less economic output. No
       matter what their preferences, all societies should wish to avoid choices like M, which are productively
       inefficient. Efficiency requires that the choice should be on the production possibility frontier.

FIGURE 12.5 The Tradeoff between Economic Output and Environmental Protection Each society will have to weigh
its own values and decide whether it prefers a choice like P with more economic output and less environmental
protection, or a choice like T with more environmental protection and less economic output.
Economists do not have a great deal to say about the choice between P, Q, R, S and T in Figure 12.5, all of which
lie along the production possibility frontier. Countries with low per capita gross domestic product (GDP), such
as India, place a greater emphasis on economic output--which in turn helps to produce nutrition, shelter,
health, education, and desirable consumer goods. Countries with higher income levels, where a greater share
of people have access to the basic necessities of life, may be willing to place a relatively greater emphasis on
environmental protection.
However, economists are united in their belief that an inefficient choice such as M is undesirable. Rather than
choosing M, a nation could achieve either greater economic output with the same environmental protection, as
at point Q, or greater environmental protection with the same level of output, as at point S. The problem with
command-and-control environmental laws is that they sometimes involve a choice like M. Market-oriented
environmental tools offer a mechanism for providing either the same environmental protection at lower cost,
or providing a greater degree of environmental protection for the same cost.

Keystone XL

How would an economist respond to claims of environmental damage caused by the Keystone XL project? Clearly,
we can consider the environmental cost of oil spills a negative externality, but how large would these external costs
be? Furthermore, are these costs "too high" when we measure them against any potential for economic benefit?
As this chapter indicates, in deciding whether pipeline construction is a good idea, an economist would want to
know not only about the marginal benefits resulting from the additional pipeline construction, but also the potential
marginal costs--and especially the pipeline's marginal external costs. Typically these come in the form of
environmental impact statements, which are usually required for such projects. For example, an impact statement,
released in March 2013 by the Nebraska Department of State, considered the possibility of fewer pipeline miles
going over the aquifer system and avoiding completely environmentally fragile areas. It indicated that pipeline
construction would not harm "most resources".
As noted at the outset of this chapter, the Obama Administration declined to approve construction of the Keystone
XL project. However, the Trump administration announced its willingness to do so, but as noted earlier, the Biden
administration effectively ended the project. While we may fairly easily quantify the economic benefits of additional
298 12 · Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities

       oil in the United States, the social costs are more challenging to measure. Consequently, different observers may
       reach different conclusions about the balance between estimates of economic benefits and estimates of the social
       costs of the pipeline project.

Key Concepts and Summary

12.1 The Economics of Pollution

Economic production can cause environmental damage. This tradeoff arises for all countries, whether high-
income or low-income, and whether their economies are market-oriented or command-oriented.

An externality occurs when an exchange between a buyer and seller has an impact on a third party who is not
part of the exchange. An externality, which is sometimes also called a spillover, can have a negative or a
positive impact on the third party. If those parties imposing a negative externality on others had to account for
the broader social cost of their behavior, they would have an incentive to reduce the production of whatever is
causing the negative externality. In the case of a positive externality, the third party obtains benefits from the
exchange between a buyer and a seller, but they are not paying for these benefits. If this is the case, then
markets would tend to under produce output because suppliers are not aware of the additional demand from
others. If the parties generating benefits to others would somehow receive compensation for these external
benefits, they would have an incentive to increase production of whatever is causing the positive externality.

12.2 Command-and-Control Regulation

Command-and-control regulation sets specific limits for pollution emissions and/or specific pollution-control
technologies that firms must use. Although such regulations have helped to protect the environment, they have
three shortcomings: they provide no incentive for going beyond the limits they set; they offer limited flexibility
on where and how to reduce pollution; and they often have politically-motivated loopholes.

12.3 Market-Oriented Environmental Tools

Examples of market-oriented environmental policies, also called cap and trade programs, include pollution
charges, marketable permits, and better-defined property rights. Market-oriented environmental policies
300 12 · Self-Check Questions

include taxes, markets, and property rights so that those who impose negative externalities must face the
social cost.

12.4 The Benefits and Costs of U.S. Environmental Laws

We can make a strong case, taken as a whole, that the benefits of U.S. environmental regulation have
outweighed the costs. As the extent of environment regulation increases, additional expenditures on
environmental protection will probably have increasing marginal costs and decreasing marginal benefits. This
pattern suggests that the flexibility and cost savings of market-oriented environmental policies will become
more important.

12.5 International Environmental Issues

Certain global environmental issues, such as global warming and biodiversity, spill over national borders and
require addressing with some form of international agreement.

12.6 The Tradeoff between Economic Output and Environmental Protection

Depending on their different income levels and political preferences, countries are likely to make different
choices about allocative efficiency--that is, the choice between economic output and environmental protection
along the production possibility frontier. However, all countries should prefer to make a choice that shows
productive efficiency--that is, the choice is somewhere on the production possibility frontier rather than inside
it. Revisit Choice in a World of Scarcity for more on these terms.

12. Consider the case of global environmental problems that spill across international borders as a prisoner's
      dilemma of the sort studied in Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly. Say that there are two countries, A
      and B. Each country can choose whether to protect the environment, at a cost of 10, or not to protect it, at
      a cost of zero. If one country decides to protect the environment, there is a benefit of 16, but the benefit is
      divided equally between the two countries. If both countries decide to protect the environment, there is a
      benefit of 32, which is divided equally between the two countries.

Introduction to Positive Externalities and Public Goods

         BRING IT HOME
The Benefits of Voyager I Endure

The rapid growth of technology has increased our ability to access and process data, to navigate through a busy city,
and to communicate with friends on the other side of the globe. The research and development efforts of citizens,
scientists, firms, universities, and governments have truly revolutionized the modern economy. To get a sense of
how far we have come in a short period of time, let's compare one of humankind's greatest achievements to the
smartphone.
310 13 · Positive Externalities and Public Goods

       In 1977 the United States launched Voyager I, a spacecraft originally intended to reach Jupiter and Saturn, to send
       back photographs and other cosmic measurements. Voyager I, however, kept going, and going--past Jupiter and
       Saturn--right out of our solar system. At the time of its launch, Voyager had some of the most sophisticated
       computing processing power NASA could engineer (8,000 instructions per second), but today, we Earthlings use
       handheld devices that can process 14 billion instructions per second.

       Still, the technology of today is a spillover product of the incredible feats NASA accomplished over forty years ago.
       NASA research, for instance, is responsible for the kidney dialysis and mammogram machines that we use today.
       Research in new technologies not only produces private benefits to the investing firm, or in this case to NASA, but it
       also creates benefits for the broader society. In this way, new knowledge often becomes what economists refer to
       as a public good. This leads us to the topic of this chapter--technology, positive externalities, public goods, and the
       role of government in encouraging innovation and the social benefits that it provides.

       As economist Mariana Mazzucato explores in her well-known work The Entrepreneurial State, what makes a
       smartphone smart? What allows its apps to help you navigate new towns while getting updates about your
       home, all while your hands are on the steering wheel and your children are in the back seat watching their
       shows? For starters, the internet, cell tower networks, GPS, and voice activation. Each of these, and many other
       technologies we rely on, were developed with intensive government support. For example, GPS, which enables
       many cell phone functions beyond the frequently used mapping and ride-sharing applications, was developed
       by the U.S. Department of Defense over several generations of satellite tracking and complex computer
       algorithm development. The U.S. government still provides GPS for many of the world's users.

       We do not often think of the government when we consider our leading products and entrepreneurs. We think
       of Apple, Google, Lyft, Tesla, Fitbit, and so on--creative innovators who built on the tools provided by these
       government efforts, using them in transformative ways. We may not think of the estimated $19 billion per year
       that the U.S. spends to maintain the GPS system, but we would certainly think of it if it suddenly went away.
       (Beyond the impact on our daily lives, economists estimate U.S. businesses alone would lose about $1 billion
       per day without GPS.)

       Mazzucato is one of several prominent economists advocating for an embrace of continued government-
       sponsored innovations in order to build economic prosperity, reduce inequality, and manage ongoing
       challenges such as drought, coastal changes, and extreme weather. She argues that competitive, private sector
       markets are often resistant to the risks involved with large-scale innovation, because failed experiments and
       lack of uptake lead to massive corporate and personal losses. Governments can take on riskier research and
       development projects. Because government spending is fueled by taxpayers, and all innovation leads to some
       level of employment change, these proposals are certainly complex and challenging to implement.

       This chapter deals with some of these issues: Will private companies be willing to invest in new technology? In
       what ways does new technology have positive externalities? What motivates inventors? What role should
       government play in encouraging research and technology? Are there certain types of goods that markets fail to
       provide efficiently, and that only government can produce? What happens when consumption or production of
       a product creates positive externalities? Why is it unsurprising when we overuse a common resource, like
       marine fisheries?

     13.1 Investments in Innovation

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Identify the positive externalities of new technology.
         · Explain the difference between private benefits and social benefits and give examples of each.
         · Calculate and analyze rates of return

       Market competition can provide an incentive for discovering new technology because a firm can earn higher

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                                              13.1 · Investments in Innovation 311

profits by finding a way to produce products more cheaply or to create products with characteristics
consumers want. As Gregory Lee, CEO of Samsung said, "Relentless pursuit of new innovation is the key
principle of our business and enables consumers to discover a world of possibilities with technology." An
innovative firm knows that it will usually have a temporary edge over its competitors and thus an ability to
earn above-normal profits before competitors can catch up.

In certain cases, however, competition can discourage new technology, especially when other firms can
quickly copy a new idea. Consider a pharmaceutical firm deciding to develop a new drug. On average, it can
cost $800 million and take more than a decade to discover a new drug, perform the necessary safety tests, and
bring the drug to market. If the research and development (R&D) effort fails--and every R&D project has some
chance of failure--then the firm will suffer losses and could even be driven out of business. If the project
succeeds, then the firm's competitors may figure out ways of adapting and copying the underlying idea, but
without having to pay the costs themselves. As a result, the innovative company will bear the much higher
costs of the R&D and will enjoy at best only a small, temporary advantage over the competition.

Many inventors over the years have discovered that their inventions brought them less profit than they might
have reasonably expected.

  · Eli Whitney (1765-1825) invented the cotton gin, but then southern cotton planters built their own seed-
      separating devices with a few minor changes in Whitney's design. When Whitney sued, he found that the
      courts in southern states would not uphold his patent rights.

  · Thomas Edison (1847-1931) still holds the record for most patents granted to an individual. His first
      invention was an automatic vote counter, and despite the social benefits, he could not find a government
      that wanted to buy it.

  · Gordon Gould came up with the idea behind the laser in 1957. He put off applying for a patent and, by the
      time he did apply, other scientists had laser inventions of their own. A lengthy legal battle resulted, in
      which Gould spent $100,000 on lawyers, before he eventually received a patent for the laser in 1977.
      Compared to the enormous social benefits of the laser, Gould received relatively little financial reward.

  · In 1936, Alan Turing delivered a paper titled, "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the
      Entscheidungsproblem," in which he presented the notion of a universal machine (later called the
      "Universal Turing Machine," and then the "Turing machine") capable of computing anything that is
      computable. The central concept of the modern computer was based on Turing's paper. Today scholars
      widely consider Turing as the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence; however,
      the UK government prosecuted Turing in 1952 for engaging in same-sex sexual acts and gave him the
      choice of chemical castration or prison. Turing chose castration and died in 1954 from cyanide poisoning.

A variety of studies by economists have found that the original inventor receives one-third to one-half of the
total economic benefits from innovations, while other businesses and new product users receive the rest.

The Positive Externalities of New Technology

Will private firms in a market economy underinvest in research and technology? If a firm builds a factory or
buys a piece of equipment, the firm receives all the economic benefits that result from the investments.
However, when a firm invests in new technology, the private benefits, or profits, that the firm receives are only
a portion of the overall social benefits. The social benefits of an innovation account for the value of all the
positive externalities of the new idea or product, whether enjoyed by other companies or society as a whole, as
well as the private benefits the firm that developed the new technology receives. As you learned in
Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities, positive externalities are beneficial spillovers to a third
party, or parties.

Consider the example of the Big Drug Company, which is planning its R&D budget for the next year. Economists
and scientists working for Big Drug have compiled a list of potential research and development projects and
estimated rates of return. (The rate of return is the estimated payoff from the project.) Figure 13.2 shows how
312 13 · Positive Externalities and Public Goods

       the calculations work. The downward-sloping DPrivate curve represents the firm's demand for financial capital
       and reflects the company's willingness to borrow to finance research and development projects at various
       interest rates. Suppose that this firm's investment in research and development creates a spillover benefit to
       other firms and households. After all, new innovations often spark other creative endeavors that society also
       values. If we add the spillover benefits society enjoys to the firm's private demand for financial capital, we can
       draw DSocial that lies above DPrivate.

       If there were a way for the firm to fully monopolize those social benefits by somehow making them unavailable
       to the rest of us, the firm's private demand curve would be the same as society's demand curve. According to
       Figure 13.2 and Table 13.1, if the going rate of interest on borrowing is 8%, and the company can receive the
       private benefits of innovation only, then the company would finance $30 million. Society, at the same rate of
       8%, would find it optimal to have $52 million of borrowing. Unless there is a way for the company to fully enjoy
       the total benefits, then it will borrow less than the socially optimal level of $52 million.

FIGURE 13.2 Positive Externalities and Technology Big Drug faces a cost of borrowing of 8%. If the firm receives
only the private benefits of investing in R&D, then we show its demand curve for financial capital by DPrivate, and the
equilibrium will occur at $30 million. Because there are spillover benefits, society would find it optimal to have $52
million of investment. If the firm could keep the social benefits of its investment for itself, its demand curve for
financial capital would be DSocial and it would be willing to borrow $52 million.

                                 Rate of Return DPrivate (in millions) DSocial (in millions)

                                 2%   $72  $84

                                 4%   $52  $72

                                 6%   $38  $62

                                 8%   $30  $52

TABLE 13.1 Return and Demand for Capital

Big Drug's original demand for financial capital (DPrivate) is based on the profits the firm receives. However,
other pharmaceutical firms and health care companies may learn new lessons about how to treat certain
medical conditions and are then able to create their own competing products. The social benefit of the drug
takes into account the value of all the drug's positive externalities. If Big Drug were able to gain this social
return instead of other companies, its demand for financial capital would shift to the demand curve DSocial,

and it would be willing to borrow and invest $52 million. However, if Big Drug is receiving only 50 cents of each
dollar of social benefits, the firm will not spend as much on creating new products. The amount it would be
willing to spend would fall somewhere in between DPrivate and DSocial.

Why Invest in Human Capital?

The investment in anything, whether it is the construction of a new power plant or research in a new cancer
treatment, usually requires a certain upfront cost with an uncertain future benefit. The investment in
education, or human capital, is no different. Over the span of many years, a student and her family invest
significant amounts of time and money into that student's education. The idea is that higher levels of
educational attainment will eventually serve to increase the student's future productivity and subsequent
ability to earn. Once the student crunches the numbers, does this investment pay off for her?

Almost universally, economists have found that the answer to this question is a clear "Yes." For example,
several studies of the return to education in the United States estimate that the rate of return to a college
education is approximately 10-15%. Data in Table 13.2, from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Usual Weekly
Earnings of Wage and Salary Workers, Fourth Quarter 2021, demonstrate that median weekly earnings are
higher for workers who have completed more education. While these rates of return will beat equivalent
investments in Treasury bonds or savings accounts, the estimated returns to education go primarily to the
individual worker, so these returns are private rates of return to education.

What does society gain from investing in the education of another student? After all, if the government is
spending taxpayer dollars to subsidize public education, society should expect some kind of return on that
spending. Economists like George Psacharopoulos have found that, across a variety of nations, the social rate
of return on schooling is also positive. After all, positive externalities exist from investment in education.
While not always easy to measure, according to Walter McMahon, the positive externalities to education
typically include better health outcomes for the population, lower levels of crime, a cleaner environment and a
more stable, democratic government. For these reasons, many nations have chosen to use taxpayer dollars to
subsidize primary, secondary, and higher education. Education clearly benefits the person who receives it, but
a society where most people have a good level of education provides positive externalities for all.

Other Examples of Positive Externalities

Although technology may be the most prominent example of a positive externality, it is not the only one. For
example, vaccinations against disease are not only a protection for the individual, but they have the positive
spillover of protecting others who may become infected. When a number of homes in a neighborhood are
modernized, updated, and restored, not only does it increase the homes' value, but other property values in
the neighborhood may increase as well.

The appropriate public policy response to a positive externality, like a new technology, is to help the party
creating the positive externality receive a greater share of the social benefits. In the case of vaccines, like flu
shots, an effective policy might be to provide a subsidy to those who choose to get vaccinated.

Figure 13.3 shows the market for flu shots. The market demand curve DMarket for flu shots reflects only the
314 13 · Positive Externalities and Public Goods

       marginal private benefits (MPB) that the vaccinated individuals receive from the shots. Assuming that there
       are no spillover costs in the production of flu shots, the market supply curve is given by the marginal private
       cost (MPC) of producing the vaccinations.
       The equilibrium quantity of flu shots produced in the market, where MPB is equal to MPC, is QMarket and the
       price of flu shots is PMarket. However, spillover benefits exist in this market because others, those who chose
       not to purchase a flu shot, receive a positive externality in the form of a reduced chance of contracting the flu.
       When we add the spillover benefits to the marginal private benefit of flu shots, the marginal social benefit
       (MSB) of flu shots is given by DSocial. Because the MSB is greater than MPB, we see that the socially optimal
       level of flu shots is greater than the market quantity (QSocial exceeds QMarket) and the corresponding price of
       flu shots, if the market were to produce QSocial, would be at PSocial. Unfortunately, the marketplace does not
       recognize the positive externality and flu shots will go under-produced and under-consumed.
       How can government try to move the market level of output closer to the socially desirable level of output? One
       policy would be to provide a subsidy, like a voucher, to any citizen who wishes to get vaccinated. This voucher
       would act as "income" that one could use to purchase only a flu shot and, if the voucher were exactly equal to
       the per-unit spillover benefits, would increase market equilibrium to a quantity of QSocial and a price of PSocial
       where MSB equals MSC (which equals MPC given the assumption that there are no spillover costs in producing
       the vaccine). Suppliers of the flu shots would receive payment of PSocial per vaccination, while consumers of flu
       shots would redeem the voucher and only pay a price of PSubsidy. When the government uses a subsidy in this
       way, it produces the socially optimal quantity of vaccinations.

       FIGURE 13.3 The Market for Flu Shots with Spillover Benefits (A Positive Externality) The market demand curve
       does not reflect the positive externality of flu vaccinations, so only QMarket will be exchanged. This outcome is
       inefficient because the marginal social benefit exceeds the marginal social cost. If the government provides a
       subsidy to consumers of flu shots, equal to the marginal social benefit minus the marginal private benefit, the level
       of vaccinations can increase to the socially optimal quantity of QSocial.
       Societal Change as an Innovation Outcome
       Economist Carlota Perez draws on the lessons of past innovations to understand the current state of our
       economy. She demonstrates that prior technological turning points, such as the proliferation of railroads and
       the emergence of mass production, created initial periods of employment and wealth shifting but eventually
       led to greater well-being and economic growth. After difficult transition periods and sometimes economic
       meltdowns during the "installment" phase of widespread new technologies, many economies and the people
       within them have benefited from prolonged periods of economic and lifestyle improvement, including lower
       unemployment and better quality of life.

Most prior innovation periods, such as the Industrial Revolution, had one significant downside: negative
impacts on the environment, such as pollution and habitat destruction. Perez notes that our current
revolution--in information and communications technology (ICT)--has the potential for significant positive
externalities related to the environment. ICT is shifting many areas of society (and therefore industry) to
digital experiences and services that do not require fossil fuels or similar natural resources. Vehicle sharing,
product rental-reuse networks, and new manufacturing methods offer the promise of far less consumable
consumption. And even though the appearance of delivery trucks and shipping boxes gives the impression of
environmental damage, most studies indicate that online shopping is better for the environment than
individuals shopping in person. (This is partly attributed to greater efficiency in a few trucks driving to a
neighborhood rather than everyone in the neighborhood driving to several stores.) Consumers and
governments can spur on those environmental benefits by choosing or partnering with companies that focus
on furthering their environmental impact, such as by using solar power to fuel their computer servers or by
using electrically powered delivery trucks.

Like other innovations, ICT has created some employment and economic opportunities while it has reduced
others. Increased globalization and efficiencies have shuttered businesses and reduced wages in some areas.
Perez's research indicates that those types of employment shifts can be managed through proper regulation
and investment (especially in human capital), particularly as firms in the relevant industries become mature
and profitable. The prospects aren't simple: ICT has created megafirms like Amazon and Apple, which despite
pleasing their consumers can wield significant power over governments and employees. But on the
environmental and societal front at least, ICT has offered a wealth of opportunities and externalities.

13.2 How Governments Can Encourage Innovation

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Explain the effects of intellectual property rights on social and private rates of return.
  · Identify three U.S. Government policies and explain how they encourage innovation

A number of different government policies can increase the incentives to innovate, including: guaranteeing
intellectual property rights, government assistance with the costs of research and development, and
cooperative research ventures between universities and companies.

Intellectual Property Rights

One way to increase new technology is to guarantee the innovator an exclusive right to that new product or
process. Intellectual property rights include patents, which give the inventor the exclusive legal right to make,
use, or sell the invention for a limited time, and copyright laws, which give the author an exclusive legal right
over works of literature, music, film/video, and pictures. For example, if a pharmaceutical firm has a patent on
a new drug, then no other firm can manufacture or sell that drug for 20 years, unless the firm with the patent
grants permission. Without a patent, the pharmaceutical firm would have to face competition for any
successful products, and could earn no more than a normal rate of profit. With a patent, a firm is able to earn
monopoly profits on its product for a period of time--which offers an incentive for research and development.
In general, how long can "a period of time" be? The Clear It Up discusses patent and copyright protection
timeframes for some works you might know.

         CLEAR IT UP

How long is Mickey Mouse protected from being copied?

All patents and copyrights are scheduled to end someday. In 2003, copyright protection for Mickey Mouse was
scheduled to run out. Once the copyright had expired, anyone would be able to copy Mickey Mouse cartoons or draw
and sell new ones. In 1998, however, Congress passed the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act. For
316 13 · Positive Externalities and Public Goods

       copyrights owned by companies or other entities, it increased or extended the copyright from 75 years to 95 years
       after publication. For copyrights owned by individuals, it increased or extended the copyright coverage from 50
       years to 70 years after death. Along with protecting Mickey for another 20 years, the copyright extension affected
       about 400,000 books, movies, and songs.

       Figure 13.4 illustrates how the total number of patent applications filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark
       Office, as well as the total number of patents granted, surged in the mid-1990s with the invention of the
       internet, and is still going strong today.

       FIGURE 13.4 Patents Filed and Granted, 1990-2020 The number of applications filed for patents increased
       substantially beginning in the 1990s, due in part to the invention of the internet, which has led to many other
       inventions and to the 1998 Copyright Term Extension Act. (Source: http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/ido/oeip/
       taf/us_stat.htm)
       While patents provide an incentive to innovate by protecting the innovator, they are not perfect. For example:

         · In countries that already have patents, economic studies show that inventors receive only one-third to
             one-half of the total economic value of their inventions.

         · In a fast-moving high-technology industry like biotechnology or semiconductor design, patents may be
             almost irrelevant because technology is advancing so quickly.

         · Not every new idea can be protected with a patent or a copyright--for example, a new way of organizing a
             factory or a new way of training employees.

         · Patents may sometimes cover too much or be granted too easily. In the early 1970s, Xerox had received
             over 1,700 patents on various elements of the photocopy machine. Every time Xerox improved the
             photocopier, it received a patent on the improvement.

         · The 20-year time period for a patent is somewhat arbitrary. Ideally, a patent should cover a long enough
             period of time for the inventor to earn a good return, but not so long that it allows the inventor to charge a
             monopoly price permanently.

       Because patents are imperfect and do not apply well to all situations, alternative methods of improving the rate
       of return for inventors of new technology are desirable. The following sections describe some of these possible
       alternative policies.

      Policy #1: Government Spending on Research and Development

       If the private sector does not have sufficient incentive to carry out research and development, one possibility is
       for the government to fund such work directly. Government spending can provide direct financial support for
       research and development (R&D) conducted at colleges and universities, nonprofit research entities, and

sometimes by private firms, as well as at government-run laboratories. While government spending on
research and development produces technology that is broadly available for firms to use, it costs taxpayers
money and can sometimes be directed more for political than for scientific or economic reasons.

The first column of Table 13.3 shows the sources of total U.S. spending on research and development. The
second column shows the total dollars of R&D funding by each source. The third column shows that, relative to
the total amount of funding, 22.7% comes from the federal government, about 69% of R&D is done by industry,
and less than 4% is done by universities and colleges. (The percentages below do not add up to exactly 100%
due to rounding.)

Sources of R&D Funding Amount ($ billions) Percent of the Total

Federal government         $129.6  21.4%

Industry                   $426.0  70.3%

Universities and colleges  $20.7   3.4%

Nonprofits                 $25.0   4.1%

Nonfederal government      $4.8    0.8%

Total                      $606.1

TABLE 13.3 U.S. Research and Development Expenditures, 2018
(Source: https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf21324)

In the 1960s the federal government paid for about two-thirds of the nation's R&D. Over time, the U.S. economy
has come to rely much more heavily on industry-funded R&D. The federal government has tried to focus its
direct R&D spending on areas where private firms are not as active. One difficulty with direct government
support of R&D is that it inevitably involves political decisions about which projects are worthy. The scientific
question of whether research is worthwhile can easily become entangled with considerations like the location
of the congressional district in which the research funding is spent.

Policy #2: Tax Breaks for Research and Development

A complementary approach to supporting R&D that does not involve the government's close scrutiny of
specific projects is to give firms a reduction in taxes depending on how much research and development they
do. The federal government refers to this policy as the research and experimentation (R&E) tax credit.
According to the Treasury Department: ". . . the R&E Credit is also a cost-effective policy for stimulating
additional private sector investment. Most recent studies find that each dollar of foregone tax revenue through
the R&E Tax Credit causes firms to invest at least a dollar in R&D, with some studies finding a benefit to cost
ratio of 2 or 2.96."

      Policy #3 Cooperative Research

       State and federal governments support research in a variety of ways. For example, United for Medical
       Research, a coalition of groups that seek funding for the National Institutes of Health, (which is supported by
       federal grants), states: "NIH-supported research added $69 billion to our GDP and supported seven million
       jobs in 2011 alone." The United States remains the leading sponsor of medical-related research, spending
       $117 billion in 2011. Other institutions, such as the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy
       of Engineering, receive federal grants for innovative projects. The Agriculture and Food Research Initiative
       (AFRI) at the United States Department of Agriculture awards federal grants to projects that apply the best
       science to the most important agricultural problems, from food safety to childhood obesity. Cooperation
       between government-funded universities, academies, and the private sector can spur product innovation and
       create whole new industries.

     13.3 Public Goods

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Identify a public good using nonexcludable and non-rival as criteria
         · Explain the free rider problem
         · Identify several sources of public goods

       Even though new technology creates positive externalities so that perhaps one-half or two-thirds of the social
       benefit of new inventions spills over to others, the inventor still receives some private return. What about a
       situation where the positive externalities are so extensive that private firms could not expect to receive any of
       the social benefit? We call this kind of good a public good. Spending on national defense is a good example of a
       public good. Let's begin by defining the characteristics of a public good and discussing why these
       characteristics make it difficult for private firms to supply public goods. Then we will see how government may
       step in to address the issue.

      The Definition of a Public Good

       Economists have a strict definition of a public good, and it does not necessarily include all goods financed
       through taxes. To understand the defining characteristics of a public good, first consider an ordinary private
       good, like a piece of pizza. We can buy and sell a piece of pizza fairly easily because it is a separate and
       identifiable item. However, public goods are not separate and identifiable in this way.

       Instead, public goods have two defining characteristics: they are nonexcludable and non-rival. The first
       characteristic, that a public good is nonexcludable, means that it is costly or impossible to exclude someone
       from using the good. If Larry buys a private good like a piece of pizza, then he can exclude others, like Lorna,
       from eating that pizza. However, if national defense is provided, then it includes everyone. Even if you strongly
       disagree with America's defense policies or with the level of defense spending, the national defense still
       protects you. You cannot choose to be unprotected, and national defense cannot protect everyone else and
       exclude you.

       The second main characteristic of a public good, that it is non-rival, means that when one person uses the
       public good, another can also use it. With a private good like pizza, if Max is eating the pizza then Michelle
       cannot also eat it; that is, the two people are rivals in consumption. With a public good like national defense,
       Max's consumption of national defense does not reduce the amount left for Michelle, so they are non-rival in
       this area.

       A number of government services are examples of public goods. For instance, it would not be easy to provide
       fire and police service so that some people in a neighborhood would be protected from the burning and
       burglary of their property, while others would not be protected at all. Protecting some necessarily means
       protecting others, too.

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                                                                 13.3 · Public Goods 319

Positive externalities and public goods are closely related concepts. Public goods have positive externalities,
like police protection or public health funding. Not all goods and services with positive externalities, however,
are public goods. Investments in education have huge positive spillovers but can be provided by a private
company. Private companies can invest in new inventions such as the Apple iPad and reap profits that may not
capture all of the social benefits. We can also describe patents as an attempt to make new inventions into
private goods, which are excludable and rivalrous, so that no one but the inventor can use them during the
length of the patent.

The Free Rider Problem of Public Goods

Private companies find it difficult to produce public goods. If a good or service is nonexcludable, like national
defense, so that it is impossible or very costly to exclude people from using this good or service, then how can a
firm charge people for it?

     LINK IT UP

Visit this website (http://openstax.org/l/freerider) to read about a connection between free riders and "bad
music."

When individuals make decisions about buying a public good, a free rider problem can arise, in which people
have an incentive to let others pay for the public good and then to "free ride" on the purchases of others. We
can express the free rider problem in terms of the prisoner's dilemma game, which we discussed as a
representation of oligopoly in Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly.
There is a dilemma with the Prisoner's Dilemma, though. See the Work It Out feature.

                                                                                                          WORK IT OUT

 The Problem with the Prisoner's Dilemma

  Suppose two people, Rachel and Samuel, are considering purchasing a public good. The difficulty with the
  prisoner's dilemma arises as each person thinks through their strategic choices.
  Step 1. Rachel reasons in this way: If Samuel does not contribute, then I would be a fool to contribute. However,
  if Samuel does contribute, then I can come out ahead by not contributing.
  Step 2. Either way, I should choose not to contribute, and instead hope that I can be a free rider who uses the
  public good paid for by Samuel.
  Step 3. Samuel reasons the same way about Rachel.
  Step 4. When both people reason in that way, the public good never gets built, and there is no movement to the
  option where everyone cooperates--which is actually best for all parties.

The Role of Government in Paying for Public Goods

The key insight in paying for public goods is to find a way of assuring that everyone will make a contribution
and to prevent free riders. For example, if people come together through the political process and agree to pay
taxes and make group decisions about the quantity of public goods, they can defeat the free rider problem by
requiring, through the law, that everyone contributes.
However, government spending and taxes are not the only way to provide public goods. In some cases, markets
can produce public goods. For example, think about radio. It is nonexcludable, since once the radio signal is
broadcast, it would be very difficult to stop someone from receiving it. It is non-rival, since one person
listening to the signal does not prevent others from listening as well. Because of these features, it is practically
320 13 · Positive Externalities and Public Goods

       impossible to charge listeners directly for listening to conventional radio broadcasts.

       Radio has found a way to collect revenue by selling advertising, which is an indirect way of "charging" listeners
       by taking up some of their time. Ultimately, consumers who purchase the goods advertised are also paying for
       the radio service, since the station builds in the cost of advertising into the product cost. In a more recent
       development, satellite radio companies, such as SiriusXM, charge a regular subscription fee for streaming
       music without commercials. In this case, however, the product is excludable--only those who pay for the
       subscription will receive the broadcast.

       Some public goods will also have a mixture of public provision at no charge along with fees for some purposes,
       like a public city park that is free to use, but the government charges a fee for parking your car, for reserving
       certain picnic grounds, and for food sold at a refreshment stand.

           LINK IT UP

       Read this article (http://openstax.org/l/governmentpay) to find out what economists say the government should
       pay for.

       In other cases, we can use social pressures and personal appeals, rather than the force of law, to reduce the
       number of free riders and to collect resources for the public good. For example, neighbors sometimes form an
       association to carry out beautification projects or to patrol their area after dark to discourage crime. In low-
       income countries, where social pressure strongly encourages all farmers to participate, farmers in a region
       may come together to work on a large irrigation project that will benefit all. We can view many fundraising
       efforts, including raising money for local charities and for the endowments of colleges and universities, as an
       attempt to use social pressure to discourage free riding and to generate the outcome that will produce a public
       benefit.

      Common Resources and the "Tragedy of the Commons"

       There are some goods that do not fall neatly into the categories of private good or public good. While it is easy
       to classify a pizza as a private good and a city park as a public good, what about an item that is nonexcludable
       and rivalrous, such as the queen conch?

       In the Caribbean, the queen conch is a large marine mollusk that lives in shallow waters of sea grass. These
       waters are so shallow, and so clear, that a single diver may harvest many conch in a single day. Not only is
       conch meat a local delicacy and an important part of the local diet, but artists use the large ornate shells and
       craftsmen transform them. Because almost anyone with a small boat, snorkel, and mask, can participate in the
       conch harvest, it is essentially nonexcludable. At the same time, fishing for conch is rivalrous. Once a diver
       catches one conch another diver cannot catch it.

       We call goods that are nonexcludable and rivalrous common resources. Because the waters of the Caribbean
       are open to all conch fishermen, and because any conch that you catch is a conch that I cannot catch,
       fishermen tend to overharvest common resources like the conch.

       The problem of overharvesting common resources is not a new one, but ecologist Garret Hardin put the tag
       "tragedy of the commons" to the problem in a 1968 article in the magazine Science. Economists view this as a
       problem of property rights. Since nobody owns the ocean, or the conch that crawl on the sand beneath it, no
       one individual has an incentive to protect that resource and responsibly harvest it. To address the issue of
       overharvesting conch and other marine fisheries, economists have advocated simple devices like fishing
       licenses, harvest limits, and shorter fishing seasons. One approach that has been turned to more recently is
       the implementation of catch shares, whereby regulators establish a total allowable catch, and then fishermen
       are allocated a portion of that total allowable catch. Catch shares appear to slow the race to fish. When the
       population of a species drops to critically low numbers, governments have even banned the harvest until
       biologists determine that the population has returned to sustainable levels. In fact, such is the case with the

conch, the harvesting of which the government has effectively banned in the United States since 1986.

The tragedy of the commons is a frequent economic and social framework for discussions about a range of
common resources, even extending into digital resources such as open media repositories and online
libraries. Prominent economist Elinor Ostrom, the first woman to receive the Nobel Prize in Economics,
proposed an alternate version, sometimes referred to as the "non-tragedy of the commons." After extensive
fieldwork in areas as diverse as Indonesia, Kenya, Maine (U.S.), and Nepal, she challenged the notion that
people would only avoid depletion of common resources if they were forced to by regulatory laws and property
rights. She noted that farmers working shared land could communicate and cooperate in order to maximize
and preserve the fields over time. She argued that when those who benefit most from a resource are in close
proximity to it (like a farm field that directly serves a town), the resource is better managed without external
influence.

Positive Externalities in Public Health Programs

One of the most remarkable changes in the standard of living in the last several centuries is that people are
living longer. Scientists believe that, thousands of years ago, human life expectancy ranged between 20 to 30
years. By 1900, average life expectancy in the United States was 47 years. By 2015, life expectancy was 79
years; due to COVID-19, life expectancy declined slightly to 77 years in 2020. Most of the gains in life
expectancy in the history of the human race happened in the twentieth century.

The rise in life expectancy seems to stem from three primary factors. First, systems for providing clean water
and disposing of human waste helped to prevent the transmission of many diseases. Second, changes in public
behavior have advanced health. Early in the twentieth century, for example, people learned the importance of
boiling bottles before using them for food storage and baby's milk, washing their hands, and protecting food
from flies. More recent behavioral changes include reducing the number of people who smoke tobacco and
precautions to limit sexually transmitted diseases. Third, medicine has played a large role. Scientists
developed immunizations for diphtheria, cholera, pertussis, tuberculosis, tetanus, and yellow fever between
1890 and 1930. Penicillin, discovered in 1941, led to a series of other antibiotic drugs for bringing infectious
diseases under control. In recent decades, drugs that reduce the risks of high blood pressure have had a
dramatic effect in extending lives.

These advances in public health have all been closely linked to positive externalities and public goods. Public
health officials taught hygienic practices to mothers in the early 1900s and encouraged less smoking in the late
1900s. Government funded many public sanitation systems and storm sewers because they have the key traits
of public goods. In the twentieth century, many medical discoveries emerged from government or university-
funded research. Patents and intellectual property rights provided an additional incentive for private
inventors. The reason for requiring immunizations, phrased in economic terms, is that it prevents spillovers of
illness to others--as well as helping the person immunized.

The Benefits of Voyager I Endure

While we applaud the technology spillovers of NASA's space projects, we should also acknowledge that those
benefits are not shared equally. Economists like Tyler Cowen, a professor at George Mason University, are seeing
increasing evidence of a widening gap between those who have access to rapidly improving technology, and those
who do not. According to Cowen, author of the 2013 book, Average Is Over: Powering America Beyond the Age of
the Great Stagnation, this inequality in access to technology and information is going to deepen the inequality in

Key Concepts and Summary

13.1 Investments in Innovation

Competition creates pressure to innovate. However, if one can easily copy new inventions, then the original
inventor loses the incentive to invest further in research and development. New technology often has positive
externalities; that is, there are often spillovers from the invention of new technology that benefit firms other
than the innovator. The social benefit of an invention, once the firm accounts for these spillovers, typically
exceeds the private benefit to the inventor. If inventors could receive a greater share of the broader social
benefits for their work, they would have a greater incentive to seek out new inventions.

13.2 How Governments Can Encourage Innovation

Public policy with regard to technology must often strike a balance. For example, patents provide an incentive
for inventors, but they should be limited to genuinely new inventions and not extend forever.

Government has a variety of policy tools for increasing the rate of return for new technology and encouraging
its development, including: direct government funding of R&D, tax incentives for R&D, protection of
intellectual property, and forming cooperative relationships between universities and the private sector.

13.3 Public Goods

A public good has two key characteristics: it is nonexcludable and non-rival. Nonexcludable means that it is
costly or impossible for one user to exclude others from using the good. Non-rival means that when one person
uses the good, it does not prevent others from using it. Markets often have a difficult time producing public
goods because free riders will attempt to use the public good without paying for it. One can overcome the free
rider problem through measures to assure that users of the public good pay for it. Such measures include
government actions, social pressures, and specific situations where markets have discovered a way to collect
payments.

The Increasing Value of a College Degree

Working your way through college used to be fairly common in the United States. According to a 2015 study by the
Georgetown Center on Education and the Workforce, 40% of college students work 30 hours or more per week.

At the same time, the cost of college seems to rise every year. The data show that between the 2000-2001
academic year and the 2019-2020 academic year, the cost of tuition, fees, and room and board has slightly more
than doubled for private four-year colleges, and has increased by a factor of almost 2.5 for public four-year colleges.
Thus, even full time employment may not be enough to cover college expenses anymore. Working full time at
minimum wage--40 hours per week, 52 weeks per year--earns $15,080 before taxes, which is substantially less
328 14 · Labor Markets and Income

       than the more than $25,000 estimated as the average cost in 2022 for a year of college at a public university. The
       result of these costs is that student loan debt topped $1.3 trillion this year.

       Despite these disheartening figures, the value of a bachelor's degree has never been higher. How do we explain this?
       This chapter will tell us.

       In a market economy like the United States, income comes from ownership of the means of production:
       resources or assets. More precisely, one's income is a function of two things: the quantity of each resource one
       owns, and the value society places on those resources. Recall from the chapter on Production, Costs, and
       Industry Structure, each factor of production has an associated factor payment. For the majority of us, the
       most important resource we own is our labor. Thus, most of our income is wages, salaries, commissions, tips
       and other types of labor income. Your labor income depends on how many hours you work and the wage rate
       an employer will pay you for those hours. At the same time, some people own real estate, which they can either
       use themselves or rent out to other users. Some people have financial assets like bank accounts, stocks and
       bonds, for which they earn interest, dividends or some other form of income.

       Each of these factor payments, like wages for labor and interest for financial capital, is determined in their
       respective factor markets. For the rest of this chapter, we will focus on labor markets, but other factor markets
       operate similarly. Later in Chapter 17 we will describe how this works for financial capital.

                CLEAR IT UP

      What is the labor market?

       The labor market is the term that economists use for all the different markets for labor. There is no single labor
       market. Rather, there is a different market for every different type of labor. Labor differs by type of work (e.g. retail
       sales vs. scientist), skill level (entry level or more experienced), and location (the market for administrative
       assistants is probably more local or regional than the market for university presidents). While each labor market is
       different, they all tend to operate in similar ways. For example, when wages go up in one labor market, they tend to
       go up in others too. When economists talk about the labor market, they are describing these similarities.

       The labor market, like all markets, has a demand and a supply. Why do firms demand labor? Why is an
       employer willing to pay you for your labor? It's not because the employer likes you or is socially conscious.
       Rather, it's because your labor is worth something to the employer--your work brings in revenues to the firm.
       How much is an employer willing to pay? That depends on the skills and experience you bring to the firm.

       If a firm wants to maximize profits, it will never pay more (in terms of wages and benefits) for a worker than the
       value of their marginal productivity to the firm. We call this the first rule of labor markets.

       Suppose a worker can produce two widgets per hour and the firm can sell each widget for $4 each. Then the
       worker is generating $8 per hour in revenues to the firm, and a profit-maximizing employer will pay the
       worker up to, but no more than, $8 per hour, because that is what the worker is worth to the firm.

       Recall the definition of marginal product. Marginal product is the additional output a firm can produce by
       adding one more worker to the production process. Since employers often hire labor by the hour, we'll define

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                  14.1 · The Theory of Labor Markets 329

marginal product as the additional output the firm produces by adding one more worker hour to the
production process. In this chapter, we assume that workers in a particular labor market are
homogeneous--they have the same background, experience and skills and they put in the same amount of
effort. Thus, marginal product depends on the capital and technology with which workers have to work.

A typist can type more pages per hour with an electric typewriter than a manual typewriter, and the typist can
type even more pages per hour with a personal computer and word processing software. A ditch digger can dig
more cubic feet of dirt in an hour with a backhoe than with a shovel.

Thus, we can define the demand for labor as the marginal product of labor times the value of that output to the
firm.

TABLE 14.1 Marginal Product
of Labor

FIGURE 14.2 Marginal Product of Labor Because of fixed capital, the marginal product of labor declines as the
employer hires additional workers.

On what does the value of each worker's marginal product depend? If we assume that the employer sells its
output in a perfectly competitive market, the value of each worker's output will be the market price of the
product. Thus,

Demand for Labor = MPL x P = Value of the Marginal Product of Labor
We show this in Table 14.2, which is an expanded version of Table 14.1

       Note that the value of each additional worker is less than the value of the ones who came before.

       FIGURE 14.3 Value of the Marginal Product of Labor For firms operating in a competitive output market, the value of
       additional output sold is the price the firms receive for the output. Since MPL declines with additional labor
       employed, while that marginal product is worth the market price, the value of the marginal product declines as
       employment increases.

      Demand for Labor in Perfectly Competitive Output Markets

       The question for any firm is how much labor to hire.
       We can define a Perfectly Competitive Labor Market as one where firms can hire all the labor they want at the
       going market wage. Think about secretaries in a large city. Employers who need secretaries can probably hire
       as many as they need if they pay the going wage rate.
       Graphically, this means that firms face a horizontal supply curve for labor, as Figure 14.3 shows.
       Given the market wage, profit maximizing firms hire workers up to the point where: Wmkt = VMPL

       FIGURE 14.4 Equilibrium Employment for Firms in a Competitive Labor Market In a perfectly competitive labor
       market, firms can hire all the labor they want at the going market wage. Therefore, they hire workers up to the point
       L1 where the going market wage equals the value of the marginal product of labor.

         CLEAR IT UP

Derived Demand

Economists describe the demand for inputs like labor as a derived demand. Since the demand for labor is MPL*P, it
is dependent on the demand for the product the firm is producing. We show this by the P term in the demand for
labor. An increase in demand for the firm's product drives up the product's price, which increases the firm's demand
for labor. Thus, we derive the demand for labor from the demand for the firm's output.

Demand for Labor in Imperfectly Competitive Output Markets

If the employer does not sell its output in a perfectly competitive industry, they face a downward sloping
demand curve for output, which means that in order to sell additional output the firm must lower its price.
This is true if the firm is a monopoly, but it's also true if the firm is an oligopoly or monopolistically
competitive. In this situation, the value of a worker's marginal product is the marginal revenue, not the price.
Thus, the demand for labor is the marginal product times the marginal revenue.

TABLE 14.3 Marginal Revenue Product

FIGURE 14.5 Marginal Revenue Product For firms with some market power in their output market, the value of
additional output sold is the firm's marginal revenue. Since MPL declines with additional labor employed and since
MR declines with additional output sold, the firm's marginal revenue declines as employment increases.

Everything else remains the same as we described above in the discussion of the labor demand in perfectly
competitive labor markets. Given the market wage, profit-maximizing firms will hire workers up to the point
where the market wage equals the marginal revenue product, as Figure 14.6 shows.
332 14 · Labor Markets and Income

       FIGURE 14.6 Equilibrium Level of Employment for Firms with Market Power For firms with market power in their
       output market, they choose the number of workers, L2, where the going market wage equals the firm's marginal
       revenue product. Note that since marginal revenue is less than price, the demand for labor for a firm which has
       market power in its output market is less than the demand for labor (L1) for a perfectly competitive firm. As a result,
       employment will be lower in an imperfectly competitive industry than in a perfectly competitive industry.

                CLEAR IT UP
      Do Profit Maximizing Employers Exploit Labor?

       If you look back at Figure 14.4, you will see that the firm pays only the last worker it hires what they're worth to the
       firm. Every other worker brings in more revenue than the firm pays them. This has sometimes led to the claim that
       employers exploit workers because they do not pay workers what they are worth. Let's think about this claim. The
       first worker is worth $x to the firm, and the second worker is worth $y, but why are they worth that much? It is
       because of the capital and technology with which they work. The difference between workers' worth and their
       compensation goes to pay for the capital and technology, without which the workers wouldn't have a job. The
       difference also goes to the employer's profit, without which the firm would close and workers wouldn't have a job.
       The firm may be earning excessive profits, but that is a different topic of discussion.

      What Determines the Going Market Wage Rate?

       In the chapter on Labor and Financial Markets, we learned that the labor market has demand and supply
       curves like other markets. The demand for labor curve is a downward sloping function of the wage rate. The
       market demand for labor is the horizontal sum of all firms' demands for labor. The supply of labor curve is an
       upward sloping function of the wage rate. This is because if wages for a particular type of labor increase in a
       particular labor market, people with appropriate skills may change jobs, and vacancies will attract people from
       outside the geographic area. The market supply of labor is the horizontal summation of all individuals'
       supplies of labor.

FIGURE 14.7 The Market Wage Rate In a competitive labor market, the equilibrium wage and employment level are
determined where the market demand for labor equals the market supply of labor.
Like all equilibrium prices, the market wage rate is determined through the interaction of supply and demand
in the labor market. Thus, we can see in Figure 14.7 for competitive markets the wage rate and number of
workers hired.
The FRED database has a great deal of data on labor markets, starting at the wage rate and number of workers
hired (https://openstax.org/l/cat10).
The United States Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes The Current Population Survey,
which is a monthly survey of households (you can find a link to it by going to the FRED database found in the
previous link), which provides data on labor supply, including numerous measures of the labor force size
(disaggregated by age, gender and educational attainment), labor force participation rates for different
demographic groups, and employment. It also includes more than 3,500 measures of earnings by different
demographic groups.
The Current Employment Statistics, which is a survey of businesses, offers alternative estimates of
employment across all sectors of the economy.
The FRED database, found in the previous link, also has a link labeled "Productivity and Costs" has a wide
range of data on productivity, labor costs, and profits across the business sector.

14.2 Wages and Employment in an Imperfectly Competitive Labor Market

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Define monopsony power
  · Explain how imperfectly competitive labor markets determine wages and employment, where employers

      have market power
In the chapters on market structure, we observed that while economists use the theory of perfect competition
as an ideal case of market structure, there are very few examples of perfectly competitive industries in the real
world. What about labor markets? How many labor markets are perfectly competitive? There are probably
more examples of perfectly competitive labor markets than perfectly competitive product markets, but that
doesn't mean that all labor markets are competitive.
When a job applicant is bargaining with an employer for a position, the applicant is often at a
disadvantage--needing the job more than the employer needs that particular applicant. John Bates Clark
(1847-1938), often named as the first great American economist, wrote in 1907: "In the making of the wages
contract the individual laborer is always at a disadvantage. He has something which he is obliged to sell and
334 14 · Labor Markets and Income

which his employer is not obliged to take, since he [that is, the employer] can reject single men with impunity."

To give workers more power, the U.S. government has passed, in response to years of labor protests, a number
of laws to create a more equal balance of power between workers and employers. These laws include some of
the following:

  · Setting minimum hourly wages
  · Setting maximum hours of work (at least before employers pay overtime rates)
  · Prohibiting child labor
  · Regulating health and safety conditions in the workplace
  · Preventing discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and age
  · Requiring employers to provide family leave
  · Requiring employers to give advance notice of layoffs
  · Covering workers with unemployment insurance
  · Setting a limit on the number of immigrant workers from other countries

Table 14.4 lists some prominent U.S. workplace protection laws. Many of the laws listed in the table were only
the start of labor market regulations in these areas and have been followed, over time, by other related laws,
regulations, and court rulings.

TABLE 14.4 Prominent U.S. Workplace Protection Laws

There are two sources of imperfect competition in labor markets. These are demand side sources, that is, labor
market power by employers, and supply side sources: labor market power by employees. In this section we will
discuss the former. In the next section we will discuss the latter.

A competitive labor market is one where there are many potential employers for a given type of worker, say a
secretary or an accountant. Suppose there is only one employer in a labor market. Because that employer has
no direct competition in hiring, if they offer lower wages than would exist in a competitive market, employees
will have few options. If they want a job, they must accept the offered wage rate. Since the employer is
exploiting its market power, we call the firm a monopsony, a term introduced and widely discussed by Joan
Robinson (though she credited scholar Bertrand Hallward with invention of the word). The classical example of
monopsony is the sole coal company in a West Virginia town. If coal miners want to work, they must accept
what the coal company is paying. This is not the only example of monopsony. Think about surgical nurses in a
town with only one hospital. A situation in which employers have at least some market power over potential
employees is not that unusual. After all, most firms have many employees while there is only one employer.
Thus, even if there is some competition for workers, it may not feel that way to potential employees unless they
do their research and find the opposite.

How does market power by an employer affect labor market outcomes? Intuitively, one might think that wages
will be lower than in a competitive labor market. Let's prove it. We will tell the story for a monopsonist, but the
results will be qualitatively similar, although less extreme, for any firm with labor market power.

Think back to monopoly. The good news for the firm is that because the monopolist is the sole supplier in the
market, it can charge any price it wishes. The bad news is that if it wants to sell a greater quantity of output, it
must lower the price it charges. Monopsony is analogous. Because the monopsonist is the sole employer in a
labor market, it can offer any wage that it wishes. However, because they face the market supply curve for
labor, if they want to hire more workers, they must raise the wage they pay. This creates a quandary, which we
can understand by introducing a new concept: the marginal cost of labor. The marginal cost of labor is the
cost to the firm of hiring one more worker. However, here is the thing: we assume that the firm is determining
how many workers to hire in total. They are not hiring sequentially. Let's look how this plays out with the
336 14 · Labor Markets and Income

example in Table 14.5.

Supply of Labor                    1   2   3   4    5

Wage Rate                          $1 per hour $2 per hour $3 per hour $4 per hour $5 per hour

Total Cost of Labor                $1  $4  $9  $16  $25

Marginal Cost of Labor $1              $3  $5  $7   $9

TABLE 14.5 The Marginal Cost of Labor

There are a couple of things to notice from the table. First, the marginal cost increases faster than the wage
rate. In fact, for any number of workers more than one, the marginal cost of labor is greater than the wage. This
is because to hire one more worker requires paying a higher wage rate, not just for the new worker but for all
the previous hires also. We can see this graphically in Figure 14.7.

FIGURE 14.8 The Marginal Cost of Labor Since monopsonies are the sole demander for labor, they face the market
supply curve for labor. In order to increase employment they must raise the wage they pay not just for new workers,
but for all the existing workers they could have hired at the previous lower wage. As a result, the marginal cost of
hiring additional labor is greater than the wage, and thus for any level of employment (above the first worker), MCL is
above the Market Supply of Labor.

FIGURE 14.9 Labor Market Outcomes Under Monopsony A monopsony will hire workers up to the point Lm where
its demand for labor equals the marginal cost of additional labor, paying the wage Wm given by the supply curve of

                                                                                                14.3 · Market Power on the Supply Side of Labor Markets: Unions 337

labor necessary to obtain Lm workers.
If the firm wants to maximize profits, it will hire labor up to the point Lm where DL = VMP (or MRP) = MCL, as
Figure 14.9 shows. Then, the supply curve for labor shows the wage the firm will have to pay to attract Lm
workers. Graphically, we can draw a vertical line up from Lm to the Supply Curve for the label and then read
the wage Wm off the vertical axis to the left.
How does this outcome compare to what would occur in a perfectly competitive market? A competitive market
would operate where DL = SL, hiring Lc workers and paying Wc wage. In other words, under monopsony
employers hire fewer workers and pay a lower wage. While pure monopsony may be rare, many employers
have some degree of market power in labor markets. The outcomes for those employers will be qualitatively
similar though not as extreme as monopsony.

FIGURE 14.10 Comparison of labor market outcomes: Monopsony vs. Perfect Competition A monopsony hires
fewer workers (Lm) than would be hired in a competitive labor market (Lc). In exploiting its market power, the
monopsony can also pay a lower wage (Wm) than workers would earn in a competitive labor market (Wc).

14.3 Market Power on the Supply Side of Labor Markets: Unions

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Explain the concept of labor unions, including membership levels and wages
  · Evaluate arguments for and against labor unions
  · Analyze reasons for the decline in U.S. union membership
A labor union is an organization of workers that negotiates with employers over wages and working conditions.
A labor union seeks to change the balance of power between employers and workers by requiring employers to
deal with workers collectively, rather than as individuals. As such, a labor union operates like a monopoly in a
labor market. We sometimes call negotiations between unions and firms collective bargaining.
The subject of labor unions can be controversial. Supporters of labor unions view them as the workers'
primary line of defense against efforts by profit-seeking firms to hold down wages and benefits. Critics of labor
unions view them as having a tendency to grab as much as they can in the short term, even if it means injuring
workers in the long run by driving firms into bankruptcy or by blocking the new technologies and production
methods that lead to economic growth. We will start with some facts about union membership in the United
States.

Facts about Union Membership and Pay

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics, about 10.3% of all U.S. workers belong to unions. This
represents nearly a 50% reduction since 1983 (the earliest year for which comparable data are available),
338 14 · Labor Markets and Income

when union members were 20.1% of all workers. Following are some facts about unions for 2021 (note that we
are using the population categories and group names utilized in the data collection and publication):

  · 10.6% of U.S. male workers belong to unions; 9.9% of female workers do
  · 10.7% of White workers, 12.3% of Black workers, and 9.8 % of Hispanic workers belong to unions
  · 11.8% of full-time workers and 5.7% of part-time workers are union members
  · 4.4% of workers ages 16-24 belong to unions, as do 13.2% of workers ages 45-54
  · Occupations in which relatively high percentages of workers belong to unions are the federal government

      (26.0% belong to a union), state government (29.9%), local government (41.7%); transportation and
      utilities (17.6%); natural resources, construction, and maintenance (15.9%); and production,
      transportation, and material moving (13.3%)
  · Occupations that have relatively low percentages of unionized workers are agricultural workers (1.7%),
      financial services (1.9%), professional and business services (2.2%), leisure and hospitality (2.2%), and
      wholesale and retail trade (4.5%)

In summary, the percentage of workers belonging to a union is higher for men than women; higher for Black
than for White or Hispanic people; higher for the 45-64 age range; and higher among workers in government
and manufacturing than workers in agriculture or service-oriented jobs. Table 14.6 lists the largest U.S. labor
unions and their membership.

TABLE 14.6 The Largest American Unions in 2021 (Source: U.S. Department of Labor and individual union websites)

In terms of pay, benefits, and hiring, U.S. unions offer a good news/bad news story. The good news for unions
and their members is that their members earn about 20% more than nonunion workers, even after adjusting
for factors such as years of work experience and education level. The bad news for unions is that the share of
U.S. workers who belong to a labor union has been steadily declining for 50 years, as Figure 14.11 shows.
About one-quarter of all U.S. workers belonged to a union in the mid-1950s, but only 10.3% of U.S. workers are
union members today. If you leave out government workers (which includes teachers in public schools), only
6.1% of the workers employed by private firms now work for a union.

FIGURE 14.11 Percentage of Wage and Salary Workers Who Are Union Members The share of wage and salary
workers who belong to unions rose sharply in the 1930s and 1940s, but has tailed off since then to 10.3% of all
workers in 2021.
The following section analyzes the higher pay union workers receive compared the pay rates for nonunion
workers. The section after that analyzes declining union membership levels. An overview of these two issues
will allow us to discuss many aspects of how unions work.
Higher Wages for Union Workers
How does a union affect wages and employment? Because a union is the sole supplier of labor, it can act like a
monopoly and ask for whatever wage rate it can obtain for its workers. If employers need workers, they have to
meet the union's wage demand.
What are the limits on how much higher pay union workers can receive? To analyze these questions, let's
consider a situation where all firms in an industry must negotiate with a single union, and no firm is allowed to
hire nonunion labor. If no labor union existed in this market, then equilibrium (E) in the labor market would
occur at the intersection of the demand for labor (D) and the supply of labor (S) as we see in Figure 14.12. This
is the same result as we showed in Figure 14.6 above. The union can, however, threaten that, unless firms
agree to the wages they demand, the workers will strike. As a result, the labor union manages to achieve,
through negotiations with the firms, a union wage of Wu for its members, above what the equilibrium wage
would otherwise have been.
340 14 · Labor Markets and Income

       FIGURE 14.12 Union Wage Negotiations Without a union, the equilibrium at E would have involved the wage We
       and the quantity of labor Qe. However, the union is able to use its bargaining power to raise the wage to Wu. The
       result is an excess supply of labor for union jobs. That is, a quantity of labor supplied, Qs is greater than firms'
       quantity demanded for labor, Qd.
       This labor market situation resembles what a monopoly firm does in selling a product, but in this case a union
       is a monopoly selling labor to firms. At the higher union wage Wu, the firms in this industry will hire less labor
       than they would have hired in equilibrium. Moreover, an excess supply of workers want union jobs, but firms
       will not be hiring for such jobs.
       From the union point of view, workers who receive higher wages are better off. However, notice that the
       quantity of workers (Qd) hired at the union wage Wu is smaller than the quantity Qe that the firm would have
       hired at the original equilibrium wage. A sensible union must recognize that when it pushes up the wage, it
       also reduces the firms' incentive to hire. This situation does not necessarily mean that union workers are fired.
       Instead, it may be that when union workers move on to other jobs or retire, they are not always replaced, or
       perhaps when a firm expands production, it expands employment somewhat less with a higher union wage
       than it would have done with the lower equilibrium wage. Other situations could be that a firm decides to
       purchase inputs from nonunion producers, rather than producing them with its own highly paid unionized
       workers, or perhaps the firm moves or opens a new facility in a state or country where unions are less
       powerful.
       From the firm's point of view, the key question is whether union workers' higher wages are matched by higher
       productivity. If so, then the firm can afford to pay the higher union wages and, the demand curve for
       "unionized" labor could actually shift to the right. This could reduce the job losses as the equilibrium
       employment level shifts to the right and the difference between the equilibrium and the union wages will have
       been reduced. If worker unionization does not increase productivity, then the higher union wage will cause
       lower profits or losses for the firm.
       Union workers might have higher productivity than nonunion workers for a number of reasons. First, higher
       wages may elicit higher productivity. Second, union workers tend to stay longer at a given job, a trend that
       reduces the employer's costs for training and hiring and results in workers with more years of experience.
       Many unions also offer job training and apprenticeship programs.
       In addition, firms that are confronted with union demands for higher wages may choose production methods
       that involve more physical capital and less labor, resulting in increased labor productivity. Table 14.7 provides
       an example. Assume that a firm can produce a home exercise cycle with three different combinations of labor
       and manufacturing equipment. Say that the firm pays labor $16 an hour (including benefits) and the machines

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                              14.3 · Market Power on the Supply Side of Labor Markets: Unions 341

for manufacturing cost $200 each. Under these circumstances, the total cost of producing a home exercise
cycle will be lowest if the firm adopts the plan of 50 hours of labor and one machine, as the table shows. Now,
suppose that a union negotiates a wage of $20 an hour including benefits. In this case, it makes no difference to
the firm whether it uses more hours of labor and fewer machines or less labor and more machines, although it
might prefer to use more machines and to hire fewer union workers. (After all, machines never threaten to
strike--but they do not buy the final product or service either.)

In the final column of the table, the wage has risen to $24 an hour. In this case, the firm clearly has an incentive
for using the plan that involves paying for fewer hours of labor and using three machines. If management
responds to union demands for higher wages by investing more in machinery, then union workers can be
more productive because they are working with more or better physical capital equipment than the typical
nonunion worker. However, the firm will need to hire fewer workers.

TABLE 14.7 Three Production Choices to Manufacture a Home Exercise Cycle

In some cases, unions have discouraged the use of labor-saving physical capital equipment--out of the
reasonable fear that new machinery will reduce the number of union jobs. For example, in 2015, the union
representing longshoremen who unload ships and the firms that operate shipping companies and port
facilities staged a work stoppage that shut down the ports on the western coast of the United States. Two key
issues in the dispute were the desire of the shipping companies and port operators to use handheld scanners
for record-keeping and computer-operated cabs for loading and unloading ships--changes which the union
opposed, along with overtime pay. President Obama threatened to use the Labor Management Relations Act of
1947--commonly known as the Taft-Hartley Act--where a court can impose an 80-day "cooling-off period" in
order to allow time for negotiations to proceed without the threat of a work stoppage. Federal mediators were
called in, and the two sides agreed to a deal in February 2015. The ultimate agreement allowed the new
technologies, but also kept wages, health, and pension benefits high for workers. In the past, presidential use
of the Taft-Hartley Act sometimes has made labor negotiations more bitter and argumentative but, in this case,
it seems to have smoothed the road to an agreement.

In other instances, unions have proved quite willing to adopt new technologies. In one prominent example,
during the 1950s and 1960s, the United Mineworkers union demanded that mining companies install labor-
saving machinery in the mines. The mineworkers' union realized that over time, the new machines would
reduce the number of jobs in the mines, but the union leaders also knew that the mine owners would have to
pay higher wages if the workers became more productive, and mechanization was a necessary step toward
greater productivity.

In fact, in some cases union workers may be more willing to accept new technology than nonunion workers,
because the union workers believe that the union will negotiate to protect their jobs and wages, whereas
nonunion workers may be more concerned that the new technology will replace their jobs. In addition, union
workers, who typically have higher job market experience and training, are likely to suffer less and benefit
more than non-union workers from the introduction of new technology. Overall, it is hard to make a definitive
case that union workers as a group are always either more or less welcoming to new technology than are
nonunion workers

       The Decline in U.S. Union Membership
       The proportion of U.S. workers belonging to unions has declined dramatically since the early 1950s.
       Economists have offered a number of possible explanations:

         · The shift from manufacturing to service industries
         · The force of globalization and increased competition from foreign producers
         · A reduced desire for unions because of the workplace protection laws now in place
         · U.S. legal environment that makes it relatively more difficult for unions to organize workers and expand

             their membership
       Let's discuss each of these four explanations in more detail.
       A first possible explanation for the decline in the share of U.S. workers belonging to unions involves the
       patterns of job growth in the manufacturing and service sectors of the economy as Figure 14.13 shows. The
       U.S. economy had about 15 million manufacturing jobs in 1960. This total rose to 19 million by the late 1970s
       and then declined to 17 million in 2013. Meanwhile, the number of jobs in service industries (including
       government employment) rose from 35 million in 1960 to over 118 million by 2013, according to the Bureau of
       Labor Statistics. Because over time unions were stronger in manufacturing than in service industries, the
       growth in jobs was not happening where the unions were. It is interesting to note that government workers
       comprise several of the biggest unions in the country, including the American Federation of State, County
       and Municipal Employees (AFSCME); the Service Employees International Union; and the National
       Education Association. Table 14.8 lists the membership of each of these unions. Outside of government
       employees, however, unions have not had great success in organizing the service sector.

       FIGURE 14.13 The Growth of Service Jobs Jobs in services have increased dramatically for more than the past 50
       years. Jobs in government have increased modestly until 1990 and then declined slightly since then. Jobs in
       manufacturing peaked in the late 1970s and have declined more than a third since then.
       A second explanation for the decline in the share of unionized workers looks at import competition. Starting in
       the 1960s, U.S. carmakers and steelmakers faced increasing competition from Japanese and European
       manufacturers. As sales of imported cars and steel rose, the number of jobs in U.S. auto manufacturing fell.

This industry is heavily unionized. Not surprisingly, membership in the United Auto Workers, which was
975,000 in 1985, had fallen to roughly 390,000 by 2015. Import competition not only decreases the
employment in sectors where unions were once strong, but also decreases the bargaining power of unions in
those sectors. However, as we have seen, unions that organize public-sector workers, who are not threatened
by import competition, have continued to see growth.

A third possible reason for the decline in the number of union workers is that citizens often call on their
elected representatives to pass laws concerning work conditions, overtime, parental leave, regulation of
pensions, and other issues. Unions offered strong political support for these laws aimed at protecting workers
but, in an ironic twist, the passage of those laws then made many workers feel less need for unions.

These first three possible reasons for the decline of unions are all somewhat plausible, but they have a
common problem. Most other developed economies have experienced similar economic and political trends,
such as the shift from manufacturing to services, globalization, and increasing government social benefits and
regulation of the workplace. Clearly there are cultural differences between countries as to their acceptance of
unions in the workplace. The share of the population belonging to unions in other countries is very high
compared with the share in the United States. Table 14.8 shows the proportion of workers in a number of the
world's high-income economies who belong to unions. The United States is near the bottom, along with France
and Spain. The last column shows union coverage, defined as including those workers whose wages are
determined by a union negotiation even if the workers do not officially belong to the union. In the United
States, union membership is almost identical to union coverage. However, in many countries, the wages of
many workers who do not officially belong to a union are still determined by collective bargaining between
unions and firms.

TABLE 14.8 International Comparisons of Union Membership and Coverage in 2012 (Source, CIA World Factbook,
retrieved from www.cia.gov)

These international differences in union membership suggest a fourth reason for the decline of union
membership in the United States: perhaps U.S. laws are less friendly to the formation of unions than such laws
in other countries. The close connection between union membership and a friendly legal environment is
344 14 · Labor Markets and Income

       apparent in the history of U.S. unions. The great rise in union membership in the 1930s followed the passage
       of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, which specified that workers had a right to organize unions and
       that management had to give them a fair chance to do so. The U.S. government strongly encouraged forming
       unions during the early 1940s in the belief that unions would help to coordinate the all-out production efforts
       needed during World War II. However, after World War II came the passage of the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947,
       which gave states the power to allow workers to opt out of the union in their workplace if they so desired. This
       law made the legal climate less encouraging to those seeking to form unions, and union membership levels
       soon started declining.
       The procedures for forming a union differ substantially from country to country. For example, the procedures
       in the United States and those in Canada are strikingly different. When a group of workers wishes to form a
       union in the United States, they announce this fact and set an election date when the firm's employees will vote
       in a secret ballot on whether to form a union. Supporters of the union lobby for a "yes" vote, and the firm's
       management lobbies for a "no" vote--often even hiring outside consultants for assistance in swaying workers
       to vote "no." In Canada, by contrast, a union is formed when a sufficient proportion of workers (usually about
       60%) signs an official card saying that they want a union. There is no separate "election date." The
       management of Canadian firms is limited by law in its ability to lobby against the union. In addition, although
       it is illegal to discriminate and fire workers based on their union activity in the United States, the penalties are
       slight, making this a not so costly way of deterring union activity. In short, forming unions is easier in
       Canada--and in many other countries--than in the United States.
       In summary, union membership in the United States is lower than in many other high-income countries, a
       difference that may be due to different legal environments and cultural attitudes toward unions.

market, but the equilibrium wage is indeterminate, somewhere in the range between Wu, what the union would
choose, and Wm, what the monopsony would choose.

Figure 14.14 is a combination of Figure 14.6 and Figure 14.11. A monopsony wants to reduce wages as well as
employment, Wm and L* in the figure. A union wants to increase wages, but at the cost of lower employment,
Wu and L* in the figure. Since both sides want to reduce employment, we can be sure that the outcome will be
lower employment compared to a competitive labor market. What happens to the wage, though, is based on
the monopsonist's relative bargaining power compared to the bargaining power of the union. The actual
outcome is indeterminate in the graph, but it will be closer to Wu if the union has more power and closer to
Wm if the monopsonist has more power.

14.5 Employment Discrimination

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Analyze earnings gaps based on race and gender
  · Explain the impact of discrimination in a competitive market
  · Identify U.S. public policies designed to reduce discrimination

Barriers to equitable participation in the labor market drive down economic growth. When certain populations
are underrepresented, underpaid, or mistreated in a labor market or industry, the negative outcomes can
effect the larger economy. For example, many science and technology fields were either unwelcoming or
overtly unaccepting of women and people of color. Some major contributors to these fields overcame these
challenges. Mexican-American scientist Lydia Villa-Komaroff, for example, faced overt discrimination when
her college advisor told her not to pursue chemistry because women didn't "belong" in chemistry. She pursued
biology instead; she developed the first instance of synthetic insulin (the chemical that people with diabetes
need in order to survive) through a process that has saved million of lives and is credited with launching the
entire industry of biotechnology--one of the most important in the U.S. economy. But for every Villa-Komaroff,
there have been thousands of women who were prevented from making those contributions. Beyond the
personal impact on those people, consider the impact on those scientific fields, our overall quality of life, and
the economy itself. Economist Lisa D. Cook has quantified the costs of these innovation losses. She estimates
that GDP could be as much as 4.4% higher if women and people from minority populations were fully able to
participate in the science and technology innovation process.

Discrimination involves acting on the belief that members of a certain group are inferior or deserve less solely
because of a factor such as race, gender, or religion. There are many types of discrimination but the focus here
will be on discrimination in labor markets, which arises if workers with the same skill levels--as measured by
education, experience, and expertise--receive different pay or have different job opportunities because of their
race or gender. Much of the data collected and published on these topics are limited in terms of the diversity of
people represented, and focus particularly on binary gender, single-race, and single-ethnicity identities. While
these characterizations do not capture the diversity of Americans, the findings are important in order to
understand discrimination and other practices, and to consider the impacts of policies and changes. Also,
while sex and gender are different, many data sets, laws, court decisions, and media accounts use the terms
interchangeably. For consistency, we will use the terminology found in the source material and government
data.

Earnings Gaps by Race and Gender

A possible signal of labor market discrimination is when an employer pays one group less than another. Figure
14.15 shows the average wage of Black workers as a ratio of the average wage of White workers and the average
wage of female workers as a ratio of the average wage of male workers. Research by the economists Francine
Blau and Laurence Kahn shows that the gap between the earnings of women and men did not move much in
the 1970s, but has declined since the 1980s. Detailed analysis by economists Kerwin Kofi Charles and Patrick
346 14 · Labor Markets and Income

       Bayer show that the gap between the earnings of Black and White people diminished in the 1970s, but grew
       again so that current differences are as wide as they were nearly 70 years ago. In both gender and race, an
       earnings gap remains.

       FIGURE 14.15 Wage Ratios by Sex and Race The ratio of wages for Black workers to White workers rose
       substantially in the late 1960s and through the 1970s. The 1990s saw a peak above 80% followed by a bumpy
       decline to the low 70s. The ratio of wages for female to male workers changed little through the 1970s. In both
       cases, a gap remains between the average wages of Black and White workers and between the average wages of
       female and male workers. Source: U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.
       An earnings gap between average wages, in and of itself, does not prove that discrimination is occurring in the
       labor market. We need to apply the same productivity characteristics to all parties (employees) involved.
       Gender discrimination in the labor market occurs when employers pay people of a specific gender less despite
       those people having comparable levels of education, experience, and expertise. (Read the Clear It Up about the
       sex-discrimination suit brought against Walmart.) Similarly, racial discrimination in the labor market exists
       when employers pay racially diverse employees less than their coworkers of the majority race despite having
       comparable levels of education, experience, and expertise. To bring a successful gender discrimination
       lawsuit, an employee must prove the employer is paying them less than an employee of a different gender who
       holds a similar job, with similar educational attainment, and with similar expertise. Likewise, someone who
       wants to sue on the grounds of racial discrimination must prove that the employer pays them less than an
       employee of another race who holds a similar job, with similar educational attainment, and with similar
       expertise.
       The FRED database includes earnings data at earnings by age, gender and race/ethnicity (https://openstax.org/
       l/33501).
       As stated previously and as we will see below, not every instance of a wage gap or employment inequity is a
       product of overt discrimination on the part of individual employers. Significant overall issues in societies, such
       as inequitable education or housing segregation, can lead to earning gaps and limitations on economic
       mobility. However, these wider issues usually affect people from minority populations and/or those who have
       been historically underrepresented in positions of power. Economist William A. Darity Jr., whose work is
       discussed in more detail below, indicates that individualized employer racism still exists, but it is largely
       practiced in "covert and subtle forms."

         CLEAR IT UP

What was the sex-discrimination case against Walmart?

In one of the largest class-action sex-discrimination cases in U.S. history, 1.2 million female employees of Walmart
claimed that the company engaged in wage and promotion discrimination. In 2011, the Supreme Court threw out
the case on the grounds that the group was too large and too diverse to consider the case a class action suit.
Lawyers for the women regrouped and were subsequently suing in smaller groups. Part of the difficulty for the
female employees is that the court said that local managers made pay and promotion decisions that were not
necessarily the company's policies as a whole. Consequently, female Walmart employees in Texas argued that their
new suit would challenge the management of a "discrete group of regional district and store managers." They
claimed that these managers made biased pay and promotion decisions. However, in 2013, a federal district court
rejected a smaller California class action suit against the company.

On other issues, Walmart made the news again in 2013 when the National Labor Relations Board found Walmart
guilty of illegally penalizing and firing workers who took part in labor protests and strikes. Walmart paid $11.7
million in back wages and compensation damages to women in Kentucky who were denied jobs due to their sex.
And in 2020, a sex-based hiring discrimination lawsuit was filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC), in which the EEOC alleged that Walmart conducted a physical ability test (known as the PAT) as
a requirement for applicants to be hired as order fillers at Walmart's grocery distribution centers nationwide, and
that the PAT disproportionately excluded female applicants from jobs as grocery order fillers. In September 2020,
Walmart and the EEOC agreed to a consent decree, which requires Walmart to cease all physical ability testing that
had been used for purposes of hiring grocery distribution center order fillers. The decree also required Walmart to
pay $20 million into a settlement fund to pay lost wages to women across the country who were denied grocery
order filler positions because of the testing.

Investigating the Female/Male Earnings Gap

As a result of changes in law and culture, women began to enter the paid workforce in substantial numbers in
the mid- to late-twentieth century. As of February 2022, 56.0% of women aged 20 and over held jobs, while
67.6% of men aged 20 and over did. Moreover, along with entering the workforce, women began to ratchet up
their education levels. In 1971, 44% of undergraduate college degrees went to women. As of the 2018-19
academic year, women earned 57% of bachelor's degrees. In 1970, women received 5.4% of the degrees from
law schools and 8.4% of the degrees from medical schools. By 2017, women were receiving just over 50% of
the law degrees, and by 2019, 48% of the medical degrees. There are now slightly more women than men in
both law schools and medical schools. These gains in education and experience have reduced the female/male
wage gap over time. However, concerns remain about the extent to which women have not yet assumed a
substantial share of the positions at the top of the largest companies or in the U.S. Congress.

There are factors that can lower women's average wages. Women are likely to bear a disproportionately large
share of household responsibilities. A mother of young children is more likely to drop out of the labor force for
several years or work on a reduced schedule than is the father. As a result, women in their 30s and 40s are
likely, on average, to have less job experience than men. In the United States, childless women with the same
education and experience levels as men are typically paid comparably. However, women with families and
children are typically paid about 7% to 14% less than other women of similar education and work experience.
Meanwhile, married men earn about 10% to 15% more than single men with comparable education and work
experience. This circumstance or practice is often referred to as the "motherhood penalty" and the
"fatherhood bonus."

Another aspect of the gender pay gap relates to work that isn't actually paid, such as household chores, caring
for children and other family members, and cooking. Studies have found that globally and within the United
States, women undertake far more of this work than do men; even women who work full time and/or bring in
348 14 · Labor Markets and Income

       the majority of family income take on more of this unpaid work than the men in their households.
       Economists study many aspects of sex- and gender-based earnings gaps, often revealing unexpected causes
       and impacts. For example, economists Jessica Pan, Jonathan Guryan, and Kerwin Kofi Charles analyzed
       decades of sociological and employment data and uncovered that the amount of sexism in the U.S. state where
       a woman was born is an indicator of the woman's earnings throughout her life, even if she moves away from
       her home state. In other words, women born in states with more pronounced sexist attitudes earn less, no
       matter where they live later on. Other economists showed that from 1950-2000, as women's representation
       increased in the workforce, jobs that became occupied by women experienced wage reductions relative to jobs
       being done by men--an outcome often referred to as "devaluation." The value of this research and similar
       investigations comes from the deeper understanding of the origins of the earnings gap, so that workers,
       employers, and governments can take steps to address them.

      Investigating the Earnings Gap Related to Race and Ethnicity

       Black people experienced blatant labor market discrimination during much of the twentieth century. Until the
       passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, it was legal in many states to refuse to hire a Black worker, regardless of
       the credentials or experience of that worker. Moreover, Black people were often denied access to educational
       opportunities, which in turn meant that they had lower levels of qualifications for many jobs. At least one
       economic study has shown that the 1964 law is partially responsible for the narrowing of the gap in
       Black-White earnings in the late 1960s and into the 1970s. For example, the ratio of total earnings of Black
       male workers to White male workers rose from 62% in 1964 to 75.3% in 2013, according to the Bureau of
       Labor Statistics.
       However, the earnings gap between Black and White workers has not changed as much as the earnings gap
       between men and women has in the last half century. The remaining racial gap seems related both to
       continuing differences in education levels and to the presence of discrimination. Table 14.9 shows that the
       percentage of Black people who complete a four-year college degree remains substantially lower than the
       percentage of White people who complete college. According to the U.S. Census, both White and Black people
       have higher levels of educational attainment than Hispanic people and lower levels than Asian people. The
       lower average levels of education for Black workers surely explain part of the earnings gap. In fact, Black
       women who have the same levels of education and experience as White women receive, on average, about the
       same level of pay. One study shows that White and Black college graduates have identical salaries immediately
       after college; however, the racial wage gap widens over time, an outcome that suggests the possibility of
       continuing discrimination. Other researchers conducted a field experiment by responding to job
       advertisements with fictitious resumes using names that were either commonly associated with Black/African
       American people or names commonly associated with White people; they found that the White-associated
       names received 50 percent more callbacks for interviews. This is suggestive of discrimination in job
       opportunities. Further, as the following Clear It Up feature explains, there is evidence to support that
       discrimination in the housing market is connected to employment discrimination.

A recent study by the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) department found that realtors showed Black
homebuyers 18 percent fewer homes compared to White homebuyers. Realtors showed Asian homebuyers 19
percent fewer properties. Additionally, Hispanic people experience more discrimination in renting apartments and
undergo stiffer credit checks than White renters. In a 2012 study by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development and the nonprofit Urban Institute, Hispanic testers who contacted agents about advertised rental units
received information about 12 percent fewer units available and were shown seven percent fewer units than White
renters. The $9 million study, based on research in 28 metropolitan areas, concluded that blatant "door slamming"
forms of discrimination are on the decline but that the discrimination that does exist is harder to detect, and as a
result, more difficult to remedy. According to the Chicago Tribune, HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan, who served in his
role from 2009-2014, told reporters, "Just because it's taken on a hidden form doesn't make it any less harmful.
You might not be able to move into that community with the good schools."

These practices are viewed as a continuation of redlining, which is the intentional and discriminatory withholding of
services or products based on race or other factors. Redlining was practiced extensively by banks and other lenders
who refused to issue mortgages or other loans to people from racial or ethnic minorities living in neighborhoods that
were deemed "hazardous" to investment, even though the same lenders would issue loans to White people with
similar economic status. Redlining has lasting effects today, demonstrated by significant divides in educational and
financial opportunity in certain neighborhoods or cities.

The lower levels of education for Black workers can also be a result of discrimination--although it may be pre-labor
market discrimination, rather than direct discrimination by employers in the labor market. For example, if redlining
and other discrimination in housing markets causes Black families to live clustered together in certain
neighborhoods and those areas have under-resourced schools, then those children will continue to have lower
educational attainment then their White counterparts and, consequently, not be able to obtain the higher paying
jobs that require higher levels of education. Another element to consider is that in the past, when Black people were
effectively barred from many high-paying jobs, obtaining additional education could have seemed not to be worth
the investment, because the educational degrees would not pay off. While the government has legally abolished
discriminatory labor practices, structures and systems take a very long time to eradicate.

Competitive Markets and Discrimination

Gary Becker (1930-2014), who won the Nobel Prize in economics in 1992, was one of the first to analyze
discrimination in economic terms. Becker pointed out that while competitive markets can allow some
employers to practice discrimination, it can also provide profit-seeking firms with incentives not to
discriminate. Given these incentives, Becker explored the question of why discrimination persists.

If a business is located in an area with a large minority population and refuses to sell to minorities, it will cut
into its own profits. If some businesses run by bigoted employers refuse to pay women and/or minorities a
350 14 · Labor Markets and Income

       wage based on their productivity, then other profit-seeking employers can hire these workers. In a competitive
       market, if the business owners care more about the color of money than about the color of skin, they will have
       an incentive to make buying, selling, hiring, and promotion decisions strictly based on economic factors.

       Do not underestimate the power of markets to offer at least a degree of freedom to oppressed groups. In many
       countries, cohesive minority population groups like Jewish people and emigrant Chinese people have
       managed to carve out a space for themselves through their economic activities, despite legal and social
       discrimination against them. Many immigrants, including those who come to the United States, have taken
       advantage of economic freedom to make new lives for themselves. However, history teaches that market forces
       alone are unlikely to eliminate discrimination. After all, discrimination against African Americans persisted in
       the market-oriented U.S. economy during the century between the ratification of the 13th Amendment, which
       abolished slavery in 1865, and the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964--and has continued since then, too.

       Why does discrimination persist in competitive markets? Gary Becker sought to explain this persistence.
       Discriminatory impulses can emerge at a number of levels: among managers, among workers, and among
       customers. Consider the situation of a store owner or manager who is not personally prejudiced, but who has
       many customers who are prejudiced. If that manager treats all groups fairly, the manager may find it drives
       away prejudiced customers. In such a situation, a policy of nondiscrimination could reduce the firm's profits.
       After all, a business firm is part of society, and a firm that does not follow the societal norms is likely to suffer.

       As economist William A. Darity Jr. points out, however, the "prejudiced customer" rationale falls apart when
       considering the many jobs that have no customer contact. Darity examined several theories regarding the
       persistence of employment discrimination, including rationales regarding group membership and employers'
       lack of information about candidates of other genders or races. Darity also directly studies and interprets
       others' work on discrimination in other countries, such as wage disparities between Sikh and Hindu men in
       India. Darity concludes that the competitive forces of the market have not been enough to overcome
       employment and wage discrimination, and, on their own, are unlikely to end such discrimination in the future.

      Public Policies to Reduce Discrimination

       A first public policy step against discrimination in the labor market is to make it illegal. For example, the Equal
       Pay Act of 1963 said that employers must pay men and women who do equal work the same. The Civil Rights
       Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The
       Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 prohibited discrimination on the basis of age against
       individuals who are 40 years of age or older. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 provides monetary damages in cases
       of intentional employment discrimination. The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 was aimed at
       prohibiting discrimination against people in the workplace who are planning pregnancy, are pregnant, or are
       returning after pregnancy. Passing a law, however, is only part of the answer, since discrimination by
       prejudiced employers may be less important than broader social patterns and systems.

       The 1964 Civil Rights Act created an important government organization, the Equal Employment Opportunity
       Commission, to investigate employment discrimination and protect workers who filed complaints against
       employers. Economist Phyllis Ann Wallace, who had previously worked for U.S. intelligence services, was
       appointed as the commission's chief of technical studies. In this role she collected and organized a massive
       amount of public and private sector data, as well as mentored and directed economists and other analysts in
       their investigations.

       These laws against discrimination have reduced the gender wage gap. A 2007 Department of Labor study
       compared salaries of men and women who have similar educational achievement, work experience, and

occupation and found that the gender wage gap is only 5%.
In the case of the earnings gap between Black people and White people (and also between Hispanic people and
White people), probably the single largest step that could be taken at this point in U.S. history to close the
earnings gap would be to reduce the gap in educational attainment. Part of the answer to this issue involves
finding ways to improve the performance of schools, which is a highly controversial topic in itself. In addition,
the education gap is unlikely to close unless Black and Hispanic families and peer groups strengthen their
culture of support for educational attainment.
Affirmative action is the name given to active efforts by government or businesses that give special rights to
minorities in hiring and promotion to make up for past discrimination. Affirmative action, in its limited and
not especially controversial form, means making an effort to reach out to a broader range of minority
candidates for jobs. In its more aggressive and controversial form, affirmative action required government and
companies to hire a specific number or percentage of minority employees. However, the U.S. Supreme Court
has ruled against state affirmative action laws. Today, the government applies affirmative action policies only
to federal contractors who have lost a discrimination lawsuit. The federal Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) enforces this type of redress.

An Increasingly Diverse Workforce

Racial and ethnic diversity is on the rise in the U.S. population and workforce. As Figure 14.16 shows, while the
White Americans comprised 78% of the population in 2012, the U.S. Bureau of the Census projects that Whites
will comprise 69% of the U.S. population by 2060. Forecasters predict that the proportion of U.S. citizens who
are of Hispanic background to rise substantially. Moreover, in addition to expected changes in the population,
workforce diversity is increasing as the women who entered the workforce in the 1970s and 1980s are now
moving up the promotion ladders within their organizations.

FIGURE 14.16 Projected Changes in America's Racial and Ethnic Diversity This figure shows projected changes in
the ethnic makeup of the U.S. population by 2060. Note that "NHPI" stands for Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific
Islander. "AIAN" stands for American Indian and Alaska Native. Source: US Department of Commerce
Regarding the future, optimists argue that the growing proportions of minority workers will break down
remaining discriminatory barriers. The economy will benefit as an increasing proportion of workers from
traditionally disadvantaged groups have a greater opportunity to fulfill their potential. Pessimists worry that
the social tensions between different genders and between ethnic groups will rise and that workers will be less
productive as a result. Anti-discrimination policy, at its best, seeks to help society move toward the more
optimistic outcome.

     14.6 Immigration

       Most Americans would be outraged if a law prevented them from moving to another city or another state.
       However, when the conversation turns to crossing national borders and is about other people arriving in the
       United States, laws preventing such movement often seem more reasonable. Some of the tensions over
       immigration stem from worries over how it might affect a country's culture, including differences in language,
       and patterns of family, authority, or gender relationships. Economics does not have much to say about such
       cultural issues. Some of the worries about immigration do, however, have to do with its effects on wages and
       income levels, and how it affects government taxes and spending. On those topics, economists have insights
       and research to offer.

      Historical Patterns of Immigration

       Supporters and opponents of immigration look at the same data and see different patterns. Those who express
       concern about immigration levels to the United States point to graphics like Figure 14.17 which shows total
       inflows of immigrants decade by decade through the twentieth and into the twenty-first century. Clearly, the
       level of immigration has been high and rising in recent years, reaching and exceeding the towering levels of
       the early twentieth century. However, those who are less worried about immigration point out that the high
       immigration levels of the early twentieth century happened when total population was much lower. Since the
       U.S. population roughly tripled during the twentieth century, the seemingly high levels in immigration in the
       1990s and 2000s look relatively smaller when they are divided by the population.

       FIGURE 14.17 Immigration Since 1900 The number of immigrants in each decade declined between 1900 and the
       1940s, rose sharply through 2009 and started to decline from 2010 to the present. (Source: U.S. Census)
       From where have the immigrants come? Immigrants from Europe were more than 90% of the total in the first
       decade of the twentieth century, but less than 20% of the total by the end of the century. By the 2000s, about
       half of U.S. immigration came from the rest of the Americas, especially Mexico, and about a quarter came from
       various countries in Asia.

      Economic Effects of Immigration

       A surge of immigration can affect the economy in a number of different ways. In this section, we will consider
       how immigrants might benefit the rest of the economy, how they might affect wage levels, and how they might
       affect government spending at the federal and local level.
       To understand the economic consequences of immigration, consider the following scenario. Imagine that the
       immigrants entering the United States matched the existing U.S. population in age range, education, skill
       levels, family size, and occupations. How would immigration of this type affect the rest of the U.S. economy?

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                                                                  14.6 · Immigration 353

Immigrants themselves would be much better off, because their standard of living would be higher in the
United States. Immigrants would contribute to both increased production and increased consumption. Given
enough time for adjustment, the range of jobs performed, income earned, taxes paid, and public services
needed would not be much affected by this kind of immigration. It would be as if the population simply
increased a little.

Now, consider the reality of recent immigration to the United States. Immigrants are not identical to the rest of
the U.S. population. About one-third of immigrants over the age of 25 lack a high school diploma. As a result,
many of the recent immigrants end up in jobs like restaurant and hotel work, lawn care, and janitorial work.
This kind of immigration represents a shift to the right in the supply of unskilled labor for a number of jobs,
which will lead to lower wages for these jobs. The middle- and upper-income households that purchase the
services of these unskilled workers will benefit from these lower wages. However, low-skilled U.S. workers who
must compete with low-skilled immigrants for jobs will tend to be negatively impacted by immigration.

The difficult policy questions about immigration are not so much about the overall gains to the rest of the
economy, which seem to be real but small in the context of the U.S. economy, as they are about the disruptive
effects of immigration in specific labor markets. One disruptive effect, as we noted, is that immigration
weighted toward low-skill workers tends to reduce wages for domestic low-skill workers. A study by Michael S.
Clune found that for each 10% rise in the number of employed immigrants with no more than a high school
diploma in the labor market, high school students reduced their annual number of hours worked by 3%. The
effects on wages of low-skill workers are not large--perhaps in the range of decline of about 1%. These effects
are likely kept low, in part, because of the legal floor of federal and state minimum wage laws. In addition,
immigrants are also thought to contribute to increased demand for local goods and services which can
stimulate the local low skilled labor market. It is also possible that employers, in the face of abundant low-skill
workers, may choose production processes which are more labor intensive than otherwise would have been.
These various factors would explain the small negative wage effect that the native low-skill workers observed
as a result of immigration.

Another potential disruptive effect is the impact on state and local government budgets. Many of the costs
imposed by immigrants are costs that arise in state-run programs, like the cost of public schooling and of
welfare benefits. However, many of the taxes that immigrants pay are federal taxes like income taxes and
Social Security taxes. Many immigrants do not own property (such as homes and cars), so they do not pay
property taxes, which are one of the main sources of state and local tax revenue. However, they do pay sales
taxes, which are state and local, and the landlords of property they rent pay property taxes. According to the
nonprofit Rand Corporation, the effects of immigration on taxes are generally positive at the federal level, but
they are negative at the state and local levels in places where there are many low-skilled immigrants.

Proposals for Immigration Reform

The Congressional Jordan Commission of the 1990s proposed reducing overall levels of immigration and
refocusing U.S. immigration policy to give priority to immigrants with higher skill levels. In the labor market,
focusing on high-skilled immigrants would help prevent any negative effects on low-skilled workers' wages.
For government budgets, higher-skilled workers find jobs more quickly, earn higher wages, and pay more in
taxes. Several other immigration-friendly countries, notably Canada and Australia, have immigration systems
where those with high levels of education or job skills have a much better chance of obtaining permission to
immigrate. For the United States, high tech companies regularly ask for a more lenient immigration policy to
admit a greater quantity of highly skilled workers under the H1B visa program.

The Obama Administration proposed the so-called "DREAM Act" legislation, which would have offered a path
354 14 · Labor Markets and Income

       to citizenship for those classified as illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States before the age of
       16. Despite bipartisan support, the legislation failed to pass at the federal level. However, some state
       legislatures, such as California, have passed their own Dream Acts.
       Between its plans for a border wall, increased deportation of undocumented immigrants, and even reductions
       in the number of highly skilled legal H1B immigrants, the Trump Administration had a much less positive
       approach to immigration. Most economists, whether conservative or liberal, believe that while immigration
       harms some domestic workers, the benefits to the nation exceed the costs. President Biden has been
       considerably more positive about immigration than his predecessor. However, given the presence of
       considerable disagreement within the overall population about the desirability of immigration, it is unlikely
       that any significant immigration reform will take place in the near future.

      The Increasing Value of a College Degree

       The cost of college has increased dramatically in recent decades, causing many college students to take student
       loans to afford it. Despite this, the value of a college degree has never been higher. How can we explain this?
       We can estimate the value of a bachelor's degree as the difference in lifetime earnings between the average holder
       of a bachelor's degree and the average high school graduate. According to a 2021 report from the Georgetown
       University Center on Education and the Workforce, adults with a bachelor's degree earn an average of $2.8 million
       during their careers, $1.2 million more than the median for workers with a high school diploma. College graduates
       also have a significantly lower unemployment rate than those with lower educational attainments.
       While a college degree holder's wages have increased somewhat, the major reason for the increase in value of a
       bachelor's degree has been the plummeting value of a high school diploma. In the twenty-first century, the majority
       of jobs require at least some post-secondary education. This includes manufacturing jobs that in the past would
       have afforded workers a middle class income with only a high school diploma. Those jobs are increasingly scarce.
       This phenomenon has also no doubt contributed to the increasing inequality of income that we observe in the U.S.
       today. We will discuss that topic next, in Chapter 15.

Key Concepts and Summary

14.1 The Theory of Labor Markets

A firm demands labor because of the value of the labor's marginal productivity. For a firm operating in a
perfectly competitive output market, this will be the value of the marginal product, which we define as the
marginal product of labor multiplied by the firm's output price. For a firm which is not perfectly competitive,
the appropriate concept is the marginal revenue product, which we define as the marginal product of labor
multiplied by the firm's marginal revenue. Profit maximizing firms employ labor up to the point where the
market wage is equal to the firm's demand for labor. In a competitive labor market, we determine market wage
through the interaction between the market supply and market demand for labor.

14.2 Wages and Employment in an Imperfectly Competitive Labor Market

A monopsony is the sole employer in a labor market. The monopsony can pay any wage it chooses, subject to
the market supply of labor. This means that if the monopsony offers too low a wage, they may not find enough
workers willing to work for them. Since to obtain more workers, they must offer a higher wage, the marginal
cost of additional labor is greater than the wage. To maximize profits, a monopsonist will hire workers up to the
point where the marginal cost of labor equals their labor demand. This results in a lower level of employment
than a competitive labor market would provide, but also a lower equilibrium wage.

14.3 Market Power on the Supply Side of Labor Markets: Unions

A labor union is an organization of workers that negotiates as a group with employers over compensation and
work conditions. Union workers in the United States are paid more on average than other workers with
comparable education and experience. Thus, either union workers must be more productive to match this
higher pay or the higher pay will lead employers to find ways of hiring fewer union workers than they
otherwise would. American union membership has been falling for decades. Some possible reasons include
the shift of jobs to service industries; greater competition from globalization; the passage of worker-friendly
legislation; and U.S. laws that are less favorable to organizing unions.

14.4 Bilateral Monopoly

A bilateral monopoly is a labor market with a union on the supply side and a monopsony on the demand side.
Since both sides have monopoly power, the equilibrium level of employment will be lower than that for a
competitive labor market, but the equilibrium wage could be higher or lower depending on which side
negotiates better. The union favors a higher wage, while the monopsony favors a lower wage, but the outcome
is indeterminate in the model.

14.5 Employment Discrimination

Discrimination occurs in a labor market when employers pay workers with the same economic characteristics,
such as education,experience, and skill, are paid different amounts because of race, gender, religion, age, or
disability status. In the United States, female workers on average earn less than male workers, and Black
workers on average earn less than White workers. There is controversy over to which discrimination
differences in factors like education and job experience can explain these earnings gaps. Free markets can
allow discrimination to occur, but the threat of a loss of sales or a loss of productive workers can also create
incentives for a firm not to discriminate. A range of public policies can be used to reduce earnings gaps
between men and women or between White and other racial/ethnic groups: requiring equal pay for equal
work, and attaining more equal educational outcomes.

14.6 Immigration

The recent level of U.S. immigration is at a historically high level if we measure it in absolute numbers, but not
if we measure it as a share of population. The overall gains to the U.S. economy from immigration are real but
relatively small. However, immigration also causes effects like slightly lower wages for low-skill workers and
budget problems for certain state and local governments.

Introduction to Poverty and Economic Inequality

         BRING IT HOME

Occupy Wall Street

In September 2011, a group of protesters gathered in Zuccotti Park in New York City to decry what they perceived
as increasing social and economic inequality in the United States. Calling their protest "Occupy Wall Street," they
argued that the concentration of wealth among the richest 1% in the United States was both economically
unsustainable and inequitable, and needed to be changed. The protest then spread to other major cities, and the
Occupy movement was born.

Why were people so upset? How much wealth is concentrated among the top 1% in our society? How did they
acquire so much wealth? These are very real, very important questions in the United States now, and this chapter on
poverty and economic inequality will help us address the causes behind this sentiment.
362 15 · Poverty and Economic Inequality

       The labor markets that determine the pay that workers receive do not take into account how much income a
       family needs for food, shelter, clothing, and health care. Market forces do not worry about what happens to
       families when a major local employer goes out of business. Market forces do not take time to contemplate
       whether those who are earning higher incomes should pay an even higher share of taxes.

       However, labor markets do create considerable income inequalities. In 2020, the median American household
       income was $67,521 (the median is the level where half of all families had more than that level and half had
       less). For family households, the median was $86,372; for non-family households, it was $40,464. The Census
       Bureau also reported that in 2020, there were 37.2 million people living in poverty, representing 11.4% of the
       population. Think about a family of three--perhaps a single mother with two children--attempting to pay for
       the basics of life on perhaps $17,916 per year. After paying for rent, healthcare, clothing, and transportation,
       such a family might have $6,000 to spend on food. Spread over 365 days, the food budget for the entire family
       would be about $17 per day. To put this in perspective, most cities have restaurants where $17 will buy you an
       appetizer for one.

       This chapter explores how the U.S. government defines poverty, the balance between assisting the poor
       without discouraging work, and how federal antipoverty programs work. It also discusses income
       inequality--how economists measure inequality, why inequality has changed in recent decades, the range of
       possible government policies to reduce inequality, and the danger of a tradeoff that too great a reduction in
       inequality may reduce incentives for producing output.

     15.1 Drawing the Poverty Line

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain economic inequality and how the poverty line is determined
         · Analyze the U.S. poverty rate over time, noting its prevalence among different groups of citizens

       Comparisons of high and low incomes raise two different issues: economic inequality and poverty. Poverty is
       measured by the number of people who fall below a certain level of income--called the poverty line--that
       defines the income one needs for a basic standard of living. Income inequality compares the share of the total
       income (or wealth) in society that different groups receive. For example, one of numerous ways to look at
       income inequality is to compare the share of income that the top 10% receive to the share of income that the
       bottom 10% receive.

       In the United States, the official definition of the poverty line traces back to a single person: Mollie Orshansky.
       In 1963, Orshansky, who was working for the Social Security Administration, published an article called
       "Children of the Poor" in a highly useful and dry-as-dust publication called the Social Security Bulletin.
       Orshansky's idea was to define a poverty line based on the cost of a healthy diet.

       Her previous job had been at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, where she had worked in an agency called the
       Bureau of Home Economics and Human Nutrition. One task of this bureau had been to calculate how much it
       would cost to feed a nutritionally adequate diet to a family. Orshansky found that the average family spent one-
       third of its income on food. She then proposed that the poverty line be the amount one requires to buy a
       nutritionally adequate diet, given the size of the family, multiplied by three.

       The current U.S. poverty line is essentially the same as the Orshansky poverty line, although the government
       adjusts the dollar amounts to represent the same buying power over time. The U.S. poverty line in 2021 ranged
       from $12,880 for a single individual to $26,500 for a household of four people.

       Figure 15.2 shows the U.S. poverty rate over time; that is, the percentage of the population below the poverty
       line in any given year. The poverty rate declined through the 1960s, rose in the early 1980s and early 1990s,
       but seems to have been slightly lower since the mid-1990s. However, in no year in the last six decades has the
       poverty rate been less than 10.5% of the U.S. population--that is, at best almost one American in nine is below

the poverty line. In recent years, the poverty rate peaked at 15.1% in 2010, before dropping to 10.5% in 2019.
Table 15.1 compares poverty rates for different groups in 2011. As you will see when we delve further into
these numbers, poverty rates are relatively low for White people, for the elderly, for the well-educated, and for
male-headed households. Poverty rates for females, Hispanic people, and African Americans are much higher
than for White people. While Hispanic people and African Americans have a higher percentage of individuals
living in poverty than others, most people in the United States living below the poverty line are White people.

The concept of a poverty line raises many tricky questions. In a vast country like the United States, should
364 15 · Poverty and Economic Inequality

there be a national poverty line? After all, according to the Federal Register, the median household income for
a family of four was $109,113 in New Jersey and $59,701 in Mississippi in 2017, and prices of some basic
goods like housing are quite different between states. The poverty line is based on cash income, which means
it does not account for government programs that provide non-cash assistance such as Medicaid (health care
for low-income individuals and families) and food aid. Also, low-income families can qualify for federal
housing assistance. (We will discuss these and other government aid programs in detail later in this chapter.)

Should the government adjust the poverty line to account for the value of such programs? Many economists
and policymakers wonder whether we should rethink the concept of what poverty means in the twenty-first
century. The following Clear It Up feature explains the poverty lines set by the World Bank for low-income
countries around the world.

         CLEAR IT UP

How do economists measure poverty in low-income countries?

The World Bank sets two poverty lines for low-income countries around the world. One poverty line is set at an
income of $1.90/day per person. The other is at $3.20/day. By comparison, the U.S. 2015 poverty line of $20,090
annually for a family of three works out to $18.35 per person per day.

Clearly, many people around the world are far poorer than Americans, as Table 15.2 shows. China and India both
have more than a billion people; Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa; and Egypt is the most populous
country in the Middle East. In all four of those countries, in the mid-2000s, a substantial share of the population
subsisted on less than $2/day. About half the world lives on less than $2.50 a day, and 80 percent of the world lives
on less than $10 per day. (Of course, the cost of food, clothing, and shelter in those countries can be very different
from those costs in the United States, so the $2 and $2.50 figures may mean greater purchasing power than they
would in the United States.)

Country Year  Percentage of Population with Income Less  Percentage of Population with Income Less
                           Than $1.90/Day/Person                      Than $3.20/Day/Person

Brazil 2019 4.6%                                         9.1%

China 2017 0.5%                                          5.4%

Egypt 2017 3.8%                                          28.9%

India 2011 22.5%                                         61.7%

Mexico 2018 1.7%                                         6.5%

Nigeria 2018 39.1%                                       71.0%

TABLE 15.2 Poverty Lines for Low-Income Countries, mid-2000s (Source: https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-
development-indicators/themes/poverty-and-inequality.html)

Any poverty line will be somewhat arbitrary, and it is useful to have a poverty line whose basic definition does
not change much over time. If Congress voted every few years to redefine poverty, then it would be difficult to
compare rates over time. After all, would a lower poverty rate change the definition, or is it the case that people
were actually better off? Government statisticians at the U.S. Census Bureau have ongoing research programs
to address questions like these.

15.2 The Poverty Trap

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Explain the poverty trap, noting how government programs impact it
  · Identify potential issues in government programs that seek to reduce poverty
  · Calculate a budget constraint line that represents the poverty trap
Can you give people too much help, or the wrong kind of help? When people are provided with food, shelter,
healthcare, income, and other necessities, assistance may reduce their incentive to work, particularly if their
work is likely to offer low wages and reduce government assistance. Consider a program to fight poverty that
works in this reasonable-sounding manner: the government provides assistance to the those who need it, but
as the recipients earn income to support themselves, the government reduces the level of assistance it
provides. With such a program, every time a person earns $100, they lose $100 in government support. As a
result, the person experiences no net gain for working. Economists call this problem the poverty trap.
Consider the situation a single-parent family faces. Figure 15.3 illustrates a single mother (earning $8 an hour)
with two children. First, consider the labor-leisure budget constraint that this family faces in a situation
without government assistance. On the horizontal axis is hours of leisure (or time spent with family
responsibilities) increasing in quantity from left to right. Also on the horizontal axis is the number of hours at
paid work, going from zero hours on the right to the maximum of 2,500 hours on the left. On the vertical axis is
the amount of income per year rising from low to higher amounts of income. The budget constraint line shows
that at zero hours of leisure and 2,500 hours of work, the maximum amount of income is $20,000 ($8 × 2,500
hours). At the other extreme of the budget constraint line, an individual would work zero hours, earn zero
income, but enjoy 2,500 hours of leisure. At point A on the budget constraint line, by working 40 hours a week,
50 weeks a year, the utility-maximizing choice is to work a total of 2,000 hours per year and earn $16,000.
Now suppose that a government antipoverty program guarantees every family with a single mother and two
children $18,000 in income. This is represented on the graph by a horizontal line at $18,000. With this
program, each time the mother earns $1,000, the government will deduct $1,000 of its support. Table 15.3
shows what will happen at each combination of work and government support.

FIGURE 15.3 The Poverty Trap in Action The original choice is 500 hours of leisure, 2,000 hours of work at point A,
and income of $16,000. With a guaranteed income of $18,000, this family would receive $18,000 whether it
provides zero hours of work or 2,000 hours of work. Only if the family provides, say, 2,300 hours of work does its
income rise above the guaranteed level of $18,000--and even then, the marginal gain to income from working many
hours is small.

TABLE 15.3 Total Income at Various Combinations of Work and Support

The new budget line, with the antipoverty program in place, is the horizontal and heavy line that is flat at
$18,000. If the mother does not work at all, she receives $18,000, all from the government. If she works full
time, giving up 40 hours per week with her children, she still ends up with $18,000 at the end of the year. Only
if she works 2,300 hours in the year--which is an average of 44 hours per week for 50 weeks a year--does
household income rise to $18,400. Even in this case, all of her year's work means that household income rises
by only $400 over the income she would receive if she did not work at all. She would need to work 50 hours a
week to reach $20,800.

The poverty trap is even stronger than this simplified example shows, because a working mother will have
extra expenses like clothing, transportation, and child care that a nonworking mother will not face, making the
economic gains from working even smaller. Moreover, those who do not work fail to build up job experience
and contacts, which makes working in the future even less likely.

To reduce the poverty trap the government could design an antipoverty program so that, instead of reducing
government payments by $1 for every $1 earned, the government would reduce payments by some smaller
amount instead. Imposing requirements for work as a condition of receiving benefits and setting a time limit
on benefits can also reduce the harshness of the poverty trap.

Figure 15.4 illustrates a government program that guarantees $18,000 in income, even for those who do not
work at all, but then reduces this amount by 50 cents for each $1 earned. The new, higher budget line in Figure
15.4 shows that, with this program, additional hours of work will bring some economic gain. Because of the
reduction in government income when an individual works, an individual earning $8.00 will really net only
$4.00 per hour. The vertical intercept of this higher budget constraint line is at $28,000 ($18,000 + 2,500 hours
× $4.00 = $28,000). The horizontal intercept is at the point on the graph where $18,000 and 2500 hours of
leisure is set. Table 15.4 shows the total income differences with various choices of labor and leisure.

However, this type of program raises other issues. First, even if it does not eliminate the incentive to work by
reducing government payments by $1 for every $1 earned, enacting such a program may still reduce the
incentive to work. At least some people who would be working 2,000 hours each year without this program
might decide to work fewer hours but still end up with more income--that is, their choice on the new budget
line would be like S, above and to the right of the original choice P. Of course, others may choose a point like R,
which involves the same amount of work as P, or even a point to the left of R that involves more work.

The second major issue is that when the government phases out its support payments more slowly, the
antipoverty program costs more money. Still, it may be preferable in the long run to spend more money on a
program that retains a greater incentive to work, rather than spending less money on a program that nearly
eliminates any gains from working.

FIGURE 15.4 Loosening the Poverty Trap: Reducing Government Assistance by 50 Cents for Every $1 Earned On
the original labor-leisure opportunity set, the lower, downward-sloping budget set, the preferred choice P is 500
hours of leisure and $16,000 of income. Then, the government created an antipoverty program that guarantees
$18,000 in income even to those who work zero hours, shown by the hoizontal dashed line. In addition, every $1
earned means phasing out 50 cents of benefits at $18,000. This program leads to the higher budget set, which the
diagram shows. The hope is that this program will provide incentives to work the same or more hours, despite
receiving income assistance. However, it is possible that the recipients will choose a point on the new budget set
like S, with less work, more leisure, and greater income, or a point like R, with the same work and greater income.

TABLE 15.4 The Labor-Leisure Tradeoff with Assistance Reduced by 50 Cents for
Every Dollar Earned

The next module will consider a variety of government support programs focused specifically on people
experiencing poverty, including welfare, SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), Medicaid, and
the earned income tax credit (EITC). Although these programs vary from state to state, it is generally a true
statement that in many states from the 1960s into the 1980s, if poor people worked, their level of income
barely rose--or did not rise at all--after factoring in the reduction in government support payments. The
following Work It Out feature shows how this happens.

     15.3 The Safety Net

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Identify the antipoverty government programs that comprise the safety net
         · Explain the safety net programs' primary goals and how these programs have changed over time
         · Discuss the complexities of these safety net programs and why they can be controversial

       The U.S. government has implemented a number of programs to assist those below the poverty line and those
       who have incomes just above the poverty line. Such programs are called the safety net, to recognize that they
       offer some protection for those who find themselves without jobs or income.

      Temporary Assistance for Needy Families

       From the Great Depression until 1996, the United States' most visible antipoverty program was Aid to Families
       with Dependent Children (AFDC), which provided cash payments to mothers with children who were below the
       poverty line. Many just called this program "welfare." In 1996, Congress passed and President Bill Clinton
       signed into law the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, more commonly called
       the "welfare reform act." The new law replaced AFDC with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF).

       Reform speech.

       TANF brought several dramatic changes in how welfare operated. Under the old AFDC program, states set the
       level of welfare benefits that they would pay to people experiencing poverty, and the federal government
       guaranteed it would chip in some of the money as well. The federal government's welfare spending would rise
       or fall depending on the number of people in need, and on how each state set its own welfare contribution.

       Under TANF, however, the federal government gives a fixed amount of money to each state. The state can then
       use the money for almost any program with an antipoverty component: for example, the state might use the
       money to give funds to families with low income, or to reduce teenage pregnancy, or even to raise the high
       school graduation rate. However, the federal government imposed two key requirements. First, if states are to
       keep receiving the TANF grants, they must impose work requirements so that most of those receiving TANF
       benefits are working (or attending school). Second, no one can receive TANF benefits with federal money for
       more than a total of five years over their lifetime. The old AFDC program had no such work requirements or
       time limits.

       TANF attempts to avoid the poverty trap by requiring that welfare recipients work and by limiting the length of
       time they can receive benefits. In its first few years, the program was quite successful. The number of families
       receiving payments in 1995, the last year of AFDC, was 4.8 million. November 2020, according to the
       Congressional Research Service, the number of families receiving payments under TANF was 1.0 million--a
       decline of nearly 80%.

       TANF benefits to poor families vary considerably across states. For example, again according to the
       Congressional Research Service, in July 2020 the highest monthly payment in New Hampshire to a single
       mother with one child was $862, while in Mississippi the highest monthly payment to that family was $146. In
       part, these payments reflect differences in states' cost of living. As reported by the Department of Health and
       Human Services, in 1995 total spending on TANF was approximately $19 billion. Spending increased yearly
       through 2001, then it was roughly flat at approximately $26 billion until 2005, then it increased again through
       2010, where it peaked at nearly $35 billion. It then decreased again to around $30 billion in 2020. When you
       take into account the effects of inflation, the decline is even greater. Moreover, there seemed little evidence that
       families were suffering a reduced standard of living as a result of TANF--although, on the other side, there was

not much evidence that families had greatly improved their total levels of income, either.

The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)

The earned income tax credit (EITC), first passed in 1975, is a method of assisting the working poor through
the tax system. The EITC is one of the largest assistance program for low-income groups, and as of December
2021, about 25 million eligible workers and families received about $60 billion in EITC. For the 2021 tax year,
the earned income credit ranges from $1,502 to $6,728 depending on tax-filing status, income, and number of
children. The average amount of EITC received nationwide was about $2,411. In 2021, for example, a single
parent with two children would have received a tax credit of $5,980 up to a modest income level. The amount
of the tax break increases with the amount of income earned, up to a point. The earned income tax credit has
often been popular with both economists and the general public because of the way it effectively increases the
payment received for work.
What about the danger of the poverty trap that every additional $1 earned will reduce government support
payments by close to $1? To minimize this problem, the earned income tax credit is phased out slowly. For
example, according to the Tax Policy Center, for a single-parent family with two children in 2013, the credit is
not reduced at all (but neither is it increased) as earnings rise from $13,430 to $17,530. Then, for every $1
earned above $17,530, the amount received from the credit is reduced by 21.06 cents, until the credit phases
out completely at an income level of $46,227.
Figure 15.5 illustrates that the earned income tax credits, child tax credits, and the TANF program all cost the
federal government money--either in direct outlays or in loss of tax revenues. CTC stands for the government
tax cuts for the child tax credit.

FIGURE 15.5 Real Federal Spending on CTC, EITC, and TANF, 1975-2016 EITC increased from under $10 billion in
the late 1980s to almost $42 billion in 2000 and to over $61 billion in 2016, far exceeding estimated 2016 outlays
in the CTC (Child Tax Credits) and TANF of over $25 billion and $18 billion, respectively. (Source: Office of
Management and Budget)
In recent years, the EITC has become a hugely expensive government program for providing income
assistance to people below or near the poverty line, costing about $60 billion in 2021. In that year, the EITC
provided benefits to about 25 million families and individuals and, on average, is worth about $2,411 per
family (with children), according to the Tax Policy Center. One reason that the TANF law worked as well as it
did is that the government greatly expanded EITC in the late 1980s and again in the early 1990s, which
increased the returns to work for low-income Americans.
370 15 · Poverty and Economic Inequality

      Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)

       Often called "food stamps," Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is a federally funded
       program, started in 1964, in which each month people receive a card like a debit card that they can use to buy
       food. The amount of food aid for which a household is eligible varies by income, number of children, and other
       factors but, in general, households are expected to spend about 30% of their own net income on food, and if
       30% of their net income is not enough to purchase a nutritionally adequate diet, then those households are
       eligible for SNAP.
       SNAP can contribute to the poverty trap. For every $100 earned, the government assumes that a family can
       spend $30 more for food, and thus reduces its eligibility for food aid by $30. This decreased benefit is not a
       complete disincentive to work--but combined with how other programs reduce benefits as income increases, it
       adds to the problem. SNAP, however, does try to address the poverty trap with its own set of work requirements
       and time limits.
       Why give debit cards and not just cash? Part of the political support for SNAP comes from a belief that since
       recipients must spend the the cards on food, they cannot "waste" them on other forms of consumption. From
       an economic point of view, however, the belief that cards must increase spending on food seems wrong-
       headed. After all, say that a family is spending $2,500 per year on food, and then it starts receiving $1,000 per
       year in SNAP aid. The family might react by spending $3,500 per year on food (income plus aid), or it might
       react by continuing to spend $2,500 per year on food, but use the $1,000 in food aid to free up $1,000 that it
       can now spend on other goods. Thus, it is reasonable to think of SNAP cards as an alternative method, along
       with TANF and the earned income tax credit, of transferring income to those working but still experiencing
       poverty.
       Anyone eligible for TANF is also eligible for SNAP, although states can expand eligibility for food aid if they
       wish to do so. In some states, where TANF welfare spending is relatively low, a poor family may receive more in
       support from SNAP than from TANF. In 2021, about 41.5 million people received food aid with total benefits of
       just over $108 billion, which is an average monthly benefit of about $287 per person per month. SNAP
       participation increased by 70% between 2007 and 2011, from 26.6 million participants to 45 million.
       According to the Congressional Budget Office, the 2008-2009 Great Recession and rising food prices caused
       this dramatic rise in participation. Likewise, between 2019 and 2021, the number of participants in SNAP
       increased by 5.8 million, the amount per person increased by 67%, and total benefits nearly doubled as a
       consequence of the sharp recession due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020.
       The federal government deploys a range of income security programs that it funds through departments such
       as Health and Human Services, Agriculture, and Housing and Urban Development (HUD) (see Figure 15.6).
       According to the Office of Management and Budget, collectively, these three departments provided an
       estimated $62 billion of aid through programs such as supplemental feeding programs for women and
       children, subsidized housing, and energy assistance. The federal government also transfers funds to
       individual states through special grant programs.

FIGURE 15.6 Expenditure Comparison of TANF, SNAP, HUD, and Other Income Security Programs, 1988-2013
(est.) Total expenditures on income security continued to rise between 1988 and 2010, while payments for TANF
have increased from $13 billion in 1998 to an estimated $17.3 billion in 2013. SNAP has seen relatively small
increments. These two programs comprise a relatively small portion of the estimated $106 billion dedicated to
income security in 2013. Note that other programs and housing programs increased dramatically during the 2008
and 2010 time periods. (Source: Table 12.3 Section 600 Income Security, https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/
default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/hist.pdf)
The safety net includes a number of other programs: government-subsidized school lunches and breakfasts
for children from low-income families; the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and
Children (WIC), which provides food assistance for pregnant women and newborns; the Low Income Home
Energy Assistance Program, which provides help with home heating bills; housing assistance, which helps pay
the rent; and Supplemental Security Income, which provides cash support for people with disabilities and
elderly people experiencing poverty.

Medicaid

Congress created Medicaid in 1965. This is a joint health insurance program between both the states and the
federal government. The federal government helps fund Medicaid, but each state is responsible for
administering the program, determining the level of benefits, and determining eligibility. It provides medical
insurance for certain people with low incomes, including those below the poverty line, with a focus on families
with children, the elderly, and people with disabilities. About one-third of Medicaid spending is for low-income
mothers with children. While an increasing share of the program funding in recent years has gone to pay for
nursing home costs for older people who cannot afford to pay for housing. The program ensures that
participants receive a basic level of benefits, but because each state sets eligibility requirements and provides
varying levels of service, the program differs from state to state.
In the past, a common problem has been that many low-paying jobs pay enough to a breadwinner so that a
family could lose its eligibility for Medicaid, yet the job does not offer health insurance benefits. A parent
considering such a job might choose not to work rather than lose health insurance for their children. In this
way, health insurance can become a part of the poverty trap. Many states recognized this problem in the 1980s
and 1990s and expanded their Medicaid coverage to include people earning up to 135% or even 185% of the
poverty line. Some states also guaranteed that children would not lose coverage if their parents worked.
These expanded guarantees cost the government money, of course, but they also helped to encourage those on
welfare to enter the labor force. As of 2014, approximately 69.7 million people participated in Medicaid. Of
372 15 · Poverty and Economic Inequality

       those enrolled, almost half are children. Healthcare expenditures, however, are highest for the elderly
       population, which comprises approximately 25% of participants. As Figure 15.7 (a) indicates, the largest
       number of households that enroll in Medicaid are those with children. Lower-income adults are the next
       largest group enrolled in Medicaid at 28%. People who are blind or have a disability account for 16% of those
       enrolled, and seniors are 9% of those enrolled. Figure 15.7 (b) shows how much actual Medicaid dollars the
       government spends for each group. Out of total Medicaid spending, the government spends more on seniors
       (20%) and people who are blind or have a disability (44%). Thus, 64% of all Medicaid spending goes to seniors,
       those who are blind, and people with disabilities. Children receive 21% of all Medicaid spending, followed by
       adults at 15%.

       FIGURE 15.7 Medicaid Enrollment and Spending Part (a) shows the Medicaid enrollment by different populations,
       with children comprising the largest percentage at 47%, followed by adults at 28%, and those who are blind or have
       a disability at 16%. Part (b) shows that Medicaid spending is principally for those who are blind or have a disability,
       followed by the elderly. Although children are the largest population that Medicaid covers, expenditures on children
       are only at 19%.

     15.4 Income Inequality: Measurement and Causes

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain the distribution of income, and analyze the sources of income inequality in a market economy
         · Measure income distribution in quintiles
         · Calculate and graph a Lorenz curve
         · Show income inequality through demand and supply diagrams
       Poverty levels can be subjective based on the overall income levels of a country. Typically a government
       measures poverty based on a percentage of the median income. Income inequality, however, has to do with the
       distribution of that income, in terms of which group receives the most or the least income. Income inequality
       involves comparing those with high incomes, middle incomes, and low incomes--not just looking at those
       below or near the poverty line. In turn, measuring income inequality means dividing the population into
       various groups and then comparing the groups, a task that we can be carry out in several ways, as the next
       Clear It Up feature shows.

                CLEAR IT UP
      How do you separate poverty and income inequality?

       Poverty can change even when inequality does not move at all. Imagine a situation in which income for everyone in
       the population declines by 10%. Poverty would rise, since a greater share of the population would now fall below

         Access for free at openstax.org
                       15.4 · Income Inequality: Measurement and Causes 373

the poverty line. However, inequality would be the same, because everyone suffered the same proportional loss.
Conversely, a general rise in income levels over time would keep inequality the same, but reduce poverty.

It is also possible for income inequality to change without affecting the poverty rate. Imagine a situation in which a
large number of people who already have high incomes increase their incomes by even more. Inequality would rise
as a result--but the number of people below the poverty line would remain unchanged.

Why did inequality of household income increase in the United States in recent decades? A trend toward
greater income inequality has occurred in many countries around the world, although the effect has been
more powerful in the U.S. economy. Economists have focused their explanations for the increasing inequality
on two factors that changed more or less continually from the 1970s into the 2000s. One set of explanations
focuses on the changing shape of American households. The other focuses on greater inequality of wages, what
some economists call "winner take all" labor markets. We will begin with how we measure inequality, and then
consider the explanations for growing inequality in the United States.

Measuring Income Distribution by Quintiles

One common way of measuring income inequality is to rank all households by income, from lowest to highest,
and then to divide all households into five groups with equal numbers of people, known as quintiles. This
calculation allows for measuring the distribution of income among the five groups compared to the total. The
first quintile is the lowest fifth or 20%, the second quintile is the next lowest, and so on. We can measure
income inequality by comparing what share of the total income each quintile earns.

U.S. income distribution by quintile appears in Table 15.5. In 2020, for example, the bottom quintile of the
income distribution received 3.2% of income; the second quintile received 8.1%; the third quintile, 14.0%; the
fourth quintile, 22.6%; and the top quintile, 52.2%. The final column of Table 15.5 shows what share of income
went to households in the top 5% of the income distribution: 23.0% in 2020. Over time, from the late 1960s to
the early 1980s, the top fifth of the income distribution typically received between about 43% to 44% of all
income. The share of income that the top fifth received then begins to rise. Census Bureau researchers trace,
much of this increase in the share of income going to the top fifth to an increase in the share of income going to
the top 5%. The quintile measure shows how income inequality has increased in recent decades.

historical-income-households.html, Table H-1, All Races.)

It can also be useful to divide the income distribution in ways other than quintiles; for example, into tenths or
even into percentiles (that is, hundredths). A more detailed breakdown can provide additional insights. For
example, the last column of Table 15.5 shows the income received by the top 5% of the income distribution.
Between 1980 and 2020, the share of income going to the top 5% increased by 6.5 percentage points (from
16.5% in 1980 to 23.0% in 2020). From 1980 to 2020 the share of income going to the top quintile increased by
8.1 percentage points (from 44.1% in 1980 to 52.2% in 2013). Thus, the top 20% of householders (the fifth
quintile) received over half (51%) of all the income in the United States in 2020.

Lorenz Curve

We can present the data on income inequality in various ways. For example, you could draw a bar graph that
showed the share of income going to each fifth of the income distribution. Figure 15.8 presents an alternative
way of showing inequality data in a Lorenz curve. This curve shows the cumulative share of population on the
horizontal axis and the cumulative percentage of total income received on the vertical axis.

FIGURE 15.8 The Lorenz Curve A Lorenz curve graphs the cumulative shares of income received by everyone up to
a certain quintile. The income distribution in 1980 was closer to the perfect equality line than the income
distribution in 2020--that is, the U.S. income distribution became more unequal over time.

Every Lorenz curve diagram begins with a line sloping up at a 45-degree angle. We show it as a dashed line in
Figure 15.8. The points along this line show what perfect equality of the income distribution looks like. It would
mean, for example, that the bottom 20% of the income distribution receives 20% of the total income, the
bottom 40% gets 40% of total income, and so on. The other lines reflect actual U.S. data on inequality for 1980
and 2020.

The trick in graphing a Lorenz curve is that you must change the shares of income for each specific quintile,
which we show in the first and third columns of numbers in Table 15.6, into cumulative income, which we

show in the second and fourth columns of numbers. For example, the bottom 40% of the cumulative income
distribution will be the sum of the first and second quintiles; the bottom 60% of the cumulative income
distribution will be the sum of the first, second, and third quintiles, and so on. The final entry in the cumulative
income column needs to be 100%, because by definition, 100% of the population receives 100% of the income.

TABLE 15.6 Calculating the Lorenz Curve

In a Lorenz curve diagram, a more unequal distribution of income will loop farther down and away from the

How does economic inequality vary around the world?

The U.S. economy has a relatively high degree of income inequality by global standards. As Table 15.7 shows, based
on a variety of national surveys for a selection of years in the second decade of this century, the U.S. economy has
greater inequality than Germany (along with most Western European countries). The region of the world with the
highest level of income inequality is Latin America, illustrated in the numbers for Brazil and Mexico. The level of
inequality in the United States is higher than in some of the low-income countries of the world, like India and
Nigeria, as well as in some middle-income countries, like China and Russia.

Causes of Growing Inequality: The Changing Composition of American Households

In 1970, 41% of married women were in the labor force, but by 2019, according to the Bureau of Labor
Statistics, 58.6% of married women were in the labor force. One result of this trend is that more households
have two earners. Moreover, it has become more common for one high earner to marry another high earner. A
few decades ago, the common pattern featured a man with relatively high earnings, such as an executive or a
doctor, marrying a woman who did not earn as much, like a secretary or a nurse. Often, the woman would leave
paid employment, at least for a few years, to raise a family. However, now doctors are marrying doctors and
executives are marrying executives, and mothers with high-powered careers are often returning to work while
their children are quite young. This pattern of households with two high earners tends to increase the
proportion of high-earning households.

According to data in the National Journal, even as two-earner couples have increased, so have single-parent
households. Of all U.S. families, in 2021, about 23% were headed by single mothers. The poverty rate among
single-parent households tends to be relatively high.

These changes in family structure, including the growth of single-parent families who tend to be at the lower
end of the income distribution, and the growth of two-career high-earner couples near the top end of the
income distribution, account for roughly half of the rise in income inequality across households in recent
decades.

Causes of Growing Inequality: A Shift in the Distribution of Wages

Another factor behind the rise in U.S. income inequality is that earnings have become less equal since the late
1970s. In particular, the earnings of high-skilled labor relative to low-skilled labor have increased. Winner-
take-all labor markets result from changes in technology, which have increased global demand for
"stars,"--whether the best CEO, doctor, basketball player, or actor. This global demand pushes salaries far above
productivity differences associated with educational differences. One way to measure this change is to take
workers' earnings with at least a four-year college bachelor's degree (including those who went on and
completed an advanced degree) and divide them by workers' earnings with only a high school degree. The
result is that those in the 25-34 age bracket with college degrees earned about 1.85 times as much as high
school graduates in 2020, up from 1.59 times in 1995, according to U.S. Census data. Winner-take-all labor
market theory argues that the salary gap between the median and the top 1 percent is not due to educational
differences.
Economists use the demand and supply model to reason through the most likely causes of this shift. According
to the National Center for Education Statistics, in recent decades, the supply of U.S. workers with college
degrees has increased substantially. For example, 840,000 four-year bachelor's degrees were conferred on
Americans in 1970. In 2018-2019, 2.0 million such degrees were conferred--an increase of over 138%. In
Figure 15.9, this shift in supply to the right, from S0 to S1, by itself should result in a lower equilibrium wage
for high-skilled labor. Thus, we can explain the increase in the price of high-skilled labor by a greater demand,
like the movement from D0 to D1. Evidently, combining both the increase in supply and in demand has
resulted in a shift from E0 to E1, and a resulting higher wage.

FIGURE 15.9 Why Would Wages Rise for High-Skilled Labor? The proportion of workers attending college has
increased in recent decades, so the supply curve for high-skilled labor has shifted to the right, from S0 to S1. If the
demand for high-skilled labor had remained at D0, then this shift in supply would have led to lower wages for high-
skilled labor. However, the wages for high-skilled labor, especially if there is a large global demand, have increased
even with the shift in supply to the right. The explanation must lie in a shift to the right in demand for high-skilled
labor, from D0 to D1. The figure shows how a combination of the shift in supply, from S0 to S1, and the shift in
demand, from D0 to D1, led to both an increase in the quantity of high-skilled labor hired and also to a rise in the
wage for such labor, from W0 to W1.
What factors would cause the demand for high-skilled labor to rise? The most plausible explanation is that
while the explosion in new information and communications technologies over the last several decades has
helped many workers to become more productive, the benefits have been especially great for high-skilled
workers like top business managers, consultants, and design professionals. The new technologies have also
helped to encourage globalization, the remarkable increase in international trade over the last few decades, by
378 15 · Poverty and Economic Inequality

       making it more possible to learn about and coordinate economic interactions all around the world. In turn, the
       rising impact of foreign trade in the U.S. economy has opened up greater opportunities for high-skilled
       workers to sell their services around the world, and lower-skilled workers have to compete with a larger supply
       of similarly skilled workers around the globe.

       We can view the market for high-skilled labor as a race between forces of supply and demand. Additional
       education and on-the-job training will tend to increase the high-skilled labor supply and to hold down its
       relative wage. Conversely, new technology and other economic trends like globalization tend to increase the
       demand for high-skilled labor and push up its relative wage. We can view the greater inequality of wages as a
       sign that demand for skilled labor is increasing faster than supply. Alternatively, if the supply of lower skilled
       workers exceeds the demand, then average wages in the lower quintiles of the income distribution will
       decrease. The combination of forces in the high-skilled and low-skilled labor markets leads to increased
       income disparity.

     15.5 Government Policies to Reduce Income Inequality

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain the arguments for and against government intervention in a market economy
         · Identify beneficial ways to reduce the economic inequality in a society
         · Show the tradeoff between incentives and income equality

       No society should expect or desire complete equality of income at a given point in time, for a number of
       reasons. First, most workers receive relatively low earnings in their first few jobs, higher earnings as they
       reach middle age, and then lower earnings after retirement. Thus, a society with people of varying ages will
       have a certain amount of income inequality. Second, people's preferences and desires differ. Some are willing
       to work long hours to have income for large houses, fast cars and computers, luxury vacations, and the ability
       to support children and grandchildren.

       These factors all imply that a snapshot of inequality in a given year does not provide an accurate picture of how
       people's incomes rise and fall over time. Even if we expect some degree of economic inequality at any point in
       time, how much inequality should there be? There is also the difference between income and wealth, as the
       following Clear It Up feature explains.

                CLEAR IT UP

      How do you measure wealth versus income inequality?

       Income is a flow of money received, often measured on a monthly or an annual basis. Wealth is the sum of the
       value of all assets, including money in bank accounts, financial investments, a pension fund, and the value of a
       home. In calculating wealth, one must subtract all debts, such as debt owed on a home mortgage and on credit
       cards. A retired person, for example, may have relatively little income in a given year, other than a pension or Social
       Security. However, if that person has saved and invested over time, the person's accumulated wealth can be quite
       substantial.

       In the United States, the wealth distribution is more unequal than the income distribution, because differences in
       income can accumulate over time to make even larger differences in wealth. However, we can measure the degree
       of inequality in the wealth distribution with the same tools we use to measure the inequality in the income
       distribution, like quintile measurements. Once every three years the Federal Reserve Bank publishes the Survey of
       Consumer Finance which reports a collection of data on wealth.

       Even if they cannot answer the question of how much inequality is too much, economists can still play an
       important role in spelling out policy options and tradeoffs. If a society decides to reduce the level of economic

inequality, it has three main sets of tools: redistribution from those with high incomes to those with low
incomes; trying to assure that a ladder of opportunity is widely available; and a tax on inheritance.

Redistribution

Redistribution means taking income from those with higher incomes and providing income to those with
lower incomes. Earlier in this chapter, we considered some of the key government policies that provide
support for people experiencing poverty: the welfare program TANF, the earned income tax credit, SNAP, and
Medicaid. If a reduction in inequality is desired, these programs could receive additional funding.

The federal income tax, which is a progressive tax system designed in such a way that the rich pay a higher
percent in income taxes than the poor, funds the programs. Data from household income tax returns in 2018
shows that the top 1% of households had an average income of $1,679,000 per year in pre-tax income and paid
an average federal tax rate of 25.4%. The effective income tax, which is total taxes paid divided by total
income (all sources of income such as wages, profits, interest, rental income, and government transfers such
as veterans' benefits), was much lower. The effective tax paid by that top 1% of householders paid was 20.4%,
while the bottom two quintiles actually paid negative effective income taxes, because of provisions like the
earned income tax credit. News stories occasionally report on a high-income person who has managed to pay
very little in taxes, but while such individual cases exist, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the
typical pattern is that people with higher incomes pay a higher average share of their income in federal income
taxes.

Of course, the fact that some degree of redistribution occurs now through the federal income tax and
government antipoverty programs does not settle the questions of how much redistribution is appropriate, and
whether more redistribution should occur.

The Ladder of Opportunity

Economic inequality is perhaps most troubling when it is not the result of effort or talent, but instead is
determined by the circumstances under which a child grows up. One child attends a well-run grade school and
high school and heads on to college, while parents help out by supporting education and other interests,
paying for college, a first car, and a first house, and offering work connections that lead to internships and jobs.
Another child attends a poorly run grade school, barely makes it through a low-quality high school, does not go
to college, and lacks family and peer support. These two children may be similar in their underlying talents
and in the effort they put forth, but their economic outcomes are likely to be quite different.

Public policy can attempt to build a ladder of opportunities so that, even though all children will never come
from identical families and attend identical schools, each child has a reasonable opportunity to attain an
economic niche in society based on their interests, desires, talents, and efforts. Table 15.8 shows some of those
initiatives.

TABLE 15.8 Public Policy Initiatives

Some have called the United States a land of opportunity. Although the general idea of a ladder of opportunity
for all citizens continues to exert a powerful attraction, specifics are often quite controversial. Society can
experiment with a wide variety of proposals for building a ladder of opportunity, especially for those who
otherwise seem likely to start their lives in a disadvantaged position. The government needs to carry out such
policy experiments in a spirit of open-mindedness, because some will succeed while others will not show
positive results or will cost too much to enact on a widespread basis.

Inheritance Taxes

There is always a debate about inheritance taxes. It goes like this: Why should people who have worked hard all
their lives and saved up a substantial nest egg not be able to give their money and possessions to their children
and grandchildren? In particular, it would seem un-American if children were unable to inherit a family
business or a family home. Alternatively, many Americans are far more comfortable with inequality resulting
from high-income people who earned their money by starting innovative new companies than they are with
inequality resulting from high-income people who have inherited money from rich parents.

The United States does have an estate tax--that is, a tax imposed on the value of an inheritance--which
suggests a willingness to limit how much wealth one can pass on as an inheritance. However, in 2022 the estate
tax applied only to those leaving inheritances of more than $12.06 million and thus applies to only a tiny
percentage of those with high levels of wealth.

The Tradeoff between Incentives and Income Equality

Government policies to reduce poverty or to encourage economic equality, if carried to extremes, can injure
incentives for economic output. The poverty trap, for example, defines a situation where guaranteeing a
certain level of income can eliminate or reduce the incentive to work. An extremely high degree of
redistribution, with very high taxes on the rich, would be likely to discourage work and entrepreneurship.
Thus, it is common to draw the tradeoff between economic output and equality, as Figure 15.10 (a) shows. In
this formulation, if society wishes a high level of economic output, like point A, it must also accept a high
degree of inequality. Conversely, if society wants a high level of equality, like point B, it must accept a lower
level of economic output because of reduced incentives for production.

This view of the tradeoff between economic output and equality may be too pessimistic, and Figure 15.10 (b)
presents an alternate vision. Here, the tradeoff between economic output and equality first slopes up, in the
vicinity of choice C, suggesting that certain programs might increase both output and economic equality. For
example, the policy of providing free public education has an element of redistribution, since the value of the
public schooling received by children of low-income families is clearly higher than what low-income families
pay in taxes. A well-educated population, however, is also an enormously powerful factor in providing the
skilled workers of tomorrow and helping the economy to grow and expand. In this case, equality and economic
growth may complement each other.

Moreover, policies to diminish inequality and soften the hardship of poverty may sustain political support for a
market economy. After all, if society does not make some effort toward reducing inequality and poverty, the
alternative might be that people would rebel against market forces. Citizens might seek economic security by
demanding that their legislators pass laws forbidding employers from ever laying off workers or reducing
wages, or laws that would impose price floors and price ceilings and shut off international trade. From this
viewpoint, policies to reduce inequality may help economic output by building social support for allowing
markets to operate.

FIGURE 15.10 The Tradeoff between Incentives and Economic Equality (a) Society faces a trade-off where any
attempt to move toward greater equality, like moving from choice A to B, involves a reduction in economic output.
(b) Situations can arise like point C, where it is possible both to increase equality and also to increase economic
output, to a choice like D. It may also be possible to increase equality with little impact on economic output, like the
movement from choice D to E. However, at some point, too aggressive a push for equality will tend to reduce
economic output, as in the shift from E to F.
The tradeoff in Figure 15.10 (b) then flattens out in the area between points D and E, which reflects the pattern
that a number of countries that provide similar levels of income to their citizens--the United States, Canada,
European Union nations, Japan, and Australia--have different levels of inequality. The pattern suggests that
countries in this range could choose a greater or a lesser degree of inequality without much impact on
economic output. Only if these countries push for a much higher level of equality, like at point F, will they
experience the diminished incentives that lead to lower levels of economic output. In this view, while a danger
always exists that an agenda to reduce poverty or inequality can be poorly designed or pushed too far, it is also
possible to discover and design policies that improve equality and do not injure incentives for economic output
by very much--or even improve such incentives.

         BRING IT HOME
Occupy Wall Street

The Occupy movement took on a life of its own over the last few months of 2011, bringing to light issues that many
people faced on the lower end of the income distribution. The contents of this chapter indicate that there is a
significant amount of income inequality in the United States. The question is: What should be done about it?
The 2008-2009 Great Recession caused unemployment to rise and incomes to fall. Many people attribute the
recession to mismanagement of the financial system by bankers and financial managers--those in the 1% of the
income distribution--but those in lower quintiles bore the greater burden of the recession through unemployment.
This seemed to present the picture of inequality in a different light: the group that seemed responsible for the
recession was not the group that seemed to bear the burden of the decline in output. A burden shared can bring a
382 15 · Poverty and Economic Inequality

       society closer together. A burden pushed off onto others can polarize it.
       On one level, the problem with trying to reduce income inequality comes down to whether you still believe in the
       American Dream. If you believe that one day you will have your American Dream--a large income, large house,
       happy family, or whatever else you would like to have in life--then you do not necessarily want to prevent anyone
       else from living out their dream. You certainly would not want to run the risk that someone would want to take part
       of your dream away from you. Thus, there is some reluctance to engage in a redistributive policy to reduce
       inequality.
       However, when those for whom the likelihood of living the American Dream is very small are considered, there are
       sound arguments in favor of trying to create greater balance. As the text indicated, a little more income equality,
       gained through long-term programs like increased education and job training, can increase overall economic output.
       Then everyone is made better off, and the 1% will not seem like such a small group any more.

Key Concepts and Summary

15.1 Drawing the Poverty Line

Wages are influenced by Supply and demand in labor markets influence wages. This can lead to very low
incomes for some people and very high incomes for others. Poverty and income inequality are not the same
thing. Poverty applies to the condition of people who cannot afford the necessities of life. Income inequality
refers to the disparity between those with higher and lower incomes. The poverty rate is what percentage of the
population lives below the poverty line, which the amount of income that it takes to purchase the necessities of
life determines. Choosing a poverty line will always be somewhat controversial.

15.2 The Poverty Trap

A poverty trap occurs when government-support payments decline as the recipients earn more income. As a
result, the recipients do not end up with much more income when they work, because the loss of government
support largely or completely offsets any income that one earns by working. Phasing out government benefits
more slowly, as well as imposing requirements for work as a condition of receiving benefits and a time limit on
benefits can reduce the harshness of the poverty trap.

15.3 The Safety Net

We call the group of government programs that address poverty the safety net. In the United States, prominent
safety net programs include Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), the Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program (SNAP), the earned income tax credit (EITC), Medicaid, and the Special Supplemental
Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).

15.4 Income Inequality: Measurement and Causes

Measuring inequality involves making comparisons across the entire distribution of income. One way of doing
this is to divide the population into groups, like quintiles, and then calculate what share of income each group
receives. An alternative approach is to draw Lorenz curves, which compare the cumulative income actually
received to a perfectly equal distribution of income. Income inequality in the United States increased
substantially from the late 1970s and early 1980s into the 2000s. The two most common explanations that
economists cite are changes in household structures that have led to more two-earner couples and single-
parent families, and the effect of new information and communications technology on wages.

15.5 Government Policies to Reduce Income Inequality

Policies that can affect the level of economic inequality include redistribution between rich and poor, making it
easier for people to climb the ladder of opportunity; and estate taxes, which are taxes on inheritances. Pushing
too aggressively for economic equality can run the risk of decreasing economic incentives. However, a
moderate push for economic equality can increase economic output, both through methods like improved
education and by building a base of political support for market forces.

Self-Check Questions

 1. Describe how each of these changes is likely to affect poverty and inequality:
      a. Incomes rise for low-income and high-income workers, but rise more for the high-income earners.
      b. Incomes fall for low-income and high-income workers, but fall more for high-income earners.

 2. Jonathon is a single father with one child. He can work as a server for $6 per hour for up to 1,500 hours per
     year. He is eligible for welfare, and so if he does not earn any income, he will receive a total of $10,000 per
     year. He can work and still receive government benefits, but for every $1 of income, his welfare stipend is
     $1 less. Create a table similar to Table 15.4 that shows Jonathan's options. Use four columns, the first
     showing number of hours to work, the second showing his earnings from work, the third showing the
     government benefits he will receive, and the fourth column showing his total income (earnings +
     government support). Sketch a labor-leisure diagram of Jonathan's opportunity set with and without
     government support.

 3. Imagine that the government reworks the welfare policy that was affecting Jonathan in question 1, so that
     for each dollar someone like Jonathan earns at work, his government benefits diminish by only 30 cents.
     Reconstruct the table from question 1 to account for this change in policy. Draw Jonathan's labor-leisure
     opportunity sets, both for before this welfare program is enacted and after it is enacted.

 4. We have discovered that the welfare system discourages recipients from working because the more
     income they earn, the less welfare benefits they receive. How does the earned income tax credit attempt to
     loosen the poverty trap?

     receives from this income distribution. Do the top and bottom quintiles in this distribution have a greater
     or larger share of total income than the top and bottom quintiles of the U.S. income distribution?

         BRING IT HOME

What's the Big Deal with Obamacare?

In August 2009, many members of the U.S. Congress used their summer recess to return to their home districts and
hold town hall-style meetings to discuss President Obama's proposed changes to the U.S. healthcare system. This
was officially known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) or as the Affordable Care Act (ACA),
but was more popularly known as Obamacare. The bill's opponents' claims ranged from the charge that the changes
were unconstitutional and would add $750 billion to the deficit, to extreme claims about the inclusion of things like
the implantation of microchips and so-called "death panels" that decide which critically-ill patients receive care and
which do not.
390 16 · Information, Risk, and Insurance

       Why did people react so strongly? After all, the intent of the law is to make healthcare insurance more affordable, to
       allow more people to obtain insurance, and to reduce the costs of healthcare. For each year from 2000 to 2011,
       these costs grew at least double the rate of inflation. In 2014, healthcare spending accounted for around 24% of all
       federal government spending. In the United States, we spend more for our healthcare than any other high-income
       nation, yet our health outcomes are worse than comparable high-income countries. In 2015, over 32 million people
       in the United States, about 12.8% of the non-elderly adult population, were without insurance. Even today, however,
       more than a decade after the Act was signed into law and after the Supreme Court mostly upheld it, a 2022 Kaiser
       Foundation poll found that 42% of likely voters viewed it unfavorably. Why is this?

       The debate over the ACA and healthcare reform could take an entire textbook, but what this chapter will do is
       introduce the basics of insurance and the problems insurance companies face. It is these problems, and how
       insurance companies respond to them that, in part, explain the divided opinion about the ACA.

       Every purchase is based on a belief about the satisfaction that the good or service will provide. In turn, these
       beliefs are based on the information that the buyer has available. For many products, the information available
       to the buyer or the seller is imperfect or unclear, which can either make buyers regret past purchases or avoid
       making future ones.

       This chapter discusses how imperfect and asymmetric information affect markets. The first module of the
       chapter discusses how asymmetric information affects markets for goods, labor, and financial capital. When
       buyers have less information about the quality of the good (for example, a gemstone) than sellers do, sellers
       may be tempted to mislead buyers. If a buyer cannot have at least some confidence in the quality of what they
       are purchasing, then they will be reluctant or unwilling to purchase the products. Thus, we require
       mechanisms to bridge this information gap, so buyers and sellers can engage in a transaction.

       The second module of the chapter discusses insurance markets, which also face similar problems of imperfect
       information. For example, a car insurance company would prefer to sell insurance only to those who are
       unlikely to have auto accidents--but it is hard for the firm to identify those perfectly safe drivers. Conversely,
       car insurance buyers would like to persuade the auto insurance company that they are safe drivers and should
       pay only a low price for coverage. If insurance markets cannot find ways to grapple with these problems of
       imperfect information, then even people who have low or average risks of making claims may not be able to
       purchase insurance. The chapter on financial markets (markets for stocks and bonds) will show that the
       problems of imperfect information can be especially poignant. We cannot eliminate imperfect information,
       but we can often manage it.

       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Analyze the impact of both imperfect information and asymmetric information

       Consider a purchase that many people make at important times in their lives: buying expensive jewelry. In May
       1994, celebrity psychologist Doree Lynn bought an expensive ring from a jeweler in Washington, D.C., which
       included an emerald that cost $14,500. Several years later, the emerald fractured. Lynn took it to another
       jeweler who found that cracks in the emerald had been filled with an epoxy resin. Lynn sued the original
       jeweler in 1997 for selling her a treated emerald without telling her, and won. The case publicized a number of
       little-known facts about precious stones. Most emeralds have internal flaws, and so they are soaked in clear oil
       or an epoxy resin to hide the flaws and make the color more deep and clear. Clear oil can leak out over time,
       and epoxy resin can discolor with age or heat. However, using clear oil or epoxy to "fill" emeralds is completely

legal, as long as it is disclosed.

After Doree Lynn's lawsuit, the NBC news show "Dateline" bought emeralds at four prominent jewelry stores in
New York City in 1997. All the sales clerks at these stores, unaware that they were being recorded on a hidden
camera, said the stones were untreated. When the emeralds were tested at a laboratory, however, technicians
discovered they had all been treated with oil or epoxy. Emeralds are not the only gemstones that are treated.
Diamonds, topaz, and tourmaline are also often irradiated to enhance colors. The general rule is that all
treatments to gemstones should be revealed, but often sellers do not disclose this. As such, many buyers face a
situation of asymmetric information, where two parties involved in an economic transaction have an unequal
amount of information (one party knows much more than the other).

Many economic transactions occur in a situation of imperfect information, where either the buyer, the seller,
or both, are less than 100% certain about the qualities of what they are buying and selling. Also, one may
characterize the transaction as asymmetric information, in which one party has more information than the
other regarding the economic transaction. Let's begin with some examples of how imperfect information
complicates transactions in goods, labor, and financial capital markets. The presence of imperfect information
can easily cause a decline in prices or quantities of products sold. However, buyers and sellers also have
incentives to create mechanisms that will allow them to make mutually beneficial transactions even in the face
of imperfect information.

If you are unclear about the difference between asymmetric information and imperfect information, read the
following Clear It Up feature.

         CLEAR IT UP

What is the difference between imperfect and asymmetric information?

For a market to reach equilibrium sellers and buyers must have full information about the product's price and
quality. If there is limited information, then buyers and sellers may not be able to transact or will possibly make poor
decisions.

Imperfect information refers to the situation where buyers and/or sellers do not have all of the necessary
information to make an informed decision about the product's price or quality. The term imperfect information
simply means that the buyers and/or sellers do not have all the information necessary to make an informed
decision. Asymmetric information is the condition where one party, either the buyer or the seller, has more
information about the product's quality or price than the other party. In either case (imperfect or asymmetric
information) buyers or sellers need remedies to make more informed decisions.

"Lemons" and Other Examples of Imperfect Information

Consider Marvin, who is trying to decide whether to buy a used car. Let's assume that Marvin is truly clueless
about what happens inside a car's engine. He is willing to do some background research, like reading
Consumer Reports or checking websites that offer information about used car makes and models and what
they should cost. He might pay a mechanic to inspect the car. Even after devoting some money and time
collecting information, however, Marvin still cannot be absolutely sure that he is buying a high-quality used
car. He knows that he might buy the car, drive it home, and use it for a few weeks before discovering that car is
a "lemon," which is slang for a defective product (especially a car).

Imagine that Marvin shops for a used car and finds two that look very similar in terms of mileage, exterior
appearances, and age. One car costs $4,000, while the other car costs $4,600. Which car should Marvin buy?

If Marvin were choosing in a world of perfect information, the answer would be simple: he should buy the
cheaper car. However, Marvin is operating in a world of imperfect information, where the sellers likely know
more about the car's problems than he does, and have an incentive to hide the information. After all, the more
392 16 · Information, Risk, and Insurance

       problems the sellers disclose, the lower the car's selling price.

       What should Marvin do? First, he needs to understand that even with imperfect information, prices still reflect
       information. Typically, used cars are more expensive on some dealer lots because the dealers have a
       trustworthy reputation to uphold. Those dealers try to fix problems that may not be obvious to their customers,
       in order to create good word of mouth about their vehicles' long term reliability. The short term benefits of
       selling their customers a "lemon" could cause a quick collapse in the dealer's reputation and a loss of long
       term profits. On other lots that are less well-established, one can find cheaper used cars, but the buyer takes on
       more risk when a dealer's reputation has little at stake. The cheapest cars of all often appear on Craigslist,
       where the individual seller has no reputation to defend. In sum, cheaper prices do carry more risk, so Marvin
       should balance his appetite for risk versus the potential headaches of many more unanticipated trips to the
       repair shop.

       Similar problems with imperfect information arise in labor and financial capital markets. Consider Greta, who
       is applying for a job. Her potential employer, like the used car buyer, is concerned about ending up with a
       "lemon"--in this case a poor quality employee. The employer will collect information about Greta's academic
       and work history. In the end, however, a degree of uncertainty will inevitably remain regarding Greta's abilities,
       which are hard to demonstrate without actually observing her on the job. How can a potential employer screen
       for certain attributes, such as motivation, timeliness, and ability to get along with others? Employers often look
       to trade schools and colleges to pre-screen candidates. Employers may not even interview a candidate unless
       he has a degree and, sometimes, a degree from a particular school. Employers may also view awards, a high
       grade point average, and other accolades as a signal of hard work, perseverance, and ability. Employers may
       also seek references for insights into key attributes such as energy level and work ethic.

      How Imperfect Information Can Affect Equilibrium Price and Quantity

       The presence of imperfect information can discourage both buyers and sellers from participating in the
       market. Buyers may become reluctant to participate because they cannot determine the product's quality.
       Sellers of high-quality or medium-quality goods may be reluctant to participate, because it is difficult to
       demonstrate the quality of their goods to buyers--and since buyers cannot determine which goods have higher
       quality, they are likely to be unwilling to pay a higher price for such goods.

       Economists sometimes refer to a market with few buyers and few sellers as a thin market. By contrast, they call
       a market with many buyers and sellers a thick market. When imperfect information is severe and buyers and
       sellers are discouraged from participating, markets may become extremely thin as a relatively small number
       of buyer and sellers attempt to communicate enough information that they can agree on a price.

      When Price Mixes with Imperfect Information about Quality

       A buyer confronted with imperfect information will often believe that the price reveals something about the
       product's quality. For example, a buyer may assume that a gemstone or a used car that costs more must be of
       higher quality, even though the buyer is not an expert on gemstones. Think of the expensive restaurant where
       the food must be good because it is so expensive or the shop where the clothes must be stylish because they
       cost so much, or the gallery where the art must be great, because the price tags are high. If you are hiring a
       lawyer, you might assume that a lawyer who charges $400 per hour must be better than a lawyer who charges
       $150 per hour. In these cases, price can act as a signal of quality.

       When buyers use the market price to draw inferences about the products' quality, then markets may have
       trouble reaching an equilibrium price and quantity. Imagine a situation where a used car dealer has a lot full of
       used cars that do not seem to be selling, and so the dealer decides to cut the car prices to sell a greater
       quantity. In a market with imperfect information, many buyers may assume that the lower price implies low-
       quality cars. As a result, the lower price may not attract more customers. Conversely, a dealer who raises prices
       may find that customers assume that the higher price means that cars are of higher quality. As a result of
       raising prices, the dealer might sell more cars. (Whether or not consumers always behave rationally, as an

economist would see it, is the subject of the following Clear It Up feature.)

The idea that higher prices might cause a greater quantity demanded and that lower prices might cause a
lower quantity demanded runs exactly counter to the basic model of demand and supply (as we outlined in the
Demand and Supply chapter). These contrary effects, however, will reach natural limits. At some point, if the
price is high enough, the quantity demanded will decline. Conversely, when the price declines far enough,
buyers will increasingly find value even if the quality is lower. In addition, information eventually becomes
more widely known. An overpriced restaurant that charges more than the quality of its food is worth to many
buyers will not last forever.

         CLEAR IT UP

Is consumer behavior rational?

There is much human behavior that mainstream economists have tended to call "irrational" since it is consistently at
odds with economists' utility maximizing models. The typical response is for economists to brush these behaviors
aside and call them "anomalies" or unexplained quirks.

"If only you knew more economics, you would not be so irrational," is what many mainstream economists seem to
be saying. A group known as behavioral economists has challenged this notion, because so much of this so-called
"quirky" behavior is extremely common among us. For example, a conventional economist would say that if you lost
a $10 bill today, and also received an extra $10 in your paycheck, you should feel perfectly neutral. After all, -$10 +
$10 = $0. You are the same financially as you were before. However, behavioral economists have conducted
research that shows many people will feel some negative emotion--anger or frustration--after those two things
happen. We tend to focus more on the loss than the gain. Economists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in a
famous 1979 Econometrica paper called this "loss aversion", where a $1 loss pains us 2.25 times more than a $1
gain helps us. This has implications for investing, as people tend to "overplay" the stock market by reacting more to
losses than to gains.

Behavioral economics also tries to explain why people make seemingly irrational decisions in the presence of
different situations, or how they "frame" the decision. We outline a popular example here: Imagine you have the
opportunity to buy an alarm clock for $20 in Store A. Across the street, you learn, is the exact same clock at Store B
for $10. You might say it is worth your time--a five-minute walk--to save $10. Now, take a different example: You are
in Store A buying a $300 phone. Five minutes away, at Store B, the same phone is $290. You again save $10 by
taking a five-minute walk. Do you do it?

Surprisingly, it is likely that you would not. Mainstream economists would say "$10 is $10" and that it would be
irrational to make a five minute walk for $10 in one case and not the other. However, behavioral economists have
pointed out that most of us evaluate outcomes relative to a reference point--here the cost of the product--and think
of gains and losses as percentages rather than using actual savings.

Which view is right? Both have their advantages, but behavioral economists have at least shed a light on trying to
describe and explain systematic behavior which some previously had dismissed as irrational. If most of us are
engaged in some "irrational behavior," perhaps there are deeper underlying reasons for this behavior in the first
place.

Mechanisms to Reduce the Risk of Imperfect Information

If you were selling a good like emeralds or used cars where imperfect information is likely to be a problem,
how could you reassure possible buyers? If you were buying a good where imperfect information is a problem,
what would it take to reassure you? Buyers and sellers in the goods market rely on reputation as well as
guarantees, warrantees, and service contracts to assure product quality. The labor market uses occupational
licenses and certifications to assure competency, while the financial capital market uses cosigners and
394 16 · Information, Risk, and Insurance

       collateral as insurance against unforeseen, detrimental events.

       In the goods market, the seller might offer a money-back guarantee, an agreement that functions as a
       promise of quality. This strategy may be especially important for a company that sells goods through mail-
       order catalogs or over the web, whose customers cannot see the actual products, because it encourages people
       to buy something even if they are not certain they want to keep it.

       L.L. Bean started using money-back-guarantees in 1911, when the founder stitched waterproof shoe rubbers
       together with leather shoe tops, and sold them as hunting shoes. He guaranteed satisfaction. However, the
       stitching came apart and, out of the first batch of 100 pairs that were sold, customers returned 90 pairs. L.L.
       Bean took out a bank loan, repaired all of the shoes, and replaced them. The L.L. Bean reputation for customer
       satisfaction began to spread. Many firms today offer money-back-guarantees for a few weeks or months, but
       L.L. Bean offers a one year money-back guarantee. In the past, L.L. Bean offered a lifetime money-back
       guarantee, which allowed customers to always return anything they had bought from L.L. Bean, no matter how
       many years later or what condition the product was in, for a full refund.

       L.L. Bean has very few stores. Instead, most of its sales are made by mail, telephone, or, now, through their
       website. For this kind of firm, imperfect information may be an especially difficult problem, because
       customers cannot see and touch what they are buying. A combination of a money-back guarantee and a
       reputation for quality can help for a mail-order firm to flourish.

       Sellers may offer a warranty, which is a promise to fix or replace the good, at least for a certain time period.
       The seller may also offer a buyer a chance to buy a service contract, where the buyer pays an extra amount
       and the seller agrees to fix anything that goes wrong for a set time period. Service contracts are often an option
       for buyers of large purchases such as cars, appliances and even houses.

       Guarantees, warranties, and service contracts are examples of explicit reassurance that sellers provide. In
       many cases, firms also offer unstated guarantees. For example, some movie theaters might refund the ticket
       cost to a customer who walks out complaining about the show. Likewise, while restaurants do not generally
       advertise a money-back guarantee or exchange policies, many restaurants allow customers to exchange one
       dish for another or reduce the price of the bill if the customer is not satisfied.

       The rationale for these policies is that firms want repeat customers, who in turn will recommend the business
       to others. As such, establishing a good reputation is of paramount importance. When buyers know that a firm
       is concerned about its reputation, they are less likely to worry about receiving a poor-quality product. For
       example, a well-established grocery store with a good reputation can often charge a higher price than a
       temporary stand at a local farmer's market, where the buyer may never see the seller again.

       Sellers of labor provide information through resumes, recommendations, school transcripts, and examples of
       their work. The labor market also uses occupational licenses to establish quality in the labor market.
       Occupational licenses, which government agencies typically issue, show that a worker has completed a certain
       type of education or passed a certain test. Some of the professionals who must hold a license are doctors,
       teachers, nurses, engineers, accountants, and lawyers. In addition, most states require a license to work as a
       barber, an embalmer, a dietitian, a massage therapist, a hearing aid dealer, a counselor, an insurance agent,
       and a real estate broker. Some other jobs require a license in only one state. Minnesota requires a state license
       to be a field archaeologist. North Dakota has a state license for bait retailers. In Louisiana, one needs a state
       license to be a "stress analyst" and California requires a state license to be a furniture upholsterer. According
       to a 2013 study from the University of Chicago, about 29% of U.S. workers have jobs that require occupational
       licenses.

       Occupational licenses have their downside as well, as they represent a barrier to entry to certain industries.
       This makes it more difficult for new entrants to compete with incumbents, which can lead to higher prices and
       less consumer choice. In occupations that require licenses, the government has decided that the additional
       information provided by licenses outweighs the negative effect on competition.

         CLEAR IT UP

Are advertisers allowed to benefit from imperfect information?

Many advertisements seem full of imperfect information--at least by what they imply. Driving a certain car, drinking
a particular soda, or wearing a certain shoe are all unlikely to bring fashionable friends and fun automatically, if at
all. The government rules on advertising, enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), allow advertising to
contain a certain amount of exaggeration about the general delight of using a product. They, however, also demand
that if one presents a claim as a fact, it must be true.

Legally, deceptive advertising dates back to the 1950s when Colgate-Palmolive created a television advertisement
that seemed to show Rapid Shave shaving cream being spread on sandpaper and then the sand was shaved off the
sandpaper. What the television advertisement actually showed was sand sprinkled on Plexiglas--without glue--and
then scraped aside by the razor.

In the 1960s, in magazine advertisements for Campbell's vegetable soup, the company was having problems getting
an appetizing soup picture, because the vegetables kept sinking. To remedy this, they filled a bowl with marbles and
poured the soup over the top, so that the bowl appeared to be crammed with vegetables.

In the late 1980s, the Volvo Company filmed a television advertisement that showed a monster truck driving over
cars, crunching their roofs--all except for the Volvo, which did not crush. However, the FTC found in 1991 that the
Volvo's roof from the filming had been reinforced with an extra steel framework, while they cut the roof supports on
the other car brands.

The Wonder Bread Company ran television advertisements featuring "Professor Wonder," who said that because
Wonder Bread contained extra calcium, it would help children's minds work better and improve their memory. The
FTC objected, and in 2002 the company agreed to stop running the advertisements.

As we can see in each of these cases, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) often checks factual claims about the
product's performance, at least to some extent. Language and images that are exaggerated or ambiguous, but not
actually false, are allowed in advertising. Untrue "facts" are not permitted. In any case, an old Latin saying applies
when watching advertisements: Caveat emptor--that is, "let the buyer beware."

On the buyer's side of the labor market, a standard precaution against hiring a "lemon" of an employee is to
specify that the first few months of employment are officially a trial or probationary period, and that the
employer can dismiss the worker for any reason or no reason during that time. Sometimes workers also
receive lower pay during this trial period.

In the financial capital market, before a bank makes a loan, it requires a prospective borrower to fill out forms
regarding incomes sources. In addition, the bank conducts a credit check on the individual's past borrowing.
Another approach is to require a cosigner on a loan; that is, another person or firm who legally pledges to
repay some or all of the money if the original borrower does not do so. Another approach is to require
collateral, often property or equipment that the bank would have a right to seize and sell if borrower does not
repay the loan.

Buyers of goods and services cannot possibly become experts in evaluating the quality of gemstones, used
cars, lawyers, and everything else they buy. Employers and lenders cannot be perfectly omniscient about
whether possible workers will turn out well or potential borrowers will repay loans on time. However, the
mechanisms that we mentioned above can reduce the risks associated with imperfect information so that the
buyer and seller are willing to proceed.

16.2 Insurance and Imperfect Information

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Explain how insurance works
  · Identify and evaluate various forms of government and social insurance
  · Discuss the problems caused by moral hazard and adverse selection
  · Analyze the impact of government regulation of insurance

Insurance is a method that households and firms use to prevent any single event from having a significant
detrimental financial effect. Generally, households or firms with insurance make regular payments, called
premiums. The insurance company prices these premiums based on the probability of certain events
occurring among a pool of people. Members of the group who then suffer a specified bad experience receive
payments from this pool of money.

Many people have several kinds of insurance: health insurance that pays when they receive medical care; car
insurance that pays if their car is in an automobile accident; house or renter's insurance that pays for stolen
possessions or items damaged by fire; and life insurance, which pays for the family if the insured individual
dies. Table 16.1 lists a set of insurance markets.

TABLE 16.1 Some Insurance Markets

All insurance involves imperfect information in both an obvious way and in a deeper way. At an obvious level,
we cannot predict future events with certainty. For example, we cannot know with certainty who will have a car
accident, become ill, die, or have his home robbed in the next year. Imperfect information also applies to
estimating the risk that something will happen to any individual. It is difficult for an insurance company to
estimate the risk that, say, a particular 20-year-old male driver from New York City will have an accident,
because even within that group, some drivers will drive more safely than others. Thus, adverse events occur
out of a combination of people's characteristics and choices that make the risks higher or lower and then the
good or bad luck of what actually happens.

How Insurance Works

A simplified example of automobile insurance might work this way. Suppose we divide a group of 100 drivers
into three groups. In a given year, 60 of those people have only a few door dings or chipped paint, which costs
$100 each. Another 30 of the drivers have medium-sized accidents that cost an average of $1,000 in damages,

Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                              16.2 · Insurance and Imperfect Information 397

and 10 of the drivers have large accidents that cost $15,000 in damages. For the moment, let's imagine that at
the beginning of any year, there is no way of identifying the drivers who are low-risk, medium-risk, or high-
risk. The total damage incurred by car accidents in this group of 100 drivers will be $186,000, that is:

If each of the 100 drivers pays a $1,860 premium each year, the insurance company will collect the $186,000
that is needed to cover the costs of the accidents that occur.
Since insurance companies have such a large number of clients, they are able to negotiate with health care and
other service providers for lower rates than the individual would be able to get, thus increasing the benefit to
consumers of becoming insured and saving the insurance company itself money when it pays out claims.
Insurance companies receive income, as Figure 16.2 shows, from insurance premiums and investment
income. The companies derive income from investing the funds that insurance companies received in the past
but did not pay out as insurance claims in prior years. The insurance company receives a rate of return from
investing these funds or reserves. The companies typically invest in fairly safe, liquid (easy to convert into
cash) investments, as the insurance companies need to be able to readily access these funds when a major
disaster strikes.

FIGURE 16.2 An Insurance Company: What Comes In, What Goes Out Money flows into an insurance company
through premiums and investments and out through the payment of claims and operating expenses.

Government and Social Insurance

Federal and state governments run a number of insurance programs. Some of the programs look much like
private insurance, in the sense that the members of a group make steady payments into a fund, and those in
the group who suffer an adverse experience receive payments. Other programs protect against risk, but
without an explicit fund set up. Following are some examples.

  · Unemployment insurance: Employers in every state pay a small amount for unemployment insurance,
      which goes into a fund to pay benefits to workers who lose their jobs and do not find new jobs, for a period
      of time, usually up to six months.

  · Pension insurance: Employers that offer pensions to their retired employees are required by law to pay a
      small fraction of what they are setting aside for pensions to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation,
      which pays at least some pension benefits to workers if a company goes bankrupt and cannot pay the
      pensions it has promised.

  · Deposit insurance: Banks are required by law to pay a small fraction of their deposits to the Federal
      Deposit Insurance Corporation, which goes into a fund that pays depositors the value of their bank
      deposits up to $250,000 (the amount was raised from $100,000 to $250,000 in 2008) if the bank should go
      bankrupt.

  · Workman's compensation insurance: Employers are required by law to pay a small percentage of the
      salaries that they pay into funds, typically run at the state level, that pay benefits to workers who suffer an
      injury on the job.

  · Retirement insurance: All workers pay a percentage of their income into Social Security and into Medicare,
      which then provides income and health care benefits to the elderly. Social Security and Medicare are not
398 16 · Information, Risk, and Insurance

             literally "insurance" in the sense that those currently contributing to the fund are not eligible for benefits.
             They function like insurance, however, in the sense that individuals make regular payments into the
             programs today in exchange for benefits they will receive in the case of a later event--either becoming old
             or becoming sick when old. A name for such programs is "social insurance."

       The major additional costs to insurance companies, other than the payment of claims, are the costs of running
       a business: the administrative costs of hiring workers, administering accounts, and processing insurance
       claims. For most insurance companies, the insurance premiums coming in and the claims payments going out
       are much larger than the amounts earned by investing money or the administrative costs.

       Thus, while factors like investment income earned on reserves, administrative costs, and groups with different
       risks complicate the overall picture, a fundamental law of insurance must hold true: The average person's
       payments into insurance over time must cover 1) the average person's claims, 2) the costs of running the
       company, and 3) leave room for the firm's profits.

      Risk Groups and Actuarial Fairness

       Not all of those who purchase insurance face the same risks. Some people may be more likely, because of
       genetics or personal habits, to fall sick with certain diseases. Some people may live in an area where car theft
       or home robbery is more likely than in other areas. Some drivers are safer than others. A risk group can be
       defined as a group that shares roughly the same risks of an adverse event occurring.

       Insurance companies often classify people into risk groups, and charge lower premiums to those with lower
       risks. If people are not separated into risk groups, then those with low risk must pay for those with high risks.
       In the simple example of how car insurance works, 60 drivers had very low damage of $100 each, 30 drivers
       had medium-sized accidents that cost $1,000 each, and 10 of the drivers had large accidents that cost $15,000.
       If all 100 of these drivers pay the same $1,860, then those with low damages are in effect paying for those with
       high damages.

       If it is possible to classify drivers according to risk group, then the insurance company can charge each group
       according to its expected losses. For example, the insurance company might charge the 60 drivers who seem
       safest of all $100 apiece, which is the average value of the damages they cause. Then the intermediate group
       could pay $1,000 apiece and the high-cost group $15,000 each. When the level of insurance premiums that
       someone pays is equal to the amount that an average person in that risk group would collect in insurance
       payments, the level of insurance is said to be "actuarially fair."

       Classifying people into risk groups can be controversial. For example, if someone had a major automobile
       accident last year, should the insurance company classify that person as a high-risk driver who is likely to have
       similar accidents in the future, or as a low-risk driver who was just extremely unlucky? The driver is likely to
       claim to be low-risk, and thus someone who should be in a risk group with those who pay low insurance
       premiums in the future. The insurance company is likely to believe that, on average, having a major accident is
       a signal of being a high-risk driver, and thus try to charge this driver higher insurance premiums. The next two
       sections discuss the two major problems of imperfect information in insurance markets--called moral hazard
       and adverse selection. Both problems arise from attempts to categorize those purchasing insurance into risk
       groups.

      The Moral Hazard Problem

       Moral hazard refers to the case when people engage in riskier behavior with insurance than they would if they
       did not have insurance. For example, if you have health insurance that covers the cost of visiting the doctor,
       you may be less likely to take precautions against catching an illness that might require a doctor's visit. If you
       have car insurance, you will worry less about driving or parking your car in ways that make it more likely to get
       dented. In another example, a business without insurance might install absolute top-level security and fire
       sprinkler systems to guard against theft and fire. If it is insured, that same business might only install a

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                              16.2 · Insurance and Imperfect Information 399

minimum level of security and fire sprinkler systems.

We cannot eliminate moral hazard, but insurance companies have some ways of reducing its effect.
Investigations to prevent insurance fraud are one way of reducing the extreme cases of moral hazard.
Insurance companies can also monitor certain kinds of behavior. To return to the example from above, they
might offer a business a lower rate on property insurance if the business installs a top-level security and fire
sprinkler system and has those systems inspected once a year.

Another method to reduce moral hazard is to require the injured party to pay a share of the costs. For example,
insurance policies often have deductibles, which is an amount that the insurance policyholder must pay out of
their own pocket before the insurance coverage starts paying. For example, auto insurance might pay for all
losses greater than $500. Health insurance policies often have a copayment, in which the policyholder must
pay a small amount. For example, a person might have to pay $20 for each doctor visit, and the insurance
company would cover the rest. Another method of cost sharing is coinsurance, which means that the
insurance company covers a certain percentage of the cost. For example, insurance might pay for 80% of the
costs of repairing a home after a fire, but the homeowner would pay the other 20%.

All of these forms of cost sharing discourage moral hazard, because people know that they will have to pay
something out of their own pocket when they make an insurance claim. The effect can be powerful. One
prominent study found that when people face moderate deductibles and copayments for their health
insurance, they consume about one-third less in medical care than people who have complete insurance and
do not pay anything out of pocket, presumably because deductibles and copayments reduce the level of moral
hazard. However, those who consumed less health care did not seem to have any difference in health status.

A final way of reducing moral hazard, which is especially applicable to health care, is to focus on healthcare
incentives of providers rather than consumers. Traditionally, most health care in the United States has been
provided on a fee-for-service basis, which means that medical care providers are paid for the services they
provide and are paid more if they provide additional services. However, in the last decade or so, the structure
of healthcare provision has shifted to an emphasis on health maintenance organizations (HMOs). A health
maintenance organization (HMO) provides healthcare that receives a fixed amount per person enrolled in the
plan--regardless of how many services are provided. In this case, a patient with insurance has an incentive to
demand more care, but the healthcare provider, which is receiving only a fixed payment, has an incentive to
reduce the moral hazard problem by limiting the quantity of care provided--as long as it will not lead to worse
health problems and higher costs later. Today, many doctors are paid with some combination of managed care
and fee-for-service; that is, a flat amount per patient, but with additional payments for the treatment of certain
health conditions.

Imperfect information is the cause of the moral hazard problem. If an insurance company had perfect
information on risk, it could simply raise its premiums every time an insured party engages in riskier
behavior. However, an insurance company cannot monitor all the risks that people take all the time and so,
even with various checks and cost sharing, moral hazard will remain a problem.

and behavioral economics.

The Adverse Selection Problem

Adverse selection refers to the problem in which insurance buyers have more information about whether they
are high-risk or low-risk than the insurance company does. This creates an asymmetric information problem
for the insurance company because buyers who are high-risk tend to want to buy more insurance, without
letting the insurance company know about their higher risk. For example, someone purchasing health
400 16 · Information, Risk, and Insurance

       insurance or life insurance probably knows more about their family's health history than an insurer can
       reasonably find out even with a costly investigation. Someone purchasing car insurance may know that they
       are a high-risk driver who has not yet had a major accident--but it is hard for the insurance company to collect
       information about how people actually drive.

       To understand how adverse selection can strangle an insurance market, recall the situation of 100 drivers who
       are buying automobile insurance, where 60 drivers had very low damages of $100 each, 30 drivers had
       medium-sized accidents that cost $1,000 each, and 10 of the drivers had large accidents that cost $15,000.
       That would equal $186,000 in total payouts by the insurance company. Imagine that, while the insurance
       company knows the overall size of the losses, it cannot identify the high-risk, medium-risk, and low-risk
       drivers. However, the drivers themselves know their risk groups. Since there is asymmetric information
       between the insurance company and the drivers, the insurance company would likely set the price of
       insurance at $1,860 per year, to cover the average loss (not including the cost of overhead and profit). The
       result is that those with low risks of only $100 will likely decide not to buy insurance; after all, it makes no
       sense for them to pay $1,860 per year when they are likely only to experience losses of $100. Those with
       medium risks of a $1,000 accident will not buy insurance either. Therefore, the insurance company ends up
       only selling insurance for $1,860 to high-risk drivers who will average $15,000 in claims apiece, and as a
       consequence, the insurance company ends up losing considerable money. If the insurance company tries to
       raise its premiums to cover the losses of those with high risks, then those with low or medium risks will be
       even more discouraged from buying insurance.

       Rather than face such a situation of adverse selection, the insurance company may decide not to sell insurance
       in this market at all. If potential buyers are to receive insurance, then one of two things must happen. First, the
       insurance company might find some way of separating insurance buyers into risk groups with some degree of
       accuracy and charging them accordingly, which in practice often means that the insurance company tries not
       to sell insurance to those who may pose high risks. Another scenario is that those with low risks must buy
       insurance, even if they have to pay more than the actuarially fair amount for their risk group. The notion that
       people can be required to purchase insurance raises the issue of government laws and regulations that
       influence the insurance industry.

      U.S. Health Care in an International Context

       The United States is the only high-income country in the world where private firms pay and provide for most
       health insurance. Greater government involvement in the provision of health insurance is one possible way of
       addressing moral hazard and adverse selection problems.

       The moral hazard problem with health insurance is that when people have insurance, they will demand higher
       quantities of health care. In the United States, private healthcare insurance tends to encourage an ever-greater
       demand for healthcare services, which healthcare providers are happy to fulfill. Table 16.2 shows that on a
       per-person basis, U.S. healthcare spending towers above healthcare spending of other countries. Note that
       while healthcare expenditures in the United States are far higher than healthcare expenditures in other
       countries, the health outcomes in the United States, as measured by life expectancy and lower rates of
       childhood mortality, tend to be lower. Health outcomes, however, may not be significantly affected by
       healthcare expenditures. Many studies have shown that a country's health is more closely related to diet,
       exercise, and genetic factors than to healthcare expenditure. This fact further emphasizes that the United
       States is spending very large amounts on medical care with little obvious health gain.

       In the U.S. health insurance market, the main way of solving this adverse selection problem is that health
       insurance is often sold through groups based on place of employment, or, under The Affordable Care Act, from
       a state government sponsored health exchange market. From an insurance company's point of view, selling
       insurance through an employer mixes together a group of people--some with high risks of future health
       problems and some with lower risks--and thus reduces the insurance firm's fear of attracting only those who
       have high risks. However, many small companies do not provide health insurance to their employees, and

many lower-paying jobs do not include health insurance. Even after we take into account all U.S. government
programs that provide health insurance for the elderly and people experiencing poverty, approximately 31
million Americans were without health insurance in 2020. While a government-controlled system can avoid
the adverse selection problem entirely by providing at least basic health insurance for all, another option is to
mandate that all Americans buy health insurance from some provider by preventing providers from denying
individuals based on preexisting conditions. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act adopted this
approach, which we will discuss later on in this chapter.

TABLE 16.2 A Comparison of Health Care Spending per Person, Life Expectancy at Birth, and Infant Mortality,
2020 (Source: 2020 OECD study and World Fact Book)

At its best, the largely private U.S. system of health insurance and healthcare delivery provides an
extraordinarily high quality of care, along with generating a seemingly endless parade of life-saving
innovations. However, the system also struggles to control its high costs and to provide basic medical care to
all. Compared to the United States, other countries have lower costs, more equal access, and better mortality
outcomes, but they often struggle to provide rapid access to health care and to offer the near-miracles of the
most up-to-date medical care. The challenge is a healthcare system that strikes the right balance between
quality, access, and cost.

Government Regulation of Insurance

The U.S. insurance industry is primarily regulated at the state level. Since 1871 there has been a National
Association of Insurance Commissioners that brings together these state regulators to exchange information
and strategies. The state insurance regulators typically attempt to accomplish two things: to keep the price of
insurance low and to ensure that everyone has insurance. These goals, however, can conflict with each other
and also become easily entangled in politics.

If insurance premiums are set at actuarially fair levels, so that people end up paying an amount that accurately
reflects their risk group, certain people will end up paying considerable amounts. For example, if health
insurance companies were trying to cover people who already have a chronic disease like AIDS, or who were
elderly, they would charge these groups very high premiums for health insurance, because their expected
health care costs are quite high. Women in the age bracket 18-44 consume, on average, about 65% more in
health care spending than men. Young male drivers have more car accidents than young female drivers. Thus,
actuarially fair insurance would tend to charge young men much more for car insurance than young women.
Because people in high-risk groups would find themselves charged so heavily for insurance, they might choose
not to buy insurance at all.
402 16 · Information, Risk, and Insurance

       State insurance regulators have sometimes reacted by passing rules that attempt to set low premiums for
       insurance. Over time, however, the fundamental law of insurance must hold: the average amount individuals
       receive cannot exceed the average amount paid in premiums. When rules are passed to keep premiums low,
       insurance companies try to avoid insuring any high-risk or even medium-risk parties. If a state legislature
       passes strict rules requiring insurance companies to sell to everyone at low prices, the insurance companies
       always have the option of withdrawing from doing business in that state. For example, the insurance regulators
       in New Jersey are well-known for attempting to keep auto insurance premiums low, and more than 20
       different insurance companies stopped doing business in the state in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Similarly,
       in 2009, State Farm announced that it was withdrawing from selling property insurance in Florida.

       In short, government regulators cannot force companies to charge low prices and provide high levels of
       insurance coverage--and thus take losses--for a sustained period of time. If insurance premiums are set below
       the actuarially fair level for a certain group, some other group will have to make up the difference. There are
       two other groups who can make up the difference: taxpayers or other insurance buyers.

       In some industries, the U.S. government has decided free markets will not provide insurance at an affordable
       price, and so the government pays for it directly. For example, private health insurance is too expensive for
       many people whose incomes are too low. To combat this, the U.S. government, together with the states, runs
       the Medicaid program, which provides health care to those with low incomes. Private health insurance also
       does not work well for the elderly, because their average health care costs can be very high. Thus, the U.S.
       government started the Medicare program, which provides health insurance to all those over age 65. Other
       government-funded health-care programs are aimed at military veterans, as an added benefit, and children in
       families with relatively low incomes.

       Another common government intervention in insurance markets is to require that everyone buy certain kinds
       of insurance. For example, most states legally require car owners to buy auto insurance. Likewise, when a bank
       loans someone money to buy a home, the person is typically required to have homeowner's insurance, which
       protects against fire and other physical damage (like hailstorms) to the home. A legal requirement that
       everyone must buy insurance means that insurance companies do not need to worry that those with low risks
       will avoid buying insurance. Since insurance companies do not need to fear adverse selection, they can set
       their prices based on an average for the market, and those with lower risks will, to some extent, end up
       subsidizing those with higher risks. However, even when laws are passed requiring people to purchase
       insurance, insurance companies cannot be compelled to sell insurance to everyone who asks--at least not at
       low cost. Thus, insurance companies will still try to avoid selling insurance to those with high risks whenever
       possible.

       The government cannot pass laws that make the problems of moral hazard and adverse selection disappear,
       but the government can make political decisions that certain groups should have insurance, even though the
       private market would not otherwise provide that insurance. Also, the government can impose the costs of that
       decision on taxpayers or on other buyers of insurance.

      The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act

       In March of 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA).
       The government started to phase in this highly contentious law over time starting in October of 2013. The goal
       of the act is to bring the United States closer to universal coverage. Some of the key features of the plan include:

         · Individual mandate: All individuals, who do not receive health care through their employer or through a
             government program (for example, Medicare), were required to have health insurance or pay a fine. The
             individual mandate's goal was to reduce the adverse selection problem and keep prices down by requiring
             all consumers--even the healthiest ones--to have health insurance. Without the need to guard against
             adverse selection (whereby only the riskiest consumers buy insurance) by raising prices, health insurance
             companies could provide more reasonable plans to their customers. At the beginning of 2019, the fine for

      not having health insurance was eliminated.
  · Each state is required to have health insurance exchanges, or utilize the federal exchange, whereby

      insurance companies compete for business. The goal of the exchanges is to improve competition in the
      market for health insurance.
  · Employer mandate: All employers with more than 50 employees must offer health insurance to their
      employees.

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) is funded through additional taxes that include:

  · Increasing the Medicare tax by 0.9 percent and adding a 3.8 percent tax on unearned income for high
      income taxpayers.

  · Charging an annual fee on health insurance providers.
  · Imposing other taxes such as a 2.3% tax on manufacturers and importers of certain medical devices.

Many people and politicians, including Donald Trump, have sought to overturn the bill. Those who oppose the
bill believe it violates an individual's right to choose whether to have insurance or not. In 2012, a number of
states challenged the law on the basis that the individual mandate provision is unconstitutional. In June 2012,
the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a 5-4 decision that the individual mandate is actually a tax, so it is
constitutional as the federal government has the right to tax the populace. At the same time, some of the taxes
that were implemented as part of the ACA have been eliminated.

         BRING IT HOME

What's the Big Deal with Obamacare?

What is it that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will actually do? To begin with, we should note that it is a massively
complex law, with a large number of parts, some of which the Obama administration implemented immediately, and
others that the government is supposed to phase in every year from 2013 through 2020. Three of these parts are
coverage for the uninsured--those without health insurance, coverage for individuals with preexisting conditions,
and the so-called employer and individual mandates, which require employers to offer and people to purchase
health insurance. Under the Trump administration, several components of the ACA were repealed or overhauled,
while under the Biden administration (and with the support of a majority of the population) the ACA has continued
as a major element in provision of health care in the United States.

As we noted in the chapter, people face ever-increasing healthcare costs in the United States. Over the years, the
ranks of the uninsured in the United States have grown as rising prices have pushed employers and individuals out
of the market. Insurance companies have increasingly used pre-existing medical conditions to determine if
someone is high risk, for whom insurance companies either charge higher prices, or they choose to deny insurance
coverage to these individuals. Whatever the cause, we noted at the beginning of the chapter that prior to the ACA,
more than 32 million Americans were uninsured. People who are uninsured tend to use emergency rooms for
treatment--the most expensive form of healthcare, which has contributed significantly to rising costs.

The ACA introduced regulations designed to control increases in healthcare costs. One example is a cap on the
amount healthcare providers can spend on administrative costs. Another is a requirement that healthcare providers
switch to electronic medical records (EMRs), which will reduce administrative costs.

The ACA required that states establish health insurance exchanges, or markets, where people without health
insurance, and businesses that do not provide it for their employees, can shop for different insurance plans. The
purpose of these exchanges was to increase competition in insurance markets and thus reduce prices of policies.

Finally, the ACA mandated that people with preexisting conditions could no longer be denied health insurance. The
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services estimates that the those without insurance in the US has fallen from
20.3% in 2012 to 11.5% in 2016. Accordingly, 20 million Americans gained coverage under the ACA. According to
the Census, as of 2020, the share of the population without health insurance had fallen to 8.6%. So the ACA has
404 16 · Information, Risk, and Insurance

       resulted in a decline in the percentage of Americans without health insurance by almost 60%.
       What was the cost of this increased coverage and how was it paid? An insurance policy works by insuring against the
       possibility of needing healthcare. If there are high risk individuals in the insurance pool, the pool must be expanded
       to include enough low risk individuals to keep average premiums affordable. To that end, the ACA imposed the
       individual mandate, requiring all individuals to purchase insurance (or pay a penalty) whether they were high risk or
       not. Many young adults would choose to skip health insurance since the likelihood of their needing significant
       healthcare is small. The individual mandate brought in a significant amount of money to pay for the ACA. However,
       despite the elimination of the penalty for not having insurance, ACA coverage has continued to increase. In addition,
       there were three other funding sources. The ACA took $716 billion which otherwise would have gone to Medicare
       spending. The ACA also increased the Medicare tax that wealthy Americans paid by an additional 0.9%. Despite
       these funding sources, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the ACA will increase the federal debt by
       $137 billion over the next decade.
       The impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has been a rise in Americans with health insurance.
       However, due to the increased taxes to pay for the ACA and the increased deficit spending, the ACA faces continued
       opposition. The Trump administration vowed to repeal it on the campaign trail but no alternative bill has made its
       way before congress. Only time will tell if the Affordable Care Act will leave a legacy or will quickly be swept by the
       wayside, jeopardizing the 20 million newly insured Americans.
       At the time of this writing, the final impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is not clear. Millions of
       previously uninsured Americans now have coverage, but the increased taxes to pay for ACA and increased deficit
       spending have created significant political opposition. Whether or not that opposition eventually succeeds in
       overturning the ACA remains to be seen.

Key Concepts and Summary

16.1 The Problem of Imperfect Information and Asymmetric Information

Many make economic transactions in a situation of imperfect information, where either the buyer, the seller, or
both are less than 100% certain about the qualities of what they are buying or selling. When information about
the quality of products is highly imperfect, it may be difficult for a market to exist.

A "lemon" is a product that turns out, after the purchase, to have low quality. When the seller has more
accurate information about the product's quality than the buyer, the buyer will be hesitant to buy, out of fear of
purchasing a "lemon."

Markets have many ways to deal with imperfect information. In goods markets, buyers facing imperfect
information about products may depend upon money-back guarantees, warranties, service contracts, and
reputation. In labor markets, employers facing imperfect information about potential employees may turn to
resumes, recommendations, occupational licenses for certain jobs, and employment for trial periods. In
capital markets, lenders facing imperfect information about borrowers may require detailed loan applications
and credit checks, cosigners, and collateral.

16.2 Insurance and Imperfect Information

Insurance is a way of sharing risk. People in a group pay premiums for insurance against some unpleasant
event, and those in the group who actually experience the unpleasant event then receive some compensation.
The fundamental law of insurance is that what the average person pays in over time cannot be less than what
the average person gets out. In an actuarially fair insurance policy, the premiums that a person pays to the
insurance company are the same as the average amount of benefits for a person in that risk group. Moral
hazard arises in insurance markets because those who are insured against a risk will have less reason to take
steps to avoid the costs from that risk.

Many insurance policies have deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance. A deductible is the maximum amount
that the policyholder must pay out-of-pocket before the insurance company pays the rest of the bill. A
copayment is a flat fee that an insurance policy-holder must pay before receiving services. Coinsurance
requires the policyholder to pay a certain percentage of costs. Deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance
reduce moral hazard by requiring the insured party to bear some of the costs before collecting insurance
benefits.

In a fee-for-service health financing system, medical care providers receive reimbursement according to the
cost of services they provide. An alternative method of organizing health care is through health maintenance
organizations (HMOs), where medical care providers receive reimbursement according to the number of
patients they handle, and it is up to the providers to allocate resources between patients who receive more or
fewer health care services. Adverse selection arises in insurance markets when insurance buyers know more
about the risks they face than does the insurance company. As a result, the insurance company runs the risk
that low-risk parties will avoid its insurance because it is too costly for them, while high-risk parties will
embrace it because it looks like a good deal to them.

Introduction to Financial Markets

         BRING IT HOME

The Housing Bubble and the 2007 Financial Crisis

In 2006, housing equity in the United States peaked at $13 trillion. That means that the market prices of homes,
less what was still owed on the loans they used to buy these houses, equaled $13 trillion. This was a very good
number, since the equity represented the value of the financial asset most U.S. citizens owned.
However, by 2008 this number declined to $8.8 trillion, and it plummeted further still in 2009. Combined with the
decline in value of other financial assets held by U.S. citizens, by 2010, U.S. homeowners' wealth had shrunk $14
trillion! This is a staggering result, and it affected millions of lives: people had to alter their retirement, housing, and
other important consumption decisions. Just about every other large economy in the world suffered a decline in the
market value of financial assets, as a result of the 2008-2009 global financial crisis.
This chapter will explain why people purchase houses (other than as a place to live), why they buy other types of
410 17 · Financial Markets

       financial assets, and why businesses sell those financial assets in the first place. The chapter will also give us insight
       into why financial markets and assets go through boom and bust cycles like the one we described here.

       When a firm needs to buy new equipment or build a new facility, it often must go to the financial market to
       raise funds. Usually firms will add capacity during an economic expansion when profits are on the rise and
       consumer demand is high. Business investment is one of the critical ingredients needed to sustain economic
       growth. Even in the sluggish 2009 economy, U.S. firms invested $1.4 trillion in new equipment and structures,
       in the hope that these investments would generate profits in the years ahead.
       Between the end of the recession in 2009 through the second quarter 2013, profits for the S&P 500 companies
       grew by 9.7% despite the weak economy, with cost cutting and reductions in input costs driving much of that
       amount, according to the Wall Street Journal. Figure 17.2 shows corporate profits after taxes (adjusted for
       inventory and capital consumption). Despite the steep decline in quarterly net profit in 2008, profits have
       recovered and surpassed pre-recession levels.

       FIGURE 17.2 Corporate Profits After Tax (Adjusted for Inventory and Capital Consumption) Prior to 2008, corporate
       profits after tax more often than not increased each year. There was a significant drop in profits during 2008 and into
       2009. The profit trend has since continued to increase each year, though at a less steady or consistent rate. (Source:
       Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/CPATAX)
       Many firms, from huge companies like General Motors to startup firms writing computer software, do not have
       the financial resources within the firm to make all the desired investments. These firms need financial capital
       from outside investors, and they are willing to pay interest for the opportunity to obtain a rate of return on the
       investment of that financial capital.
       On the other side of the financial capital market, financial capital suppliers, like households, wish to use their
       savings in a way that will provide a return. Individuals cannot, however, take the few thousand dollars that they
       save in any given year, write a letter to General Motors or some other firm, and negotiate to invest their money
       with that firm. Financial capital markets bridge this gap: that is, they find ways to take the inflow of funds from
       many separate financial capital suppliers and transform it into the funds of financial capital demanders desire.
       Such financial markets include stocks, bonds, bank loans, and other financial investments.

Our perspective then shifts to consider how these financial investments appear to capital suppliers such as the
households that are saving funds. Households have a range of investment options: bank accounts, certificates
of deposit, money market mutual funds, bonds, stocks, stock and bond mutual funds, housing, and even
tangible assets like gold. Finally, the chapter investigates two methods for becoming rich: a quick and easy
method that does not work very well at all, and a slow, reliable method that can work very well over a lifetime.

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Describe financial capital and how it relates to profits
  · Discuss the purpose and process of borrowing, bonds, and corporate stock
  · Explain how firms choose between sources of financial capital

Firms often make decisions that involve spending money in the present and expecting to earn profits in the
future. Examples include when a firm buys a machine that will last 10 years, or builds a new plant that will last
for 30 years, or starts a research and development project. Firms can raise the financial capital they need to
pay for such projects in four main ways: (1) from early-stage investors; (2) by reinvesting profits; (3) by
borrowing through banks or bonds; and (4) by selling stock. When business owners choose financial capital
sources, they also choose how to pay for them.

Early-Stage Financial Capital

Firms that are just beginning often have an idea or a prototype for a product or service to sell, but few
customers, or even no customers at all, and thus are not earning profits. Such firms face a difficult problem
when it comes to raising financial capital: How can a firm that has not yet demonstrated any ability to earn
profits pay a rate of return to financial investors?

For many small businesses, the original source of money is the business owner. Someone who decides to start
a restaurant or a gas station, for instance, might cover the startup costs by dipping into their own bank
account, or by borrowing money (perhaps using a home as collateral). Alternatively, many cities have a
network of well-to-do individuals, known as "angel investors," who will put their own money into small new
companies at an early development stage, in exchange for owning some portion of the firm.

Venture capital firms make financial investments in new companies that are still relatively small in size, but
that have potential to grow substantially. These firms gather money from a variety of individual or institutional
investors, including banks, institutions like college endowments, insurance companies that hold financial
reserves, and corporate pension funds. Venture capital firms do more than just supply money to small
startups. They also provide advice on potential products, customers, and key employees. Typically, a venture
capital fund invests in a number of firms, and then investors in that fund receive returns according to how the
fund as a whole performs.

The amount of money invested in venture capital fluctuates substantially from year to year: as one example,
venture capital firms invested more than $48.3 billion in 2014, according to the National Venture Capital
Association. All early-stage investors realize that the majority of small startup businesses will never hit it big;
many of them will go out of business within a few months or years. They also know that getting in on the
ground floor of a few huge successes like a Netflix or an Amazon.com can make up for multiple failures.
Therefore, early-stage investors are willing to take large risks in order to position themselves to gain
substantial returns on their investment.

      Profits as a Source of Financial Capital

       If firms are earning profits (their revenues are greater than costs), they can choose to reinvest some of these
       profits in equipment, structures, and research and development. For many established companies, reinvesting
       their own profits is one primary source of financial capital. Companies and firms just getting started may have
       numerous attractive investment opportunities, but few current profits to invest. Even large firms can
       experience a year or two of earning low profits or even suffering losses, but unless the firm can find a steady
       and reliable financial capital source so that it can continue making real investments in tough times, the firm
       may not survive until better times arrive. Firms often need to find financial capital sources other than profits.

      Borrowing: Banks and Bonds

       When a firm has a record of at least earning significant revenues, and better still of earning profits, the firm
       can make a credible promise to pay interest, and so it becomes possible for the firm to borrow money. Firms
       have two main borrowing methods: banks and bonds.

       A bank loan for a firm works in much the same way as a loan for an individual who is buying a car or a house.
       The firm borrows an amount of money and then promises to repay it, including some rate of interest, over a
       predetermined period of time. If the firm fails to make its loan payments, the bank (or banks) can often take
       the firm to court and require it to sell its buildings or equipment to make the loan payments.

       Another source of financial capital is a bond. A bond is a financial contract: a borrower agrees to repay the
       amount that it borrowed and also an interest rate over a period of time in the future. A corporate bond is
       issued by firms, but bonds are also issued by various levels of government. For example, a municipal bond is
       issued by cities, a state bond by U.S. states, and a Treasury bond by the federal government through the U.S.
       Department of the Treasury. A bond specifies an amount that one will borrow, the interest rate that one will
       pay, and the time until repayment.

       A large company, for example, might issue bonds for $10 million. The firm promises to make interest
       payments at an annual rate of 8%, or $800,000 per year and then, after 10 years, will repay the $10 million it
       originally borrowed. When a firm issues bonds, it may choose to issue many bonds in smaller amounts that
       together reach the total amount it wishes to raise. A firm that seeks to borrow $50 million by issuing bonds,
       might actually issue 10,000 bonds of $5,000 each. In this way, an individual investor could, in effect, loan the
       firm $5,000, or any multiple of that amount. Anyone who owns a bond and receives the interest payments is
       called a bondholder. If a firm issues bonds and fails to make the promised interest payments, the bondholders
       can take the firm to court and require it to pay, even if the firm needs to raise the money by selling buildings or
       equipment. However, there is no guarantee the firm will have sufficient assets to pay off the bonds. The
       bondholders may recoup only a portion of what they loaned the firm.

       Bank borrowing is more customized than issuing bonds, so it often works better for relatively small firms. The
       bank can get to know the firm extremely well--often because the bank can monitor sales and expenses quite
       accurately by looking at deposits and withdrawals. Relatively large and well-known firms often issue bonds
       instead. They use bonds to raise new financial capital that pays for investments, or to raise capital to pay off
       old bonds, or to buy other firms. However, the idea that firms or individuals use banks for relatively smaller
       loans and bonds for larger loans is not an ironclad rule: sometimes groups of banks make large loans and
       sometimes relatively small and lesser-known firms issue bonds.

      Corporate Stock and Public Firms

       A corporation is a business that "incorporates"--that is owned by shareholders that have limited liability for
       the company's debt but share in its profits (and losses). Corporations may be private or public, and may or may
       not have publicly traded stock. They may raise funds to finance their operations or new investments by raising
       capital through selling stock or issuing bonds.

       Those who buy the stock become the firm's owners, or shareholders. Stock represents firm ownership; that is,

a person who owns 100% of a company's stock, by definition, owns the entire company. The company's stock
is divided into shares. Corporate giants like IBM, AT&T, Ford, General Electric, Microsoft, Merck, and Exxon all
have millions of stock shares. In most large and well-known firms, no individual owns a majority of the stock
shares. Instead, large numbers of shareholders--even those who hold thousands of shares--each have only a
small slice of the firm's overall ownership.

When a large number of shareholders own a company, there are three questions to ask:

1. How and when does the company obtain money from its sale of stock?
2. What rate of return does the company promise to pay when it sells stock?
3. Who makes decisions in a company owned by a large number of shareholders?

First, a firm receives money from the stock sale only when the company sells its own stock to the public (the
public includes individuals, mutual funds, insurance companies, and pension funds). We call a firm's first
stock sale to the public an initial public offering (IPO). The IPO is important for two reasons. For one, the IPO,
and any stock issued thereafter, such as stock held as treasury stock (shares that a company keeps in their own
treasury) or new stock issued later as a secondary offering, provides the funds to repay the early-stage
investors, like the angel investors and the venture capital firms. A venture capital firm may have a 40%
ownership in the firm. When the firm sells stock, the venture capital firm sells its part ownership of the firm to
the public. A second reason for the importance of the IPO is that it provides the established company with
financial capital for substantially expanding its operations.

However, most of the time when one buys and sells corporate stock the firm receives no financial return at all.
If you buy General Motors stock, you almost certainly buy it from the current share owner, and General Motors
does not receive any of your money. This pattern should not seem particularly odd. After all, if you buy a house,
the current owner receives your money, not the original house builder. Similarly, when you buy stock shares,
you are buying a small slice of the firm's ownership from the existing owner--and the firm that originally
issued the stock is not a part of this transaction.

Second, when a firm decides to issue stock, it must recognize that investors will expect to receive a rate of
return. That rate of return can come in two forms. A firm can make a direct payment to its shareholders, called
a dividend. Alternatively, a financial investor might buy a share of stock in Wal-Mart for $45 and then later sell
it to someone else for $60, for $15 gain. We call the increase in the stock value (or of any asset) between when
one buys and sells it a capital gain.

Third: Who makes the decisions about when a firm will issue stock, or pay dividends, or re-invest profits? To
understand the answers to these questions, it is useful to separate firms into two groups: private and public.

A private company is frequently owned by the people who generally run it on a day-to-day basis. Individuals
can run a private company. We call this a sole proprietorship. If a group runs it, we call it a partnership. A
private company can also be a corporation, but with no publicly issued stock. A small law firm run by one
person, even if it employs some other lawyers, would be a sole proprietorship. Partners may jointly own a
larger law firm. Most private companies are relatively small, but there are some large private corporations,
with tens of billions of dollars in annual sales, that do not have publicly issued stock, such as farm products
dealer Cargill, the Mars candy company, and the Bechtel engineering and construction firm.

When a firm decides to sell stock, which financial investors can buy and sell, we call it a public company.
Shareholders own a public company. Since the shareholders are a very broad group, often consisting of
thousands or even millions of investors, the shareholders vote for a board of directors, who in turn hire top
executives to run the firm on a day-to-day basis. The more stock a shareholder owns, the more votes that
shareholder is entitled to cast for the company's board of directors.

In theory, the board of directors helps to ensure that the firm runs in the interests of the true owners--the
shareholders. However, the top executives who run the firm have a strong voice in choosing the candidates
414 17 · Financial Markets

       who will serve on their board of directors. After all, few shareholders are knowledgeable enough or have
       enough personal incentive to spend energy and money nominating alternative board members.

      How Firms Choose between Financial Capital Sources

       There are clear patterns in how businesses raise financial capital. We can explain these patterns in terms of
       imperfect information, which as we discussed in Information, Risk, and Insurance, is a situation where buyers
       and sellers in a market do not both have full and equal information. Those who are actually running a firm will
       almost always have more information about whether the firm is likely to earn profits in the future than outside
       investors who provide financial capital.

       Any young startup firm is a risk. Some startup firms are only a little more than an idea on paper. The firm's
       founders inevitably have better information than anyone else about how hard they are willing to work, and
       whether the firm is likely to succeed. When the founders invested their own money into the firm, they
       demonstrate a belief in its prospects. At this early stage, angel investors and venture capitalists try to
       overcome the imperfect information, at least in part, by knowing the managers and their business plan
       personally and by giving them advice.

       Accurate information is sometimes not available because corporate governance, the name economists give to
       the institutions that are supposed to watch over top executives, fails, as the following Clear It Up feature on
       Lehman Brothers shows.

                CLEAR IT UP

      How did lack of corporate governance lead to the Lehman Brothers failure?

       In 2008, Lehman Brothers was the fourth largest U.S. investment bank, with 25,000 employees. The firm had been
       in business for 164 years. On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
       There are many causes of the Lehman Brothers failure. One area of apparent failure was the lack of oversight by the
       Board of Directors to keep managers from undertaking excessive risk. We can attribute part of the oversight failure,
       according to Tim Geithner's April 10, 2010, testimony to Congress, to the Executive Compensation Committee's
       emphasis on short-term gains without enough consideration of the risks. In addition, according to the court
       examiner's report, the Lehman Brother's Board of Directors paid too little attention to the details of the operations
       of Lehman Brothers and also had limited financial service experience.

       The board of directors, elected by the shareholders, is supposed to be the first line of corporate governance and
       oversight for top executives. A second institution of corporate governance is the auditing firm the company hires to
       review the company's financial records and certify that everything looks reasonable. A third institution of corporate
       governance is outside investors, especially large shareholders like those who invest large mutual funds or pension
       funds. In the case of Lehman Brothers, corporate governance failed to provide investors with accurate financial
       information about the firm's operations.

       As a firm becomes at least somewhat established and its strategy appears likely to lead to profits in the near
       future, knowing the individual managers and their business plans on a personal basis becomes less important,
       because information has become more widely available regarding the company's products, revenues, costs,
       and profits. As a result, other outside investors who do not know the managers personally, like bondholders
       and shareholders, are more willing to provide financial capital to the firm.

       At this point, a firm must often choose how to access financial capital. It may choose to borrow from a bank,
       issue bonds, or issue stock. The great disadvantage of borrowing money from a bank or issuing bonds is that
       the firm commits to scheduled interest payments, whether or not it has sufficient income. The great advantage
       of borrowing money is that the firm maintains control of its operations and is not subject to shareholders.
       Issuing stock involves selling off company ownership to the public and becoming responsible to a board of

directors and the shareholders.

The benefit of issuing stock is that a small and growing firm increases its visibility in the financial markets and
can access large amounts of financial capital for expansion, without worrying about repaying this money. If the
firm is successful and profitable, the board of directors will need to decide upon a dividend payout or how to
reinvest profits to further grow the company. Issuing and placing stock is expensive, requires the expertise of
investment bankers and attorneys, and entails compliance with reporting requirements to shareholders and
government agencies, such as the federal Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

17.2 How Households Supply Financial Capital

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Show the relationship between savers, banks, and borrowers
  · Calculate bond yield
  · Contrast bonds, stocks, mutual funds, and assets
  · Explain the tradeoffs between return and risk

The ways in which firms would prefer to raise funds are only half the story of financial markets. The other half
is what those households and individuals who supply funds desire, and how they perceive the available
choices. The focus of our discussion now shifts from firms on the demand side of financial capital markets to
households on the supply side of those markets. We can divide the mechanisms for savings available to
households into several categories: deposits in bank accounts; bonds; stocks; money market mutual funds;
stock and bond mutual funds; and housing and other tangible assets like owning gold. We need to analyze each
of these investments in terms of three factors: (1) the expected rate of return it will pay; (2) the risk that the
return will be much lower or higher than expected; and (3) the investment's liquidity, which refers to how
easily one can exchange money or financial assets for a good or service. We will do this analysis as we discuss
each of these investments in the sections below. First, however, we need to understand the difference between
expected rate of return, risk, and actual rate of return.

Expected Rate of Return, Risk, and Actual Rate of Return

The expected rate of return refers to how much a project or an investment is expected to return to the
investor, either in future interest payments, capital gains, or increased profitability. It is usually the average
return over a period of time, usually in years or even decades. We normally measure it as a percentage rate.
Risk measures the uncertainty of that project's profitability. There are several types of risk, including default
risk and interest rate risk. Default risk, as its name suggests, is the risk that the borrower fails to pay back the
bond or loan. Interest rate risk is the danger that you might buy a long term bond at a 6% interest rate right
before market rates suddenly rise, so had you waited, you could have received a similar bond that paid 9%. A
high-risk investment is one for which a wide range of potential payoffs is reasonably probable. A low-risk
investment may have actual returns that are fairly close to its expected rate of return year after year. A high-
risk investment will have actual returns that are much higher than the expected rate of return in some months
or years and much lower in other months or years. The actual rate of return refers to the total rate of return,
including capital gains and interest paid on an investment at the end of a time period.

Bank Accounts

An intermediary is one who stands between two other parties. For example, a person who arranges a blind
date between two other people is one kind of intermediary. In financial capital markets, banks are an example
of a financial intermediary--that is, an institution that operates between a saver who deposits funds in a bank
and a borrower who receives a loan from that bank. When a bank serves as a financial intermediary, unlike the
situation with a couple on a blind date, the saver and the borrower never meet. In fact, it is not even possible to
make direct connections between those who deposit funds in banks and those who borrow from banks,
because all deposited funds end up in one big pool, which the financial institution then lends out.
416 17 · Financial Markets

       Figure 17.3 illustrates the position of banks as a financial intermediary, with a pattern of deposits flowing into
       a bank and loans flowing out, and then repayment of the loans flowing back to the bank, with interest
       payments for the original savers.

       FIGURE 17.3 Banks as Financial Intermediaries Banks are a financial intermediary because they stand between
       savers and borrowers. Savers place deposits with banks, and then receive interest payments and withdraw money.
       Borrowers receive loans from banks, and repay the loans with interest.
       Banks offer a range of accounts to serve different needs. A checking account typically pays little or no interest,
       but it facilitates transactions by giving you easy access to your money, either by writing a check or by using a
       debit card (that is, a card which works like a credit card, except that purchases are immediately deducted from
       your checking account rather than billed separately through a credit card company). A savings account
       typically pays some interest rate, but getting the money typically requires you to make a trip to the bank or an
       automatic teller machine (or you can access the funds electronically). The lines between checking and savings
       accounts have blurred in the last couple of decades, as many banks offer checking accounts that will pay an
       interest rate similar to a savings account if you keep a certain minimum amount in the account, or conversely,
       offer savings accounts that allow you to write at least a few checks per month.
       Another way to deposit savings at a bank is to use a certificate of deposit (CD). With a CD, you agree to deposit
       a certain amount of money, often measured in thousands of dollars, in the account for a stated period of time,
       typically ranging from a few months to several years. In exchange, the bank agrees to pay a higher interest rate
       than for a regular savings account. While you can withdraw the money before the allotted time, as the
       advertisements for CDs always warn, there is "a substantial penalty for early withdrawal."
       Figure 17.4 shows the annual rate of interest paid on a six-month, one-year, and five-year CD since 1984, as
       reported by Bankrate.com. The interest rates that savings accounts pay are typically a little lower than the CD
       rate, because financial investors need to receive a slightly higher rate of interest as compensation for
       promising to leave deposits untouched for a period of time in a CD, and thus forfeiting some liquidity.

FIGURE 17.4 Interest Rates on Six-Month, One-Year, and Five-Year Certificates of Deposit The interest rates on
certificates of deposit have fluctuated over time. The high interest rates of the early 1980s are indicative of the
relatively high inflation rate in the United States at that time. Interest rates fluctuate with the business cycle,
typically increasing during expansions and decreasing during a recession. Note the steep decline in CD rates since
2008, the beginning of the Great Recession.
The great advantages of bank accounts are that financial investors have very easy access to their money, and
also money in bank accounts is extremely safe. In part, this safety arises because a bank account offers more
security than keeping a few thousand dollars in the toe of a sock in your underwear drawer. In addition, the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) protects the savings of the average person. Every bank is
required by law to pay a fee to the FDIC, based on the size of its deposits. Then, if a bank should go bankrupt
and not be able to repay depositors, the FDIC guarantees that all customers will receive their deposits back up
to $250,000.
The bottom line on bank accounts looks like this: low risk means low rate of return but high liquidity.

Bonds

An investor who buys a bond expects to receive a rate of return. However, bonds vary in the rates of return that
they offer, according to the riskiness of the borrower. We always can divide an interest rate into three
components (as we explained in Choice in a World of Scarcity): compensation for delaying consumption, an
adjustment for an inflationary rise in the overall level of prices, and a risk premium that takes the borrower's
riskiness into account.
The U.S. government is an extremely safe borrower, so when the U.S. government issues Treasury bonds, it can
pay a relatively low interest rate. Firms that appear to be safe borrowers, perhaps because of their sheer size or
because they have consistently earned profits over time, will pay a higher interest rate than the U.S.
government. Firms that appear to be riskier borrowers, perhaps because they are still growing or their
businesses appear shaky, will pay the highest interest rates when they issue bonds. We call bonds that offer
high interest rates to compensate for their relatively high chance of default high-yield bonds or junk bonds. A
number of today's well-known firms issued junk bonds in the 1980s when they were starting to grow, including
Turner Broadcasting and Microsoft.

A bond issued by the U.S. government or a large corporation may seem to be relatively low risk: after all, the
418 17 · Financial Markets

       bond issuer has promised to make certain payments over time, and except for rare bankruptcy cases, these
       payments will occur. If a corporate bond issuer fails to make the payments that it owes to its bondholders, the
       bondholders can require that the company declare bankruptcy, sell off its assets, and pay them as much as it
       can. Even in the case of junk bonds, a wise investor can reduce the risk by purchasing bonds from a wide range
       of different companies since, even if a few firms go broke and do not pay, they are not all likely to go bankrupt.

       As we noted before, bonds carry an interest rate risk. For example, imagine you decide to buy a 10-year bond
       for $1,000 that would pay an annual interest rate of 8%. Soon after you buy the bond, interest rates on bonds
       rise, so that now similar companies are paying an annual rate of 12%. Anyone who buys a $1,000 bond now
       can receive annual payments of $120 per year, but since your bond was issued at an interest rate of 8%, you
       have tied up $1,000 and receive payments of only $80 per year. In the meaningful sense of opportunity cost,
       you are missing out on the higher payments that you could have received. Furthermore, you can calculate the
       amount you should be willing to pay now for future payments. To place a present discounted value on a future
       payment, decide what you would need in the present to equal a certain amount in the future. This calculation
       will require an interest rate. For example, if the interest rate is 25%, then a payment of $125 a year from now
       will have a present discounted value of $100--that is, you could take $100 in the present and have $125 in the
       future. (We discuss this further in the appendix on Present Discounted Value.)

       In financial terms, a bond has several parts. A bond is basically an "I owe you" note that an investor receives in
       exchange for capital (money). The bond has a face value. This is the amount the borrower agrees to pay the
       investor at maturity. The bond has a coupon rate or interest rate, which is usually semi-annual, but can be
       paid at different times throughout the year. (Bonds used to be paper documents with coupons that investors
       clipped and turned in to the bank to receive interest.) The bond has a maturity date when the borrower will
       pay back its face value as well as its last interest payment. Combining the bond's face value, interest rate, and
       maturity date, and market interest rates, allows a buyer to compute a bond's present value, which is the most
       that a buyer would be willing to pay for a given bond. This may or may not be the same as the face value.

       The bond yield measures the rate of return a bond is expected to pay over time. Investors can buy bonds when
       they are issued and they can buy and sell them during their lifetimes. When buying a bond that has been
       around for a few years, investors should know that the interest rate printed on a bond is often not the same as
       the bond yield, even on new bonds. Read the next Work It Out feature to see how this happens.

                                                                                                                WORK IT OUT

        Calculating the Bond Yield

         You have bought a $1,000 bond whose coupon rate is 8%. To calculate your return or yield, follow these steps:

          1. Assume the following:
               Face value of a bond: $1,000
               Coupon rate: 8 %
               Annual payment: $80 per year

          2. Consider the risk of the bond. If this bond carries no risk, then it would be safe to assume that the bond will
               sell for $1,000 when it is issued and pay the purchaser $80 per year until its maturity, at which time the final
               interest payment will be made and the original $1,000 will be repaid. Now, assume that over time the
               interest rates prevailing in the economy rise to 12% and that there is now only one year left to this bond's
               maturity. This makes the bond an unattractive investment, since an investor can find another bond that
               perhaps pays 12%. To induce the investor to buy the 8% bond, the bond seller will lower its price below its
               face value of $1,000.

          3. Calculate the bond's price when its interest rate is less than the market interest rate. The expected
               payments from the bond one year from now are $1,080, because in the bond's last year the bond's issuer
               will make the final interest payment and then also repay the original $1,000. Given that interest rates are

        now 12%, you know that you could invest $964 in an alternative investment and receive $1,080 a year from
        now; that is, $964(1 + 0.12) = $1080. Therefore, you will not pay more than $964 for the original $1,000
        bond.
  4. Consider that the investor will receive the $1,000 face value, plus $80 for the last year's interest payment.
        The yield on the bond will be ($1080 - $964)/$964 = 12%. The yield, or total return, means interest
        payments, plus capital gains. Note that the interest or coupon rate of 8% did not change. When interest rates
        rise, bonds previously issued at lower interest rates will sell for less than face value. Conversely, when
        interest rates fall, bonds previously issued at higher interest rates will sell for more than face value.

Figure 17.5 shows bond yield for two kinds of bonds: 10-year Treasury bonds (which are officially called
"notes") and corporate bonds issued by firms that have been given an AAA rating as relatively safe borrowers
by Moody's, an independent firm that publishes such ratings. Even though corporate bonds pay a higher
interest rate, because firms are riskier borrowers than the federal government, the rates tend to rise and fall
together. Treasury bonds typically pay more than bank accounts, and corporate bonds typically pay a higher
interest rate than Treasury bonds.

FIGURE 17.5 Interest Rates for Corporate Bonds and Ten-Year U.S. Treasury Bonds The interest rates for corporate
bonds and U.S. Treasury bonds (officially "notes") rise and fall together, depending on conditions for borrowers and
lenders in financial markets for borrowing. The corporate bonds always pay a higher interest rate, to make up for the
higher risk they have of defaulting compared with the U.S. government.
The bottom line for bonds: rate of return--low to moderate, depending on the borrower's risk; risk--low to
moderate, depending on whether interest rates in the economy change substantially after the bond is issued;
liquidity--moderate, because the investor needs to sell the bond before the investor regains the cash.

Stocks

As we stated earlier, the rate of return on a financial investment in a share of stock can come in two forms: as
dividends paid by the firm and as a capital gain achieved by selling the stock for more than you paid. The range
of possible returns from buying stock is mind-bending. Firms can decide to pay dividends or not. A stock price
can rise to a multiple of its original price or sink all the way to zero. Even in short periods of time, well-
established companies can see large movements in their stock prices. For example, on July 1, 2011, Netflix
stock peaked at $295 per share; one year later, on July 30, 2012, it was at $53.91 per share; in 2022, it had
recovered to $199. When Facebook went public, its shares of stock sold for around $40 per share, but in 2022,
they were selling for slightly over $212.
We will discuss the reasons why stock prices fall and rise so abruptly below, but first you need to know how we
measure stock market performance. There are a number of different ways to measure the overall performance
420 17 · Financial Markets

of the stock market, based on averaging different subsets of companies' stock prices. Perhaps the best-known
stock market measure is the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is based on 30 large U.S. companies' stock
prices. Another stock market performance gauge, the Standard & Poor's 500, follows the stock prices of the 500
largest U.S. companies. The Wilshire 5000 tracks the stock prices of essentially all U.S. companies that have
stock the public can buy and sell.

Other stock market measures focus on where stocks are traded. For example, the New York Stock Exchange
monitors the performance of stocks that are traded on that exchange in New York City. The Nasdaq stock
market includes about 3,600 stocks, with a concentration of technology stocks. Table 17.1 lists some of the
most commonly cited measures of U.S. and international stock markets.

TABLE 17.1 Some Stock Market Measures

The trend in the stock market is generally up over time, but with some large dips along the way. Figure 17.6
shows the path of the Standard & Poor's 500 index (which is measured on the left-hand vertical axis) and the
Dow Jones Index (which is measured on the right-hand vertical axis). Broad stock market measures, like the
ones we list here, tend to move together. The S&P 500 Index is the weighted average market capitalization of
the firms selected to be in the index. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is the price weighted average of 30
industrial stocks tracked on the New York Stock Exchange.

When the Dow Jones average rises from 5,000 to 10,000, you know that the average price of the stocks in that
index has roughly doubled. Figure 17.6 shows that stock prices did not rise much in the 1970s, but then
started a steady climb in the 1980s. From 2000 to 2013, stock prices bounced up and down, but ended up at

about the same level.

FIGURE 17.6 The Dow Jones Industrial Index and the Standard & Poor's 500, 1965-2021 Stock prices rose
dramatically from the 1980s up to about 2000. From 2000 to 2013, stock prices bounced up and down, but ended
up at about the same level. Since 2009, both indexes have for the most part increased.

Table 17.2 shows the total annual rate of return an investor would have received from buying the stocks in the
S&P 500 index over recent decades. The total return here includes both dividends paid by these companies
and also capital gains arising from increases in the stock value. (For technical reasons related to how we
calculate the numbers, the dividends and capital gains do not add exactly to the total return.) From the 1950s
to the 1980s, the average firm paid annual dividends equal to about 4% of its stock value. Since the 1990s,
dividends have dropped and now often provide a return closer to 1% to 2%. In the 1960s and 1970s, the gap
between percent earned on capital gains and dividends was much closer than it has been since the 1980s. In
the 1980s and 1990s, capital gains were far higher than dividends. In the 2000s, dividends remained low and,
while stock prices fluctuated, they ended the decade roughly where they had started. In the 2010s, dividends
remained low and stock prices increased, and this continued at the beginning of the 2020s.

The overall pattern is that stocks as a group have provided a high rate of return over extended periods of time,
but this return comes with risks. The market value of individual companies can rise and fall substantially, both
over short time periods and over the long run. During extended periods of time like the 1970s or the first
decade of the 2000s, the overall stock market return can be quite modest. The stock market can sometimes fall
sharply, as it did in 2008.

The bottom line on investing in stocks is that the rate of return over time will be high, but the risks are also
high, especially in the short run. Liquidity is also high since one can sell stock in publicly held companies
readily for spendable money.

Mutual Funds

Buying stocks or bonds issued by a single company is always somewhat risky. An individual firm may find
itself buffeted by unfavorable supply and demand conditions or hurt by unlucky or unwise managerial
decisions. Thus, a standard recommendation from financial investors is diversification, which means buying
stocks or bonds from a wide range of companies. A saver who diversifies is following the old proverb: "Don't
put all your eggs in one basket." In any broad group of companies, some firms will do better than expected and
some will do worse--but the diversification has a tendency to cancel out extreme increases and decreases in
value.

Purchasing a diversified group of stocks or bonds has become easier in the internet age, but it remains
something of a task. To simplify the process, companies offer mutual funds, which consist of a variety of
stocks or bonds from different companies. The financial investor buys mutual fund shares, and then receives a
return based on how the fund as a whole performs. In 2021, according to the Investment Company Factbook,
just over 47% of U.S. households had a financial investment in a mutual fund--including many people who
have their retirement savings or pension money invested in this way.

Mutual funds can focus in certain areas: one mutual fund might invest only in company stocks based in
Indonesia, or only in bonds issued by large manufacturing companies, or only in biotechnology companies'
stock. At the other end of the spectrum, a mutual fund might be quite broad. At the extreme, some mutual
funds own a tiny share of every firm in the stock market, and thus the mutual fund's value will fluctuate with
the overall stock market's average. We call a mutual fund that seeks only to mimic the market's overall
performance an index fund.

Diversification can offset some of the risks of individual stocks rising or falling. Even investors who buy an
indexed mutual fund designed to mimic some measure of the broad stock market, like the Standard & Poor's
500, had better prepare against some ups and downs, like those the stock market experienced in the first
decade of the 2000s. In 2008 average U.S. stock funds declined 38%, reducing individual and household
wealth. This steep drop in value hit hardest those who were close to retirement and were counting on their
stock funds to supplement retirement income.

The bottom line on investing in mutual funds is that the rate of return over time will be high. The risks are also
high, but the risks and returns for an individual mutual fund will be lower than those for an individual stock.
As with stocks, liquidity is also high provided the mutual fund or stock index fund is readily traded.

Housing and Other Tangible Assets

Households can also seek a rate of return by purchasing tangible assets, especially housing. About two-thirds
of U.S. households own their own home. An owner's equity in a house is the monetary value the owner would
have after selling the house and repaying any outstanding bank loans they used to buy the house. For example,
imagine that you buy a house for $200,000, paying 10% of the price as a down payment and taking out a bank
loan for the remaining $180,000. Over time, you pay off some of your bank loan, so that only $100,000
remains, and the house's value on the market rises to $250,000. At that point, your equity in the home is the
value of the home minus the value of the loan outstanding, which is $150,000. For many middle-class
Americans, home equity is their single greatest financial asset. The total value of all home equity held by U.S.
households was $23.6 trillion as of the middle of 2021, according to Federal Reserve data.

Investment in a house is tangibly different from bank accounts, stocks, and bonds because a house offers both
a financial and a nonfinancial return. If you buy a house to live in, part of the return on your investment occurs
from your consumption of "housing services"--that is, having a place to live. (Of course, if you buy a home and
rent it out, you receive rental payments for the housing services you provide, which would offer a financial
return.) Buying a house to live in also offers the possibility of a capital gain from selling the house in the future
for more than you paid for it. There can, however, be different outcomes, as the Clear It Up on the housing
market shows.

Housing prices have usually risen steadily over time. For example, the median sales price for an existing one-
family home was $122,900 in 1990, but 232,000 at the end of December 2016, according to FRED® Economic
Data. Over these 24 years, home prices increased an average of 3.1% per year, which is an average financial
return over this time. Figure 17.7 shows U.S. Census data for the average sales price of a new home in the
United States from 1965 to 2021.

However, the possible capital gains from rising housing prices are riskier than these national price averages.
Certain regions of the country or metropolitan areas have seen drops in housing prices over time. The median
housing price for the United States as a whole fell almost 7% in 2008 and again in 2009, dropping the median
price from $247,900 to $216,700. As of 2016, home values had recovered and even exceeded their pre-
recession levels, and they have continued to increase into the early 2020s.

       FIGURE 17.7 The Median Average Sales Price for New Single-Family Homes, 1990-2015 The median price is the
       price where half of sales prices are higher and half are lower. The median sales price for a new one-family home was
       $122,900 in 1990. It rose as high as $248,000 in 2007, before falling to $232,000 in 2008. In 2015, the median
       sales price was $294,000. Of course, this national figure conceals many local differences, like the areas where
       housing prices are higher or lower, or how housing prices have risen or fallen at certain times. (Source: U.S. Census)
       Investors can also put money into other tangible assets such as gold, silver, and other precious metals, or in
       duller commodities like sugar, cocoa, coffee, orange juice, oil, and natural gas. The return on these investments
       derives from the saver's hope of buying low, selling high, and receiving a capital gain. Investing in, say, gold or
       coffee offers relatively little in the way of nonfinancial benefits to the user (unless the investor likes to caress
       gold or gaze upon a warehouse full of coffee). Typically, investors in these commodities never even see the
       physical good. Instead, they sign a contract that takes ownership of a certain quantity of these commodities,
       which are stored in a warehouse, and later they sell the ownership to someone else. As one example, from 1981
       to 2005, the gold prices generally fluctuated between about $300 and $500 per ounce, but then rose sharply to
       over $1,100 per ounce by early 2010. In January 2017, prices were hovering around $1,191 per ounce, and
       they have since increased, reaching over $1,900 by early 2022.
       A final area of tangible assets consists of "collectibles" like paintings, fine wine, jewelry, antiques, or even
       baseball cards. Most collectibles provide returns both in the form of services or of a potentially higher selling
       price in the future. You can use paintings by hanging them on the wall; jewelry by wearing it; baseball cards by
       displaying them. You can also hope to sell them someday for more than you paid for them. However, the
       evidence on prices of collectibles, while scanty, is that while they may go through periods where prices
       skyrocket for a time, you should not expect to make a higher-than-average rate of return over a sustained
       period of time from investing in this way.
       The bottom line on investing in tangible assets: rate of return--moderate, especially if you can receive
       nonfinancial benefits from, for example, living in the house; risk--moderate for housing or high if you buy gold
       or baseball cards; liquidity--low, because it often takes considerable time and energy to sell a house or a piece
       of fine art and turn your capital gain into cash. The next Clear It Up feature explains the issues in the recent
       U.S. housing market crisis.

      What was all the commotion in the recent U.S. housing market?

       The cumulative average annual growth rate in housing prices from 1981 to 2000 was 5.1%. The price of an average
       U.S. home then took off from 2003 to 2005, rising more than 10% per year. No serious analyst believed this rate of
       growth was sustainable; after all, if housing prices grew at, say, 11% per year over time, the average price of a home

would more than double every seven years. However, at the time many serious analysts saw no reason for deep
concern. After all, housing prices often change in fits and starts, like all prices, and a price surge for a few years is
often followed by prices that are flat or even declining a bit as local markets adjust.

The sharp rise in housing prices was driven by a high level of demand for housing. Interest rates were low, so
financial institutions encouraged people to borrow money to buy a house. Banks became much more flexible in their
lending, making what were called "subprime" loans. Banks loaned money with low, or sometimes no down
payment. They offered loans with very low payments for the first two years, but then much higher payments after
that. The idea was that housing prices would keep rising, so the borrower would just refinance the mortgage two
years in the future, and thus would not ever have to make the higher payments. Some banks even offered so-called
NINJA loans, which meant a financial institution issued a loan even though the borrower had no income, no job, nor
assets.

In retrospect, these loans seem outlandish. Many borrowers figured, however, that as long as housing prices kept
rising, it made sense to buy. Many lenders used a process called "securitizing," in which they sold their mortgages to
financial companies, which put all the mortgages into a big pool, creating large financial securities, and then re-sold
these mortgage-backed securities to investors. In this way, the lenders off-loaded the mortgage risks to investors.
Investors were interested in mortgage-backed securities as they appeared to offer a steady stream of income,
provided the borrowers repaid them. Investors relied on the ratings agencies to assess the credit risk associated
with the mortgage-backed securities. In hindsight, it appears that the credit agencies were far too lenient in their
ratings of many of the securitized loans. Bank and financial regulators watched the steady rise in the market for
mortgage-backed securities, but saw no reason at the time to intervene.

When housing prices turned down, many households that had borrowed when prices were high found that what they
owed the bank was more than what their home was worth. Many banks believed that they had diversified by selling
their individual loans and instead buying securities based on mortgage loans from all over the country. After all,
banks thought back in 2005, the average house price had not declined at any time since the Great Depression in the
1930s. These securities based on mortgage loans, however, turned out to be far riskier than expected. The bust in
housing prices weakened both bank and household finances, and thus helped bring on the 2008-2009 Great
Recession.

The Tradeoffs between Return and Risk

The discussion of financial investments has emphasized the expected rate of return, the risk, and the liquidity
of each investment. Table 17.3 summarizes these characteristics.

TABLE 17.3 Key Characteristics of Financial Investments

The household investment choices listed here display a tradeoff between the expected return and the degree of
risk involved. Bank accounts have very low risk and very low returns; bonds have higher risk but higher
returns; and stocks are riskiest of all but have the potential for still higher returns. In effect, the higher average
return compensates for the higher degree of risk. If risky assets like stocks did not also offer a higher average
return, then few investors would want them.

This tradeoff between return and risk complicates the task of any financial investor: Is it better to invest safely
or to take a risk and go for the high return? Ultimately, choices about risk and return will be based on personal
preferences. However, it is often useful to examine risk and return in the context of different time frames.

The high returns of stock market investments refer to a high average return that we can expect over a period of
several years or decades. The high risk of such investments refers to the fact that in shorter time frames, from
months to a few years, the rate of return may fluctuate a great deal. Thus, a person near retirement age, who
already owns a house, may prefer reduced risk and certainty about retirement income. For young workers, just
starting to make a reasonably profitable living, it may make sense to put most of their savings for retirement in
mutual funds. Mutual funds are able to take advantage of their buying and selling size and thereby reduce
transaction costs for investors. Stocks are risky in the short term, to be sure, but when the worker can look
forward to several decades during which stock market ups and downs can even out, stocks will typically pay a
much higher return over that extended period than will bonds or bank accounts. Thus, one must consider
tradeoffs between risk and return in the context of where the investor is in life.

17.3 How to Accumulate Personal Wealth

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Explain the random walk theory
  · Calculate simple and compound interest
  · Evaluate how capital markets transform financial capital

Getting rich may seem straightforward enough. Figure out what companies are going to grow and earn high
profits in the future, or figure out what companies are going to become popular for everyone else to buy. Those
companies are the ones that will pay high dividends or whose stock price will climb in the future. Then, buy
stock in those companies. Presto! Multiply your money!

Why is this path to riches not as easy as it sounds? This module first discusses the problems with picking
stocks, and then discusses a more reliable but undeniably duller method of accumulating personal wealth.

Why It Is Hard to Get Rich Quick: The Random Walk Theory

The chief problem with attempting to buy stock in companies that will have higher prices in the future is that
many other financial investors are trying to do the same thing. Thus, in attempting to get rich in the stock
market, it is no help to identify a company that is going to earn high profits if many other investors have
already reached the same conclusion, because the stock price will already be high, based on the expected high
level of future profits.

The idea that stock prices are based on expectations about the future has a powerful and unexpected

implication. If expectations determine stock price, then shifts in expectations will determine shifts in the stock
price. Thus, what matters for predicting whether the stock price of a company will do well is not whether the
company will actually earn profits in the future. Instead, you must find a company that analysts widely believe
at present to have poor prospects, but that will actually turn out to be a shining star. Brigades of stock market
analysts and individual investors are carrying out such research 24 hours a day.

The fundamental problem with predicting future stock winners is that, by definition, no one can predict the
future news that alters expectations about profits. Because stock prices will shift in response to unpredictable
future news, these prices will tend to follow what mathematicians call a "random walk with a trend." The
"random walk" part means that, on any given day, stock prices are just as likely to rise as to fall. "With a trend"
means that over time, the upward steps tend to be larger than the downward steps, so stocks do gradually
climb.

If stocks follow a random walk, then not even financial professionals will be able to choose those that will beat
the average consistently. While some investment advisers are better than average in any given year, and some
even succeed for a number of years in a row, the majority of financial investors do not outguess the market. If
we look back over time, it is typically true that half or two-thirds of the mutual funds that attempted to pick
stocks which would rise more than the market average actually ended up performing worse than the market
average. For the average investor who reads the newspaper business pages over a cup of coffee in the morning,
the odds of doing better than full-time professionals is not very good at all. Trying to pick the stocks that will
gain a great deal in the future is a risky and unlikely way to become rich.

Getting Rich the Slow, Boring Way

Many U.S. citizens can accumulate a large amount of wealth during their lifetimes, if they make two key
choices. The first is to complete additional education and training. In 2020, the Bureau of Labor Statistics
reported median weekly usual earnings for full-time wage and salary workers age 25 and over that
corresponded to annual income of $40,612 for those with a high school diploma, $48,776 for those with a two-
year associate degree, and $67,860 for those with a four-year bachelor's degree. Learning is not only good for
you, but it pays off financially, too.

The second key choice is to start saving money early in life, and to give the power of compound interest a
chance. Imagine that at age 25, you save $3,000 and place that money into an account that you do not touch. In
the long run, it is not unreasonable to assume a 7% real annual rate of return (that is, 7% above the rate of
inflation) on money invested in a well-diversified stock portfolio. After 40 years, using the formula for
compound interest, the original $3,000 investment will have multiplied nearly fifteen fold:

Having $45,000 does not make you a millionaire. Notice, however, that this tidy sum is the result of saving
$3,000 exactly once. Saving that amount every year for several decades--or saving more as income rises--will
multiply the total considerably. This type of wealth will not rival the riches of Microsoft CEO Bill Gates, but
remember that only half of Americans have any money in mutual funds at all. Accumulating hundreds of
thousands of dollars by retirement is a perfectly achievable goal for a well-educated person who starts saving
early in life--and that amount of accumulated wealth will put you at or near the top 10% of all American
households. The following Work It Out feature shows the difference between simple and compound interest,
and the power of compound interest.

                                                                                                          WORK IT OUT

 Simple and Compound Interest

  Simple interest is an interest rate calculation only on the principal amount.
428 17 · Financial Markets

         Step 1. Learn the formula for simple interest:

         Step 2. Practice using the simple interest formula.
         Example 1: $100 Deposit at a simple interest rate of 5% held for one year is:

         Simple interest in this example is $5.
         Example 2: $100 Deposit at a simple interest rate of 5% held for three years is:

         Simple interest in this example is $15.
         Step 3. Calculate the total future amount using this formula:

         Step 4. Put the two simple interest formulas together.

         Step 5. Apply the simple interest formula to our three year example.

         Compound interest is an interest rate calculation on the principal plus the accumulated interest.
         Step 6. To find the compound interest, we determine the difference between the future value and the present
         value of the principal. This is accomplished as follows:

Step 7. Apply this formula to our three-year scenario. Follow the calculations in
Table 17.4

                                                     Year 1

                                                     $100 + ($100 × 0.05)

                    $110.25 + ($110.25 × .05)

Compound interest $115.76 - $100 = $15.76

TABLE 17.4

Step 8. Note that, after three years, the total is $115.76. Therefore the total compound interest is $15.76. This is
$0.76 more than we obtained with simple interest. While this may not seem like much, keep in mind that we
were only working with $100 and over a relatively short time period. Compound interest can make a huge
difference with larger sums of money and over longer periods of time.

Obtaining additional education and saving money early in life obviously will not make you rich overnight.
Additional education typically means deferring earning income and living as a student for more years. Saving
money often requires choices like driving an older or less expensive car, living in a smaller apartment or
buying a smaller house, and making other day-to-day sacrifices. For most people, the tradeoffs for achieving
substantial personal wealth will require effort, patience, and sacrifice.

How Capital Markets Transform Financial Flows

Financial capital markets have the power to repackage money as it moves from those who supply financial
capital to those who demand it. Banks accept checking account deposits and turn them into long-term loans to
companies. Individual firms sell shares of stock and issue bonds to raise capital. Firms make and sell an
astonishing array of goods and services, but an investor can receive a return on the company's decisions by
buying stock in that company. Financial investors sell and resell stocks and bonds to one another. Venture
capitalists and angel investors search for promising small companies. Mutual funds combine the stocks and
bonds--and thus, indirectly, the products and investments--of many different companies.

In this chapter, we discussed the basic mechanisms of financial markets. (A more advanced course in
economics or finance will consider more sophisticated tools.) The fundamentals of those financial capital
markets remain the same: Firms are trying to raise financial capital and households are looking for a desirable
combination of rate of return, risk, and liquidity. Financial markets are society's mechanisms for bringing
together these forces of demand and supply.

                BRING IT HOME
      The Housing Bubble and the Financial Crisis of 2007

       The housing boom and bust in the United States, and the resulting multi-trillion-dollar decline in home equity, began
       with the fall of home prices starting in 2007. As home values dipped, many home prices fell below the amount the
       borrower owed on the mortgage and owners stopped paying and defaulted on their loan. Banks found that their
       assets (loans) became worthless. Many financial institutions around the world had invested in mortgage-backed
       securities, or had purchased insurance on mortgage-backed securities. When housing prices collapsed, the value of
       those financial assets collapsed as well. The asset side of the banks' balance sheets dropped, causing bank failures
       and bank runs. Around the globe, financial institutions were bankrupted or nearly so. The result was a large
       decrease in lending and borrowing, or a freezing up of available credit. When credit dries up, the economy is on its
       knees. The crisis was not limited to the United States. Iceland, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal, and
       Greece all had similar housing boom and bust cycles, and similar credit freezes.
       If businesses cannot access financial capital, they cannot make physical capital investments. Those investments
       ultimately lead to job creation. When credit dried up, businesses invested less, and they ultimately laid off millions
       of workers. This caused incomes to drop, which caused demand to drop. In turn businesses sold less, so they laid
       off more workers. Compounding these events, as economic conditions worsened, financial institutions were even
       less likely to make loans.
       To make matters even worse, as businesses sold less, their expected future profit decreased, and this led to a drop
       in stock prices. Combining all these effects led to major decreases in incomes, demand, consumption, and
       employment, and to the Great Recession, which in the United States officially lasted from December 2007 to June
       2009. During this time, the unemployment rate rose from 5% to a peak of 10.1%. Four years after the recession
       officially ended, unemployment was still stubbornly high, at 7.6%, and 11.8 million people were still unemployed.
       As the world's leading consumer, if the United States goes into recession, it usually drags other countries down with
       it. The Great Recession was no exception. With few exceptions, U.S. trading partners also entered into recessions of
       their own, of varying lengths, or suffered slower economic growth. Like the United States, many European countries
       also gave direct financial assistance, so-called bailouts, to the institutions that make up their financial markets.
       There was good reason to do this. Financial markets bridge the gap between demanders and suppliers of financial
       capital. These institutions and markets need to function in order for an economy to invest in new financial capital.
       However, much of this bailout money was borrowed, and this borrowed money contributed to another crisis in
       Europe. Because of the impact on their budgets of the financial crisis and the resulting bailouts, many countries
       found themselves with unsustainably high deficits. They chose to undertake austerity measures, large decreases in
       government spending and large tax increases, in order to reduce their deficits. Greece, Ireland, Spain, and Portugal
       all had to undertake relatively severe austerity measures. The ramifications of this crisis have spread. Economists
       even called into question the euro's viability.

Key Concepts and Summary

17.1 How Businesses Raise Financial Capital

Companies can raise early-stage financial capital in several ways: from their owners' or managers' personal
savings, or credit cards and from private investors like angel investors and venture capital firms.

A bond is a financial contract through which a borrower agrees to repay the amount that it borrowed. A bond
specifies an amount that one will borrow, the amounts that one will repay over time based on the interest rate
when the bond is issued, and the time until repayment. Corporate bonds are issued by firms; municipal bonds
are issued by cities, state bonds by U.S. states, and Treasury bonds by the federal government through the U.S.
Department of the Treasury.

Stock represents firm ownership. A company's stock is divided into shares. A firm receives financial capital
when it sells stock to the public. We call a company's first stock sale to the public the initial public offering
(IPO). However, a firm does not receive any funds when one shareholder sells stock in the firm to another
investor. One receives the rate of return on stock in two forms: dividends and capital gains.

A private company is usually owned by the people who run it on a day-to-day basis, although hired managers
can run it. We call a private company owned and run by an individual a sole proprietorship, while a firm owned
and run by a group is a partnership. When a firm decides to sell stock that financial investors can buy and sell,
then the firm is owned by its shareholders--who in turn elect a board of directors to hire top day-to-day
management. We call this a public company. Corporate governance is the name economists give to the
institutions that are supposed to watch over top executives, though it does not always work.

17.2 How Households Supply Financial Capital

We can categorize all investments according to three key characteristics: average expected return, degree of
risk, and liquidity. To obtain a higher rate of return, an investor must typically accept either more risk or less
liquidity. Banks are an example of a financial intermediary, an institution that operates to coordinate supply
and demand in the financial capital market. Banks offer a range of accounts, including checking accounts,
savings accounts, and certificates of deposit. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), banks
purchase insurance against the risk of a bank failure.

A typical bond promises the financial investor a series of payments over time, based on the interest rate at the
time the financial institution issues the bond, and when the borrower repays it. Bonds that offer a high rate of
return but also a relatively high chance of defaulting on the payments are called high-yield or junk bonds. The
bond yield is the rate of return that a bond promises to pay at the time of purchase. Even when bonds make
payments based on a fixed interest rate, they are somewhat risky, because if interest rates rise for the economy
as a whole, an investor who owns bonds issued at lower interest rates is now locked into the low rate and
suffers a loss.

Changes in the stock price depend on changes in expectations about future profits. Investing in any individual
firm is somewhat risky, so investors are wise to practice diversification, which means investing in a range of
companies. A mutual fund purchases an array of stocks and/or bonds. An investor in the mutual fund then
receives a return depending on the fund's overall performance as a whole. A mutual fund that seeks to imitate

the overall behavior of the stock market is called an index fund.
We can also regard housing and other tangible assets as forms of financial investment, which pay a rate of
return in the form of capital gains. Housing can also offer a nonfinancial return--specifically, you can live in it.

17.3 How to Accumulate Personal Wealth

It is extremely difficult, even for financial professionals, to predict changes in future expectations and thus to
choose the stocks whose price will rise in the future. Most Americans can accumulate considerable financial
wealth if they follow two rules: complete significant additional education and training after graduating from
high school and start saving money early in life.

Chinese Tire Tariffs

Do you know where the tires on your car are made? If they were imported, they may be subject to a tariff (a tax on
imported goods) that could raise the price of your car. What do you think about that tariff? Would you write to your
representative or your senator about it? Would you start a Facebook or Twitter campaign?
Most people are unlikely to fight this kind of tax or even inform themselves about the issue in the first place. In The
Logic of Collective Action (1965), economist Mancur Olson challenged the popular idea that, in a democracy, the
majority view will prevail, and in doing so launched the modern study of public economy, sometimes referred to as
public choice, a subtopic of microeconomics. In this chapter, we will look at the economics of government policy,
why smaller, more organized groups have an incentive to work hard to enact certain policies, and why lawmakers
438 18 · Public Economy

       ultimately make decisions that may result in bad economic policy.

       As President Abraham Lincoln famously said in his 1863 Gettysburg Address, democratic governments are
       supposed to be "of the people, by the people, and for the people." Can we rely on democratic governments to
       enact sensible economic policies? After all, they react to voters, not to analyses of demand and supply curves.
       The main focus of an economics course is, naturally enough, to analyze the characteristics of markets and
       purely economic institutions. However, political institutions also play a role in allocating society's scarce
       resources, and economists have played an active role, along with other social scientists, in analyzing how such
       political institutions work.

       Other chapters of this book discuss situations in which market forces can sometimes lead to undesirable
       results: monopoly, imperfect competition, and antitrust policy; negative and positive externalities; poverty and
       inequality of incomes; failures to provide insurance; and financial markets that may go from boom to bust.
       Many of these chapters suggest that the government's economic policies could address these issues.

       However, just as markets can face issues and problems that lead to undesirable outcomes, a democratic
       system of government can also make mistakes, either by enacting policies that do not benefit society as a
       whole or by failing to enact policies that would have benefited society as a whole. This chapter discusses some
       practical difficulties of democracy from an economic point of view: we presume the actors in the political
       system follow their own self-interest, which is not necessarily the same as the public good. For example, many
       of those who are eligible to vote do not, which obviously raises questions about whether a democratic system
       will reflect everyone's interests. Benefits or costs of government action are sometimes concentrated on small
       groups, which in some cases may organize and have a disproportionately large impact on politics and in other
       cases may fail to organize and end up neglected. A legislator who worries about support from voters in their
       district may focus on spending projects specific to the district without sufficient concern for whether this
       spending is in the nation's interest.

       When more than two choices exist, the principle that the majority of voters should decide may not always
       make logical sense, because situations can arise where it becomes literally impossible to decide what the
       "majority" prefers. Government may also be slower than private firms to correct its mistakes, because
       government agencies do not face competition or the threat of new entry.

     18.1 Voter Participation and Costs of Elections

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain the significance of rational ignorance
         · Evaluate the impact of election expenses

       In U.S. presidential elections over the last few decades, about 55% to 65% of voting-age citizens actually voted,
       according to the U.S. Census. In congressional elections when there is no presidential race, or in local
       elections, the turnout is typically lower, often less than half the eligible voters. In other countries, the share of
       adults who vote is often higher. For example, in national elections since the 1980s in Germany, Spain, and
       France, about 75% to 80% of those of voting age cast ballots. Even this total falls well short of 100%. Some
       countries have laws that require voting, among them Australia, Belgium, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Singapore, and
       most Latin American nations. At the time the United States was founded, voting was mandatory in Virginia,
       Maryland, Delaware, and Georgia. Even if the law can require people to vote, however, no law can require that
       each voter cast an informed or a thoughtful vote. Moreover, in the United States and in most countries around
       the world, the freedom to vote has also typically meant the freedom not to vote.

       Why do people not vote? Perhaps they do not care too much about who wins, or they are uninformed about who
       is running, or they do not believe their vote will matter or change their lives in any way. These reasons are
       probably tied together, since people who do not believe their vote matters will not bother to become informed

                                                                                                                         18.1 · Voter Participation and Costs of Elections 439

or care who wins. Economists have suggested why a utility-maximizing person might rationally decide not to
vote or not to become informed about the election. While a single vote may decide a few elections in very small
towns, in most elections of any size, the Board of Elections measures the margin of victory in hundreds,
thousands, or even millions of votes. A rational voter will recognize that one vote is extremely unlikely to make
a difference. This theory of rational ignorance holds that people will not vote if the costs of becoming
informed and voting are too high, or they feel their vote will not be decisive in the election.

In a 1957 work, An Economic Theory of Democracy, the economist Anthony Downs stated the problem this
way: "It seems probable that for a great many citizens in a democracy, rational behavior excludes any
investment whatever in political information per se. No matter how significant a difference between parties is
revealed to the rational citizen by his free information, or how uncertain he is about which party to support, he
realizes that his vote has almost no chance of influencing the outcome... He will not even utilize all the free
information available, since assimilating it takes time." In his classic 1948 novel Walden Two, the psychologist
B. F. Skinner puts the issue even more succinctly via one of his characters, who states: "The chance that one
man's vote will decide the issue in a national election...is less than the chance that he will be killed on his way
to the polls." The following Clear It Up feature explores another aspect of the election process: spending.

         CLEAR IT UP

How much is too much to spend on an election?

In the 2020 elections, it is estimated that spending for president, Congress, and state and local offices amounted to
$14.4 billion, more than twice what had been spent in 2016. The money raised went to the campaigns, including
advertising, fundraising, travel, and staff. Many people worry that politicians spend too much time raising money
and end up entangled with special interest groups that make major donations. Critics would prefer a system that
restricts what candidates can spend, perhaps in exchange for limited public campaign financing or free television
advertising time.

How much spending on campaigns is too much? Five billion dollars will buy many potato chips, but in the U.S.
economy, which was nearly $21 trillion in 2020, the $14.4 billion spent on political campaigns was about 1/15th of
1% of the overall economy. Here is another way to think about campaign spending. Total government spending
programs in 2020, including federal and state governments, was about $8.8 trillion, so the cost of choosing the
people who would determine how to spend this money was less than 2/10 of 1% of that. In the context of the
enormous U.S. economy, $14.4 billion is not as much money as it sounds. U.S. consumers spend almost $2 billion
per year on toothpaste and $7 billion on hair care products. In 2020, Proctor and Gamble spent almost $5 billion on
advertising. It may seem peculiar that one company's spending on advertisements amounts to one third of what is
spent on presidential and other elections.

Whatever we believe about whether candidates and their parties spend too much or too little on elections, the U.S.
Supreme Court has placed limits on how government can limit campaign spending. In a 1976 decision, Buckley v.
Valeo, the Supreme Court emphasized that the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution specifies freedom of
speech. The federal government and states can offer candidates a voluntary deal in which government makes some
public financing available to candidates, but only if the candidates agree to abide by certain spending limits. Of
course, candidates can also voluntarily agree to set certain spending limits if they wish. However, government
cannot forbid people or organizations to raise and spend money above these limits if they choose.

In 2002, Congress passed and President George W. Bush signed into law the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act
(BCRA). The relatively noncontroversial portions of the act strengthen the rules requiring full and speedy disclosure
of who contributes money to campaigns. However, some controversial portions of the Act limit the ability of
individuals and groups to make certain kinds of political donations and they ban certain kinds of advertising in the
months leading up to an election. Some called these bans into question after the release of two films: Michael
Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 and Citizens United's Hillary: The Movie. At question was whether each film sought to
440 18 · Public Economy

       discredit political candidates for office too close to an election, in violation of the BCRA. The lower courts found that
       Moore's film did not violate the Act, while Citizens United's did. The fight reached the Supreme Court, as Citizens
       United v. Federal Election Commission, saying that the First Amendment protects the rights of corporations as well
       as individuals to donate to political campaigns. The Court ruled, in a 5-4 decision, that the spending limits were
       unconstitutional. This controversial decision, which essentially allows unlimited contributions by corporations to
       political action committees, overruled several previous decisions and will likely be revisited in the future, due to the
       strength of the public reaction. For now, it has resulted in a sharp increase in election spending.

       While many U.S. adults do not bother to vote in presidential elections, more than half do. What motivates
       them? Research on voting behavior has indicated that people who are more settled or more "connected" to
       society tend to vote more frequently. According to the Washington Post, more married people vote than single
       people. Those with a job vote more than the unemployed. Those who have lived longer in a neighborhood are
       more likely to vote than newcomers. Those who report that they know their neighbors and talk to them are
       more likely to vote than socially isolated people. Those with a higher income and level of education are also
       more likely to vote. These factors suggest that politicians are likely to focus more on the interests of married,
       employed, well-educated people with at least a middle-class level of income than on the interests of other
       groups. For example, those who vote may tend to be more supportive of financial assistance for the two-year
       and four-year colleges they expect their children to attend than they are of medical care or public school
       education aimed at families of unemployed people and those experiencing poverty.

       There have been many proposals to encourage greater voter turnout: making it easier to register to vote,
       keeping the polls open for more hours, or even moving Election Day to the weekend, when fewer people need
       to worry about jobs or school commitments. However, such changes do not seem to have caused a long-term
       upward trend in the number of people voting. After all, casting an informed vote will always impose some costs
       of time and energy. It is not clear how to strengthen people's feeling of connectedness to society in a way that
       will lead to a substantial increase in voter turnout. Without greater voter turnout, however, politicians elected
       by the votes of 60% or fewer of the population may not enact economic policy in the best interests of 100% of
       the population. Meanwhile, countering a long trend toward making voting easier, many states have recently
       enacted new voting laws that critics say are actually barriers to voting. States have passed laws reducing early
       voting, restricting groups who are organizing get-out-the-vote efforts, enacted strict photo ID laws, as well as
       laws that require showing proof of U.S. citizenship. The ACLU argues that while these laws profess to prevent
       voter fraud, they are in effect making it harder for individuals to cast their vote.

     18.2 Special Interest Politics

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain how special interest groups and lobbyists can influence campaigns and elections
         · Describe pork-barrel spending and logrolling

       Many political issues are of intense interest to a relatively small group, as we noted above. For example, many
       U.S. drivers do not much care where their car tires were made--they just want good quality as inexpensively as
       possible. In September 2009, President Obama and Congress enacted a tariff (taxes added on imported goods)
       on tires imported from China that would increase the price by 35 percent in its first year, 30 percent in its
       second year, and 25 percent in its third year. Interestingly, the U.S. companies that make tires did not favor this
       step, because most of them also import tires from China and other countries. (See Globalization and
       Protectionism for more on tariffs.) However, the United Steelworkers union, which had seen jobs in the tire

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                                                 18.2 · Special Interest Politics 441

industry fall by 5,000 over the previous five years, lobbied fiercely for the tariff. With this tariff, the cost of all
tires increased significantly. (See the closing Bring It Home feature at the end of this chapter for more
information on the tire tariff.)

Special interest groups are groups that are small in number relative to the nation, but quite well organized
and focused on a specific issue. A special interest group can pressure legislators to enact public policies that
do not benefit society as a whole. Imagine an environmental rule to reduce air pollution that will cost 10 large
companies $8 million each, for a total cost of $80 million. The social benefits from enacting this rule provide
an average benefit of $10 for every person in the United States, for a total of about $3 trillion. Even though the
benefits are far higher than the costs for society as a whole, the 10 companies are likely to lobby much more
fiercely to avoid $8 million in costs than the average person is to argue for $10 worth of benefits.

As this example suggests, we can relate the problem of special interests in politics to an issue we raised in
Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities about economic policy with respect to negative
externalities and pollution--the problem called regulatory capture (which we defined in Monopoly and
Antitrust Policy). In legislative bodies and agencies that write laws and regulations about how much
corporations will pay in taxes, or rules for safety in the workplace, or instructions on how to satisfy
environmental regulations, you can be sure the specific industry affected has lobbyists who study every word
and every comma. They talk with the legislators who are writing the legislation and suggest alternative
wording. They contribute to the campaigns of legislators on the key committees--and may even offer those
legislators high-paying jobs after they have left office. As a result, it often turns out that those regulated can
exercise considerable influence over the regulators.

In the early 2000s, about 40 million people in the United States were eligible for Medicare, a government
program that provides health insurance for those 65 and older. On some issues, the elderly are a powerful
interest group. They donate money and time to political campaigns, and in the 2020 presidential election, 76%
of those ages 65-74 voted, while just 51% of those aged 18 to 24 cast a ballot, according to the U.S. Census.

In 2003, Congress passed and President George Bush signed into law a substantial expansion of Medicare that
helped the elderly to pay for prescription drugs. The prescription drug benefit cost the federal government
about $40 billion in 2006, and the Medicare system projected that the annual cost would rise to $121 billion by
2016. The political pressure to pass a prescription drug benefit for Medicare was apparently quite high, while
the political pressure to assist the 40 million with no health insurance at all was considerably lower. One
reason might be that the American Association for Retired People AARP, a well-funded and well-organized
lobbying group represents senior citizens, while there is no umbrella organization to lobby for those without
health insurance.

In the battle over passage of the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA), which became known as "Obamacare," there
was heavy lobbying on all sides by insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies. However, labor
unions and community groups financed a lobby group, Health Care for America Now (HCAN), to offset
corporate lobbying. HCAN, spending $60 million dollars, was successful in helping pass legislation which
added new regulations on insurance companies and a mandate that all individuals will obtain health
insurance by 2014. The following Work It Out feature further explains voter incentives and lobbyist influence.
442 18 · Public Economy

                                                                                                                WORK IT OUT

        Paying To Get Your Way

         Suppose Congress proposes a tax on carbon emissions for certain factories in a small town of 10,000 people.
         Congress estimates the tax will reduce pollution to such an extent that it will benefit each resident by an
         equivalent of $300. The tax will also reduce profits to the town's two large factories by $1 million each. How
         much should the factory owners be willing to spend to fight the tax passage, and how much should the
         townspeople be willing to pay to support it? Why is society unlikely to achieve the optimal outcome?
         Step 1. The two factory owners each stand to lose $1 million if the tax passes, so each should be willing to spend
         up to that amount to prevent the passage, a combined sum of $2 million. Of course, in the real world, there is no
         guarantee that lobbying efforts will be successful, so the factory owners may choose to invest an amount that is
         substantially lower.
         Step 2. There are 10,000 townspeople, each standing to benefit by $300 if the tax passes. Theoretically, then,
         they should be willing to spend up to $3 million (10,000 × $300) to ensure passage. (Again, in the real world with
         no guarantees of success, they may choose to spend less.)
         Step 3. It is costly and difficult for 10,000 people to coordinate in such a way as to influence public policy. Since
         each person stands to gain only $300, many may feel lobbying is not worth the effort.
         Step 4. The two factory owners, however, find it very easy and profitable to coordinate their activities, so they
         have a greater incentive to do so.

       Special interests may develop a close relationship with one political party, so their ability to influence
       legislation rises and falls as that party moves in or out of power. A special interest may even hurt a political
       party if it appears to a number of voters that the relationship is too cozy. In a close election, a small group that
       has been under-represented in the past may find that it can tip the election one way or another--so that group
       will suddenly receive considerable attention. Democratic institutions produce an ebb and flow of political
       parties and interests and thus offer both opportunities for special interests and ways of counterbalancing
       those interests over time.

      Identifiable Winners, Anonymous Losers

       A number of economic policies produce gains whose beneficiaries are easily identifiable, but costs that are
       partly or entirely shared by a large number who remain anonymous. A democratic political system probably
       has a bias toward those who are identifiable.
       For example, policies that impose price controls--like rent control--may look as if they benefit renters and
       impose costs only on landlords. However, when landlords then decide to reduce the number of rental units
       available in the area, a number of people who would have liked to rent an apartment end up living somewhere
       else because no units were available. These would-be renters have experienced a cost of rent control, but it is
       hard to identify who they are.
       Similarly, policies that block imports will benefit the firms that would have competed with those imports--and
       workers at those firms--who are likely to be quite visible. Consumers who would have preferred to purchase
       the imported products, and who thus bear some costs of the protectionist policy, are much less visible.
       Specific tax breaks and spending programs also have identifiable winners and impose costs on others who are
       hard to identify. Special interests are more likely to arise from a group that is easily identifiable, rather than
       from a group where some of those who suffer may not even recognize they are bearing costs.

Pork Barrels and Logrolling

Politicians have an incentive to ensure that they spend government money in their home state or district,
where it will benefit their constituents in a direct and obvious way. Thus, when legislators are negotiating over
whether to support a piece of legislation, they commonly ask each other to include pork-barrel spending,
legislation that benefits mainly a single political district. Pork-barrel spending is another case in which
concentrated benefits and widely dispersed costs challenge democracy: the benefits of pork-barrel spending
are obvious and direct to local voters, while the costs are spread over the entire country. Read the following
Clear It Up feature for more information on pork-barrel spending.

         CLEAR IT UP

How much impact can pork-barrel spending have?

Many observers widely regard U.S. Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, who was originally elected to the Senate
in 1958 and served until 2010, as one of the masters of pork-barrel politics, directing a steady stream of federal
funds to his home state. A journalist once compiled a list of structures in West Virginia at least partly government
funded and named after Byrd: "the Robert C. Byrd Highway; the Robert C. Byrd Locks and Dam; the Robert C. Byrd
Institute; the Robert C. Byrd Life Long Learning Center; the Robert C. Byrd Honors Scholarship Program; the Robert
C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope; the Robert C. Byrd Institute for Advanced Flexible Manufacturing; the Robert C. Byrd
Federal Courthouse; the Robert C. Byrd Health Sciences Center; the Robert C. Byrd Academic and Technology
Center; the Robert C. Byrd United Technical Center; the Robert C. Byrd Federal Building; the Robert C. Byrd Drive;
the Robert C. Byrd Hilltop Office Complex; the Robert C. Byrd Library; and the Robert C. Byrd Learning Resource
Center; the Robert C. Byrd Rural Health Center." This list does not include government-funded projects in West
Virginia that were not named after Byrd. Of course, we would have to analyze each of these expenditures in detail to
figure out whether we should treat them as pork-barrel spending or whether they provide widespread benefits that
reach beyond West Virginia. At least some of them, or a portion of them, certainly would fall into that category.
Because there are currently no term limits for Congressional representatives, those who have been in office longer
generally have more power to enact pork-barrel projects.

The amount that government spends on individual pork-barrel projects is small, but many small projects can
add up to a substantial total. A nonprofit watchdog organization, called Citizens against Government Waste,
produces an annual report, the Pig Book that attempts to quantify the amount of pork-barrel spending,
focusing on items that only one member of Congress requested, that were passed into law without any public
hearings, or that serve only a local purpose. Whether any specific item qualifies as pork can be controversial.
The 2021 Congressional Pig Book identified 285 earmarks in FY 2021, with a cost of $16.8 billion. Recent
growth in earmarks and their cost is apparent: in FY 2017, there were 163 earmarks at a cost of $6.8 billion.
Hence, in only four years, there was a 75% increase in the number of earmarks and a 147% increase in the
cost of those earmarks.

Logrolling, an action in which all members of a group of legislators agree to vote for a package of otherwise
unrelated laws that they individually favor, can encourage pork barrel spending. For example, if one member
of the U.S. Congress suggests building a new bridge or hospital in their own congressional district, the other
members might oppose it. However, if 51% of the legislators come together, they can pass a bill that includes a
bridge or hospital for every one of their districts.

As a reflection of this interest of legislators in their own districts, the U.S. government has typically spread out
its spending on military bases and weapons programs to congressional districts all across the country. In part,
the government does this to help create a situation that encourages members of Congress to vote in support of
defense spending.

         · Explain the voting cycle
         · Analyze the interrelationship between markets and government

       Most developed countries today have a democratic system of government: citizens express their opinions
       through votes and those votes affect the direction of the country. The advantage of democracy over other
       systems is that it allows everyone in a society an equal say and therefore may reduce the possibility of a small
       group of wealthy oligarchs oppressing the masses. There is no such thing as a perfect system, and democracy,
       for all its popularity, is not without its problems, a few of which we will examine here.

       We sometimes sum up and oversimplify democracy in two words: "Majority rule." When voters face three or
       more choices, however, then voting may not always be a useful way of determining what the majority prefers.

       As one example, consider an election in a state where 60% of the population is liberal and 40% is conservative.
       If there are only two candidates, one from each side, and if liberals and conservatives vote in the same 60-40
       proportions in which they are represented in the population, then the liberal will win. What if the election ends
       up including two liberal candidates and one conservative? It is possible that the liberal vote will split and
       victory will go to the minority party. In this case, the outcome does not reflect the majority's preference.

       Does the majority view prevail in the case of sugar quotas? Clearly there are more sugar consumers in the
       United States than sugar producers, but the U.S. domestic sugar lobby (www.sugarcane.org) has successfully
       argued for protection against imports since 1789. By law, therefore, U.S. cookie and candy makers must use
       85% domestic sugar in their products. Meanwhile quotas on imported sugar restrict supply and keep the
       domestic sugar price up--raising prices for companies that use sugar in producing their goods and for
       consumers. The European Union allows sugar imports, and prices there are 40% lower than U.S. sugar prices.
       Sugar-producing countries in the Caribbean repeatedly protest the U.S. quotas at the World Trade
       Organization meetings, but each bite of cookie, at present, costs you more than if there were no sugar lobby.
       This case goes against the theory of the "median" voter in a democracy. The median voter theory argues that
       politicians will try to match policies to what pleases the median voter preferences. If we think of political
       positions along a spectrum from left to right, the median voter is in the middle of the spectrum. This theory
       argues that actual policy will reflect "middle of the road." In the case of sugar lobby politics, the minority, not
       the median, dominates policy.

       Sometimes it is not even clear how to define the majority opinion. Step aside from politics for a moment and
       think about a choice facing three families (the Ortegas, the Schmidts, and the Alexanders) who are planning to
       celebrate New Year's Day together. They agree to vote on the menu, choosing from three entrees, and they
       agree that the majority vote wins. With three families, it seems reasonable that one producing choice will get a
       2-1 majority. What if, however, their vote ends up looking like Table 18.1?

       Clearly, the three families disagree on their first choice. However, the problem goes even deeper. Instead of
       looking at all three choices at once, compare them two at a time. (See Figure 18.2) In a vote of turkey versus
       beef, turkey wins by 2-1. In a vote of beef versus lasagna, beef wins 2-1. If turkey beats beef, and beef beats
       lasagna, then it might seem only logical that turkey must also beat lasagna. However, with the preferences,
       lasagna is preferred to turkey by a 2-1 vote, as well. If lasagna is preferred to turkey, and turkey beats beef,
       then surely it must be that lasagna also beats beef? Actually, no. Beef beats lasagna. In other words, the
       majority view may not win. Clearly, as any car salesperson will tell you, the way one presents choices to us
       influences our decisions.

FIGURE 18.2 A Voting Cycle Given these choices, voting will struggle to produce a majority outcome. Turkey is
favored over roast beef by 2-1 and roast beef is favored over lasagna by 2-1. If turkey beats roast beef and roast
beef beats lasagna, then it might seem that turkey must beat lasagna, too. However, given these preferences,
lasagna is favored over turkey by 2-1.

TABLE 18.1 Circular Preferences

We call the situation in which Choice A is preferred by a majority over Choice B, Choice B is preferred by a
majority over Choice C, and Choice C is preferred by a majority over Choice A a voting cycle. It is easy to
imagine sets of government choices--say, perhaps the choice between increased defense spending, increased
government spending on health care, and a tax cut--in which a voting cycle could occur. The result will be
determined by the order in which interested parties present and vote on choices, not by majority rule, because
every choice is both preferred to some alternative and also not preferred to another alternative.

Where Is Government's Self-Correcting Mechanism?

When a firm produces a product no one wants to buy or produces at a higher cost than its competitors, the firm
is likely to suffer losses. If it cannot change its ways, it will go out of business. This self-correcting mechanism
in the marketplace can have harsh effects on workers or on local economies, but it also puts pressure on firms
for good performance.

Government agencies, however, do not sell their products in a market. They receive tax dollars instead. They
are not challenged by competitors as are private-sector firms. If the U.S. Department of Education or the U.S.
Department of Defense is performing poorly, citizens cannot purchase their services from another provider
446 18 · Public Economy

       and drive the existing government agencies into bankruptcy. If you are upset that the Internal Revenue Service
       is slow in sending you a tax refund or seems unable to answer your questions, you cannot decide to pay your
       income taxes through a different organization. Of course, elected politicians can assign new leaders to
       government agencies and instruct them to reorganize or to emphasize a different mission. The pressure
       government faces, however, to change its bureaucracy, to seek greater efficiency, and to improve customer
       responsiveness is much milder than the threat of being put out of business altogether.

       This insight suggests that when government provides goods or services directly, we might expect it to do so
       with less efficiency than private firms--except in certain cases where the government agency may compete
       directly with private firms. At the local level, for example, government can provide directly services like
       garbage collection, using private firms under contract to the government, or by a mix of government
       employees competing with private firms.

      A Balanced View of Markets and Government

       The British statesman Sir Winston Churchill (1874-1965) once wrote: "No one pretends that democracy is
       perfect or all-wise. Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except for all of the
       other forms which have been tried from time to time." In that spirit, the theme of this discussion is certainly
       not that we should abandon democratic government. A practical student of public policy needs to recognize
       that in some cases, like the case of well-organized special interests or pork-barrel legislation, a democratic
       government may seek to enact economically unwise projects or programs. In other cases, by placing a low
       priority on the problems of those who are not well organized or who are less likely to vote, the government may
       fail to act when it could do some good. In these and other cases, there is no automatic reason to believe that
       government will necessarily make economically sensible choices.

       "The true test of a first-rate mind is the ability to hold two contradictory ideas at the same time," wrote the
       American author F. Scott Fitzgerald (1896-1940). At this point in your study of microeconomics, you should be
       able to go one better than Fitzgerald and hold three somewhat contradictory ideas about the interrelationship
       between markets and government in your mind at the same time.

       First, markets are extraordinarily useful and flexible institutions through which society can allocate its scarce
       resources. We introduced this idea with the subjects of international trade and demand and supply in other
       chapters and reinforced it in all the subsequent discussions of how households and firms make decisions.

       Second, markets may sometimes produce unwanted results. A short list of the cases in which markets produce
       unwanted results includes monopoly and other cases of imperfect competition, pollution, poverty and
       inequality of incomes, discrimination, and failure to provide insurance.

       Third, while government may play a useful role in addressing the problems of markets, government action is
       also imperfect and may not reflect majority views. Economists readily admit that, in settings like monopoly or
       negative externalities, a potential role exists for government intervention. However, in the real world, it is not
       enough to point out that government action might be a good idea. Instead, we must have some confidence that
       the government is likely to identify and carry out the appropriate public policy. To make sensible judgments
       about economic policy, we must see the strengths and weaknesses of both markets and government. We must
       not idealize or demonize either unregulated markets or government actions. Instead, consider the actual
       strengths and weaknesses of real-world markets and real-world governments.

       These three insights seldom lead to simple or obvious political conclusions. As the famous British economist
       Joan Robinson wrote some decades ago: "[E]conomic theory, in itself, preaches no doctrines and cannot
       establish any universally valid laws. It is a method of ordering ideas and formulating questions." The study of
       economics is neither politically conservative, nor moderate, nor liberal. There are economists who are
       Democrats, Republicans, libertarians, socialists, and members of every other political group you can name. Of
       course, conservatives may tend to emphasize the virtues of markets and the limitations of government, while
       liberals may tend to emphasize the shortcomings of markets and the need for government programs. Such

differences only illustrate that the language and terminology of economics is not limited to one set of political
beliefs, but can be used by all.

         BRING IT HOME

Chinese Tire Tariffs

In April 2009, the union representing U.S. tire manufacturing workers filed a request with the U.S. International
Trade Commission (ITC), asking it to investigate tire imports from China. Under U.S. trade law, if imports from a
country increase to the point that they cause market disruption in the United States, as determined by the ITC, then
it can also recommend a remedy for this market disruption. In this case, the ITC determined that from 2004 to
2008, U.S. tire manufacturers suffered declines in production, financial health, and employment as a direct result of
increases in tire imports from China. The ITC recommended placing an additional tax on tire imports from China.
President Obama and Congress agreed with the ITC recommendation, and in June 2009 tariffs on Chinese tires
increased from 4% to 39%. In addition, tariffs on Chinese tires increased further as part of President Trump's
increases on a broad range of Chinese products.

Why would U.S. consumers buy imported tires from China in the first place? Most likely, because they are cheaper
than tires produced domestically or in other countries. Therefore, this tariff increase should cause U.S. consumers to
pay higher prices for tires, either because Chinese tires are now more expensive, or because U.S. consumers are
pushed by the tariff to buy more expensive tires made by U.S. manufacturers or those from other countries. In the
end, this tariff made U.S. consumers pay more for tires.

Was this tariff met with outrage expressed via social media, traditional media, or mass protests? Were there
"Occupy Wall Street-type" demonstrations? The answer is a resounding "No". Most U.S. tire consumers were likely
unaware of the tariff increase, although they may have noticed the price increase, which was between $4 and $13
depending on the type of tire. Tire consumers are also potential voters. Conceivably, a tax increase, even a small
one, might make voters unhappy. However, voters probably realized that it was not worth their time to learn
anything about this issue or cast a vote based on it. They probably thought their vote would not matter in
determining the outcome of an election or changing this policy.

Estimates of the impact of this tariff show it costs U.S. consumers around $1.11 billion annually. Of this amount,
roughly $817 million ends up in the pockets of foreign tire manufacturers other than in China, and the remaining
$294 million goes to U.S. tire manufacturers. In other words, the tariff increase on Chinese tires may have saved
1,200 jobs in the domestic tire sector, but it cost 3,700 jobs in other sectors, as consumers had to reduce their
spending because they were paying more for tires. People actually lost their jobs as a result of this tariff. Workers in
U.S. tire manufacturing firms earned about $40,000 in 2010. Given the number of jobs saved and the total cost to
U.S. consumers, the cost of saving one job amounted to $926,500!

This tariff caused a net decline in U.S. social surplus. (We discuss total surplus in the Demand and Supply chapter,
and tariffs in the Introduction to International Trade chapter.) Instead of saving jobs, it cost jobs, and those jobs that
it saved cost many times more than the people working in them could ever hope to earn. Why would the government
do this?

The chapter answers this question by discussing the influence special interest groups have on economic policy. The
steelworkers union, whose members make tires, saw increasingly more members lose their jobs as U.S. consumers
consumed increasingly more cheap Chinese tires. By definition, this union is relatively small but well organized,
especially compared to tire consumers. It stands to gain much for each of its members, compared to what each tire
consumer may have to give up in terms of higher prices. Thus, the steelworkers union (joined by domestic tire
manufacturers) has not only the means but the incentive to lobby economic policymakers and lawmakers. Given
that U.S. tire consumers are a large and unorganized group, if they even are a group, it is unlikely they will lobby
against higher tire tariffs. In the end, lawmakers tend to listen to those who lobby them, even though the results
make for bad economic policy.

Key Concepts and Summary

18.1 Voter Participation and Costs of Elections

The theory of rational ignorance says voters will recognize that their single vote is extremely unlikely to
influence the outcome of an election. As a consequence, they will choose to remain uninformed about issues
and not vote. This theory helps explain why voter turnout is so low in the United States.

18.2 Special Interest Politics

Special interest politics arises when a relatively small group, called a special interest group, each of whose
members has a large interest in a political outcome, devotes considerable time and energy to lobbying for the
group's preferred choice. Meanwhile, the large majority, each of whose members has only a small interest in
this issue, pays no attention.

We define pork--barrel spending as legislation whose benefits are concentrated on a single district while the
costs are spread widely over the country. Logrolling refers to a situation in which two or more legislators agree
to vote for each other's legislation, which can then encourage pork-barrel spending in many districts.

18.3 Flaws in the Democratic System of Government

Majority votes can run into difficulties when more than two choices exist. A voting cycle occurs when, in a
situation with at least three choices, choice A is preferred by a majority vote to choice B, choice B is preferred
by a majority vote to choice C, and choice C is preferred by a majority vote to choice A. In such a situation, it is
impossible to identify what the majority prefers. Another difficulty arises when the vote is so divided that no
choice receives a majority.

A practical approach to microeconomic policy will need to take a realistic view of the specific strengths and
weaknesses of markets as well as government, rather than making the easy but wrong assumption that either
the market or government is always beneficial or always harmful.

      contrast to rational ignorance theory?

15. What are some possible ways to encourage voter participation and overcome rational ignorance?

      sometimes willing to cooperate in order to form lobbying associations?

19. Special interests do not oppose regulations in all cases. The Marketplace Fairness Act of 2013 would
      require online merchants to collect sales taxes from their customers in other states. Why might a large

      online retailer like Amazon.com support such a measure?
20. To ensure safety and efficacy, the Food and Drug Administration regulates the medicines that pharmacies

      are allowed to sell in the United States. Sometimes this means a company must test a drug for years before
      it can reach the market. We can easily identify the winners in this system as those who are protected from
      unsafe drugs that might otherwise harm them. Who are the more anonymous losers who do not benefit
      from strict medical regulations?
21. How is it possible to bear a cost without realizing it? What are some examples of policies that affect people
      in ways of which they may not even be aware?

      perhaps from your own district, that have had positive results?
23. The United States currently uses a voting system called "first past the post" in elections, meaning that the
      candidate with the most votes wins. What are some of the problems with a "first past the post" system?
24. What are some alternatives to a "first past the post" system that might reduce the problem of voting

25. AT&T spent some $10 million dollars lobbying Congress to block entry of competitors into the telephone

26. Occupy Wall Street was a national (and later global) organized protest against the greed, bank profits, and
      financial corruption that led to the 2008-2009 recession. The group popularized slogans like "We are the
      99%," meaning it represented the majority against the wealth of the top 1%. Does the fact that the protests
      had little to no effect on legislative changes support or contradict the chapter?

      million people living there, and each would benefit by $200 from this smoking ban. However, there are
      two large tobacco companies in Tobaccoville and the ban would cost them $5 million each. What are the
      proposed policy's total costs and benefits? Do you think it will pass?

Introduction to the Macroeconomic Perspective

         BRING IT HOME

How is the Economy Doing? How Does One Tell?

The 1990s were boom years for the U.S. economy. Beginning in the late 2000s, from 2007 to 2014, economic
performance in the U.S. was poor. The economy experienced another period of strong growth between 2014 and
2019, before COVID-19 rocked the world economy in March and April of 2020. What causes the economy to expand
or contract? Why do businesses fail when they are making all the right decisions? Why do workers lose their jobs
when they are hardworking and productive? Are bad economic times a failure of the market system? Are they a
452 19 · The Macroeconomic Perspective

       failure of the government? These are all questions of macroeconomics, which we will begin to address in this
       chapter. We will not be able to answer all of these questions here, but we will start with the basics: How is the
       economy doing? How can we tell?
       The macro economy includes all buying and selling, all production and consumption; everything that goes on in
       every market in the economy. How can we get a handle on that? The answer begins more than 80 years ago, during
       the Great Depression. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his economic advisers knew things were bad--but how
       could they express and measure just how bad it was? An economist named Simon Kuznets, who later won the Nobel
       Prize for his work, came up with a way to track what the entire economy is producing. In this chapter, you will learn
       how the government constructs GDP, how we use it, and why it is so important.

       Macroeconomics focuses on the economy as a whole (or on whole economies as they interact). What causes
       recessions? What makes unemployment stay high when recessions are supposed to be over? Why do some
       countries grow faster than others? Why do some countries have higher standards of living than others? These
       are all questions that macroeconomics addresses. Macroeconomics involves adding up the economic activity
       of all households and all businesses in all markets to obtain the overall demand and supply in the economy.
       However, when we do that, something curious happens. It is not unusual that what results at the macro level is
       different from the sum of the microeconomic parts. What seems sensible from a microeconomic point of view
       can have unexpected or counterproductive results at the macroeconomic level. Imagine that you are sitting at
       an event with a large audience, like a live concert or a basketball game. A few people decide that they want a
       better view, and so they stand up. However, when these people stand up, they block the view for other people,
       and the others need to stand up as well if they wish to see. Eventually, nearly everyone is standing up, and as a
       result, no one can see much better than before. The rational decision of some individuals at the micro level--to
       stand up for a better view--ended up as self-defeating at the macro level. This is not macroeconomics, but it is
       an apt analogy.
       Macroeconomics is a rather massive subject. How are we going to tackle it? Figure 19.2 illustrates the structure
       we will use. We will study macroeconomics from three different perspectives:
        1. What are the macroeconomic goals? (Macroeconomics as a discipline does not have goals, but we do have

             goals for the macro economy.)
        2. What are the frameworks economists can use to analyze the macroeconomy?
        3. Finally, what are the policy tools governments can use to manage the macroeconomy?

       FIGURE 19.2 Macroeconomic Goals, Framework, and Policies This chart shows what macroeconomics is about.
       The box on the left indicates a consensus of what are the most important goals for the macro economy, the middle
       box lists the frameworks economists use to analyze macroeconomic changes (such as inflation or recession), and
       the box on the right indicates the two tools the federal government uses to influence the macro economy.

      Goals

       In thinking about the macroeconomy's overall health, it is useful to consider three primary goals: economic
       growth, low unemployment, and low inflation.

         · Economic growth ultimately determines the prevailing standard of living in a country. Economists
             measure growth by the percentage change in real (inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product. A growth

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                              19.1 · Measuring the Size of the Economy: Gross Domestic Product 453

      rate of more than 3% is considered good.
  · Unemployment, as measured by the unemployment rate, is the percentage of people in the labor force

      who do not have a job. When people lack jobs, the economy is wasting a precious resource-labor, and the
      result is lower goods and services produced. Unemployment, however, is more than a statistic--it
      represents people's livelihoods. While measured unemployment is unlikely to ever be zero, economists
      consider a measured unemployment rate of 5% or less low (good).
  · Inflation is a sustained increase in the overall level of prices, and is measured by the consumer price
      index. If many people face a situation where the prices that they pay for food, shelter, and healthcare are
      rising much faster than the wages they receive for their labor, there will be widespread unhappiness as
      their standard of living declines. For that reason, low inflation--an inflation rate of 1-2%--is a major goal.

As you learn in the micro part of this book, principal tools that economists use are theories and models (see
Welcome to Economics! for more on this). In microeconomics, we used the theories of supply and demand. In
macroeconomics, we use the theories of aggregate demand (AD) and aggregate supply (AS). This book presents
two perspectives on macroeconomics: the Neoclassical perspective and the Keynesian perspective, each of
which has its own version of AD and AS. Between the two perspectives, you will obtain a good understanding of
what drives the macroeconomy.

Policy Tools

National governments have two tools for influencing the macroeconomy. The first is monetary policy, which
involves managing the money supply and interest rates. The second is fiscal policy, which involves changes in
government spending/purchases and taxes.

We will explain each of the items in Figure 19.2 in detail in one or more other chapters. As you learn these
things, you will discover that the goals and the policy tools are in the news almost every day.

19.1 Measuring the Size of the Economy: Gross Domestic Product

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Identify the components of GDP on the demand side and on the supply side
  · Evaluate how economists measure gross domestic product (GDP)
  · Contrast and calculate GDP, net exports, and net national product

Macroeconomics is an empirical subject, so the first step toward understanding it is to measure the economy.

How large is the U.S. economy? Economists typically measure the size of a nation's overall economy by its
gross domestic product (GDP), which is the value of all final goods and services produced within a country in
a given year. Measuring GDP involves counting the production of millions of different goods and
services--smart phones, cars, music downloads, computers, steel, bananas, college educations, and all other
new goods and services that a country produced in the current year--and summing them into a total dollar
value. This task is straightforward: take the quantity of everything produced, multiply it by the price at which
each product sold, and add up the total. In 2020, the U.S. GDP totaled $20.9 trillion, the largest GDP in the
world.

Each of the market transactions that enter into GDP must involve both a buyer and a seller. We can measure an
economy's GDP either by the total dollar value of what consumers purchase in the economy, or by the total
dollar value of what is the country produces. There is even a third way, as we will explain later.

GDP Measured by Components of Demand

Who buys all of this production? We can divide this demand into four main parts: consumer spending
(consumption), business spending (investment), government spending on goods and services, and spending
454 19 · The Macroeconomic Perspective

on net exports. (See the following Clear It Up feature to understand what we mean by investment.) Table 19.1
shows how these four components added up to the GDP in 2020, Figure 19.4 (a) shows the levels of
consumption, investment, and government purchases over time, expressed as a percentage of GDP, while
Figure 19.4 (b) shows the levels of exports and imports as a percentage of GDP over time. A few patterns about
each of these components are worth noticing. Table 19.1 shows the components of GDP from the demand side.

         Components of GDP on the Demand Side (in trillions of dollars) Percentage of Total

Consumption $14.0                       67.2%

Investment $3.6                         17.4%

Government $3.9                         18.5%

Exports  $2.1                           10.2%

Imports  -$2.7                          -13.3%

Total GDP $20.9                         100%

What does the word "investment" mean?

What do economists mean by investment, or business spending? In calculating GDP, investment does not refer to
purchasing stocks and bonds or trading financial assets. It refers to purchasing new capital goods, that is, new
commercial real estate (such as buildings, factories, and stores) and equipment, residential housing construction,
and inventories. Inventories that manufacturers produce this year are included in this year's GDP--even if they are
not yet sold. From the accountant's perspective, it is as if the firm invested in its own inventories. Business
investment in 2020 was $3.6 trillion, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

FIGURE 19.4 Components of GDP on the Demand Side (a) Consumption is about two-thirds of GDP, and it has been
on a slight upward trend over time. Business investment hovers around 15% of GDP, but it fluctuates more than
consumption. Government spending on goods and services is slightly under 20% of GDP and has declined modestly
over time. (b) Exports are added to total demand for goods and services, while imports are subtracted from total
demand. If exports exceed imports, as in most of the 1960s and 1970s in the U.S. economy, a trade surplus exists.
If imports exceed exports, as in recent years, then a trade deficit exists. (Source: http://bea.gov/iTable/
index_nipa.cfm, Table 1.1.10)
Consumption expenditure by households is the largest component of GDP, accounting for about two-thirds of
the GDP in any year. This tells us that consumers' spending decisions are a major driver of the economy.
However, consumer spending is a gentle elephant: when viewed over time, it does not jump around too much,
and has increased modestly from about 60% of GDP in the 1960s and 1970s.
Investment expenditure refers to purchases of physical plant and equipment, primarily by businesses. If
Starbucks builds a new store, or Amazon buys robots, they count these expenditures under business
investment. Investment demand is far smaller than consumption demand, typically accounting for only about
15-18% of GDP, but it is very important for the economy because this is where jobs are created. However, it
fluctuates more noticeably than consumption. Business investment is volatile. New technology or a new
product can spur business investment, but then confidence can drop and business investment can pull back
sharply.
If you have noticed any of the infrastructure projects (new bridges, highways, airports) launched during the
2009 recession, or if you received a stimulus check during the pandemic-induced recession of 2020-2021, you
have seen how important government spending can be for the economy. Government expenditure in the
United States is close to 20% of GDP, and includes spending by all three levels of government: federal, state,
and local. The only part of government spending counted in demand is government purchases of goods or
services produced in the economy. Examples include the government buying a new fighter jet for the Air Force
(federal government spending), building a new highway (state government spending), or a new school (local
government spending). A significant portion of government budgets consists of transfer payments, like
unemployment benefits, veteran's benefits, and Social Security payments to retirees. The government
excludes these payments from GDP because it does not receive a new good or service in return or exchange.
Instead they are transfers of income from taxpayers to others. If you are curious about the awesome
undertaking of adding up GDP, read the following Clear It Up feature.

      How do statisticians measure GDP?

       Government economists at the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), within the U.S. Department of Commerce, piece
       together estimates of GDP from a variety of sources.

       Once every five years, in the second and seventh year of each decade, the Bureau of the Census carries out a
       detailed census of businesses throughout the United States. In between, the Census Bureau carries out a monthly
       survey of retail sales. The government adjusts these figures with foreign trade data to account for exports that are
       produced in the United States and sold abroad and for imports that are produced abroad and sold here. Once every
       ten years, the Census Bureau conducts a comprehensive survey of housing and residential finance. Together, these
       sources provide the main basis for figuring out what is produced for consumers.

       For investment, the Census Bureau carries out a monthly survey of construction and an annual survey of
       expenditures on physical capital equipment.

       For what the federal government purchases, the statisticians rely on the U.S. Department of the Treasury. An annual
       Census of Governments gathers information on state and local governments. Because the government spends a
       considerable amount at all levels hiring people to provide services, it also tracks a large portion of spending through
       payroll records that state governments and the Social Security Administration collect.

       With regard to foreign trade, the Census Bureau compiles a monthly record of all import and export documents.
       Additional surveys cover transportation and travel, and make adjustments for financial services that are produced in
       the United States for foreign customers.

       Many other sources contribute to GDP estimates. Information on energy comes from the U.S. Department of
       Transportation and Department of Energy. The Agency for Health Care Research and Quality collects information on
       healthcare. Surveys of landlords find out about rental income. The Department of Agriculture collects statistics on
       farming.

       All these bits and pieces of information arrive in different forms, at different time intervals. The BEA melds them
       together to produce GDP estimates on a quarterly basis (every three months). The BEA then "annualizes" these
       numbers by multiplying by four. As more information comes in, the BEA updates and revises these estimates. BEA
       releases the GDP "advance" estimate for a certain quarter one month after a quarter. The "preliminary" estimate
       comes out one month after that. The BEA publishes the "final" estimate one month later, but it is not actually final.
       In July, the BEA releases roughly updated estimates for the previous calendar year. Then, once every five years,
       after it has processed all the results of the latest detailed five-year business census, the BEA revises all of the past
       GDP estimates according to the newest methods and data, going all the way back to 1929.

       When thinking about the demand for domestically produced goods in a global economy, it is important to
       count spending on exports--domestically produced goods that a country sells abroad. Similarly, we must also
       subtract spending on imports--goods that a country produces in other countries that residents of this country
       purchase. The GDP net export component is equal to the dollar value of exports (X) minus the dollar value of
       imports (M), (X - M). We call the gap between exports and imports the trade balance. If a country's exports are
       larger than its imports, then a country has a trade surplus. In the United States, exports typically exceeded
       imports in the 1960s and 1970s, as Figure 19.4(b) shows.

Since the early 1980s, imports have typically exceeded exports, and so the United States has experienced a
trade deficit in most years. The trade deficit grew quite large in the late 1990s and in the mid-2000s. Figure
19.4 (b) also shows that imports and exports have both risen substantially in recent decades, even after the
declines during the Great Recession between 2008 and 2009. As we noted before, if exports and imports are
equal, foreign trade has no effect on total GDP. However, even if exports and imports are balanced overall,
foreign trade might still have powerful effects on particular industries and workers by causing nations to shift
workers and physical capital investment toward one industry rather than another.

Based on these four components of demand, we can measure GDP as:

Understanding how to measure GDP is important for analyzing connections in the macro economy and for
thinking about macroeconomic policy tools.

GDP Measured by What is Produced

Everything that we purchase somebody must first produce. Table 19.2 breaks down what a country produces
into five categories: durable goods, nondurable goods, services, structures, and the change in inventories.
Before going into detail about these categories, notice that total GDP measured according to what is produced
is exactly the same as the GDP measured by looking at the five components of demand. Figure 19.5 provides a
visual representation of this information.

               Components of GDP on the Supply Side (in trillions of dollars) Percentage of Total

Goods

Durable goods  $3.5         16.7%

Nondurable goods $2.8       13.4%

Services       $12.7        60.8%

       FIGURE 19.5 Percentage of Components of GDP on the Production Side Services make up over 60 percent of the
       production side components of GDP in the United States.
       Since every market transaction must have both a buyer and a seller, GDP must be the same whether measured
       by what is demanded or by what is produced. Figure 19.6 shows these components of what is produced,
       expressed as a percentage of GDP, since 1950.

       FIGURE 19.6 Types of Production Services are the largest single component of total supply, representing over 60
       percent of GDP, up from about 45 percent in the early 1950s. Durable and nondurable goods constitute the
       manufacturing sector, and they have declined from 40 percent of GDP in 1950 to about 30 percent in 2016.
       Nondurable goods used to be larger than durable goods, but in recent years, nondurable goods have been dropping

to below the share of durable goods, which is less than 20% of GDP. Structures hover around 10% of GDP. We do
not show here the change in inventories, the final component of aggregate supply. It is typically less than 1% of
GDP.

In thinking about what is produced in the economy, many non-economists immediately focus on solid, long-
lasting goods, like cars and computers. By far the largest part of GDP, however, is services. Moreover, services
have been a growing share of GDP over time. A detailed breakdown of the leading service industries would
include healthcare, education, and legal and financial services. It has been decades since most of the U.S.
economy involved making solid objects. Instead, the most common jobs in a modern economy involve a
worker looking at pieces of paper or a computer screen; meeting with co-workers, customers, or suppliers; or
making phone calls.

Even within the overall category of goods, long-lasting durable goods like cars and refrigerators are about the
same share of the economy as short-lived nondurable goods like food and clothing. The category of structures
includes everything from homes, to office buildings, shopping malls, and factories. Inventories is a small
category that refers to the goods that one business has produced but has not yet sold to consumers, and are
still sitting in warehouses and on shelves. The amount of inventories sitting on shelves tends to decline if
business is better than expected, or to rise if business is worse than expected.

Another Way to Measure GDP: The National Income Approach

GDP is a measure of what is produced in a nation. The primary way GDP is estimated is with the Expenditure
Approach we discussed above, but there is another way. Everything a firm produces, when sold, becomes
revenues to the firm. Businesses use revenues to pay their bills: Wages and salaries for labor, interest and
dividends for capital, rent for land, profit to the entrepreneur, etc. So adding up all the income produced in a
year provides a second way of measuring GDP. This is why the terms GDP and national income are sometimes
used interchangeably. The total value of a nation's output is equal to the total value of a nation's income.

The Problem of Double Counting

We define GDP as the current value of all final goods and services produced in a nation in a year. What are final
goods? They are goods at the furthest stage of production at the end of a year. Statisticians who calculate GDP
must avoid the mistake of double counting, in which they count output more than once as it travels through
the production stages. For example, imagine what would happen if government statisticians first counted the
value of tires that a tire manufacturer produces, and then counted the value of a new truck that an automaker
sold that contains those tires. In this example, the statisticians would have counted the value of the tires twice-
because the truck's price includes the value of the tires.

To avoid this problem, which would overstate the size of the economy considerably, government statisticians
count just the value of final goods and services in the chain of production that are sold for consumption,
investment, government, and trade purposes. Statisticians exclude intermediate goods, which are goods that
go into producing other goods, from GDP calculations. From the example above, they will only count the Ford
truck's value. The value of what businesses provide to other businesses is captured in the final products at the
end of the production chain.

The concept of GDP is fairly straightforward: it is just the dollar value of all final goods and services produced
in the economy in a year. In our decentralized, market-oriented economy, actually calculating the more than
$21 trillion-dollar U.S. GDP--along with how it is changing every few months--is a full-time job for a brigade of
government statisticians.

Net exports                             Illegal goods

TABLE 19.3 Counting GDP

Notice the items that are not counted into GDP, as Table 19.3 outlines. The sales of used goods are not included
because they were produced in a previous year and are part of that year's GDP. The entire underground
economy of services paid "under the table" and illegal sales should be counted, but is not, because it is
impossible to track these sales. In Friedrich Schneider's recent study of shadow economies, he estimated the
underground economy in the United States to be 6.6% of GDP, or close to $2 trillion dollars in 2013 alone.
Transfer payments, such as payment by the government to individuals, are not included, because they do not
represent production. Also, production of some goods--such as home production as when you make your
breakfast--is not counted because these goods are not sold in the marketplace.

Other Ways to Measure the Economy

Besides GDP, there are several different but closely related ways of measuring the size of the economy. We
mentioned above that we can think of GDP as total production and as total purchases. We can also think of it as
total income since anything one produces and sells yields income.

One of the closest cousins of GDP is the gross national product (GNP). GDP includes only what country
produces within its borders. GNP adds what domestic businesses and labor abroad produces, and subtracts
any payments that foreign labor and businesses located in the United States send home to other countries. In
other words, GNP is based more on what a country's citizens and firms produce, wherever they are located,
and GDP is based on what happens within a certain county's geographic boundaries. For the United States, the
gap between GDP and GNP is relatively small; in recent years, only about 0.2%. For small nations, which may
have a substantial share of their population working abroad and sending money back home, the difference can
be substantial.

We calculate net national product (NNP) by taking GNP and then subtracting the value of how much physical
capital is worn out, or reduced in value because of aging, over the course of a year. The process by which
capital ages and loses value is called depreciation. We can further subdivide NNP into national income, which
includes all income to businesses and individuals, and personal income, which includes only income to
people.

The gross national income (GNI) includes the value of all goods and services produced by people from a
country--whether in the country or not. Unlike the other methods, GNI essentially measures the wealth of a
nation because it focuses on income, not output. As you will see in the discussion regarding global economic
diversity, the World Bank now uses GNI to classify nations according to economic status.

For practical purposes, it is not vital to memorize these definitions. However, it is important to be aware that
these differences exist and to know what statistic you are examining, so that you do not accidentally compare,
say, GDP in one year or for one country with GNP or NNP in another year or another country. To get an idea of

19.2 Adjusting Nominal Values to Real Values

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Contrast nominal GDP and real GDP
  · Explain GDP deflator
  · Calculate real GDP based on nominal GDP values

When examining economic statistics, there is a crucial distinction worth emphasizing. The distinction is
between nominal and real measurements, which refer to whether or not inflation has distorted a given
statistic. Looking at economic statistics without considering inflation is like looking through a pair of
binoculars and trying to guess how close something is: unless you know how strong the lenses are, you cannot
guess the distance very accurately. Similarly, if you do not know the inflation rate, it is difficult to figure out if a
rise in GDP is due mainly to a rise in the overall level of prices or to a rise in quantities of goods produced. The
nominal value of any economic statistic means that we measure the statistic in terms of actual prices that
exist at the time. The real value refers to the same statistic after it has been adjusted for inflation. Generally, it
is the real value that is more important.

Converting Nominal to Real GDP

Table 19.5 shows U.S. GDP at five-year intervals since 1960 in nominal dollars; that is, GDP measured using
the actual market prices prevailing in each stated year. Figure 19.7 also reflects this data in a graph.

GDP of $543 billion in 1960 = 38). This conclusion would be highly misleading. Recall that we define nominal
GDP as the quantity of every final good or service produced multiplied by the price at which it was sold,
summed up for all goods and services. In order to see how much production has actually increased, we need to
extract the effects of higher prices on nominal GDP. We can easily accomplish this using the GDP deflator.
The GDP deflator is a price index measuring the average prices of all final goods and services included in the
economy. We explore price indices in detail and how we compute them in Inflation, but this definition will do
in the context of this chapter. Table 19.5 provides the GDP deflator data and Figure 19.8 shows it graphically.

FIGURE 19.8 U.S. GDP Deflator, 1960-2020 Much like nominal GDP, the GDP deflator has risen exponentially from
1960 through 2010. (Source: BEA https://apps.bea.gov/itable/index.cfm, Table 1.1.9)
Figure 19.8 shows that the price level has risen dramatically since 1960. The price level in 2020 was seven
times higher than in 1960 (the deflator for 2020 was 113 versus a level of 17 in 1960). Clearly, much of the
growth in nominal GDP was due to inflation, not an actual change in the quantity of goods and services
produced, in other words, not in real GDP. Recall that nominal GDP can rise for two reasons: an increase in
output, and/or an increase in prices. What is needed is to extract the increase in prices from nominal GDP so
as to measure only changes in output. After all, the dollars used to measure nominal GDP in 1960 are worth
more than the inflated dollars of 2020--and the price index tells exactly how much more. This adjustment is

       easy to do if you understand that nominal measurements are in value terms, where

       Let's look at an example at the micro level. Suppose the t-shirt company, Coolshirts, sells 10 t-shirts at a price
       of $9 each.

       Then,

       In other words, when we compute "real" measurements we are trying to obtain actual quantities, in this case,
       10 t-shirts.
       With GDP, it is just a tiny bit more complicated. We start with the same formula as above:

       For reasons that we will explain in more detail below, mathematically, a price index is a two-digit decimal
       number like 1.00 or 0.85 or 1.25. Because some people have trouble working with decimals, when the price
       index is published, it has traditionally been multiplied by 100 to get integer numbers like 100, 85, or 125. What
       this means is that when we "deflate" nominal figures to get real figures (by dividing the nominal by the price
       index). We also need to remember to divide the published price index by 100 to make the math work. Thus, the
       formula becomes:

       Now read the following Work It Out feature for more practice calculating real GDP.

                                                                                                                WORK IT OUT
        Computing GDP

         It is possible to use the data in Table 19.5 to compute real GDP.
         Step 1. Look at Table 19.5, to see that, in 1960, nominal GDP was $543.3 billion and the price index (GDP
         deflator) was 19.0.
         Step 2. To calculate the real GDP in 1960, use the formula:

         We'll do this in two parts to make it clear. First adjust the price index: 19 divided by 100 = 0.19. Then divide into
         nominal GDP: $543.3 billion / 0.19 = $2,859.5 billion.
         Step 3. Use the same formula to calculate the real GDP in 1965.

TABLE 19.6 Converting Nominal to Real GDP (Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis, www.bea.gov)

There are a couple things to notice here. Whenever you compute a real statistic, one year (or period) plays a
special role. It is called the base year (or base period). The base year is the year whose prices we use to compute
the real statistic. When we calculate real GDP, for example, we take the quantities of goods and services
produced in each year (for example, 1960 or 1973) and multiply them by their prices in the base year (in this
case, 2005), so we get a measure of GDP that uses prices that do not change from year to year. That is why real
GDP is labeled "Constant Dollars" or, in this example, "2012 Dollars," which means that real GDP is constructed
using prices that existed in 2005. While the example here uses 2012 as the base year, more generally, you can
use any year as the base year. The formula is:

Rearranging the formula and using the data from 2012:

Comparing real GDP and nominal GDP for 2012, you see they are the same. This is no accident. It is because we
have chosen 2012 as the "base year" in this example. Since the price index in the base year always has a value of
100 (by definition), nominal and real GDP are always the same in the base year.

Look at the data for 2015.

  Use this data to make another observation: As long as inflation is positive, meaning prices increase on average
  from year to year, real GDP should be less than nominal GDP in any year after the base year. The reason for this
  should be clear: The value of nominal GDP is "inflated" by inflation. Similarly, as long as inflation is positive, real
  GDP should be greater than nominal GDP in any year before the base year.

Figure 19.9 shows the U.S. nominal and real GDP since 1960. Because 2005 is the base year, the nominal and
real values are exactly the same in that year. However, over time, the rise in nominal GDP looks much larger
than the rise in real GDP (that is, the nominal GDP line rises more steeply than the real GDP line), because the
presence of inflation, especially in the 1970s exaggerates the rise in nominal GDP.

FIGURE 19.9 U.S. Nominal and Real GDP, 1960-2020 The red line measures U.S. GDP in nominal dollars. The black
line measures U.S. GDP in real dollars, where all dollar values are converted to 2012 dollars. Since we express real
GDP in 2012 dollars, the two lines cross in 2012. However, real GDP will appear higher than nominal GDP in the
years before 2012, because dollars were worth less in 2012 than in previous years. Conversely, real GDP will appear
lower in the years after 2012, because dollars were worth more in 2012 than in later years.
Let's return to the question that we posed originally: How much did GDP increase in real terms? What was the
real GDP growth rate from 1960 to 2020? To find the real growth rate, we apply the formula for percentage
change:

In other words, the U.S. economy has increased real production of goods and services by nearly a factor of five
since 1960. Of course, that understates the material improvement since it fails to capture improvements in the
quality of products and the invention of new products.
There is a quicker way to answer this question approximately, using another math trick. Because:

Therefore, real GDP growth rate (% change in quantity) equals the growth rate in nominal GDP (% change in
value) minus the inflation rate (% change in price).
Note that using this equation provides an approximation for small changes in the levels. For more accurate
measures, one should use the first formula.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

  · Explain recessions, depressions, peaks, and troughs
  · Evaluate the importance of tracking real GDP over time
When news reports indicate that "the economy grew 1.2% in the first quarter," the reports are referring to the
468 19 · The Macroeconomic Perspective

       percentage change in real GDP. By convention, governments report GDP growth at an annualized rate:
       Whatever the calculated growth in real GDP was for the quarter, we multiply it by four when it is reported as if
       the economy were growing at that rate for a full year.

       FIGURE 19.10 U.S. GDP, 1930-2020 Real GDP in the United States in 2020 (in 2012 dollars) was about $18.4
       trillion. After adjusting to remove the effects of inflation, this represents a roughly 20-fold increase in the economy's
       production of goods and services since 1930. (Source: bea.gov)
       Figure 19.10 shows the pattern of U.S. real GDP since 1930. Short term declines have regularly interrupted the
       generally upward long-term path of GDP. We call a significant decline in real GDP a recession. We call an
       especially lengthy and deep recession a depression. The severe drop in GDP that occurred during the 1930s
       Great Depression is clearly visible in the figure, as is the 2008-2009 Great Recession and the recession
       induced by COVID-19 in 2020.
       Real GDP is important because it is highly correlated with other measures of economic activity, like
       employment and unemployment. When real GDP rises, so does employment.
       The most significant human problem associated with recessions (and their larger, uglier cousins, depressions)
       is that a slowdown in production means that firms need to lay off or fire some of their workers. Losing a job
       imposes painful financial and personal costs on workers, and often on their extended families as well. In
       addition, even those who keep their jobs are likely to find that wage raises are scanty at best--or their
       employers may ask them to take pay cuts.
       Table 19.7 lists the pattern of recessions and expansions in the U.S. economy since 1900. We call the highest
       point of the economy, before the recession begins, the peak. Conversely, the lowest point of a recession, before
       a recovery begins, is the trough. Thus, a recession lasts from peak to trough, and an economic upswing runs
       from trough to peak. We call the economy's movement from peak to trough and trough to peak the business
       cycle. It is intriguing to notice that the three longest trough-to-peak expansions of the twentieth century have
       happened since 1960. The most recent recession was caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. It started in
       February 2020 and ended formally in May 2020. This was the most severe recession since the 1930s Great
       Depression, but also the shortest. The previous recession, called the Great Recession, was also very severe and
       lasted about 18 months. The expansion starting in June 2009, the trough from the Great Recession, was the
       longest on record--ending 128 months with the pandemic-induced recession.

     19.4 Comparing GDP among Countries

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain how we can use GDP to compare the economic welfare of different nations
         · Calculate the conversion of GDP to a common currency by using exchange rates
         · Calculate GDP per capita using population data
       It is common to use GDP as a measure of economic welfare or standard of living in a nation. When comparing
       the GDP of different nations for this purpose, two issues immediately arise. First, we measure a country's GDP
       in its own currency: the United States uses the U.S. dollar; Canada, the Canadian dollar; most countries of
       Western Europe, the euro; Japan, the yen; Mexico, the peso; and so on. Thus, comparing GDP between two
       countries requires converting to a common currency. A second issue is that countries have very different
       numbers of people. For instance, the United States has a much larger economy than Mexico or Canada, but it
       also has almost three times as many people as Mexico and nine times as many people as Canada. Thus, if we
       are trying to compare standards of living across countries, we need to divide GDP by population.

      Converting Currencies with Exchange Rates

       To compare the GDP of countries with different currencies, it is necessary to convert to a "common
       denominator" using an exchange rate, which is the value of one currency in terms of another currency. We
       express exchange rates either as the units of country A's currency that need to be traded for a single unit of
       country B's currency (for example, Japanese yen per British pound), or as the inverse (for example, British
       pounds per Japanese yen). We can use two types of exchange rates for this purpose, market exchange rates
       and purchasing power parity (PPP) equivalent exchange rates. Market exchange rates vary on a day-to-day
       basis depending on supply and demand in foreign exchange markets. PPP-equivalent exchange rates provide a
       longer run measure of the exchange rate. For this reason, economists typically use PPP-equivalent exchange
       rates for GDP cross country comparisons. We will discuss exchange rates in more detail in Exchange Rates and
       International Capital Flows. The following Work It Out feature explains how to convert GDP to a common
       currency.

                                                                                                                WORK IT OUT

        Converting GDP to a Common Currency

         Using the exchange rate to convert GDP from one currency to another is straightforward. Say that the task is to
         compare Brazil's GDP in 2020 of 7.4 trillion reals with the U.S. GDP of $20.9 trillion for the same year.
         Step 1. Determine the exchange rate for the specified year. In 2020, the exchange rate was 2.362 reals = $1.
         (These numbers are realistic, but rounded off to simplify the calculations.)
         Step 2. Convert Brazil's GDP into U.S. dollars:

         Step 3. Compare this value to the GDP in the United States in the same year. The U.S. GDP was $20.9 trillion in
         2020, which is almost seven times that of GDP in Brazil.
         Step 4. View Table 19.8 which shows the size of and variety of GDPs of different countries in 2020, all expressed
         in U.S. dollars. We calculate each using the process that we explained above.

GDP Per Capita

The U.S. economy has the largest GDP in the world, by a considerable amount. The United States is also a
populous country; in fact, it is the third largest country by population in the world, although well behind China
and India. Is the U.S. economy larger than other countries just because the United States has more people than
most other countries, or because the U.S. economy is actually larger on a per-person basis? We can answer this
question by calculating a country's GDP per capita; that is, the GDP divided by the population.

The second column of Table 19.9 lists the GDP of the same selection of countries that appeared in the previous
Tracking Real GDP over Time and Table 19.8, showing their GDP as converted into U.S. dollars (which is the
same as the last column of the previous table). The third column gives the population for each country. The
fourth column lists the GDP per capita. We obtain GDP per capita in two steps: First, by multiplying column two
(GDP, in billions of dollars) by 1000 so it has the same units as column three (Population, in millions). Then
divide the result (GDP in millions of dollars) by column three (Population, in millions).

Notice that the rankings by GDP in billions of U.S. dollars, and by GDP per capita, are different than the ranking
of GDP by each country's currency. Measured by its own currency, the rupee, India has a somewhat larger GDP
than Germany. On a per capita basis in U.S. dollars, Germany has more than 9 times India's per capita GDP on
PPP terms.

         CLEAR IT UP

Is China going to surpass the United States in terms of standard of living?

China has the largest GDP in PPP terms: $24 trillion compared to the United States' $21 trillion. But China has a
much larger population so that in per capita terms, its GDP is less than one fourth that of the United States ($17,000
compared to $63,000). The Chinese people are still quite poor relative to the United States and other developed
countries. One caveat: For reasons we will discuss shortly, GDP per capita can give us only a rough idea of the
differences in living standards across countries.

The world's high-income nations--including the United States, Canada, the Western European countries, and
Japan--typically have GDP per capita in the range of $20,000 to $50,000. Middle-income countries, which
include much of Latin America, Eastern Europe, and some countries in East Asia, have GDP per capita in the
range of $6,000 to $12,000. The world's low-income countries, many of them located in Africa and Asia, often
have GDP per capita of less than $2,000 per year.

The level of GDP per capita clearly captures some of what we mean by the phrase "standard of living." Most of
the migration in the world, for example, involves people who are moving from countries with relatively low
GDP per capita to countries with relatively high GDP per capita.

"Standard of living" is a broader term than GDP. While GDP focuses on production that is bought and sold in
markets, standard of living includes all elements that affect people's well-being, whether they are bought and
sold in the market or not. To illuminate the difference between GDP and standard of living, it is useful to spell
out some things that GDP does not cover that are clearly relevant to standard of living.

Limitations of GDP as a Measure of the Standard of Living

GDP measures economic activity, not all activity. As a result, economists like Kate Raworth see it as a
somewhat outdated and limited indication of well-being and prosperity. While GDP measures output of work
done at home, as well as spending on travel, it doesn't capture unpaid work or leisure time. So, two countries
may have equal GDP, but one nation's workers may have an average workday of eight hours, while the other has
an average workday of twelve hours. In that case, is their equal GDP truly measuring the prosperity of those
nations? The GDP per capita of the U.S. economy is larger than the GDP per capita of Germany, as Table 19.9
showed, but does that prove that the standard of living in the United States is higher? Not necessarily, since it
is also true that the average U.S. worker works several hundred hours more per year more than the average
German worker. Calculating GDP does not account for the German worker's extra vacation weeks.

While GDP includes what a country spends on environmental protection, healthcare, and education, it does
not include actual levels of environmental cleanliness, health, and learning. GDP includes the cost of buying
pollution-control equipment, but it does not address whether the air and water are actually cleaner or dirtier.
GDP includes spending on medical care, but does not address whether life expectancy or infant mortality have
risen or fallen. Similarly, it counts spending on education, but does not address directly how much of the
population can read, write, or do basic mathematics.

GDP includes production that is exchanged in the market, but it does not cover production that is not
exchanged in the market. For example, hiring someone to mow your lawn or clean your house is part of GDP,
but doing these tasks yourself is not part of GDP. One remarkable change in the U.S. economy in recent
decades is the growth in women's participation in the labor force. As of 1970, only about 42% of women
participated in the paid labor force. By the second decade of the 2000s, nearly 60% of women participated in
the paid labor force according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. As women are now in the labor force, many of
the services they used to produce in the non-market economy like food preparation and child care have shifted
to some extent into the market economy, which makes the GDP appear larger even if people actually are not
consuming more services. However, as Raworth points out and was explored in the chapter on the labor
market, even women who are fully employed expend significant effort (generally more than men) in raising
children and maintaining a home. Raworth advocates that economic measures include monetized and un-
monetized goods and services, so that the status and contributors to each economy are more accurate.

GDP has nothing to say about the level of inequality in society. GDP per capita is only an average. When GDP
per capita rises by 5%, it could mean that GDP for everyone in the society has risen by 5%, or that GDP of some
groups has risen by more while that of others has risen by less--or even declined. GDP also has nothing in
particular to say about the amount of variety available. If a family buys 100 loaves of bread in a year, GDP does
not care whether they are all white bread, or whether the family can choose from wheat, rye, pumpernickel,
and many others--it just looks at the total amount the family spends on bread.

Likewise, GDP has nothing much to say about what technology and products are available. The standard of
living in, for example, 1950 or 1900 was not affected only by how much money people had--it was also affected
by what they could buy. No matter how much money you had in 1950, you could not buy an iPhone or a
personal computer.

In certain cases, it is not clear that a rise in GDP is even a good thing. If a city is wrecked by a hurricane, and
474 19 · The Macroeconomic Perspective

       then experiences a surge of rebuilding construction activity, it would be peculiar to claim that the hurricane
       was therefore economically beneficial. If people are led by a rising fear of crime, to pay for installing bars and
       burglar alarms on all their windows, it is hard to believe that this increase in GDP has made them better off.
       Similarly, some people would argue that sales of certain goods, like pornography or extremely violent movies,
       do not represent a gain to society's standard of living.

      Does a Rise in GDP Overstate or Understate the Rise in the Standard of Living?

       The fact that GDP per capita does not fully capture the broader idea of standard of living has led to a concern
       that the increases in GDP over time are illusory. It is theoretically possible that while GDP is rising, the
       standard of living could be falling if human health, environmental cleanliness, and other factors that are not
       included in GDP are worsening. Fortunately, this fear appears to be overstated.

       In some ways, the rise in GDP understates the actual rise in the standard of living. For example, the typical
       workweek for a U.S. worker has fallen over the last century from about 60 hours per week to less than 40 hours
       per week. Life expectancy and health have risen dramatically, and so has the average level of education. Since
       1970, the air and water in the United States have generally been getting cleaner. Companies have developed
       new technologies for entertainment, travel, information, and health. A much wider variety of basic products
       like food and clothing is available today than several decades ago. Because GDP does not capture leisure,
       health, a cleaner environment, the possibilities that new technology creates, or an increase in variety, the
       actual rise in the standard of living for Americans in recent decades has exceeded the rise in GDP.

       On the other side, crime rates, traffic congestion levels, and income inequality are higher in the United States
       now than they were in the 1960s. Moreover, a substantial number of services that women primarily provided in
       the non-market economy are now part of the market economy that GDP counts. By ignoring these factors, GDP
       would tend to overstate the true rise in the standard of living.

      GDP is Rough, but Useful

       A high level of GDP should not be the only goal of macroeconomic policy, or government policy more broadly.
       Even though GDP does not measure the broader standard of living with any precision, it does measure
       production well and it does indicate when a country is materially better or worse off in terms of jobs and
       incomes. In most countries, a significantly higher GDP per capita occurs hand in hand with other
       improvements in everyday life along many dimensions, like education, health, and environmental protection.

       No single number can capture all the elements of a term as broad as "standard of living." Nonetheless, GDP per
       capita is a reasonable, rough-and-ready measure of the standard of living.

      How is the Economy Doing? How Does One Tell?

       To determine the state of the economy, one needs to examine economic indicators, such as GDP. To calculate GDP is
       quite an undertaking. It is the broadest measure of a nation's economic activity and we owe a debt to Simon
       Kuznets, the creator of the measurement, for that.

       The sheer size of the U.S. economy as measured by nominal GDP is huge--as of the third quarter of 2021, $23.2
       trillion worth of goods and services were produced annually. During the COVID-19-induced recession, which lasted
       just two months according to NBER and was concentrated across Quarters 1 and 2 of 2020, real GDP dropped

9%--much larger and quicker of a drop than during the previous economic downturn, the Great Recession
(2007-2009). The economy quickly bounced back, and as of Quarter 1 of 2021, real GDP had slightly surpassed the
level it was at prior to the start of the pandemic. These statistics show the severity of the pandemic-induced
recession, and while real GDP fully recovered, there are other ways in which the economy has not. While GDP and
GDP per capita give us a rough estimate of a nation's standard of living, there are many other ways to track the
health of the economy. This chapter is the building block for other chapters that explore more economic indicators
such as unemployment, inflation, or interest rates, and perhaps more importantly, will explain how they are related
and what causes them to rise or fall.

Key Concepts and Summary

19.1 Measuring the Size of the Economy: Gross Domestic Product

Economists generally express the size of a nation's economy as its gross domestic product (GDP), which
measures the value of the output of all goods and services produced within the country in a year. Economists
measure GDP by taking the quantities of all goods and services produced, multiplying them by their prices,
and summing the total. Since GDP measures what is bought and sold in the economy, we can measure it either
by the sum of what is purchased in the economy or what is produced.

We can divide demand into consumption, investment, government, exports, and imports. We can divide what
is produced in the economy into durable goods, nondurable goods, services, structures, and inventories. To
avoid double counting, GDP counts only final output of goods and services, not the production of intermediate
goods or the value of labor in the chain of production.

19.2 Adjusting Nominal Values to Real Values

The nominal value of an economic statistic is the commonly announced value. The real value is the value after
adjusting for changes in inflation. To convert nominal economic data from several different years into real,
inflation-adjusted data, the starting point is to choose a base year arbitrarily and then use a price index to
convert the measurements so that economists measure them in the money prevailing in the base year.

19.3 Tracking Real GDP over Time

Over the long term, U.S. real GDP have increased dramatically. At the same time, GDP has not increased the
same amount each year. The speeding up and slowing down of GDP growth represents the business cycle.
When GDP declines significantly, a recession occurs. A longer and deeper decline is a depression. Recessions
begin at the business cycle's peak and end at the trough.

19.4 Comparing GDP among Countries

Since we measure GDP in a country's currency, in order to compare different countries' GDPs, we need to
convert them to a common currency. One way to do that is with the exchange rate, which is the price of one
country's currency in terms of another. Once we express GDPs in a common currency, we can compare each
country's GDP per capita by dividing GDP by population. Countries with large populations often have large
GDPs, but GDP alone can be a misleading indicator of a nation's wealth. A better measure is GDP per capita.

19.5 How Well GDP Measures the Well-Being of Society

GDP is an indicator of a society's standard of living, but it is only a rough indicator. GDP does not directly take
account of leisure, environmental quality, levels of health and education, activities conducted outside the
market, changes in inequality of income, increases in variety, increases in technology, or the (positive or
negative) value that society may place on certain types of output.

Introduction to Economic Growth

Calories and Economic Growth

On average, humans need about 2,500 calories a day to survive, depending on height, weight, and gender. The
economist Brad DeLong estimates that the average worker in the early 1600s earned wages that could afford him
2,500 food calories. This worker lived in Western Europe. Two hundred years later, that same worker could afford
3,000 food calories. However, between 1800 and 1875, just a time span of just 75 years, economic growth was so
rapid that western European workers could purchase 5,000 food calories a day. By 2012, a low skilled worker in an
affluent Western European/North American country could afford to purchase 2.4 million food calories per day.

What caused such a rapid rise in living standards between 1800 and 1875 and thereafter? Why is it that many
countries, especially those in Western Europe, North America, and parts of East Asia, can feed their populations
more than adequately, while others cannot? We will look at these and other questions as we examine long-run
economic growth.
482 20 · Economic Growth

       Every country worries about economic growth. In the United States and other high-income countries, the
       question is whether economic growth continues to provide the same remarkable gains in our standard of living
       as it did during the twentieth century. Meanwhile, can middle-income countries like Brazil, Egypt, or Poland
       catch up to the higher-income countries, or must they remain in the second tier of per capita income? Of the
       world's population of roughly 7.5 billion people, about 1.1 billion are scraping by on incomes that average less
       than $2 per day, not that different from the standard of living 2,000 years ago. Can the world's poor be lifted
       from their fearful poverty? As the 1995 Nobel laureate in economics, Robert E. Lucas Jr., once noted: "The
       consequences for human welfare involved in questions like these are simply staggering: Once one starts to
       think about them, it is hard to think about anything else."

       Dramatic improvements in a nation's standard of living are possible. After the Korean War in the late 1950s,
       the Republic of Korea, often called South Korea, was one of the poorest economies in the world. Most South
       Koreans worked in peasant agriculture. According to the British economist Angus Maddison, who devoted life's
       work to measuring GDP and population in the world economy, GDP per capita in 1990 international dollars
       was $854 per year. From the 1960s to the early twenty-first century, a time period well within the lifetime and
       memory of many adults, the South Korean economy grew rapidly. Over these four decades, GDP per capita
       increased by more than 6% per year. According to the World Bank, GDP for South Korea now exceeds $30,000
       in nominal terms, placing it firmly among high-income countries like Italy, New Zealand, and Israel. Measured
       by total GDP in 2015, South Korea is the eleventh-largest economy in the world. For a nation of 50 million
       people, this transformation is extraordinary.

       South Korea is a standout example, but it is not the only case of rapid and sustained economic growth. Other
       East Asian nations, like Thailand and Indonesia, have seen very rapid growth as well. China has grown
       enormously since it enacted market-oriented economic reforms around 1980. GDP per capita in high-income
       economies like the United States also has grown dramatically albeit over a longer time frame. Since the Civil
       War, the U.S. economy has transformed from a primarily rural and agricultural economy to an economy based
       on services, manufacturing, and technology.

     20.1 The Relatively Recent Arrival of Economic Growth

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain the conditions that have allowed for modern economic growth in the last two centuries
         · Analyze the influence of public policies on an economy's long-run economic growth

       Let's begin with a brief overview of spectacular economic growth patterns around the world in the last two
       centuries. We commonly refer to this as the period of modern economic growth. (Later in the chapter we will
       discuss lower economic growth rates and some key ingredients for economic progress.) Rapid and sustained
       economic growth is a relatively recent experience for the human race. Before the last two centuries, although
       rulers, nobles, and conquerors could afford some extravagances and although economies rose above the
       subsistence level, the average person's standard of living had not changed much for centuries.

       Progressive, powerful economic and institutional changes started to have a significant effect in the late
       eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. According to the Dutch economic historian Jan Luiten van Zanden,
       slavery-based societies, favorable demographics, global trading routes, and standardized trading institutions
       that spread with different empires set the stage for the Industrial Revolution to succeed. The Industrial
       Revolution refers to the widespread use of power-driven machinery and the economic and social changes that
       resulted in the first half of the 1800s. Ingenious machines--the steam engine, the power loom, and the steam
       locomotive--performed tasks that otherwise would have taken vast numbers of workers to do. The Industrial
       Revolution began in Great Britain, and soon spread to the United States, Germany, and other countries.

       The jobs for ordinary people working with these machines were often dirty and dangerous by modern
       standards, but the alternative jobs of that time in peasant agriculture and small-village industry were often

dirty and dangerous, too. The new jobs of the Industrial Revolution typically offered higher pay and a chance
for social mobility. A self-reinforcing cycle began: New inventions and investments generated profits, the
profits provided funds for more new investment and inventions, and the investments and inventions provided
opportunities for further profits. Slowly, a group of national economies in Europe and North America emerged
from centuries of sluggishness into a period of rapid modern growth. During the last two centuries, the average
GDP growth rate per capita in the leading industrialized countries has been about 2% per year. What were
times like before then? Read the following Clear It Up feature for the answer.

         CLEAR IT UP

What were economic conditions like before 1870?

Angus Maddison, a quantitative economic historian, led the most systematic inquiry into national incomes before
1870. Economists recently have refined and used his methods to compile GDP per capita estimates from year 1 C.E.
to 1348. Table 20.1 is an important counterpoint to most of the narrative in this chapter. It shows that nations can
decline as well as rise. A wide array of forces, such as epidemics, natural and weather-related disasters, the inability
to govern large empires, and the remarkably slow pace of technological and institutional progress explain declines in
income. Institutions are the traditions and laws by which people in a community agree to behave and govern
themselves. Such institutions include marriage, religion, education, and laws of governance. Institutional progress is
the development and codification of these institutions to reinforce social order, and thus, economic growth.

One example of such an institution is the Magna Carta (Great Charter), which the English nobles forced King John to
sign in 1215. The Magna Carta codified the principles of due process, whereby a free man could not be penalized
unless his peers had made a lawful judgment against him. The United States in its own constitution later adopted
this concept. This social order may have contributed to England's GDP per capita in 1348, which was second to that
of northern Italy.

In studying economic growth, a country's institutional framework plays a critical role. Table 20.1 also shows relative
global equality for almost 1,300 years. After this, we begin to see significant divergence in income (not in the table).

Another fascinating and underreported fact is the high levels of income, compared to others at that time, attained by
the Islamic Empire Abbasid Caliphate--which was founded in present-day Iraq in 730 C.E. At its height, the empire
spanned large regions of the Middle East, North Africa, and Spain until its gradual decline over 200 years.
484 20 · Economic Growth

       The Industrial Revolution led to increasing inequality among nations. Some economies took off, whereas
       others, like many of those in Africa or Asia, remained close to a subsistence standard of living. General
       calculations show that the 17 countries of the world with the most-developed economies had, on average, 2.4
       times the GDP per capita of the world's poorest economies in 1870. By 1960, the most developed economies
       had 4.2 times the GDP per capita of the poorest economies.

       However, by the middle of the twentieth century, some countries had shown that catching up was possible.
       Japan's economic growth took off in the 1960s and 1970s, with a growth rate of real GDP per capita averaging
       11% per year during those decades. Certain countries in Latin America experienced a boom in economic
       growth in the 1960s as well. In Brazil, for example, GDP per capita expanded by an average annual rate of
       11.1% from 1968 to 1973. In the 1970s, some East Asian economies, including South Korea, Thailand, and
       Taiwan, saw rapid growth. In these countries, growth rates of 11% to 12% per year in GDP per capita were not
       uncommon. More recently, China, with its population of nearly 1.4 billion people, grew at a per capita rate 9%
       per year from 1984 into the 2000s and still average high rates of growth (more than 5% today). India, with a
       population of 1.4 billion, has shown promising signs of economic growth, with growth in GDP per capita of
       about 4% per year during the 1990s and climbing toward 7% to 8% per year in the 2000s and 2010s.

       These waves of catch-up economic growth have not reached all shores. In certain African countries like Niger,
       Tanzania, and Sudan, for example, GDP per capita at the start of the 2000s was still less than $300, not much
       higher than it was in the nineteenth century and for centuries before that. In the context of the overall situation
       of low-income people around the world, the good economic news from China (population: 1.4 billion) and India
       (population: 1.3 billion) is, nonetheless, astounding and heartening.

       Economic growth in the last two centuries has made a striking change in the human condition. Richard
       Easterlin, an economist at the University of Southern California, wrote in 2000:

             By many measures, a revolution in the human condition is sweeping the world. Most people today are
             better fed, clothed, and housed than their predecessors two centuries ago. They are healthier, live
             longer, and are better educated. Women's lives are less centered on reproduction and political
             democracy has gained a foothold. Although Western Europe and its offshoots have been the leaders of
             this advance, most of the less developed nations have joined in during the 20th century, with the
             newly emerging nations of sub-Saharan Africa the latest to participate. Although the picture is not one
             of universal progress, it is the greatest advance in the human condition of the world's population ever
             achieved in such a brief span of time.

      Rule of Law and Economic Growth

       Economic growth depends on many factors. Key among those factors is adherence to the rule of law and
       protection of property rights and contractual rights by a country's government so that markets can work
       effectively and efficiently. Laws must be clear, public, fair, enforced, and equally applicable to all members of
       society. Property rights, as you might recall from Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities are the
       rights of individuals and firms to own property and use it as they see fit. If you have $100, you have the right to
       use that money, whether you spend it, lend it, or keep it in a jar. It is your property. The definition of property
       includes physical property as well as the right to your training and experience, especially since your training is
       what determines your livelihood. Using this property includes the right to enter into contracts with other
       parties with your property. Individuals or firms must own the property to enter into a contract.

       Contractual rights, then, are based on property rights and they allow individuals to enter into agreements with
       others regarding the use of their property providing recourse through the legal system in the event of

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                         20.2 · Labor Productivity and Economic Growth 485

noncompliance. One example is the employment agreement: a skilled surgeon operates on an ill person and
expects payment. Failure to pay would constitute property theft by the patient. The theft is property the
services that the surgeon provided. In a society with strong property rights and contractual rights, the terms of
the patient-surgeon contract will be fulfilled, because the surgeon would have recourse through the court
system to extract payment from that individual. Without a legal system that enforces contracts, people would
not be likely to enter into contracts for current or future services because of the risk of non-payment. This
would make it difficult to transact business and would slow economic growth.

The World Bank considers a country's legal system effective if it upholds property rights and contractual
rights. The World Bank has developed a ranking system for countries' legal systems based on effective
protection of property rights and rule-based governance using a scale from 1 to 6, with 1 being the lowest and
6 the highest rating. In 2020, the world average ranking was 2.9. The three countries with the lowest ranking of
1.0 were Somalia and Eritrea, with South Sudan at 1.5. Their GDP per capita was $875, $1,625, and $1,234.70
respectively. The World Bank also cites Afghanistan (GDP per capita $2,087.60) as having a low standard of
living, weak government structure, and lack of adherence to the rule of law, which has stymied its economic
growth. The landlocked Central African Republic (GDP per capita $979.60) has poor economic resources as
well as political instability and is a source of children used in human trafficking. Zimbabwe (GDP per capita
$2,895.40) has had declining and often negative growth for much of the period since 1998. Land redistribution
and price controls have disrupted the economy, and corruption and violence have dominated the political
process. Although global economic growth has increased, those countries lacking a clear system of property
rights and an independent court system free from corruption have lagged far behind.

20.2 Labor Productivity and Economic Growth

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Identify the role of labor productivity in promoting economic growth
  · Analyze the sources of economic growth using the aggregate production function
  · Measure an economy's rate of productivity growth
  · Evaluate the power of sustained growth

Sustained long-term economic growth comes from increases in worker productivity, which essentially means
how well we do things. In other words, how efficient is your nation with its time and workers? Labor
productivity is the value that each employed person creates per unit of their input. The easiest way to
comprehend labor productivity is to imagine a Canadian worker who can make 10 loaves of bread in an hour
versus a U.S. worker who in the same hour can make only two loaves of bread. In this fictional example, the
Canadians are more productive. More productivity essentially means you can do more in the same amount of
time. This in turn frees up resources for workers to use elsewhere.

What determines how productive workers are? The answer is pretty intuitive. The first determinant of labor
productivity is human capital. Human capital is the accumulated knowledge (from education and experience),
skills, and expertise that the average worker in an economy possesses. Typically the higher the average level of
education in an economy, the higher the accumulated human capital and the higher the labor productivity.

The second factor that determines labor productivity is technological change. Technological change is a
combination of invention--advances in knowledge--and innovation, which is putting those advances to use in
a new product or service. For example, the transistor was invented in 1947. It allowed us to miniaturize the
footprint of electronic devices and use less power than the tube technology that came before it. Innovations
since then have produced smaller and better transistors that are ubiquitous in products as varied as smart-
phones, computers, and escalators. Developing the transistor has allowed workers to be anywhere with smaller
devices. People can use these devices to communicate with other workers, measure product quality or do any
other task in less time, improving worker productivity.
486 20 · Economic Growth

       The third factor that determines labor productivity is economies of scale. Recall that economies of scale are the
       cost advantages that industries obtain due to size. (Read more about economies of scale in Production, Cost
       and Industry Structure.) Consider again the case of the fictional Canadian worker who could produce 10 loaves
       of bread in an hour. If this difference in productivity was due only to economies of scale, it could be that the
       Canadian worker had access to a large industrial-size oven while the U.S. worker was using a standard
       residential size oven.
       Now that we have explored the determinants of worker productivity, let's turn to how economists measure
       economic growth and productivity.

      Sources of Economic Growth: The Aggregate Production Function

       To analyze the sources of economic growth, it is useful to think about a production function, which is the
       technical relationship by which economic inputs like labor, machinery, and raw materials are turned into
       outputs like goods and services that consumers use. A microeconomic production function describes a firm's
       or perhaps an industry's inputs and outputs. In macroeconomics, we call the connection from inputs to
       outputs for the entire economy an aggregate production function.

      Components of the Aggregate Production Function

       Economists construct different production functions depending on the focus of their studies. Figure 20.2
       presents two examples of aggregate production functions. In the first production function in Figure 20.2 (a),
       the output is GDP. The inputs in this example are workforce, human capital, physical capital, and technology.
       We discuss these inputs further in the module, Components of Economic Growth.

       FIGURE 20.2 Aggregate Production Functions An aggregate production function shows what goes into producing

the output for an overall economy. (a) This aggregate production function has GDP as its output. (b) This aggregate
production function has GDP per capita as its output. Because we calculate it on a per-person basis, we already
figure the labor input into the other factors and we do not need to list it separately.

Measuring Productivity

An economy's rate of productivity growth is closely linked to the growth rate of its GDP per capita, although the
two are not identical. For example, if the percentage of the population who holds jobs in an economy increases,
GDP per capita will increase but the productivity of individual workers may not be affected. Over the long term,
the only way that GDP per capita can grow continually is if the productivity of the average worker rises or if
there are complementary increases in capital.
A common measure of U.S. productivity per worker is dollar value per hour the worker contributes to the
employer's output. This measure excludes government workers, because their output is not sold in the market
and so their productivity is hard to measure. It also excludes farming, which accounts for only a relatively
small share of the U.S. economy. Figure 20.3 shows an index of output per hour, with 2012 as the base year
(when the index equals 100). The index equaled 110.5 in 2020. In 1977, the index equaled about 50, which
shows that workers have more than doubled their productivity since then.

FIGURE 20.3 Output per Hour Worked in the U.S. Economy, 1947-2020 Output per hour worked is a measure of
worker productivity. In the U.S. economy, worker productivity rose more quickly in the 1960s and the mid-1990s
compared with the 1970s and 1980s. However, these growth-rate differences are only a few percentage points per
year. Look carefully to see them in the changing slope of the line. The average U.S. worker produced over twice as
much per hour in 2020 than they did in the 1970s. (Source: U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.)

Rate. The graphed data moves up and down across a zero line indicating change year over year. In 1970, 1974,
1981, 1983, 2008, and 2020, the rate was quite low, as the U.S. was undergoing recessions.
According to the Department of Labor, U.S. productivity growth was fairly strong in the 1950s but then
declined in the 1970s and 1980s before rising again in the second half of the 1990s and the first half of the
2000s. In fact, the rate of productivity measured by the change in output per hour worked averaged 2.8% per

       decreased to 1.4% from 2007 to 2020 Figure 20.4 shows average annual rates of productivity growth averaged
       over time since 1947.

       FIGURE 20.4 Productivity Growth Since 1947 U.S. growth in worker productivity was very high between 1947 and
       1973. It then declined to lower levels in the later 1970s and the 1980s. The late 1990s and early 2000s saw
       productivity rebound, but then productivity sagged a bit between 2001 and 2020. Some think the productivity
       rebound of the late 1990s and early 2000s marks the start of a "new economy" built on higher productivity growth,
       but we cannot determine this until more time has passed. (Source: U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor
       Statistics.)

      The "New Economy" Controversy

       In recent years a controversy has been brewing among economists about the resurgence of U.S. productivity in
       the second half of the 1990s. One school of thought argues that the United States had developed a "new
       economy" based on the extraordinary advances in communications and information technology of the 1990s.
       The most optimistic proponents argue that it would generate higher average productivity growth for decades to
       come. The pessimists, alternatively, argue that even five or ten years of stronger productivity growth does not
       prove that higher productivity will last for the long term. It is hard to infer anything about long-term
       productivity trends during the later part of the 2000s, because the steep 2008-2009 recession, with its sharp
       but not completely synchronized declines in output and employment, complicates any interpretation. While
       productivity growth was high in 2009 and 2010 (around 3%), it has slowed down over the last decade.
       Productivity growth is also closely linked to the average level of wages. Over time, the amount that firms are
       willing to pay workers will depend on the value of the output those workers produce. If a few employers tried to
       pay their workers less than what those workers produced, then those workers would receive offers of higher
       wages from other profit-seeking employers. If a few employers mistakenly paid their workers more than what
       those workers produced, those employers would soon end up with losses. In the long run, productivity per
       hour is the most important determinant of the average wage level in any economy. To learn how to compare
       economies in this regard, follow the steps in the following Work It Out feature.

Comparing the Economies of Two Countries

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) tracks data on the annual growth rate of
real GDP per hour worked. You can find these data on the OECD data webpage "Growth in GDP per capita,
productivity and ULC" at this (http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=PDB_GR) website.

Step 1. Visit the OECD website given above and select two countries to compare.

Step 2. On the drop-down menu "Subject," select " GDP per capita, constant prices," and under "Measure,"
select "Annual growth/change." Then record the data for the countries you have chosen for the five most recent
years.

Step 3. Go back to the drop-down "Subject" menu and select "GDP per hour worked, constant prices," and under
"Measure" again select "Annual growth/change." Select data for the same years for which you selected GDP per
capita data.

Step 4. Compare real GDP growth for both countries. Table 20.2 provides an example of a comparison between
Australia and Belgium.

Australia                   2011 2012 2013 2014 2015

Real GDP/Capita Growth (%)  2.3% 1.5% 1.3% 1.4 0.1%

Real GDP Growth/Hours Worked (%) 1.7% -0.1% 1.4% 2.2% -0.2%

Belgium                     2011 2012 2013 2014 2015

Real GDP/Capita Growth (%)  0.9 -0.6 -0.5 1.2 1.0

Real GDP Growth/Hours Worked (%) -0.5 -0.3 0.4 1.4 0.9

TABLE 20.2

Step 5. For both measures, growth in Australia is greater than growth in Belgium for the first four years. In
addition, there are year-to-year fluctuations. Many factors can affect growth. For example, one factor that may
have contributed to Australia's stronger growth may be its larger inflows of immigrants, who generally contribute
to economic growth.

The Power of Sustained Economic Growth

Nothing is more important for people's standard of living than sustained economic growth. Even small
changes in the rate of growth, when sustained and compounded over long periods of time, make an enormous
difference in the standard of living. Consider Table 20.3, in which the rows of the table show several different
rates of growth in GDP per capita and the columns show different periods of time. Assume for simplicity that
an economy starts with a GDP per capita of 100. The table then applies the following formula to calculate what
GDP will be at the given growth rate in the future:

For example, an economy that starts with a GDP of 100 and grows at 3% per year will reach a GDP of 209 after
25 years; that is, 100 (1.03)25 = 209.

The slowest rate of GDP per capita growth in the table, just 1% per year, is similar to what the United States
490 20 · Economic Growth

experienced during its weakest years of productivity growth. The second highest rate, 3% per year, is close to
what the U.S. economy experienced during the strong economy of the late 1990s and into the 2000s. Higher
rates of per capita growth, such as 5% or 8% per year, represent the experience of rapid growth in economies
like Japan, Korea, and China.

Table 20.3 shows that even a few percentage points of difference in economic growth rates will have a
profound effect if sustained and compounded over time. For example, an economy growing at a 1% annual rate
over 50 years will see its GDP per capita rise by a total of 64%, from 100 to 164 in this example. However, a
country growing at a 5% annual rate will see (almost) the same amount of growth--from 100 to 163--over just
10 years. Rapid rates of economic growth can bring profound transformation. (See the following Clear It Up
feature on the relationship between compound growth rates and compound interest rates.) If the rate of growth
is 8%, young adults starting at age 20 will see the average standard of living in their country more than double
by the time they reach age 30, and grow more than sixfold by the time they reach age 45.

TABLE 20.3 Growth of GDP over Different Time Horizons

         CLEAR IT UP

How are compound growth rates and compound interest rates related?

The formula for GDP growth rates over different periods of time, as Figure 20.3 shows, is exactly the same as the
formula for how a given amount of financial savings grows at a certain interest rate over time, as presented in Choice
in a World of Scarcity. Both formulas have the same ingredients:

  · an original starting amount, in one case GDP and in the other case an amount of financial saving;
  · a percentage increase over time, in one case the GDP growth rate and in the other case an interest rate;
  · and an amount of time over which this effect happens.

Recall that compound interest is interest that is earned on past interest. It causes the total amount of financial
savings to grow dramatically over time. Similarly, compound rates of economic growth, or the compound growth
rate, means that we multiply the rate of growth by a base that includes past GDP growth, with dramatic effects over
time.

For example, in 2020, the Central Intelligence Agency's World Fact Book reported that South Korea had a GDP of
$2.2 trillion. With a growth rate of 2.8% per year, South Korea's GDP will be $2.5 trillion in five years. If we apply the
growth rate to each year's ending GDP for the next five years, we will calculate that at the end of year one, GDP is
$2.3 trillion. In year two, we start with the end-of-year one value of $2.3 trillion and increase it by 2.8%. Year three
starts with the end-of-year two GDP, and we increase it by 2.8% and so on, as Table 20.4 depicts.

5  $2.5 Trillion × (1+0.028)  $2.50 Trillion

TABLE 20.4

Another way to calculate the growth rate is to apply the following formula:

Where "future value" is the value of GDP five years hence, "present value" is the starting GDP amount of $2.2
trillion, "g" is the growth rate of 2.8%, and "n" is the number of periods for which we are calculating growth.

20.3 Components of Economic Growth

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Discuss the components of economic growth, including physical capital, human capital, and technology
  · Explain capital deepening and its significance
  · Analyze the methods employed in economic growth accounting studies
  · Identify factors that contribute to a healthy climate for economic growth

Over decades and generations, seemingly small differences of a few percentage points in the annual rate of
economic growth make an enormous difference in GDP per capita. In this module, we discuss some of the
components of economic growth, including physical capital, human capital, and technology.

The category of physical capital includes the plant and equipment that firms use as well as things like roads
(also called infrastructure). Again, greater physical capital implies more output. Physical capital can affect
productivity in two ways: (1) an increase in the quantity of physical capital (for example, more computers of
the same quality); and (2) an increase in the quality of physical capital (same number of computers but the
computers are faster, and so on). Human capital refers to the skills and knowledge that make workers
productive. Human capital and physical capital accumulation are similar: In both cases, investment now pays
off in higher productivity in the future.

The category of technology is the "joker in the deck." Earlier we described it as the combination of invention
and innovation. When most people think of new technology, the invention of new products like the laser, the
smartphone, or some new wonder drug come to mind. In food production, developing more drought-resistant
seeds is another example of technology. Technology, as economists use the term, however, includes still more.
It includes new ways of organizing work, like the invention of the assembly line, new methods for ensuring
better quality of output in factories, and innovative institutions that facilitate the process of converting inputs
into output. In short, technology comprises all the advances that make the existing machines and other inputs
produce more, and at higher quality, as well as altogether new products.

It may not make sense to compare the GDPs of China and say, Benin, simply because of the great difference in
population size. To understand economic growth, which is really concerned with the growth in living
492 20 · Economic Growth

       standards of an average person, it is often useful to focus on GDP per capita. Using GDP per capita also makes
       it easier to compare countries with smaller numbers of people, like Belgium, Uruguay, or Zimbabwe, with
       countries that have larger populations, like the United States, the Russian Federation, or Nigeria.
       To obtain a per capita production function, divide each input in Figure 20.2(a) by the population. This creates a
       second aggregate production function where the output is GDP per capita (that is, GDP divided by population).
       The inputs are the average level of human capital per person, the average level of physical capital per person,
       and the level of technology per person--see Figure 20.2(b). The result of having population in the denominator
       is mathematically appealing. Increases in population lower per capita income. However, increasing population
       is important for the average person only if the rate of income growth exceeds population growth. A more
       important reason for constructing a per capita production function is to understand the contribution of human
       and physical capital.

      Capital Deepening

       When society increases the level of capital per person, we call the result capital deepening. The idea of capital
       deepening can apply both to additional human capital per worker and to additional physical capital per
       worker.
       Recall that one way to measure human capital is to look at the average levels of education in an economy.
       Figure 20.5 illustrates the human capital deepening for U.S. workers by showing that the proportion of the U.S.
       population with a high school and a college degree is rising. As recently as 1970, for example, only about half of
       U.S. adults had at least a high school diploma. By the start of the twenty-first century, more than 80% of adults
       had graduated from high school. The idea of human capital deepening also applies to the years of experience
       that workers have, but the average experience level of U.S. workers has not changed much in recent decades.
       Thus, the key dimension for deepening human capital in the U.S. economy focuses more on additional
       education and training than on a higher average level of work experience.

       FIGURE 20.5 Human Capital Deepening in the U.S. Rising levels of education for persons 25 and older show the
       deepening of human capital in the U.S. economy. Even today, under one-third of U.S. adults have completed a four-
       year college degree. There is clearly room for additional deepening of human capital to occur. (Source: Penn World
       Tables, 10.0 https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/productivity/pwt/?lang=en)
       Figure 20.6 shows physical capital deepening in the U.S. economy. The average U.S. worker in the late 2000s
       was working with physical capital worth almost three times as much as that of the average worker of the early

         Access for free at openstax.org
        20.3 · Components of Economic Growth 493

1950s.

FIGURE 20.6 Physical Capital per Worker in the United States The value of the physical capital, measured by plant
and equipment, used by the average worker in the U.S. economy has risen over the decades. The increase may have
leveled off a bit in the 1970s and 1980s, which were, not coincidentally, times of slower-than-usual growth in
worker productivity. We see a renewed increase in physical capital per worker in the late 1990s, followed by a
flattening in the early 2000s. (Source: Center for International Comparisons of Production, Income and Prices,
University of Pennsylvania)

Not only does the current U.S. economy have better-educated workers with more and improved physical
capital than it did several decades ago, but these workers have access to more advanced technologies. Growth
in technology is impossible to measure with a simple line on a graph, but evidence that we live in an age of
technological marvels is all around us--discoveries in genetics and in the structure of particles, the wireless
internet, and other inventions almost too numerous to count. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office typically
has issued more than 150,000 patents annually in recent years.

This recipe for economic growth--investing in labor productivity, with investments in human capital and
technology, as well as increasing physical capital--also applies to other economies. South Korea, for example,
already achieved universal enrollment in primary school (the equivalent of kindergarten through sixth grade
in the United States) by 1965, when Korea's GDP per capita was still near its rock bottom low. By the late 1980s,
Korea had achieved almost universal secondary school education (the equivalent of a high school education in
the United States). With regard to physical capital, Korea's rates of investment had been about 15% of GDP at
the start of the 1960s, but doubled to 30-35% of GDP by the late 1960s and early 1970s. With regard to
technology, South Korean students went to universities and colleges around the world to obtain scientific and
technical training, and South Korean firms reached out to study and form partnerships with firms that could
offer them technological insights. These factors combined to foster South Korea's high rate of economic
growth.

Growth Accounting Studies

Since the late 1950s, economists have conducted growth accounting studies to determine the extent to which
494 20 · Economic Growth

       physical and human capital deepening and technology have contributed to growth. The usual approach uses
       an aggregate production function to estimate how much of per capita economic growth can be attributed to
       growth in physical capital and human capital. We can measure these two inputs at least roughly. The part of
       growth that is unexplained by measured inputs, called the residual, is then attributed to growth in technology.
       The exact numerical estimates differ from study to study and from country to country, depending on how
       researchers measured these three main factors and over what time horizons. For studies of the U.S. economy,
       three lessons commonly emerge from growth accounting studies.

       First, technology is typically the most important contributor to U.S. economic growth. Growth in human capital
       and physical capital often explains only half or less than half of the economic growth that occurs. New ways of
       doing things are tremendously important.

       Second, while investment in physical capital is essential to growth in labor productivity and GDP per capita,
       building human capital is at least as important. Economic growth is not just a matter of more machines and
       buildings. One vivid example of the power of human capital and technological knowledge occurred in Europe
       in the years after World War II (1939-1945). During the war, a large share of Europe's physical capital, such as
       factories, roads, and vehicles, was destroyed. Europe also lost an overwhelming amount of human capital in
       the form of millions of men, women, and children who died during the war. However, the powerful
       combination of skilled workers and technological knowledge, working within a market-oriented economic
       framework, rebuilt Europe's productive capacity to an even higher level within less than two decades.

       A third lesson is that these three factors of human capital, physical capital, and technology work together.
       Workers with a higher level of education and skills are often better at coming up with new technological
       innovations. These technological innovations are often ideas that cannot increase production until they
       become a part of new investment in physical capital. New machines that embody technological innovations
       often require additional training, which builds worker skills further. If the recipe for economic growth is to
       succeed, an economy needs all the ingredients of the aggregate production function. See the following Clear It
       Up feature for an example of how human capital, physical capital, and technology can combine to significantly
       impact lives.

      How do girls' education and economic growth relate in low-income countries?

       In the early 2000s, according to the World Bank, about 110 million children between the ages of 6 and 11 were not
       in school--and about two-thirds of them were girls. In Afghanistan, for example, the literacy rate for those aged
       15-24 for the period 2005-2014 was 62% for males and only 32% for females. In Benin, in West Africa, it was 55%
       for males and 31% for females. In Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, it was 76% for males and 58 percent for
       females.

       Whenever any child does not receive a basic education, it is both a human and an economic loss. In low-income
       countries, wages typically increase by an average of 10 to 20% with each additional year of education. There is,
       however, some intriguing evidence that helping girls in low-income countries to close the education gap with boys
       may be especially important, because of the social role that many of the girls will play as mothers and homemakers.

       Girls in low-income countries who receive more education tend to grow up to have fewer, healthier, better-educated
       children. Their children are more likely to be better nourished and to receive basic health care like immunizations.
       Economic research on women in low-income economies backs up these findings. When 20 women obtain one
       additional year of schooling, as a group they will, on average, have one less child. When 1,000 women obtain one
       additional year of schooling, on average one to two fewer women from that group will die in childbirth. When a
       woman stays in school an additional year, that factor alone means that, on average, each of her children will spend
       an additional half-year in school. Education for girls is a good investment because it is an investment in economic
       growth with benefits beyond the current generation.

A Healthy Climate for Economic Growth

While physical and human capital deepening and better technology are important, equally important to a
nation's well-being is the climate or system within which these inputs are cultivated. Both the type of market
economy and a legal system that governs and sustains property rights and contractual rights are important
contributors to a healthy economic climate.

A healthy economic climate usually involves some sort of market orientation at the microeconomic, individual,
or firm decision-making level. Markets that allow personal and business rewards and incentives for increasing
human and physical capital encourage overall macroeconomic growth. For example, when workers participate
in a competitive and well-functioning labor market, they have an incentive to acquire additional human
capital, because additional education and skills will pay off in higher wages. Firms have an incentive to invest
in physical capital and in training workers, because they expect to earn higher profits for their shareholders.
Both individuals and firms look for new technologies, because even small inventions can make work easier or
lead to product improvement. Collectively, such individual and business decisions made within a market
structure add up to macroeconomic growth. Much of the rapid growth since the late nineteenth century has
come from harnessing the power of competitive markets to allocate resources. This market orientation
typically reaches beyond national borders and includes openness to international trade.

A general orientation toward markets does not rule out important roles for government. There are times when
markets fail to allocate capital or technology in a manner that provides the greatest benefit for society as a
whole. The government's role is to correct these failures. In addition, government can guide or influence
markets toward certain outcomes. The following examples highlight some important areas that governments
around the world have chosen to invest in to facilitate capital deepening and technology:

  · Education. The Danish government requires all children under 16 to attend school. They can choose to
     attend a public school (Folkeskole) or a private school. Students do not pay tuition to attend Folkeskole.
      Thirteen percent of primary/secondary (elementary/high) school is private, and the government supplies
      vouchers to citizens who choose private school.

  · Savings and Investment. In the United States, as in other countries, the government taxes gains from
      private investment. Low capital gains taxes encourage investment and so also economic growth.

  · Infrastructure. The Japanese government in the mid-1990s undertook significant infrastructure projects
      to improve roads and public works. This in turn increased the stock of physical capital and ultimately
      economic growth.

  · Special Economic Zones. The island of Mauritius is one of the few African nations to encourage
      international trade in government-supported special economic zones (SEZ). These are areas of the
      country, usually with access to a port where, among other benefits, the government does not tax trade. As a
      result of its SEZ, Mauritius has enjoyed above-average economic growth since the 1980s. Free trade does
      not have to occur in an SEZ however. Governments can encourage international trade across the board, or
      surrender to protectionism.

  · Scientific Research. The European Union has strong programs to invest in scientific research. The
      researchers Abraham García and Pierre Mohnen demonstrate that firms which received support from the
      Austrian government actually increased their research intensity and had more sales. Governments can
      support scientific research and technical training that helps to create and spread new technologies.
      Governments can also provide a legal environment that protects the ability of inventors to profit from their
      inventions.

There are many more ways in which the government can play an active role in promoting economic growth.
We explore them in other chapters and in particular in Macroeconomic Policy Around the World. A healthy
climate for growth in GDP per capita and labor productivity includes human capital deepening, physical
capital deepening, and technological gains, operating in a market-oriented economy with supportive
government policies.

20.4 Economic Convergence

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Explain economic convergence
  · Analyze various arguments for and against economic convergence
  · Evaluate the speed of economic convergence between high-income countries and the rest of the world

Some low-income and middle-income economies around the world have shown a pattern of convergence, in
which their economies grow faster than those of high-income countries. GDP increased by an average rate of
2.7% per year in the 1990s and 1.7% per year from 2010 to 2019 in the high-income countries of the world,
which include the United States, Canada, the European Union countries, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand.

Table 20.5 lists eight countries that belong to an informal "fast growth club." These countries averaged GDP
growth (after adjusting for inflation) of at least 5% per year in both the time periods from 1990 to 2000 and
from 2010 to 2019. Since economic growth in these countries has exceeded the average of the world's high-
income economies, these countries may converge with the high-income countries. The second part of Table
20.5 lists the "slow growth club," which consists of countries that averaged GDP growth of 2% per year or less
(after adjusting for inflation) during the same time periods. The final portion of Table 20.5 shows GDP growth
rates for the countries of the world divided by income. (Note that the reason there is no data for 2001-2009 is
because of the Great Recession, which lasted from 2007-2009. Many country's GDP shrank during these
years.)

TABLE 20.5 Economic Growth around the World (Source: http://databank.worldbank.org/data/views/
variableSelection/selectvariables.aspx?source=world-development-indicators#c_u)

Each of the countries in Table 20.5 has its own unique story of investments in human and physical capital,
technological gains, market forces, government policies, and even lucky events, but an overall pattern of
convergence is clear. The low-income countries have GDP growth that is faster than that of the middle-income
countries, which in turn have GDP growth that is faster than that of the high-income countries. Two prominent
members of the fast-growth club are China and India, which between them have nearly 40% of the world's
population. Some prominent members of the slow-growth club are high-income countries like France,
Germany, Italy, and Japan.

Will this pattern of economic convergence persist into the future? This is a controversial question among
economists that we will consider by looking at some of the main arguments on both sides.

Arguments Favoring Convergence

Several arguments suggest that low-income countries might have an advantage in achieving greater worker
productivity and economic growth in the future.

A first argument is based on diminishing marginal returns. Even though deepening human and physical
capital will tend to increase GDP per capita, the law of diminishing returns suggests that as an economy
continues to increase its human and physical capital, the marginal gains to economic growth will diminish. For
example, raising the average education level of the population by two years from a tenth-grade level to a high
school diploma (while holding all other inputs constant) would produce a certain increase in output. An
additional two-year increase, so that the average person had a two-year college degree, would increase output
further, but the marginal gain would be smaller. Yet another additional two-year increase in the level of
education, so that the average person would have a four-year-college bachelor's degree, would increase output
still further, but the marginal increase would again be smaller. A similar lesson holds for physical capital. If the
quantity of physical capital available to the average worker increases, by, say, $5,000 to $10,000 (again, while
holding all other inputs constant), it will increase the level of output. An additional increase from $10,000 to
498 20 · Economic Growth

       $15,000 will increase output further, but the marginal increase will be smaller.
       Low-income countries like China and India tend to have lower levels of human capital and physical capital, so
       an investment in capital deepening should have a larger marginal effect in these countries than in high-
       income countries, where levels of human and physical capital are already relatively high. Diminishing returns
       implies that low-income economies could converge to the levels that the high-income countries achieve.
       A second argument is that low-income countries may find it easier to improve their technologies than high-
       income countries. High-income countries must continually invent new technologies, whereas low-income
       countries can often find ways of applying technology that has already been invented and is well understood.
       The economist Alexander Gerschenkron (1904-1978) gave this phenomenon a memorable name: "the
       advantages of backwardness." Of course, he did not literally mean that it is an advantage to have a lower
       standard of living. He was pointing out that a country that is behind has some extra potential for catching up.
       Finally, optimists argue that many countries have observed the experience of those that have grown more
       quickly and have learned from it. Moreover, once the people of a country begin to enjoy the benefits of a higher
       standard of living, they may be more likely to build and support the market-friendly institutions that will help
       provide this standard of living.

      Arguments That Convergence Is neither Inevitable nor Likely

       If the economy's growth depended only on the deepening of human capital and physical capital, then we would
       expect that economy's growth rate to slow down over the long run because of diminishing marginal returns.
       However, there is another crucial factor in the aggregate production function: technology.
       Developing new technology can provide a way for an economy to sidestep the diminishing marginal returns of
       capital deepening. Figure 20.7 shows how. The figure's horizontal axis measures the amount of capital
       deepening, which on this figure is an overall measure that includes deepening of both physical and human
       capital. The amount of human and physical capital per worker increases as you move from left to right, from
       C1 to C2 to C3. The diagram's vertical axis measures per capita output. Start by considering the lowest line in
       this diagram, labeled Technology 1. Along this aggregate production function, the level of technology is held
       constant, so the line shows only the relationship between capital deepening and output. As capital deepens
       from C1 to C2 to C3 and the economy moves from R to U to W, per capita output does increase--but the way in
       which the line starts out steeper on the left but then flattens as it moves to the right shows the diminishing
       marginal returns, as additional marginal amounts of capital deepening increase output by ever-smaller
       amounts. The shape of the aggregate production line (Technology 1) shows that the ability of capital
       deepening, by itself, to generate sustained economic growth is limited, since diminishing returns will
       eventually set in.

FIGURE 20.7 Capital Deepening and New Technology Imagine that the economy starts at point R, with the level of
physical and human capital C1 and the output per capita at G1. If the economy relies only on capital deepening,
while remaining at the technology level shown by the Technology 1 line, then it would face diminishing marginal
returns as it moved from point R to point U to point W. However, now imagine that capital deepening is combined
with improvements in technology. Then, as capital deepens from C1 to C2, technology improves from Technology 1
to Technology 2, and the economy moves from R to S. Similarly, as capital deepens from C2 to C3, technology
increases from Technology 2 to Technology 3, and the economy moves from S to T. With improvements in
technology, there is no longer any reason that economic growth must necessarily slow down.
Now, bring improvements in technology into the picture. Improved technology means that with a given set of
inputs, more output is possible. The production function labeled Technology 1 in the figure is based on one
level of technology, but Technology 2 is based on an improved level of technology, so for every level of capital
deepening on the horizontal axis, it produces a higher level of output on the vertical axis. In turn, production
function Technology 3 represents a still higher level of technology, so that for every level of inputs on the
horizontal axis, it produces a higher level of output on the vertical axis than either of the other two aggregate
production functions.
Most healthy, growing economies are deepening their human and physical capital and increasing technology
at the same time. As a result, the economy can move from a choice like point R on the Technology 1 aggregate
production line to a point like S on Technology 2 and a point like T on the still higher aggregate production line
(Technology 3). With the combination of technology and capital deepening, the rise in GDP per capita in high-
income countries does not need to fade away because of diminishing returns. The gains from technology can
offset the diminishing returns involved with capital deepening.
Will technological improvements themselves run into diminishing returns over time? That is, will it become
continually harder and more costly to discover new technological improvements? Perhaps someday, but, at
least over the last two centuries since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, improvements in technology
have not run into diminishing marginal returns. Modern inventions, like the internet or discoveries in genetics
or materials science, do not seem to provide smaller gains to output than earlier inventions like the steam
engine or the railroad. One reason that technological ideas do not seem to run into diminishing returns is that
we often can apply widely the ideas of new technology at a marginal cost that is very low or even zero. A
specific worker or group of workers must use a specific additional machine, or an additional year of education.
Many workers across the economy can use a new technology or invention at very low marginal cost.
The argument that it is easier for a low-income country to copy and adapt existing technology than it is for a
high-income country to invent new technology is not necessarily true, either. When it comes to adapting and
using new technology, a society's performance is not necessarily guaranteed, but is the result of whether the
country's economic, educational, and public policy institutions are supportive. In theory, perhaps, low-income
countries have many opportunities to copy and adapt technology, but if they lack the appropriate supportive
economic infrastructure and institutions, the theoretical possibility that backwardness might have certain
advantages is of little practical relevance.

      The Slowness of Convergence

       Although economic convergence between the high-income countries and the rest of the world seems possible
       and even likely, it will proceed slowly. Consider, for example, a country that starts off with a GDP per capita of
       $40,000, which would roughly represent a typical high-income country today, and another country that starts
       out at $4,000, which is roughly the level in low-income but not impoverished countries like Indonesia,
       Guatemala, or Egypt. Say that the rich country chugs along at a 2% annual growth rate of GDP per capita, while
       the poorer country grows at the aggressive rate of 7% per year. After 30 years, GDP per capita in the rich
       country will be $72,450 (that is, $40,000 (1 + 0.02)30) while in the poor country it will be $30,450 (that is,
       $4,000 (1 + 0.07)30). Convergence has occurred. The rich country used to be 10 times as wealthy as the poor
       one, and now it is only about 2.4 times as wealthy. Even after 30 consecutive years of very rapid growth,
       however, people in the low-income country are still likely to feel quite poor compared to people in the rich
       country. Moreover, as the poor country catches up, its opportunities for catch-up growth are reduced, and its
       growth rate may slow down somewhat.

       The slowness of convergence illustrates again that small differences in annual rates of economic growth
       become huge differences over time. The high-income countries have been building up their advantage in
       standard of living over decades--more than a century in some cases. Even in an optimistic scenario, it will take
       decades for the low-income countries of the world to catch up significantly.

      Calories and Economic Growth

       We can tell the story of modern economic growth by looking at calorie consumption over time. The dramatic rise in
       incomes allowed the average person to eat better and consume more calories. How did these incomes increase?
       The neoclassical growth consensus uses the aggregate production function to suggest that the period of modern
       economic growth came about because of increases in inputs such as technology and physical and human capital.
       Also important was the way in which technological progress combined with physical and human capital deepening
       to create growth and convergence. The issue of distribution of income notwithstanding, it is clear that the average
       worker can afford more calories in 2020 than in 1875.

       Aside from increases in income, there is another reason why the average person can afford more food. Modern
       agriculture has allowed many countries to produce more food than they need. Despite having more than enough
       food, however, many governments and multilateral agencies have not solved the food distribution problem. In fact,
       food shortages, famine, or general food insecurity are caused more often by the failure of government
       macroeconomic policy, according to the Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen. Sen has conducted extensive
       research into issues of inequality, poverty, and the role of government in improving standards of living.
       Macroeconomic policies that strive toward stable inflation, full employment, education of women, and preservation
       of property rights are more likely to eliminate starvation and provide for a more even distribution of food.

       Because we have more food per capita, global food prices have decreased since 1875. The prices of some foods,
       however, have decreased more than the prices of others. For example, researchers from the University of
       Washington have shown that in the United States, calories from zucchini and lettuce are 100 times more expensive
       than calories from oil, butter, and sugar. Research from countries like India, China, and the United States suggests
       that as incomes rise, individuals want more calories from fats and protein and fewer from carbohydrates. This has
       very interesting implications for global food production, obesity, and environmental consequences. Affluent urban
       India has an obesity problem much like many parts of the United States. The forces of convergence are at work.

Key Concepts and Summary

20.1 The Relatively Recent Arrival of Economic Growth

Since the early nineteenth century, there has been a spectacular process of long-run economic growth during
which the world's leading economies--mostly those in Western Europe and North America--expanded GDP per
capita at an average rate of about 2% per year. In the last half-century, countries like Japan, South Korea, and
China have shown the potential to catch up. The Industrial Revolution facilitated the extensive process of
economic growth, that economists often refer to as modern economic growth. This increased worker
productivity and trade, as well as the development of governance and market institutions.

20.2 Labor Productivity and Economic Growth

We can measure productivity, the value of what is produced per worker, or per hour worked, as the level of GDP
per worker or GDP per hour. The United States experienced a productivity slowdown between 1973 and 1989.
Since then, U.S. productivity has rebounded for the most part, but annual growth in productivity in the
nonfarm business sector has been less than one percent each year between 2011 and 2016. It is not clear what
productivity growth will be in the coming years. The rate of productivity growth is the primary determinant of
an economy's rate of long-term economic growth and higher wages. Over decades and generations, seemingly
small differences of a few percentage points in the annual rate of economic growth make an enormous
difference in GDP per capita. An aggregate production function specifies how certain inputs in the economy,
like human capital, physical capital, and technology, lead to the output measured as GDP per capita.
502 20 · Self-Check Questions

Compound interest and compound growth rates behave in the same way as productivity rates. Seemingly
small changes in percentage points can have big impacts on income over time.

20.3 Components of Economic Growth

Over decades and generations, seemingly small differences of a few percentage points in the annual rate of
economic growth make an enormous difference in GDP per capita. Capital deepening refers to an increase in
the amount of capital per worker, either human capital per worker, in the form of higher education or skills, or
physical capital per worker. Technology, in its economic meaning, refers broadly to all new methods of
production, which includes major scientific inventions but also small inventions and even better forms of
management or other types of institutions. A healthy climate for growth in GDP per capita consists of
improvements in human capital, physical capital, and technology, in a market-oriented environment with
supportive public policies and institutions.

20.4 Economic Convergence

When countries with lower GDP levels per capita catch up to countries with higher GDP levels per capita, we
call the process convergence. Convergence can occur even when both high- and low-income countries increase
investment in physical and human capital with the objective of growing GDP. This is because the impact of new
investment in physical and human capital on a low-income country may result in huge gains as new skills or
equipment combine with the labor force. In higher-income countries, however, a level of investment equal to
that of the low income country is not likely to have as big an impact, because the more developed country most
likely already has high levels of capital investment. Therefore, the marginal gain from this additional
investment tends to be successively less and less. Higher income countries are more likely to have diminishing
returns to their investments and must continually invent new technologies. This allows lower-income
economies to have a chance for convergent growth. However, many high-income economies have developed
economic and political institutions that provide a healthy economic climate for an ongoing stream of
technological innovations. Continuous technological innovation can counterbalance diminishing returns to
investments in human and physical capital.

      Mexico. If the productivity of U.S. workers grows at 2% for 25 years and the productivity of Mexico's
      workers grows at 6% for 25 years, which country will have higher worker productivity at that point?

Unemployment and the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Complicated Story

It was the most abrupt economic change in the post-World War II era. Between March 2020 and April 2020, the
U.S. unemployment rate increased from 4.4% to 14.8%. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of people
were left without work as businesses shut down and people stayed home and cut their spending, especially on
restaurants, tourism, and travel. As confidence and spending were slowly restored, and as the situation with the
virus steadily improved, unemployment began to tick down. By 2022, with the availability of vaccines and boosters
and other improved health measures, things were better still, but the presence of dangerous variants prevented a
full return to normal.
506 21 · Unemployment

       The COVID-19 pandemic had other effects on the labor market as well. Labor force participation--the rate at which
       people are employed or actively searching for work--declined and as of early-2022 remained lower than it was in
       2019. Some were forced to stop working because of school and childcare closures. Others were concerned about
       how safe their workplaces would be in the middle of a global pandemic. And still others simply chose to retire early.
       Labor force participation remains a sore spot in the labor market's recovery.

       These two statistics--unemployment and labor force participation--show how complicated the labor market can be.
       As the unemployment rate declined through 2021, the disappointing statistics on labor force participation show
       weak points. One day you may have read a headline about how easy it was to find a job, and the next day a headline
       would describe how difficult it was for employers to find workers. By the end of this chapter, you will be in a much
       better position to make sense of these events.

       Unemployment can be a terrible and wrenching life experience--like a serious automobile accident or a messy
       divorce--whose consequences only someone who has gone through it can fully understand. For unemployed
       individuals and their families, there is the day-to-day financial stress of not knowing from where the next
       paycheck is coming. There are painful adjustments, like watching your savings account dwindle, selling a car
       and buying a cheaper one, or moving to a less expensive place to live. Even when the unemployed person finds
       a new job, it may pay less than the previous one. For many people, their job is an important part of their self
       worth. When unemployment separates people from the workforce, it can affect family relationships as well as
       mental and physical health.

       The human costs of unemployment alone would justify making a low level of unemployment an important
       public policy priority. However, unemployment also includes economic costs to the broader society. When
       millions of unemployed but willing workers cannot find jobs, economic resource are unused. An economy with
       high unemployment is like a company operating with a functional but unused factory. The opportunity cost of
       unemployment is the output that the unemployed workers could have produced.

       This chapter will discuss how economists define and compute the unemployment rate. It will examine the
       patterns of unemployment over time, for the U.S. economy as a whole, for different demographic groups in the
       U.S. economy, and for other countries. It will then consider an economic explanation for unemployment, and
       how it explains the patterns of unemployment and suggests public policies for reducing it.

     21.1 How Economists Define and Compute Unemployment Rate

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Calculate the labor force participation rate and the unemployment rate
         · Explain hidden unemployment and what it means to be in or out of the labor force
         · Evaluate the collection and interpretation of unemployment data

       Newspaper or television reports typically describe unemployment as a percentage or a rate. A recent report
       might have said, for example, from September 2021 to October 2021, the U.S. unemployment rate declined
       from 4.8% to 4.6%. At a glance, the changes between the percentages may seem small. However, remember
       that the U.S. economy has about 162 million adults (as of the beginning of 2022) who either have jobs or are
       looking for them. A rise or fall of just 0.1% in the unemployment rate of 162 million potential workers
       translates into 160,000 people, which is roughly the total population of a city like Syracuse, New York,
       Brownsville, Texas, or Pasadena, California. Large rises in the unemployment rate mean large numbers of job
       losses. In April 2020, at the peak of the pandemic-induced recession, over 20 million people were out of work.
       Even with the unemployment rate at 4.2% in November 2021, about 7 million people who were looking for jobs
       were out of work.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (http://openstax.org/l/BLS1) tracks and reports all data related to
unemployment.

Who's In or Out of the Labor Force?

Should we count everyone without a job as unemployed? Of course not. For example, we should not count
children as unemployed. Surely, we should not count the retired as unemployed. Many full-time college
students have only a part-time job, or no job at all, but it seems inappropriate to count them as suffering the
pains of unemployment. Some people are not working because they are rearing children, ill, on vacation, or on
parental leave.

The point is that we do not just divide the adult population into employed and unemployed. A third group
exists: people who do not have a job, and for some reason--retirement, looking after children, taking a
voluntary break before a new job--are not interested in having a job, either. It also includes those who do want
a job but have quit looking, often due to discouragement due to their inability to find suitable employment.
Economists refer to this third group of those who are not working and not looking for work as out of the labor
force or not in the labor force.

The U.S. unemployment rate, which is based on a monthly survey carried out by the U.S. Bureau of the Census,
asks a series of questions to divide the adult population into employed, unemployed, or not in the labor force.
To be classified as unemployed, a person must be without a job, currently available to work, and actively
looking for work in the previous four weeks. Thus, a person who does not have a job but who is not currently
available to work or has not actively looked for work in the last four weeks is counted as out of the labor force.

Employed: currently working for pay

Unemployed: Out of work and actively looking for a job

Out of the labor force: Out of paid work and not actively looking for a job

Labor force: the number of employed plus the unemployed

Calculating the Unemployment Rate

Figure 21.2 shows the three-way division of the 16-and-over population. In November 2021, about 61.8% of
the adult population was "in the labor force"; that is, people are either employed or without a job but looking
for work. We can divide those in the labor force into the employed and the unemployed. Table 21.1 shows those
values. The unemployment rate is not the percentage of the total adult population without jobs, but rather the
percentage of adults who are in the labor force but who do not have jobs:
508 21 · Unemployment

FIGURE 21.2 Employed, Unemployed, and Out of the Labor Force Distribution of Adult Population (age 16 and
older), November 2021 The total adult, working-age population in November 2021 was 262.029 million. Out of this
total population, 155.175 million were classified as employed, and 6.877 million were classified as unemployed.
The remaining 99.977 million were classified as out of the labor force. As you will learn, however, this seemingly
simple chart does not tell the whole story. As you will learn, however, this seemingly simple chart does not tell the

                       (Source: https://data.bls.gov)

In this example, we can calculate the unemployment rate as 6.877 million unemployed people divided by
162.052 million people in the labor force, which works out to a 4.2% rate of unemployment. The following
Work It Out feature will walk you through the steps of this calculation.

 Calculating Labor Force Percentages

  How do economists arrive at the percentages in and out of the labor force and the unemployment rate? We will
  use the values in Table 21.1 to illustrate the steps.
  To determine the percentage in the labor force:
  Step 1. Divide the number of people in the labor force (165.052 million) by the total adult (working-age)
  population (262.029 million).
  Step 2. Multiply by 100 to obtain the percentage.

  To determine the percentage out of the labor force:
  Step 1. Divide the number of people out of the labor force (99.977 million) by the total adult (working-age)
  population (262.029 million).
  Step 2. Multiply by 100 to obtain the percentage.

  To determine the unemployment rate:
  Step 1. Divide the number of unemployed people (6.877 million) by the total labor force (165.052 million).
  Step 2. Multiply by 100 to obtain the rate.

Hidden Unemployment

Even with the "out of the labor force" category, there are still some people who are mislabeled in the
categorization of employed, unemployed, or out of the labor force. There are some people who have only part
time or temporary jobs, and they are looking for full time and permanent employment that are counted as
employed, although they are not employed in the way they would like or need to be. Additionally, there are
individuals who are underemployed. This includes those who are trained or skilled for one type or level of
work but are working in a lower paying job or one that does not utilize their skills. For example, we would
consider an individual with a college degree in finance who is working as a sales clerk underemployed. They
are, however, also counted in the employed group. All of these individuals fall under the umbrella of the term
"hidden unemployment." Discouraged workers, those who have stopped looking for employment and, hence,
are no longer counted in the unemployed also fall into this group

Labor Force Participation Rate

Another important statistic is the labor force participation rate. This is the percentage of adults in an
economy who are either employed or who are unemployed and looking for a job. Using the data in Figure 21.2
and Table 21.1, those included in this calculation would be the 162.052 million individuals in the labor force.
We calculate the rate by taking the number of people in the labor force, that is, the number employed and the
number unemployed, divided by the total adult population and multiplying by 100 to get the percentage. For
the data from November 2021, the labor force participation rate is 61.8%. Historically, the civilian labor force
participation rate in the United States climbed beginning in the 1960s as women increasingly entered the
workforce, and it peaked at just over 67% in late 1999 to early 2000. Since then, the labor force participation
rate has steadily declined, slowly to about 66% in 2008, early in the Great Recession, and then more rapidly
during and after that recession. The labor force then climbed slowly during the 2010s but declined again
during the pandemic in March-April 2020 and remained lower than pre-pandemic levels as of early 2022.

      The Establishment Payroll Survey

       When the unemployment report comes out each month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) also reports on
       the number of jobs created--which comes from the establishment payroll survey. The payroll survey is based
       on a survey of about 147,000 businesses and government agencies throughout the United States. It generates
       payroll employment estimates by the following criteria: all employees, average weekly hours worked, and
       average hourly, weekly, and overtime earnings. One of the criticisms of this survey is that it does not count the
       self-employed. It also does not make a distinction between new, minimum wage, part time or temporary jobs
       and full time jobs with "decent" pay.

      How Does the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Collect the U.S. Unemployment Data?

       The unemployment rate announced by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on the first Friday of each month for
       the previous month is based on the Current Population Survey (CPS), which the Bureau has carried out every
       month since 1940. The Bureau takes great care to make this survey representative of the country as a whole.
       The country is first divided into 3,137 areas. The U.S. Bureau of the Census then selects 729 of these areas to
       survey. It divides the 729 areas into districts of about 300 households each, and divides each district into
       clusters of about four dwelling units. Every month, Census Bureau employees call about 15,000 of the four-
       household clusters, for a total of 60,000 households. Employees interview households for four consecutive
       months, then rotate them out of the survey for eight months, and then interview them again for the same four
       months the following year, before leaving the sample permanently.

       Based on this survey, state, industry, urban and rural areas, gender, age, race or ethnicity, and level of
       education statistics comprise components that contribute to unemployment rates. A wide variety of other
       information is available, too. For example, how long have people been unemployed? Did they become
       unemployed because they quit, or were laid off, or their employer went out of business? Is the unemployed
       person the only wage earner in the family? The Current Population Survey is a treasure trove of information
       about employment and unemployment. If you are wondering what the difference is between the CPS and EPS,
       read the following Clear it Up feature.

                CLEAR IT UP

      What is the difference between CPS and EPS?

       The United States Census Bureau conducts the Current Population Survey (CPS), which measures the percentage of
       the labor force that is unemployed. The Bureau of Labor Statistics' establishment payroll survey (EPS) is a payroll
       survey that measures the net change in jobs created for the month.

      Criticisms of Measuring Unemployment

       There are always complications in measuring the number of unemployed. For example, what about people
       who do not have jobs and would be available to work, but are discouraged by the lack of available jobs in their
       area and stopped looking? Such people, and their families, may be suffering the pains of unemployment.
       However, the survey counts them as out of the labor force because they are not actively looking for work. Other
       people may tell the Census Bureau that they are ready to work and looking for a job but, truly, they are not that
       eager to work and are not looking very hard at all. They are counted as unemployed, although they might more
       accurately be classified as out of the labor force. Still other people may have a job, perhaps doing something
       like yard work, child care, or cleaning houses, but are not reporting the income earned to the tax authorities.
       They may report being unemployed, when they actually are working.

       Although the unemployment rate gets most of the public and media attention, economic researchers at the
       Bureau of Labor Statistics publish a wide array of surveys and reports that try to measure these kinds of issues
       and to develop a more nuanced and complete view of the labor market. It is not exactly a hot news flash that

quite informative, when interpreted knowledgeably and sensibly.

21.2 Patterns of Unemployment

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Explain historical patterns of unemployment in the U.S.
  · Identify trends of unemployment based on demographics
  · Evaluate global unemployment rates
Let's look at how unemployment rates have changed over time and how various groups of people are affected
by unemployment differently.

The Historical U.S. Unemployment Rate

Figure 21.3 shows the historical pattern of U.S. unemployment since 1955.

FIGURE 21.3 The U.S. Unemployment Rate, 1948-2020 The U.S. unemployment rate moves up and down as the
economy moves in and out of recessions. However, over time, the unemployment rate seems to return to a range of
4% to 6%. There does not seem to be a long-term trend toward the rate moving generally higher or generally lower.
(Source: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), Unemployment Rate (UNRATE), https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/
UNRATE)
As we look at this data, several patterns stand out:
1. Unemployment rates do fluctuate over time. During the deep recessions of the early 1980s, 2007-2009,

      and 2021, unemployment reached roughly 10%. For comparison, during the 1930s Great Depression, the
      unemployment rate reached almost 25% of the labor force.
2. Unemployment rates in the late 1990s and into the mid-2000s were rather low by historical standards.
      The unemployment rate was below 5% from 1997 to 2000, and near 5% during almost all of 2006-2007,
      and 5% or less from September 2015 through March 2020. The previous time unemployment had been
      less than 5% for three consecutive years was three decades earlier, from 1968 to 1970.
3. The unemployment rate never falls all the way to zero. It almost never seems to get below 3%--and it stays
      that low only for very short periods. (We discuss reasons why this is the case later in this chapter.)
512 21 · Unemployment

        4. The timing of rises and falls in unemployment matches fairly well with the timing of upswings and
             downswings in the overall economy, except that unemployment tends to lag changes in economic activity,
             and especially so during upswings of the economy following a recession. During periods of recession and
             depression, unemployment is high. During periods of economic growth, unemployment tends to be lower.

        5. No significant upward or downward trend in unemployment rates is apparent. This point is especially
             worth noting because the U.S. population more than quadrupled from 76 million in 1900 to over 324
             million by 2017. Moreover, a higher proportion of U.S. adults are now in the paid workforce, because
             women have entered the paid labor force in significant numbers in recent decades. Women comprised
             18% of the paid workforce in 1900 and nearly half of the paid workforce in 2021. However, despite the
             increased number of workers, as well as other economic events like globalization and the continuous
             invention of new technologies, the economy has provided jobs without causing any long-term upward or
             downward trend in unemployment rates.

       economy moves in and out of recessions.

      Unemployment Rates by Group

       Unemployment is not distributed evenly across the U.S. population. Figure 21.4 shows unemployment rates
       broken down in various ways: by gender, age, and race/ethnicity.

FIGURE 21.4 Unemployment Rate by Demographic Group (a) By gender, 1948-2020. Unemployment rates for men
used to be lower than unemployment rates for women, but in recent decades, the two rates have been very close,
often- and especially during and soon after the Great Recession - with the unemployment rate for men somewhat
higher. (b) By age, 1948-2020. Unemployment rates are highest for the very young and become lower with age. (c)
By race and ethnicity, 1974-2020. Although unemployment rates for all groups tend to rise and fall together, the
unemployment rate for Black people is typically about twice as high as that for White people, while the
unemployment rate for Hispanic people is in between. (Source: www.bls.gov)
The unemployment rate for women had historically tended to be higher than the unemployment rate for men,
perhaps reflecting the historical pattern that women were seen as "secondary" earners. By about 1980,
however, the unemployment rate for women was essentially the same as that for men, as Figure 21.4 (a) shows.
During the pandemic-induced recession of 2020 and in the immediate aftermath, the unemployment rate for
women exceeded the unemployment rate for men. Subsequently, however, the gap has narrowed.

Read this report (http://openstax.org/l/BLS_recession) for detailed information on the 2008-2009 recession. It
also provides some very useful information on the statistics of unemployment.

Younger workers tend to have higher unemployment, while middle-aged workers tend to have lower
unemployment, probably because the middle-aged workers feel the responsibility of needing to have a job
more heavily. Younger workers move in and out of jobs more than middle-aged workers, as part of the process
of matching of workers and jobs, and this contributes to their higher unemployment rates. In addition, middle-
aged workers are more likely to feel the responsibility of needing to have a job more heavily. Elderly workers
have extremely low rates of unemployment, because those who do not have jobs often exit the labor force by
retiring, and thus are not counted in the unemployment statistics. Figure 21.4 (b) shows unemployment rates
for women divided by age. The pattern for men is similar.

The unemployment rate for African-Americans is substantially higher than the rate for other racial or ethnic
groups, a fact that surely reflects, to some extent, a pattern of discrimination that has constrained Black
people's labor market opportunities. However, the gaps between unemployment rates for White, Black, and
Hispanic people have diminished in the 1990s, as Figure 21.4 (c) shows. In fact, unemployment rates for Black
and Hispanic people were at the lowest levels for several decades in the mid-2000s before rising during the
recent Great Recession.

Finally, those with less education typically suffer higher unemployment. In November 2021, for example, the
unemployment rate for those with a college degree was 2.3%; for those with some college but not a four year
degree, the unemployment rate was 3.7%; for high school graduates with no additional degree, the
unemployment rate was 5.2%; and for those without a high school diploma, the unemployment rate was 5.7%.
This pattern arises because additional education typically offers better connections to the labor market and
higher demand. With less attractive labor market opportunities for low-skilled workers compared to the
opportunities for the more highly-skilled, including lower pay, low-skilled workers may be less motivated to
find jobs.

Breaking Down Unemployment in Other Ways

The Bureau of Labor Statistics also gives information about the reasons for unemployment, as well as the
length of time individuals have been unemployed. Table 21.2, for example, shows the four reasons for
unemployment and the percentages of the currently unemployed that fall into each category. Table 21.3 shows
the length of unemployment. For both of these, the data is from November 2021.(bls.gov)

International Unemployment Comparisons

From an international perspective, the U.S. unemployment rate typically has looked a little better than average.
Table 21.4 compares unemployment rates for 1991, 1996, 2001, 2006 (just before the Great Recession), and
2019 (just before the pandemic-induced recession) from several other high-income countries.

Rates

However, we need to treat cross-country comparisons of unemployment rates with care, because each country
has slightly different definitions of unemployment, survey tools for measuring unemployment, and also
different labor markets. For example, Japan's unemployment rates appear quite low, but Japan's economy has
been mired in slow growth and recession since the late 1980s, and Japan's unemployment rate probably paints
too rosy a picture of its labor market. In Japan, workers who lose their jobs are often quick to exit the labor
force and not look for a new job, in which case they are not counted as unemployed. In addition, Japanese
firms are often quite reluctant to fire workers, and so firms have substantial numbers of workers who are on
reduced hours or officially employed, but doing very little. We can view this Japanese pattern as an unusual

       method for society to provide support for the unemployed, rather than a sign of a healthy economy.

       We hear about the Chinese economy in the news all the time. The value of the Chinese yuan in comparison to
       the U.S. dollar is likely to be part of the nightly business report, so why is the Chinese economy not included in
       this discussion of international unemployment? The lack of reliable statistics is the reason. This article
       (http://openstax.org/l/ChinaEmployment) explains why.

       Comparing unemployment rates in the United States and other high-income economies with unemployment
       rates in Latin America, Africa, Eastern Europe, and Asia is very difficult. One reason is that the statistical
       agencies in many poorer countries lack the resources and technical capabilities of the U.S. Bureau of the
       Census. However, a more difficult problem with international comparisons is that in many low-income
       countries, most workers are not involved in the labor market through an employer who pays them regularly.
       Instead, workers in these countries are engaged in short-term work, subsistence activities, and barter.
       Moreover, the effect of unemployment is very different in high-income and low-income countries. Unemployed
       workers in the developed economies have access to various government programs like unemployment
       insurance, welfare, and food stamps. Such programs may barely exist in poorer countries. Although
       unemployment is a serious problem in many low-income countries, it manifests itself in a different way than
       in high-income countries.

     21.3 What Causes Changes in Unemployment over the Short Run

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Analyze cyclical unemployment
         · Explain the relationship between sticky wages and employment using various economic arguments
         · Apply supply and demand models to unemployment and wages

       We have seen that unemployment varies across times and places. What causes changes in unemployment?
       There are different answers in the short run and in the long run. Let's look at the short run first.

      Cyclical Unemployment

       Let's make the plausible assumption that in the short run, from a few months to a few years, the quantity of
       hours that the average person is willing to work for a given wage does not change much, so the labor supply
       curve does not shift much. In addition, make the standard ceteris paribus assumption that there is no
       substantial short-term change in the age structure of the labor force, institutions and laws affecting the labor
       market, or other possibly relevant factors.

       One primary determinant of the demand for labor from firms is how they perceive the state of the macro
       economy. If firms believe that business is expanding, then at any given wage they will desire to hire a greater
       quantity of labor, and the labor demand curve shifts to the right. Conversely, if firms perceive that the economy
       is slowing down or entering a recession, then they will wish to hire a lower quantity of labor at any given wage,
       and the labor demand curve will shift to the left. Economists call the variation in unemployment that the
       economy causes moving from expansion to recession or from recession to expansion (i.e. the business cycle)
       cyclical unemployment.

       From the standpoint of the supply-and-demand model of competitive and flexible labor markets,
       unemployment represents something of a puzzle. In a supply-and-demand model of a labor market, as Figure
       21.5 illustrates, the labor market should move toward an equilibrium wage and quantity. At the equilibrium
       wage (We), the equilibrium quantity (Qe) of labor supplied by workers should be equal to the quantity of labor
       demanded by employers.

FIGURE 21.5 The Unemployment and Equilibrium in the Labor Market In a labor market with flexible wages, the
equilibrium will occur at wage We and quantity Qe, where the number of people who want jobs (shown by S) equals
the number of jobs available (shown by D).
One possibility for unemployment is that people who are unemployed are those who are not willing to work at
the current equilibrium wage, say $10 an hour, but would be willing to work at a higher wage, like $20 per hour.
The monthly Current Population Survey would count these people as unemployed, because they say they are
ready and looking for work (at $20 per hour). However, from an economist's perspective, these people are
choosing to be unemployed.
Probably a few people are unemployed because of unrealistic expectations about wages, but they do not
represent the majority of the unemployed. Instead, unemployed people often have friends or acquaintances of
similar skill levels who are employed, and the unemployed would be willing to work at the jobs and wages
similar to what those people are receiving. However, the employers of their friends and acquaintances do not
seem to be hiring. In other words, these people are involuntarily unemployed. What causes involuntary
unemployment?

Why Wages Might Be Sticky Downward

If a labor market model with flexible wages does not describe unemployment very well--because it predicts
that anyone willing to work at the going wage can always find a job--then it may prove useful to consider
economic models in which wages are not flexible or adjust only very slowly. In particular, even though wage
increases may occur with relative ease, wage decreases are few and far between.
One set of reasons why wages may be "sticky downward," as economists put it, involves economic laws and
institutions. For low-skilled workers receiving minimum wage, it is illegal to reduce their wages. For union
workers operating under a multiyear contract with a company, wage cuts might violate the contract and create
a labor dispute or a strike. However, minimum wages and union contracts are not a sufficient reason why
wages would be sticky downward for the U.S. economy as a whole. After all, out of the 73.3 million or so
employed workers in the U.S. economy who earn wages by the hour, only about 1.1 million--less than 2% of the
total--do not receive compensation above the minimum wage. Similarly, labor unions represent only about
12% of American wage and salary workers. In other high-income countries, more workers may have their
wages determined by unions or the minimum wage may be set at a level that applies to a larger share of
workers. However, for the United States, these two factors combined affect only about 15% or less of the labor
force.
Economists looking for reasons why wages might be sticky downwards have focused on factors that may
characterize most labor relationships in the economy, not just a few. Many have proposed a number of
different theories, but they share a common tone.
518 21 · Unemployment

       One argument is that even employees who are not union members often work under an implicit contract,
       which is that the employer will try to keep wages from falling when the economy is weak or the business is
       having trouble, and the employee will not expect huge salary increases when the economy or the business is
       strong. This wage-setting behavior acts like a form of insurance: the employee has some protection against
       wage declines in bad times, but pays for that protection with lower wages in good times. Clearly, this sort of
       implicit contract means that firms will be hesitant to cut wages, lest workers feel betrayed and work less hard
       or even leave the firm.
       Efficiency wage theory argues that workers' productivity depends on their pay, and so employers will often
       find it worthwhile to pay their employees somewhat more than market conditions might dictate. One reason is
       that employees who receive better pay than others will be more productive because they recognize that if they
       were to lose their current jobs, they would suffer a decline in salary. As a result, they are motivated to work
       harder and to stay with the current employer. In addition, employers know that it is costly and time-consuming
       to hire and train new employees, so they would prefer to pay workers a little extra now rather than to lose them
       and have to hire and train new workers. Thus, by avoiding wage cuts, the employer minimizes costs of training
       and hiring new workers, and reaps the benefits of well-motivated employees.
       The adverse selection of wage cuts argument points out that if an employer reacts to poor business
       conditions by reducing wages for all workers, then the best workers, those with the best employment
       alternatives at other firms, are the most likely to leave. The least attractive workers, with fewer employment
       alternatives, are more likely to stay. Consequently, firms are more likely to choose which workers should
       depart, through layoffs and firings, rather than trimming wages across the board. Sometimes companies that
       are experiencing difficult times can persuade workers to take a pay cut for the short term, and still retain most
       of the firm's workers. However, it is far more typical for companies to lay off some workers, rather than to cut
       wages for everyone.
       The insider-outsider model of the labor force, in simple terms, argues that those already working for firms are
       "insiders," while new employees, at least for a time, are "outsiders." A firm depends on its insiders to keep the
       organization running smoothly, to be familiar with routine procedures, and to train new employees. However,
       cutting wages will alienate the insiders and damage the firm's productivity and prospects.
       Finally, the relative wage coordination argument points out that even if most workers were hypothetically
       willing to see a decline in their own wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also experiences
       such a decline, there is no obvious way for a decentralized economy to implement such a plan. Instead,
       workers confronted with the possibility of a wage cut will worry that other workers will not have such a wage
       cut, and so a wage cut means being worse off both in absolute terms and relative to others. As a result, workers
       fight hard against wage cuts.
       These theories of why wages tend not to move downward differ in their logic and their implications, and
       figuring out the strengths and weaknesses of each theory is an ongoing subject of research and controversy
       among economists. All tend to imply that wages will decline only very slowly, if at all, even when the economy
       or a business is having tough times. When wages are inflexible and unlikely to fall, then either short-run or
       long-run unemployment can result. Figure 21.6 illustrates this.

FIGURE 21.6 Sticky Wages in the Labor Market Because the wage rate is stuck at W, above the equilibrium, the
number of those who want jobs (Qs) is greater than the number of job openings (Qd). The result is unemployment,
shown by the bracket in the figure.
Figure 21.7 shows the interaction between shifts in labor demand and wages that are sticky downward. Figure
21.7 (a) illustrates the situation in which the demand for labor shifts to the right from D0 to D1. In this case, the
equilibrium wage rises from W0 to W1 and the equilibrium quantity of labor hired increases from Q0 to Q1. It
does not hurt employee morale at all for wages to rise.
Figure 21.7 (b) shows the situation in which the demand for labor shifts to the left, from D0 to D1, as it would
tend to do in a recession. Because wages are sticky downward, they do not adjust toward what would have been
the new equilibrium wage (W1), at least not in the short run. Instead, after the shift in the labor demand curve,
the same quantity of workers is willing to work at that wage as before; however, the quantity of workers
demanded at that wage has declined from the original equilibrium (Q0) to Q2. The gap between the original
equilibrium quantity (Q0) and the new quantity demanded of labor (Q2) represents workers who would be
willing to work at the going wage but cannot find jobs. The gap represents the economic meaning of
unemployment.

FIGURE 21.7 Rising Wage and Low Unemployment: Where Is the Unemployment in Supply and Demand? (a) In a
labor market where wages are able to rise, an increase in the demand for labor from D0 to D1 leads to an increase in
equilibrium quantity of labor hired from Q0 to Q1 and a rise in the equilibrium wage from W0 to W1. (b) In a labor
market where wages do not decline, a fall in the demand for labor from D0 to D1 leads to a decline in the quantity of
520 21 · Unemployment

       labor demanded at the original wage (W0) from Q0 to Q2. These workers will want to work at the prevailing wage
       (W0), but will not be able to find jobs.

       This analysis helps to explain the connection that we noted earlier: that unemployment tends to rise in
       recessions and to decline during expansions. The overall state of the economy shifts the labor demand curve
       and, combined with wages that are sticky downwards, unemployment changes. The rise in unemployment that
       occurs because of a recession is cyclical unemployment.

     21.4 What Causes Changes in Unemployment over the Long Run

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain frictional and structural unemployment
         · Assess relationships between the natural rate of employment and potential real GDP, productivity, and

             public policy
         · Identify recent patterns in the natural rate of employment
         · Propose ways to combat unemployment

       Cyclical unemployment explains why unemployment rises during a recession and falls during an economic
       expansion, but what explains the remaining level of unemployment even in good economic times? Why is the
       unemployment rate never zero? Even when the U.S. economy is growing strongly, the unemployment rate only
       rarely dips as low as 4%. Moreover, the discussion earlier in this chapter pointed out that unemployment rates
       in many European countries like Italy, France, and Germany have often been remarkably high at various times
       in the last few decades. Why does some level of unemployment persist even when economies are growing
       strongly? Why are unemployment rates continually higher in certain economies, through good economic years
       and bad? Economists have a term to describe the remaining level of unemployment that occurs even when the
       economy is healthy: they call it the natural rate of unemployment.

      The Long Run: The Natural Rate of Unemployment

       The natural rate of unemployment is not "natural" in the sense that water freezes at 32 degrees Fahrenheit or
       boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit. It is not a physical and unchanging law of nature. Instead, it is only the
       "natural" rate because it is the unemployment rate that would result from the combination of economic, social,
       and political factors that exist at a time--assuming the economy was neither booming nor in recession. These
       forces include the usual pattern of companies expanding and contracting their workforces in a dynamic
       economy, social and economic forces that affect the labor market, or public policies that affect either the
       eagerness of people to work or the willingness of businesses to hire. Let's discuss these factors in more detail.

      Frictional Unemployment

       In a market economy, some companies are always going broke for a variety of reasons: old technology; poor
       management; good management that happened to make bad decisions; shifts in tastes of consumers so that
       less of the firm's product is desired; a large customer who went broke; or tough domestic or foreign
       competitors. Conversely, other companies will be doing very well for just the opposite reasons and looking to
       hire more employees. In a perfect world, all of those who lost jobs would immediately find new ones. However,
       in the real world, even if the number of job seekers is equal to the number of job vacancies, it takes time to find
       out about new jobs, to interview and figure out if the new job is a good match, or perhaps to sell a house and

buy another in proximity to a new job. Economists call the unemployment that occurs in the meantime, as
workers move between jobs, frictional unemployment. Frictional unemployment is not inherently a bad
thing. It takes time on part of both the employer and the individual to match those looking for employment
with the correct job openings. For individuals and companies to be successful and productive, you want people
to find the job for which they are best suited, not just the first job offered.

In the mid-2000s, before the 2008-2009 recession, it was true that about 7% of U.S. workers saw their jobs
disappear in any three-month period. However, in periods of economic growth, these destroyed jobs are
counterbalanced for the economy as a whole by a larger number of jobs created. In 2019, for example, there
were typically about 6 million unemployed people at any given time in the U.S. economy. Even though about
two-thirds of those unemployed people found a job in 14 weeks or fewer, the unemployment rate did not
change much during the year, because those who found new jobs were largely offset by others who lost jobs.

Of course, it would be preferable if people who were losing jobs could immediately and easily move into newly
created jobs, but in the real world, that is not possible. Someone who is laid off by a textile mill in South
Carolina cannot turn around and immediately start working for a textile mill in California. Instead, the
adjustment process happens in ripples. Some people find new jobs near their old ones, while others find that
they must move to new locations. Some people can do a very similar job with a different company, while others
must start new career paths. Some people may be near retirement and decide to look only for part-time work,
while others want an employer that offers a long-term career path. The frictional unemployment that results
from people moving between jobs in a dynamic economy may account for one to two percentage points of total
unemployment.

The level of frictional unemployment will depend on how easy it is for workers to learn about alternative jobs,
which may reflect the ease of communications about job prospects in the economy. The extent of frictional
unemployment will also depend to some extent on how willing people are to move to new areas to find
jobs--which in turn may depend on history and culture.

Frictional unemployment and the natural rate of unemployment also seem to depend on the age distribution of
the population. Figure 21.4 (b) showed that unemployment rates are typically lower for people between 25-54
years of age or aged 55 and over than they are for those who are younger. "Prime-age workers," as those in the
25-54 age bracket are sometimes called, are typically at a place in their lives when they want to have a job and
income arriving at all times. In addition, older workers who lose jobs may prefer to opt for retirement. By
contrast, it is likely that a relatively high proportion of those who are under 25 will be trying out jobs and life
options, and this leads to greater job mobility and hence higher frictional unemployment. Thus, a society with
a relatively high proportion of young workers, like the U.S. beginning in the mid-1960s when Baby Boomers
began entering the labor market, will tend to have a higher unemployment rate than a society with a higher
proportion of its workers in older ages.

Structural Unemployment

Another factor that influences the natural rate of unemployment is the amount of structural unemployment.
The structurally unemployed are individuals who have no jobs because they lack skills valued by the labor
market, either because demand has shifted away from the skills they do have, or because they never learned
any skills. An example of the former would be the unemployment among aerospace engineers after the U.S.
space program downsized in the 1970s. An example of the latter would be high school dropouts.

Some people worry that technology causes structural unemployment. In the past, new technologies have put
lower skilled employees out of work, but at the same time they create demand for higher skilled workers to use
the new technologies. Education seems to be the key in minimizing the amount of structural unemployment.
Individuals who have degrees can be retrained if they become structurally unemployed. For people with no
skills and little education, that option is more limited.
522 21 · Unemployment

      Natural Unemployment and Potential Real GDP

       The natural unemployment rate is related to two other important concepts: full employment and potential real
       GDP. Economists consider the economy to be at full employment when the actual unemployment rate is equal
       to the natural unemployment rate. When the economy is at full employment, real GDP is equal to potential real
       GDP. By contrast, when the economy is below full employment, the unemployment rate is greater than the
       natural unemployment rate and real GDP is less than potential. Finally, when the economy is above full
       employment, then the unemployment rate is less than the natural unemployment rate and real GDP is greater
       than potential. Operating above potential is only possible for a short while, since it is analogous to all workers
       working overtime.

      Productivity Shifts and the Natural Rate of Unemployment

       Unexpected shifts in productivity can have a powerful effect on the natural rate of unemployment. Over time,
       workers' productivity determines the level of wages in an economy. After all, if a business paid workers more
       than could be justified by their productivity, the business will ultimately lose money and go bankrupt.
       Conversely, if a business tries to pay workers less than their productivity then, in a competitive labor market,
       other businesses will find it worthwhile to hire away those workers and pay them more.
       However, adjustments of wages to productivity levels will not happen quickly or smoothly. Employers typically
       review wages only once or twice a year. In many modern jobs, it is difficult to measure productivity at the
       individual level. For example, how precisely would one measure the quantity produced by an accountant who
       is one of many people working in the tax department of a large corporation? Because productivity is difficult to
       observe, employers often determine wage increases based on recent experience with productivity. If
       productivity has been rising at, say, 2% per year, then wages rise at that level as well. However, when
       productivity changes unexpectedly, it can affect the natural rate of unemployment for a time.
       The U.S. economy in the 1970s and 1990s provides two vivid examples of this process. In the 1970s,
       productivity growth slowed down unexpectedly (as we discussed in Economic Growth). For example, output
       per hour of U.S. workers in the business sector increased at an annual rate of 3.3% per year from 1960 to 1973,
       but only 0.8% from 1973 to 1982. Figure 21.8 (a) illustrates the situation where the demand for labor--that is,
       the quantity of labor that business is willing to hire at any given wage--has been shifting out a little each year
       because of rising productivity, from D0 to D1 to D2. As a result, equilibrium wages have been rising each year
       from W0 to W1 to W2. However, when productivity unexpectedly slows down, the pattern of wage increases
       does not adjust right away. Wages keep rising each year from W2 to W3 to W4, but the demand for labor is no
       longer shifting up. A gap opens where the quantity of labor supplied at wage level W4 is greater than the
       quantity demanded. The natural rate of unemployment rises. In the aftermath of this unexpectedly low
       productivity in the 1970s, the national unemployment rate did not fall below 7% from May, 1980 until 1986.
       Over time, the rise in wages will adjust to match the slower gains in productivity, and the unemployment rate
       will ease back down, but this process may take years.

FIGURE 21.8 Unexpected Productivity Changes and Unemployment (a) Productivity is rising, increasing the
demand for labor. Employers and workers become used to the pattern of wage increases. Then productivity
suddenly stops increasing. However, there is a delay or lag in the recognition that productivity is no longer
increasing. As a result, wages keep rising as before, but the demand for labor is no longer increasing, so at wage W3
and wage W4, unemployment exists where the quantity supplied of labor exceeds the quantity demanded. (b) The
rate of productivity increase has been zero for a time, so employers and workers have come to accept the
equilibrium wage level (W). Then productivity increases unexpectedly, shifting demand for labor from D0 to D1. At
the wage (W), this means that the quantity demanded of labor exceeds the quantity supplied, and with job offers
plentiful, the unemployment rate will be low.
The late 1990s provide an opposite example: instead of the surprise decline in productivity that occurred in
the 1970s, productivity unexpectedly rose in the mid-1990s. The annual growth rate of real output per hour of
labor increased from 1.7% from 1980-1995, to an annual rate of 2.6% from 1995-2001. Let's simplify the
situation a bit, so that the economic lesson of the story is easier to see graphically, and say that productivity
had not been increasing at all in earlier years, so the intersection of the labor market was at point E in Figure
21.8 (b), where the demand curve for labor (D0) intersects the supply curve for labor. As a result, real wages
were not increasing. Now, productivity jumps upward, which shifts the demand for labor out to the right, from
D0 to D1. At least for a time, however, wages are still set according to the earlier expectations of no productivity
growth, so wages do not rise. The result is that at the prevailing wage level (W), the quantity of labor demanded
(Qd) will for a time exceed the quantity of labor supplied (Qs), and unemployment will be very low--actually
below the natural level of unemployment for a time. This pattern of unexpectedly high productivity helps to
explain why the unemployment rate stayed below 4.5%--quite a low level by historical standards--from 1998
until after the U.S. economy had entered a recession in 2001.
Levels of unemployment will tend to be somewhat higher on average when productivity is unexpectedly low,
and conversely, will tend to be somewhat lower on average when productivity is unexpectedly high. However,
over time, wages do eventually adjust to reflect productivity levels.

Public Policy and the Natural Rate of Unemployment

Public policy can also have a powerful effect on the natural rate of unemployment. On the supply side of the
labor market, public policies to assist the unemployed can affect how eager people are to find work. For
example, if a worker who loses a job is guaranteed a generous package of unemployment insurance, welfare
benefits, food stamps, and government medical benefits, then the opportunity cost of unemployment is lower
and that worker will be less eager to seek a new job.
What seems to matter most is not just the amount of these benefits, but how long they last. A society that
524 21 · Unemployment

provides generous help for the unemployed that cuts off after, say, six months, may provide less of an incentive
for unemployment than a society that provides less generous help that lasts for several years. Conversely,
government assistance for job search or retraining can in some cases encourage people back to work sooner.

How does U.S. unemployment insurance work?

Unemployment insurance is a joint federal-state program that the federal government enacted in 1935. While the
federal government sets minimum standards for the program, state governments conduct most of the
administration.

The funding for the program is a federal tax collected from employers. The federal government requires tax
collection on the first $7,000 in wages paid to each worker; however, states can choose to collect the tax on a higher
amount if they wish, and 41 states have set a higher limit. States can choose the length of time that they pay
benefits, although most states limit unemployment benefits to 26 weeks--with extensions possible in times of
especially high unemployment. The states then use the fund to pay benefits to those who become unemployed.
Average unemployment benefits are equal to about one-third of the wage that the person earned in their previous
job, but the level of unemployment benefits varies considerably across states.

unemployment benefits.

On the demand side of the labor market, government rules, social institutions, and the presence of unions can
affect the willingness of firms to hire. For example, if a government makes it hard for businesses to start up or
to expand, by wrapping new businesses in bureaucratic red tape, then businesses will become more
discouraged about hiring. Government regulations can make it harder to start a business by requiring that a
new business obtain many permits and pay many fees, or by restricting the types and quality of products that a
company can sell. Other government regulations, like zoning laws, may limit where companies can conduct
business, or whether businesses are allowed to be open during evenings or on Sunday.

Whatever rationales may be offered for such laws in terms of social value--like the value some Muslim people
place on not working on Friday, or some Jewish people on not working on Saturday, or some Christian people
on not working on Sunday--these kinds of restrictions create a difference between some willing workers and
other willing employers, and thus contribute to a higher natural rate of unemployment. Similarly, if
government makes it difficult to fire or lay off workers, businesses may react by trying not to hire more
workers than strictly necessary--since laying these workers off would be costly and difficult. High minimum
wages may discourage businesses from hiring low-skill workers. Government rules may encourage and
support powerful unions, which can then push up wages for union workers, but at a cost of discouraging
businesses from hiring those workers.

The Natural Rate of Unemployment in Recent Years

The underlying economic, social, and political factors that determine the natural rate of unemployment can
change over time, which means that the natural rate of unemployment can change over time, too.

Estimates by economists of the natural rate of unemployment in the U.S. economy in the early 2000s run at
about 4.5 to 5.5%. This is a lower estimate than earlier. We outline three of the common reasons that
economists propose for this change below.

1. The internet has provided a remarkable new tool through which job seekers can find out about jobs at
      different companies and can make contact with relative ease. An internet search is far easier than trying
      to find a list of local employers and then hunting up phone numbers for all of their human resources
      departments, and requesting a list of jobs and application forms. Social networking sites such as LinkedIn
      have changed how people find work as well.

2. The growth of the temporary worker industry has probably helped to reduce the natural rate of
      unemployment. In the early 1980s, only about 0.5% of all workers held jobs through temp agencies. By the
      early 2000s, the figure had risen above 2%. Temp agencies can provide jobs for workers while they are
      looking for permanent work. They can also serve as a clearinghouse, helping workers find out about jobs
      with certain employers and getting a tryout with the employer. For many workers, a temp job is a stepping-
      stone to a permanent job that they might not have heard about or obtained any other way, so the growth of
      temp jobs will also tend to reduce frictional unemployment.

3. The aging of the "baby boom generation"--the especially large generation of Americans born between
      1946 and 1964--meant that the proportion of young workers in the economy was relatively high in the
      1970s, as the boomers entered the labor market, but is relatively low today. As we noted earlier, middle-
      aged and older workers are far more likely to experience low unemployment than younger workers, a
      factor that tends to reduce the natural rate of unemployment as the baby boomers age.

The combined result of these factors is that the natural rate of unemployment was on average lower in the
1990s and the early 2000s than in the 1980s. The 2008-2009 Great Recession pushed monthly unemployment
rates up to 10% in late 2009. However, even at that time, the Congressional Budget Office was forecasting that
526 21 · Unemployment

       by 2015, unemployment rates would fall back to about 5%. During the first two months of 2020, the
       unemployment rate held steady at 3.5%. As of the first quarter of 2022, the Congressional Budget Office
       estimates the natural rate to be 4.6%.

      The Natural Rate of Unemployment in Europe

       By the standards of other high-income economies, the natural rate of unemployment in the U.S. economy
       appears relatively low. Through good economic years and bad, many European economies have had
       unemployment rates hovering near 10%, or even higher, since the 1970s. European rates of unemployment
       have been higher not because recessions in Europe have been deeper, but rather because the conditions
       underlying supply and demand for labor have been different in Europe, in a way that has created a much
       higher natural rate of unemployment.

       Many European countries have a combination of generous welfare and unemployment benefits, together with
       nests of rules that impose additional costs on businesses when they hire. In addition, many countries have
       laws that require firms to give workers months of notice before laying them off and to provide substantial
       severance or retraining packages after laying them off. The legally required notice before laying off a worker
       can be more than three months in Spain, Germany, Denmark, and Belgium, and the legally required severance
       package can be as high as a year's salary or more in Austria, Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Greece. Such laws will
       surely discourage laying off or firing current workers. However, when companies know that it will be difficult to
       fire or lay off workers, they also become hesitant about hiring in the first place.

       We can attribute the typically higher levels of unemployment in many European countries in recent years,
       which have prevailed even when economies are growing at a solid pace, to the fact that the sorts of laws and
       regulations that lead to a high natural rate of unemployment are much more prevalent in Europe than in the
       United States.

      A Preview of Policies to Fight Unemployment

       The Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy and Macroeconomic Policy Around the World chapters provide a
       detailed discussion of how to fight unemployment, when we can discuss these policies in the context of the full
       array of macroeconomic goals and frameworks for analysis. However, even at this preliminary stage, it is
       useful to preview the main issues concerning policies to fight unemployment.

       The remedy for unemployment will depend on the diagnosis. Cyclical unemployment is a short-term problem,
       caused because the economy is in a recession. Thus, the preferred solution will be to avoid or minimize
       recessions. As Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy discusses, governments can enact this policy by
       stimulating the overall buying power in the economy, so that firms perceive that sales and profits are possible,
       which makes them eager to hire.

       Dealing with the natural rate of unemployment is trickier. In a market-oriented economy, firms will hire and
       fire workers. Governments cannot control this. Furthermore, the evolving age structure of the economy's
       population, or unexpected shifts in productivity are beyond a government's control and, will affect the natural
       rate of unemployment for a time. However, as the example of high ongoing unemployment rates for many
       European countries illustrates, government policy clearly can affect the natural rate of unemployment that will
       persist even when GDP is growing.

       When a government enacts policies that will affect workers or employers, it must examine how these policies
       will affect the information and incentives employees and employers have to find one another. For example, the
       government may have a role to play in helping some of the unemployed with job searches. Governments may
       need to rethink the design of their programs that offer assistance to unemployed workers and protections to
       employed workers so that they will not unduly discourage the supply of labor. Similarly, governments may
       need to reassess rules that make it difficult for businesses to begin or to expand so that they will not unduly
       discourage the demand for labor. The message is not that governments should repeal all laws affecting labor

consider the tradeoffs involved.

Unemployment and the COVID-19 Pandemic

Almost two years after the pandemic began, the unemployment rate was on track to go below 4% again by early- to
mid-2022. While this is great news for workers, we have also seen that the story of the labor market is more
complicated than a single statistic might suggest. Millions remained out of the labor force due to the public health
situation, and the percentage of workers unemployed for longer than 26 weeks was still high.
The shift to remote work helped the unemployment rate come down by providing greater flexibility for workers
concerned with their health and safety. But it didn't help workers, especially women, who continued to be burdened
with excessive care responsibilities at home. During 2020, the unemployment rate for women exceeded that of men
by over a full percentage point. Additionally, virus variants in other countries threatened to disrupt progress made at
home and abroad.
The pandemic has helped shed light on how we can use information from all areas of the labor market to evaluate
the health of the economy.

Key Concepts and Summary

21.1 How Economists Define and Compute Unemployment Rate

Unemployment imposes high costs. Unemployed individuals experience loss of income and stress. An
economy with high unemployment suffers an opportunity cost of unused resources. We can divide the adult
population into those in the labor force and those out of the labor force. In turn, we divide those in the labor
force into employed and unemployed. A person without a job must be willing and able to work and actively
looking for work to be counted as unemployed; otherwise, a person without a job is counted as out of the labor
force. Economists define the unemployment rate as the number of unemployed persons divided by the
number of persons in the labor force (not the overall adult population). The Current Population Survey (CPS)
conducted by the United States Census Bureau measures the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed.
The establishment payroll survey by the Bureau of Labor Statistics measures the net change in jobs created for
the month.

21.2 Patterns of Unemployment

The U.S. unemployment rate rises during periods of recession and depression, but falls back to the range of 4%
to 6% when the economy is strong. The unemployment rate never falls to zero. Despite enormous growth in the
size of the U.S. population and labor force in the twentieth century, along with other major trends like
globalization and new technology, the unemployment rate shows no long-term rising trend.

Unemployment rates differ by group: higher for African-Americans and Hispanic people than for White
people; higher for less educated than more educated; higher for the young than the middle-aged. Women's
unemployment rates used to be higher than men's, but in recent years men's and women's unemployment

rates have been very similar. In recent years, unemployment rates in the United States have compared
favorably with unemployment rates in most other high-income economies.

21.3 What Causes Changes in Unemployment over the Short Run

Cyclical unemployment rises and falls with the business cycle. In a labor market with flexible wages, wages will
adjust in such a market so that quantity demanded of labor always equals the quantity supplied of labor at the
equilibrium wage. Economists have proposed many theories for why wages might not be flexible, but instead
may adjust only in a "sticky" way, especially when it comes to downward adjustments: implicit contracts,
efficiency wage theory, adverse selection of wage cuts, insider-outsider model, and relative wage coordination.

21.4 What Causes Changes in Unemployment over the Long Run

The natural rate of unemployment is the rate of unemployment that the economic, social, and political forces
in the economy would cause even when the economy is not in a recession. These factors include the frictional
unemployment that occurs when people either choose to change jobs or are put out of work for a time by the
shifts of a dynamic and changing economy. They also include any laws concerning conditions of hiring and
firing that have the undesired side effect of discouraging job formation. They also include structural
unemployment, which occurs when demand shifts permanently away from a certain type of job skill.

Critical Thinking Questions

30. Using the definition of the unemployment rate, is an increase in the unemployment rate necessarily a bad
      thing for a nation?

31. Is a decrease in the unemployment rate necessarily a good thing for a nation? Explain.

32. If many workers become discouraged from looking for jobs, explain how the number of jobs could decline
      but the unemployment rate could fall at the same time.

33. Would you expect hidden unemployment to be higher, lower, or about the same when the unemployment
      rate is high, say 10%, versus low, say 4%? Explain.

34. Is the higher unemployment rates for minority workers necessarily an indication of discrimination? What
      could be some other reasons for the higher unemployment rate?

35. While unemployment is highly negatively correlated with the level of economic activity, in the real world it
      responds with a lag. In other words, firms do not immediately lay off workers in response to a sales
      decline. They wait a while before responding. Similarly, firms do not immediately hire workers when sales
      pick up. What do you think accounts for the lag in response time?

36. Why do you think that unemployment rates are lower for individuals with more education?

37. Do you think it is rational for workers to prefer sticky wages to wage cuts, when the consequence of sticky
      wages is unemployment for some workers? Why or why not? How do the reasons for sticky wages
      explained in this section apply to your argument?

38. Under what condition would a decrease in unemployment be bad for the economy?

39. Under what condition would an increase in the unemployment rate be a positive sign?

40. As the baby boom generation retires, the ratio of retirees to workers will increase noticeably. How will this
      affect the Social Security program? How will this affect the standard of living of the average American?

41. Unemployment rates have been higher in many European countries in recent decades than in the United
      States. Is the main reason for this long-term difference in unemployment rates more likely to be cyclical
      unemployment or the natural rate of unemployment? Explain briefly.

42. Is it desirable to pursue a goal of zero unemployment? Why or why not?

43. Is it desirable to eliminate natural unemployment? Why or why not? Hint: Think about what our economy
      would look like today and what assumptions would have to be met to have a zero rate of natural
      unemployment.

44. The U.S. unemployment rate increased from 4.6% in July 2001 to 5.9% by June 2002. Without studying
      the subject in any detail, would you expect that a change of this kind is more likely to be due to cyclical

Introduction to Inflation

A $550 Million Loaf of Bread?

If you were born within the last three decades in the United States, Canada, or many other countries in the
developed world, you probably have no real experience with a high rate of inflation. Inflation is when most prices in
an entire economy are rising. However, there is an extreme form of inflation called hyperinflation. This occurred in
Germany between 1921 and 1928, and more recently in Zimbabwe between 2008 and 2009. In November 2008,
Zimbabwe had an inflation rate of 79.6 billion percent. In contrast, in 2014, the United States had an average annual
rate of inflation of 1.6%.

       Zimbabwe's inflation rate was so high it is difficult to comprehend, so let's put it into context. It is equivalent to price
       increases of 98% per day. This means that, from one day to the next, prices essentially double. What is life like in an
       economy afflicted with hyperinflation? Most of you reading this will have never experienced this phenomenon. The
       government adjusted prices for commodities in Zimbabwean dollars several times each day. There was no desire to
       hold on to currency since it lost value by the minute. The people there spent a great deal of time getting rid of any
       cash they acquired by purchasing whatever food or other commodities they could find. At one point, a loaf of bread
       cost 550 million Zimbabwean dollars. Teachers' salaries were in the trillions a month; however, this was equivalent
       to only one U.S. dollar a day. At its height, it took 621,984,228 Zimbabwean dollars to purchase one U.S. dollar.

       Government agencies had no money to pay their workers so they started printing money to pay their bills rather than
       raising taxes. Rising prices caused the government to enact price controls on private businesses, which led to
       shortages and the emergence of black markets. In 2009, the country abandoned its currency and allowed people to
       use foreign currencies for purchases.

       How does this happen? How can both government and the economy fail to function at the most basic level? Before
       we consider these extreme cases of hyperinflation, let's first look at inflation itself.

       Inflation is a general and ongoing rise in the level of prices in an entire economy. Inflation does not refer to a
       change in relative prices. A relative price change occurs when you see that the price of tuition has risen, but
       the price of laptops has fallen. Inflation, on the other hand, means that there is pressure for prices to rise in
       most markets in the economy. In addition, price increases in the supply-and-demand model were one-time
       events, representing a shift from a previous equilibrium to a new one. Inflation implies an ongoing rise in
       prices. If inflation happened for one year and then stopped, then it would not be inflation any more.

       This chapter begins by showing how to combine prices of individual goods and services to create a measure of
       overall inflation. It discusses the historical and recent experience of inflation, both in the United States and in
       other countries around the world. Other chapters have sometimes included a note under an exhibit or a
       parenthetical reminder in the text saying that the numbers have been adjusted for inflation. In this chapter, it
       is time to show how to use inflation statistics to adjust other economic variables, so that you can tell how much
       of, for example, we can attribute the rise in GDP over different periods of time to an actual increase in the
       production of goods and services and how much we should attribute to the fact that prices for most items have
       risen.

       Inflation has consequences for people and firms throughout the economy, in their roles as lenders and
       borrowers, wage-earners, taxpayers, and consumers. The chapter concludes with a discussion of some
       imperfections and biases in the inflation statistics, and a preview of policies for fighting inflation that we will
       discuss in other chapters.

     22.1 Tracking Inflation

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Calculate the annual rate of inflation
         · Explain and use index numbers and base years when simplifying the total quantity spent over a year for

             products
         · Calculate inflation rates using index numbers

       Dinner table conversations where you might have heard about inflation usually entail reminiscing about when
       "everything seemed to cost so much less. You used to be able to buy three gallons of gasoline for a dollar and
       then go see an afternoon movie for another dollar." Table 22.1 compares some prices of common goods in
       1970 and 2017. Of course, the average prices in this table may not reflect the prices where you live. The cost of
       living in New York City is much higher than in Houston, Texas, for example. In addition, certain products have
       evolved over recent decades. A new car in 2021, loaded with antipollution equipment, safety gear,

computerized engine controls, and many other technological advances, is a more advanced machine (and
more fuel efficient) than your typical 1970s car. However, put details like these to one side for the moment, and
look at the overall pattern. The primary reason behind the price rises in Table 22.1--and all the price increases
for the other products in the economy--is not specific to the market for housing or cars or gasoline or movie
tickets. Instead, it is part of a general rise in the level of all prices. At the beginning of 2021, $1 had about the
same purchasing power in overall terms of goods and services as 15 cents did in 1972, because of the amount
of inflation that has occurred over that time period.

                    Items         1970  2021

Pound of ground beef              $0.66 $5.96

Pound of butter                   $0.87 $3.50

Movie ticket                      $1.55 $13.70

Sales price of new home (median)  $22,000 $408,800

New car                           $3,000 $42,000

Gallon of gasoline                $0.36 $3.32

Average hourly wage for a manufacturing worker $3.23 $30.11

Per capita GDP                    $5,069 $63,543

TABLE 22.1 Price Comparisons, 1970 and 2021 (Sources: See chapter
References at end of book.)

Moreover, the power of inflation does not affect just goods and services, but wages and income levels, too. The
second-to-last row of Table 22.1 shows that the average hourly wage for a manufacturing worker increased
nearly ten-fold from 1970 to 2021. The average worker in 2021 is better educated and more productive than
the average worker in 1970--but not six times more productive. Per capita GDP increased substantially from
1970 to 2021, but is the average person in the U.S. economy really more than twelve times better off in just 51
years? Not likely.

A modern economy has millions of goods and services whose prices are continually quivering in the breezes of
supply and demand. How can all of these shifts in price attribute to a single inflation rate? As with many
problems in economic measurement, the conceptual answer is reasonably straightforward: Economists
combine prices of a variety of goods and services into a single price level. The inflation rate is simply the
percentage change in the price level. Applying the concept, however, involves some practical difficulties.

The Price of a Basket of Goods

To calculate the price level, economists begin with the concept of a basket of goods and services, consisting of
the different items individuals, businesses, or organizations typically buy. The next step is to look at how the
prices of those items change over time. In thinking about how to combine individual prices into an overall
price level, many people find that their first impulse is to calculate the average of the prices. Such a calculation,
however, could easily be misleading because some products matter more than others.

Changes in the prices of goods for which people spend a larger share of their incomes will matter more than
changes in the prices of goods for which people spend a smaller share of their incomes. For example, an
increase of 10% in the rental rate on housing matters more to most people than whether the price of carrots
rises by 10%. To construct an overall measure of the price level, economists compute a weighted average of the
536 22 · Inflation

prices of the items in the basket, where the weights are based on the actual quantities of goods and services
people buy. The following Work It Out feature walks you through the steps of calculating the annual rate of
inflation based on a few products.

                                                                                                          WORK IT OUT

 Calculating an Annual Rate of Inflation

  Consider the simple basket of goods with only three items, represented in Table 22.2. Say that in any given
  month, a college student spends money on 20 hamburgers, one bottle of aspirin, and five movies. The table
  provides prices for these items over four years through each time period (Pd). Prices of some goods in the basket
  may rise while others fall. In this example, the price of aspirin does not change over the four years, while movies
  increase in price and hamburgers bounce up and down. The table shows the cost of buying the given basket of
  goods at the prices prevailing at that time.

                         Items    Hamburger Aspirin Movies Total Inflation Rate

                    Qty           20            1 bottle 5          -  -

                    (Pd 1) Price  $3.00         $10.00 $6.00 -         -

                    (Pd 1) Amount Spent $60.00  $10.00 $30.00 $100.00 -

                    (Pd 2) Price  $3.20         $10.00 $6.50 -         -

                    (Pd 2) Amount Spent $64.00  $10.00 $32.50 $106.50 6.5%

                    (Pd 3) Price  $3.10         $10.00 $7.00 -         -

                    (Pd 3) Amount Spent $62.00  $10.00 $35.00 $107.00 0.5%

                    (Pd 4) Price  $3.50         $10.00 $7.50 -         -

                    (Pd 4) Amount Spent $70.00  $10.00 $37.50 $117.50 9.8%

                    TABLE 22.2 A College Student's Basket of Goods

To calculate the annual rate of inflation in this example:

Step 1. Find the percentage change in the cost of purchasing the overall basket of goods between the time
periods. The general equation for percentage changes between two years, whether in the context of inflation or
in any other calculation, is:

Step 2. From period 1 to period 2, the total cost of purchasing the basket of goods in Table 22.2 rises from $100
to $106.50. Therefore, the percentage change over this time--the inflation rate--is:

Step 3. From period 2 to period 3, the overall change in the cost of purchasing the basket rises from $106.50 to
$107. Thus, the inflation rate over this time, again calculated by the percentage change, is approximately:

                                                                                                                                                          22.1 · Tracking Inflation 537

  Step 4. From period 3 to period 4, the overall cost rises from $107 to $117.50. The inflation rate is thus:

  This calculation of the change in the total cost of purchasing a basket of goods accounts for how much a student
  spends on each good. Hamburgers are the lowest-priced good in this example, and aspirin is the highest-priced.
  If an individual buys a greater quantity of a low-price good, then it makes sense that changes in the price of that
  good should have a larger impact on the buying power of that person's money. The larger impact of hamburgers
  shows up in the "amount spent" row, where, in all time periods, hamburgers are the largest item within the
  amount spent row.

Index Numbers

The numerical results of a calculation based on a basket of goods can get a little messy. The simplified example
in Table 22.2 has only three goods and the prices are in even dollars, not numbers like 79 cents or $124.99. If
the list of products were much longer, and we used more realistic prices, the total quantity spent over a year
might be some messy-looking number like $17,147.51 or $27,654.92.
To simplify the task of interpreting the price levels for more realistic and complex baskets of goods,
economists typically report the price level in each period as an index number, rather than as the dollar
amount for buying the basket of goods. Economists create price indices to calculate an overall average change
in relative prices over time. To convert the money spent on the basket to an index number, economists
arbitrarily choose one year to be the base year, or starting point from which we measure changes in prices.
The base year, by definition, has an index number equal to 100. This sounds complicated, but it is really a
simple math trick. In the example above, say that we choose time period 3 as the base year. Since the total
amount of spending in that year is $107, we divide that amount by itself ($107) and multiply by 100. Again, this
is because the index number in the base year always has to have a value of 100. Then, to figure out the values
of the index number for the other years, we divide the dollar amounts for the other years by 1.07 as well. Note
also that the dollar signs cancel out so that index numbers have no units.
Table 22.3 shows calculations for the other values of the index number, based on the example in Table 22.2.
Because we calculate the index numbers so that they are in exactly the same proportion as the total dollar cost
of purchasing the basket of goods, we can calculate the inflation rate based on the index numbers, using the
percentage change formula. Thus, the inflation rate from period 1 to period 2 would be

This is the same answer that we derived when measuring inflation based on the dollar cost of the basket of
goods for the same time period.

                                   Total Spending Index Number Inflation Rate Since Previous Period

                    Period 1 $100

                    Period 2 $106.50

                    Period 3 $107

                    Period 4 $117.50

538 22 · Inflation

       If the inflation rate is the same whether it is based on dollar values or index numbers, then why bother with the
       index numbers? The advantage is that indexing allows easier eyeballing of the inflation numbers. If you glance
       at two index numbers like 107 and 110, you know automatically that the rate of inflation between the two years
       is about, but not quite exactly equal to, 3%. By contrast, imagine that we express the price levels in absolute
       dollars of a large basket of goods, so that when you looked at the data, the numbers were $19,493.62 and
       $20,040.17. Most people find it difficult to eyeball those kinds of numbers and say that it is a change of about
       3%. However, the two numbers expressed in absolute dollars are exactly in the same proportion of 107 to 110
       as the previous example. If you're wondering why simple subtraction of the index numbers wouldn't work,
       read the following Clear It Up feature.

                CLEAR IT UP

      Why do you not just subtract index numbers?

       A word of warning: When a price index moves from, say, 107 to 110, the rate of inflation is not exactly 3%.
       Remember, the inflation rate is not derived by subtracting the index numbers, but rather through the percentage-
       change calculation. We calculate the precise inflation rate as the price index moves from 107 to 110 as 100 x (110 -
       107) / 107 = 100 x 0.028 = 2.8%. When the base year is fairly close to 100, a quick subtraction is not a terrible
       shortcut to calculating the inflation rate--but when precision matters down to tenths of a percent, subtracting will
       not give the right answer.

       Two final points about index numbers are worth remembering. First, index numbers have no dollar signs or
       other units attached to them. Although we can use index numbers to calculate a percentage inflation rate, the
       index numbers themselves do not have percentage signs. Index numbers just mirror the proportions that we
       find in other data. They transform the other data so that it is easier to work with the data.

       Second, the choice of a base year for the index number--that is, the year that is automatically set equal to
       100--is arbitrary. We choose it as a starting point from which we can track changes in prices. In the official
       inflation statistics, it is common to use one base year for a few years, and then to update it, so that the base
       year of 100 is relatively close to the present. However, any base year that we choose for the index numbers will
       result in exactly the same inflation rate. To see this in the previous example, imagine that period 1 is the base
       year when total spending was $100, and we assign it an index number of 100. At a glance, you can see that the
       index numbers would now exactly match the dollar figures, and the inflation rate in the first period would be
       6.5%.

       Now that we see how indexes work to track inflation, the next module will show us how economists measure
       the cost of living.

     22.2 How to Measure Changes in the Cost of Living

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Use the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to calculate U.S. inflation rates
         · Identify several ways the Bureau of Labor Statistics avoids biases in the Consumer Price Index (CPI)
         · Differentiate among the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the Producer Price Index (PPI), the International

             Price Index, the Employment Cost Index, and the GDP deflator.

       The most commonly cited measure of inflation in the United States is the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                   22.2 · How to Measure Changes in the Cost of Living 539

Government statisticians at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics calculate the CPI based on the prices in a fixed
basket of goods and services that represents the purchases of the average family of four. In recent years, the
statisticians have paid considerable attention to a subtle problem: that the change in the total cost of buying a
fixed basket of goods and services over time is conceptually not quite the same as the change in the cost of
living, because the cost of living represents how much it costs for a person to feel that their consumption
provides an equal level of satisfaction or utility.

To understand the distinction, imagine that over the past 10 years, the cost of purchasing a fixed basket of
goods increased by 25% and your salary also increased by 25%. Has your personal standard of living held
constant? If you do not necessarily purchase an identical fixed basket of goods every year, then an inflation
calculation based on the cost of a fixed basket of goods may be a misleading measure of how your cost of living
has changed. Two problems arise here: substitution bias and quality/new goods bias.

When the price of a good rises, consumers tend to purchase less of it and to seek out substitutes instead.
Conversely, as the price of a good falls, people will tend to purchase more of it. This pattern implies that goods
with generally rising prices should tend over time to become less important in the overall basket of goods used
to calculate inflation, while goods with falling prices should tend to become more important. Consider, as an
example, a rise in the price of peaches by $100 per pound. If consumers were utterly inflexible in their
demand for peaches, this would lead to a big rise in the price of food for consumers. Alternatively, imagine that
people are utterly indifferent to whether they have peaches or other types of fruit. Now, if peach prices rise,
people completely switch to other fruit choices and the average price of food does not change at all. A fixed and
unchanging basket of goods assumes that consumers are locked into buying exactly the same goods,
regardless of price changes--not a very likely assumption. Thus, substitution bias--the rise in the price of a
fixed basket of goods over time--tends to overstate the rise in a consumer's true cost of living, because it does
not take into account that the person can substitute away from goods whose relative prices have risen.

The other major problem in using a fixed basket of goods as the basis for calculating inflation is how to deal
with the arrival of improved versions of older goods or altogether new goods. Consider the problem that arises
if a cereal is improved by adding 12 essential vitamins and minerals--and also if a box of the cereal costs 5%
more. It would clearly be misleading to count the entire resulting higher price as inflation, because the new
price reflects a higher quality (or at least different) product. Ideally, one would like to know how much of the
higher price is due to the quality change, and how much of it is just a higher price. The Bureau of Labor
Statistics, which is responsible for computing the Consumer Price Index, must deal with these difficulties in
adjusting for quality changes.

Consider how these prices compare to today's models. Is the product today of a different quality?

We can think of a new product as an extreme improvement in quality--from something that did not exist to
something that does. However, the basket of goods that was fixed in the past obviously does not include new
goods created since then. The basket of goods and services in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is revised and
updated over time, and so new products are gradually included. However, the process takes some time. For
example, room air conditioners were widely sold in the early 1950s, but were not introduced into the basket of
goods behind the Consumer Price Index until 1964. The VCR and personal computer were available in the late
1970s and widely sold by the early 1980s, but did not enter the CPI basket of goods until 1987. By 1996, there
were more than 40 million cellular phone subscribers in the United States--but cell phones were not yet part of
the CPI basket of goods. The parade of inventions has continued, with the CPI inevitably lagging a few years
behind.

The arrival of new goods creates problems with respect to the accuracy of measuring inflation. The reason
540 22 · Inflation

       people buy new goods, presumably, is that the new goods offer better value for money than existing goods.
       Thus, if the price index leaves out new goods, it overlooks one of the ways in which the cost of living is
       improving. In addition, the price of a new good is often higher when it is first introduced and then declines
       over time. If the new good is not included in the CPI for some years, until its price is already lower, the CPI may
       miss counting this price decline altogether. Taking these arguments together, the quality/new goods bias
       means that the rise in the price of a fixed basket of goods over time tends to overstate the rise in a consumer's
       true cost of living, because it does not account for how improvements in the quality of existing goods or the
       invention of new goods improves the standard of living. The following Clear It Up feature is a must-read on
       how statisticians comprise and calculate the CPI.

                CLEAR IT UP

      How do U.S. government statisticians measure the Consumer Price Index?

       When the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) calculates the Consumer Price Index, the first task is to decide on a
       basket of goods that is representative of the purchases of the average household. We do this by using the Consumer
       Expenditure Survey, a national survey of about 7,000 households, which provides detailed information on spending
       habits. Statisticians divide consumer expenditures into eight major groups (seen below), which in turn they divide
       into more than 200 individual item categories. The BLS currently uses 1982-1984 as the base period.

       For each of the 200 individual expenditure items, the BLS chooses several hundred very specific examples of that
       item and looks at the prices of those examples. In figuring out the "breakfast cereal" item under the overall category
       of "foods and beverages," the BLS picks several hundred examples of breakfast cereal. One example might be the
       price of a 24-oz. box of a particular brand of cereal sold at a particular store. The BLS statistically selects specific
       products and sizes and stores to reflect what people buy and where they shop. The basket of goods in the Consumer
       Price Index thus consists of about 80,000 products; that is, several hundred specific products in over 200 broad-
       item categories. Statisticians rotate about one-quarter of these 80,000 specific products of the sample each year,
       and replace them with a different set of products.

       The next step is to collect data on prices. Data collectors visit or call about 23,000 stores in 87 urban areas all over
       the United States every month to collect prices on these 80,000 specific products. The BLS also conducts a survey
       of 50,000 landlords or tenants to collect information about rents.

       Statisticians then calculate the Consumer Price Index by taking the 80,000 prices of individual products and
       combining them, using weights (see Figure 22.2) determined by the quantities of these products that people buy
       and allowing for factors like substitution between goods and quality improvements, into price indices for the 200 or
       so overall items. Then, the statisticians combine the price indices for the 200 items into an overall Consumer Price
       Index. According the Consumer Price Index website, there are eight categories that data collectors use:

        1. Food and beverages (breakfast cereal, milk, coffee, chicken, wine, full-service meals, and snacks)

The CPI and Core Inflation Index

Imagine if you were driving a company truck across the country- you probably would care about things like the
prices of available roadside food and motel rooms as well as the truck's operating condition. However, the
manager of the firm might have different priorities. He would care mostly about the truck's on-time
performance and much less so about the food you were eating and the places you were staying. In other words,
the company manager would be paying attention to the firm's production, while ignoring transitory elements
that impacted you, but did not affect the company's bottom line.
In a sense, a similar situation occurs with regard to measures of inflation. As we've learned, CPI measures
prices as they affect everyday household spending. Economists typically calculate a core inflation index by
taking the CPI and excluding volatile economic variables. In this way, economists have a better sense of the
underlying trends in prices that affect the cost of living.
Examples of excluded variables include energy and food prices, which can jump around from month to month
because of the weather. According to an article by Kent Bernhard, during Hurricane Katrina in 2005, a key
supply point for the nation's gasoline was nearly knocked out. Gas prices quickly shot up across the nation, in
some places by up to 40 cents a gallon in one day. This was not the cause of an economic policy but rather a
short-lived event until the pumps were restored in the region. In this case, the CPI that month would register
the change as a cost of living event to households, but the core inflation index would remain unchanged. As a
result, the Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rates would not be influenced. Similarly, droughts can cause
world-wide spikes in food prices that, if temporary, do not affect the nation's economic capability.
As former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke noted in 1999 about the core inflation index, "It
provide(s) a better guide to monetary policy than the other indices, since it measures the more persistent
underlying inflation rather than transitory influences on the price level." Bernanke also noted that it helps
communicate that the Federal Reserve does not need to respond to every inflationary shock since some price
changes are transitory and not part of a structural change in the economy.
In sum, both the CPI and the core inflation index are important, but serve different audiences. The CPI helps
households understand their overall cost of living from month to month, while the core inflation index is a
preferred gauge from which to make important government policy changes.

      Practical Solutions for the Substitution and the Quality/New Goods Biases

       By the early 2000s, the Bureau of Labor Statistics was using alternative mathematical methods for calculating
       the Consumer Price Index, more complicated than just adding up the cost of a fixed basket of goods, to allow
       for some substitution between goods. It was also updating the basket of goods behind the CPI more frequently,
       so that it could include new and improved goods more rapidly. For certain products, the BLS was carrying out
       studies to try to measure the quality improvement. For example, with computers, an economic study can try to
       adjust for changes in speed, memory, screen size, and other product characteristics, and then calculate the
       change in price after accounting for these product changes. However, these adjustments are inevitably
       imperfect, and exactly how to make these adjustments is often a source of controversy among professional
       economists.

       By the early 2000s, the substitution bias and quality/new goods bias had been somewhat reduced, so that since
       then the rise in the CPI probably overstates the true rise in inflation by only about 0.5% per year. Over one or a
       few years, this is not much. Over a period of a decade or two, even half of a percent per year compounds to a
       more significant amount. In addition, the CPI tracks prices from physical locations, and not at online sites like
       Amazon, where prices can be lower.

       When measuring inflation (and other economic statistics, too), a tradeoff arises between simplicity and
       interpretation. If we calculate the inflation rate with a basket of goods that is fixed and unchanging, then the
       calculation of an inflation rate is straightforward, but the problems of substitution bias and quality/new goods
       bias will arise. However, when the basket of goods is allowed to shift and evolve to reflect substitution toward
       lower relative prices, quality improvements, and new goods, the technical details of calculating the inflation
       rate grow more complex.

      Additional Price Indices: PPI, GDP Deflator, and More

       The basket of goods behind the Consumer Price Index represents an average hypothetical U.S. household's
       consumption, which is to say that it does not exactly capture anyone's personal experience. When the task is to
       calculate an average level of inflation, this approach works fine. What if, however, you are concerned about
       inflation experienced by a certain group, like the elderly, or the poor, or single-parent families with children, or
       Hispanic-Americans? In specific situations, a price index based on the buying power of the average consumer
       may not feel quite right.

       This problem has a straightforward solution. If the Consumer Price Index does not serve the desired purpose,
       then invent another index, based on a basket of goods appropriate for the group of interest. The Bureau of
       Labor Statistics publishes a number of experimental price indices: some for particular groups like the elderly
       or the poor, some for different geographic areas, and some for certain broad categories of goods like food or
       housing.

       The BLS also calculates several price indices that are not based on baskets of consumer goods. For example,
       the Producer Price Index (PPI) is based on prices paid for supplies and inputs by producers of goods and
       services. We can break it down into price indices for different industries, commodities, and stages of
       processing (like finished goods, intermediate goods, or crude materials for further processing). There is an
       International Price Index based on the prices of merchandise that is exported or imported. An Employment
       Cost Index measures wage inflation in the labor market. The GDP deflator, which the Bureau of Economic
       Analysis measures, is a price index that includes all the GDP components (that is, consumption plus
       investment plus government plus exports minus imports). Unlike the CPI, its baskets are not fixed but re-
       calculate what that year's GDP would have been worth using the base-year's prices. MIT's Billion Prices Project
       is a more recent alternative attempt to measure prices: economists collect data online from retailers and then
       put them into an index that they compare to the CPI (Source: http://bpp.mit.edu/usa/).

       What's the best measure of inflation? If one is concerned with the most accurate measure of inflation, one
       should use the GDP deflator as it picks up the prices of goods and services produced. However, it is not a good

measure of the cost of living as it includes prices of many products not purchased by households (for example,
aircraft, fire engines, factory buildings, office complexes, and bulldozers). If one wants the most accurate
measure of inflation as it impacts households, one should use the CPI, as it only picks up prices of products
purchased by households. That is why economists sometimes refer to the CPI as the cost-of-living index. As the
Bureau of Labor Statistics states on its website: "The `best' measure of inflation for a given application depends
on the intended use of the data."

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Identify patterns of inflation for the United States using data from the Consumer Price Index
  · Identify patterns of inflation on an international level
In the last three decades, inflation has been relatively low in the U.S. economy, with the Consumer Price Index
typically rising 2% to 4% per year. Looking back over the twentieth century, there have been several periods
where inflation caused the price level to rise at double-digit rates, but nothing has come close to
hyperinflation.

Historical Inflation in the U.S. Economy

Figure 22.3 (a) shows the level of prices in the Consumer Price Index stretching back to 1913. In this case, the
base years (when the CPI is defined as 100) are set for the average level of prices that existed from 1982 to
1984. Figure 22.3 (b) shows the annual percentage changes in the CPI over time, which is the inflation rate.

FIGURE 22.3 U.S. Price Level and Inflation Rates since 1947 Graph a shows the trends in the U.S. price level from
the year 1947 to 2020. In 1947, the graph starts out close to 22. It gradually increases until about 1973, then
increases more rapidly through the remainder of the 1970s and beyond, with periodic dips, until 2020, when it
reached around 260. Graph b shows the trends in U.S. inflation rates from the year 1948 to 2020. In 1948, the

until settling to around 1.2% in 2020.

       Inflation as measured by the consumer price index reflects the annual percentage change in the cost to the
       average consumer of acquiring a basket of goods and services that may be fixed or changed at specified
       intervals, such as yearly.
       The first two waves of inflation are easy to characterize in historical terms: they are right after World War I and
       World War II. However, there are also two periods of severe negative inflation--called deflation--in the early
       decades of the twentieth century: one following the deep 1920-21 recession and the other during the Great
       Depression of the 1930s. (Since inflation is a time when the buying power of money in terms of goods and
       services is reduced, deflation will be a time when the buying power of money in terms of goods and services
       increases.) For the period from 1900 to about 1960, the major inflations and deflations nearly balanced each
       other out, so the average annual rate of inflation over these years was only about 1% per year. A third wave of
       more severe inflation arrived in the 1970s and departed in the early 1980s.

       Times of recession or depression often seem to be times when the inflation rate is lower, as in the recession of
       1920-1921, the Great Depression, the recession of 1980-1982, and the Great Recession in 2008-2009. There
       were a few months in 2009 that were deflationary, but not at an annual rate. High levels of unemployment
       typically accompany recessions, and the total demand for goods falls, pulling the price level down. Conversely,
       the rate of inflation often, but not always, seems to start moving up when the economy is growing very strongly,
       like right after wartime or during the 1960s. The frameworks for macroeconomic analysis, that we developed
       in other chapters, will explain why recession often accompanies higher unemployment and lower inflation,
       while rapid economic growth often brings lower unemployment but higher inflation.

      Inflation around the World

       Around the rest of the world, the pattern of inflation has been very mixed; Figure 22.4 shows inflation rates
       over the last several decades. Many industrialized countries, not just the United States, had relatively high
       inflation rates in the 1970s. For example, in 1975, Japan's inflation rate was over 8% and the inflation rate for
       the United Kingdom was almost 25%. In the 1980s, inflation rates came down in the United States and in
       Europe and have largely stayed down.

FIGURE 22.4 Countries with Relatively Low Inflation Rates, 1961-2020 This chart shows the annual percentage
change in consumer prices compared with the previous year's consumer prices in the United States, the United
Kingdom, Japan, and Germany.
Countries with controlled economies in the 1970s, like the Soviet Union and China, historically had very low
rates of measured inflation--because prices were forbidden to rise by law, except for the cases where the
government deemed a price increase to be due to quality improvements. However, these countries also had
perpetual shortages of goods, since forbidding prices to rise acts like a price ceiling and creates a situation
where quantity demanded often exceeds quantity supplied. As Russia and China made a transition toward
more market-oriented economies, they also experienced outbursts of inflation, although we should regard the
statistics for these economies as somewhat shakier. Inflation in China averaged about 10% per year for much
of the 1980s and early 1990s, although it has dropped off since then. Russia experienced hyperinflation--an
outburst of high inflation--of 2,500% per year in the early 1990s, although by 2006 Russia's consumer price
inflation had dipped below 10% per year, as Figure 22.5 shows. The closest the United States has ever reached
hyperinflation was during the 1860-1865 Civil War, in the Confederate states.

Many countries in Latin America experienced raging inflation during the 1980s and early 1990s, with inflation
rates often well above 100% per year. In 1990, for example, both Brazil and Argentina saw inflation climb
above 2000%. Certain countries in Africa experienced extremely high rates of inflation, sometimes bordering
on hyperinflation, in the 1990s. Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa, had an inflation rate of 75% in
1995.

In the early 2000s, the problem of inflation appears to have diminished for most countries, at least in
comparison to the worst times of recent decades. As we noted in this earlier Bring it Home feature, in recent
years, the world's worst example of hyperinflation was in Zimbabwe, where at one point the government was
issuing bills with a face value of $100 trillion (in Zimbabwean dollars)--that is, the bills had
$100,000,000,000,000 written on the front, but were almost worthless. In many countries, the memory of
double-digit, triple-digit, and even quadruple-digit inflation is not very far in the past.

22.4 The Confusion Over Inflation

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Explain how inflation can cause redistributions of purchasing power
  · Identify ways inflation can blur the perception of supply and demand
  · Explain the economic benefits and challenges of inflation

Economists usually oppose high inflation, but they oppose it in a milder way than many non-economists.
Robert Shiller, one of 2013's Nobel Prize winners in economics, carried out several surveys during the 1990s
about attitudes toward inflation. One of his questions asked, "Do you agree that preventing high inflation is an
important national priority, as important as preventing drug use or preventing deterioration in the quality of
our schools?" Answers were on a scale of 1-5, where 1 meant "Fully agree" and 5 meant "Completely
disagree." For the U.S. population as a whole, 52% answered "Fully agree" that preventing high inflation was a
highly important national priority and just 4% said "Completely disagree." However, among professional
economists, only 18% answered "Fully agree," while the same percentage of 18% answered "Completely
disagree."

The Land of Funny Money

What are the economic problems caused by inflation, and why do economists often regard them with less
concern than the general public? Consider a very short story: "The Land of Funny Money."

One morning, everyone in the Land of Funny Money awakened to find that everything denominated in money
had increased by 20%. The change was completely unexpected. Every price in every store was 20% higher.
Paychecks were 20% higher. Interest rates were 20 % higher. The amount of money, everywhere from wallets
to savings accounts, was 20% larger. This overnight inflation of prices made newspaper headlines everywhere
in the Land of Funny Money. However, the headlines quickly disappeared, as people realized that in terms of
what they could actually buy with their incomes, this inflation had no economic impact. Everyone's pay could
still buy exactly the same set of goods as it did before. Everyone's savings were still sufficient to buy exactly the
same car, vacation, or retirement that they could have bought before. Equal levels of inflation in all wages and
prices ended up not mattering much at all.

When the people in Robert Shiller's surveys explained their concern about inflation, one typical reason was
that they feared that as prices rose, they would not be able to afford to buy as much. In other words, people
were worried because they did not live in a place like the Land of Funny Money, where all prices and wages
rose simultaneously. Instead, people live here on Planet Earth, where prices might rise while wages do not rise
at all, or where wages rise more slowly than prices.

Economists note that over most periods, the inflation level in prices is roughly similar to the inflation level in
wages, and so they reason that, on average, over time, people's economic status is not greatly changed by
548 22 · Inflation

       inflation. If all prices, wages, and interest rates adjusted automatically and immediately with inflation, as in the
       Land of Funny Money, then no one's purchasing power, profits, or real loan payments would change. However,
       if other economic variables do not move exactly in sync with inflation, or if they adjust for inflation only after a
       time lag, then inflation can cause three types of problems: unintended redistributions of purchasing power,
       blurred price signals, and difficulties in long-term planning.

      Unintended Redistributions of Purchasing Power

       Inflation can cause redistributions of purchasing power that hurt some and help others. People who are hurt
       by inflation include those who are holding considerable cash, whether it is in a safe deposit box or in a
       cardboard box under the bed. When inflation happens, the buying power of cash diminishes. However, cash is
       only an example of a more general problem: anyone who has financial assets invested in a way that the
       nominal return does not keep up with inflation will tend to be affected by inflation. For example, if a person
       has money in a bank account that pays 4% interest, but inflation rises to 5%, then the real rate of return for the
       money invested in that bank account is negative 1%.
       The problem of a good-looking nominal interest rate transforming into an ugly-looking real interest rate can
       be worsened by taxes. The U.S. income tax is charged on the nominal interest received in dollar terms, without
       an adjustment for inflation. Thus, the government taxes a person who invests $10,000 and receives a 5%
       nominal rate of interest on the $500 received--no matter whether the inflation rate is 0%, 5%, or 10%. If
       inflation is 0%, then the real interest rate is 5% and all $500 is a gain in buying power. However, if inflation is
       5%, then the real interest rate is zero and the person had no real gain--but owes income tax on the nominal
       gain anyway. If inflation is 10%, then the real interest rate is negative 5% and the person is actually falling
       behind in buying power, but would still owe taxes on the $500 in nominal gains.
       Inflation can cause unintended redistributions for wage earners, too. Wages do typically creep up with inflation
       over time, eventually. The last row of Table 22.1 at the start of this chapter showed that the average hourly
       wage in manufacturing in the U.S. economy increased from $3.23 in 1970 to $30.11 in 2021, which is an
       increase by a factor of close to ten. Over that time period, the Consumer Price Index increased by about a
       factor of eight. However, increases in wages may lag behind inflation for a year or two, since wage adjustments
       are often somewhat sticky and occur only once or twice a year. Moreover, the extent to which wages keep up
       with inflation creates insecurity for workers and may involve painful, prolonged conflicts between employers
       and employees. If the government adjusts minimum wage for inflation only infrequently, minimum wage
       workers are losing purchasing power from their nominal wages, as Figure 22.6 shows.

FIGURE 22.6 U.S. Minimum Wage and Inflation After adjusting for inflation, the federal minimum wage dropped
about 30 percent from 1965-2020, even though the nominal figure climbed from $1.40 to $7.25 per hour.
Increases in the minimum wage in between 2008 and 2010 kept the decline from being worse--as it would have
been if the wage had remained the same as it did from 1997 through 2007. Since 2010, the real minimum wage has
continued to decline. (Sources: http://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/chart.htm and http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/

One sizable group of people has often received a large share of their income in a form that does not increase
over time: retirees who receive a private company pension. Most pensions have traditionally been set as a fixed
nominal dollar amount per year at retirement. For this reason, economists call pensions "defined benefits"
plans. Even if inflation is low, the combination of inflation and a fixed income can create a substantial problem
over time. A person who retires on a fixed income at age 65 will find that losing just 1% to 2% of buying power
per year to inflation compounds to a considerable loss of buying power after a decade or two.
Fortunately, pensions and other defined benefits retirement plans are increasingly rare, replaced instead by
"defined contribution" plans, such as 401(k)s and 403(b)s. In these plans, the employer contributes a fixed
amount to the worker's retirement account on a regular basis (usually every pay check). The employee often
contributes as well. The worker invests these funds in a wide range of investment vehicles. These plans are tax
deferred, and they are portable so that if the individual takes a job with a different employer, their 401(k)
comes with them. To the extent that the investments made generate real rates of return, retirees are not
burdened by the inflation costs of traditional pensioners.
However, ordinary people can sometimes benefit from the unintended redistributions of inflation. Consider
someone who borrows $10,000 to buy a car at a fixed interest rate of 9%. If inflation is 3% at the time the loan
is made, then the borrower must repay the loan at a real interest rate of 6%. However, if inflation rises to 9%,
then the real interest rate on the loan is zero. In this case, the borrower's benefit from inflation is the lender's
loss. A borrower paying a fixed interest rate, who benefits from inflation, is just the flip side of an investor
receiving a fixed interest rate, who suffers from inflation. The lesson is that when interest rates are fixed, rises
in the rate of inflation tend to penalize suppliers of financial capital, who receive repayment in dollars that are
550 22 · Inflation

       worth less because of inflation, while demanders of financial capital end up better off, because they can repay
       their loans in dollars that are worth less than originally expected.

       The unintended redistributions of buying power that inflation causes may have a broader effect on society.
       America's widespread acceptance of market forces rests on a perception that people's actions have a
       reasonable connection to market outcomes. When inflation causes a retiree who built up a pension or invested
       at a fixed interest rate to suffer, however, while someone who borrowed at a fixed interest rate benefits from
       inflation, it is hard to believe that this outcome was deserved in any way. Similarly, when homeowners benefit
       from inflation because the price of their homes rises, while renters suffer because they are paying higher rent,
       it is hard to see any useful incentive effects. One of the reasons that the general public dislikes inflation is a
       sense that it makes economic rewards and penalties more arbitrary--and therefore likely to be perceived as
       unfair - even dangerous, as the next Clear It Up feature shows.

                CLEAR IT UP

      Is there a connection between German hyperinflation and Hitler's rise to power?

       Germany suffered an intense hyperinflation of its currency, the Mark, in the years after World War I, when the
       Weimar Republic in Germany resorted to printing money to pay its bills and the onset of the Great Depression
       created the social turmoil that Adolf Hitler was able to take advantage of in his rise to power. Shiller described the
       connection this way in a National Bureau of Economic Research 1996 Working Paper:

             A fact that is probably little known to young people today, even in Germany, is that the final collapse of the
             Mark in 1923, the time when the Mark's inflation reached astronomical levels (inflation of 35,974.9% in
             November 1923 alone, for an annual rate that month of 4.69 × 1028%), came in the same month as did
             Hitler's Beer Hall Putsch, his Nazi Party's armed attempt to overthrow the German government. This failed
             putsch resulted in Hitler's imprisonment, at which time he wrote his book Mein Kampf, setting forth an
             inspirational plan for Germany's future, suggesting plans for world domination. . .

             . . . Most people in Germany today probably do not clearly remember these events; this lack of attention to
             it may be because its memory is blurred by the more dramatic events that succeeded it (the Nazi seizure of
             power and World War II). However, to someone living through these historical events in sequence . . . [the
             putsch] may have been remembered as vivid evidence of the potential effects of inflation.

      Blurred Price Signals

       Prices are the messengers in a market economy, conveying information about conditions of demand and
       supply. Inflation blurs those price messages. Inflation means that we perceive price signals more vaguely, like
       a radio program received with considerable static. If the static becomes severe, it is hard to tell what is
       happening.

       In Israel, when inflation accelerated to an annual rate of 500% in 1985, some stores stopped posting prices
       directly on items, since they would have had to put new labels on the items or shelves every few days to reflect
       inflation. Instead, a shopper just took items from a shelf and went up to the checkout register to find out the
       price for that day. Obviously, this situation makes comparing prices and shopping for the best deal rather
       difficult. When the levels and changes of prices become uncertain, businesses and individuals find it harder to
       react to economic signals. In a world where inflation is at a high rate, but bouncing up and down to some
       extent, does a higher price of a good mean that inflation has risen, or that supply of that good has decreased, or
       that demand for that good has increased? Should a buyer of the good take the higher prices as an economic
       hint to start substituting other products--or have the prices of the substitutes risen by an equal amount?
       Should a seller of the good take a higher price as a reason to increase production--or is the higher price only a
       sign of a general inflation in which the prices of all inputs to production are rising as well? The true story will
       presumably become clear over time, but at a given moment, who can say?

High and variable inflation means that the incentives in the economy to adjust in response to changes in prices
are weaker. Markets will adjust toward their equilibrium prices and quantities more erratically and slowly, and
many individual markets will experience a greater chance of surpluses and shortages.

Problems of Long-Term Planning

Inflation can make long-term planning difficult. In discussing unintended redistributions, we considered the
case of someone trying to plan for retirement with a pension that is fixed in nominal terms and a high rate of
inflation. Similar problems arise for all people trying to save for retirement, because they must consider what
their money will really buy several decades in the future when we cannot know the rate of future inflation.
Inflation, especially at moderate or high levels, will pose substantial planning problems for businesses, too. A
firm can make money from inflation--for example, by paying bills and wages as late as possible so that it can
pay in inflated dollars, while collecting revenues as soon as possible. A firm can also suffer losses from
inflation, as in the case of a retail business that gets stuck holding too much cash, only to see inflation eroding
the value of that cash. However, when a business spends its time focusing on how to profit by inflation, or at
least how to avoid suffering from it, an inevitable tradeoff strikes: less time is spent on improving products and
services or on figuring out how to make existing products and services more cheaply. An economy with high
inflation rewards businesses that have found clever ways of profiting from inflation, which are not necessarily
the businesses that excel at productivity, innovation, or quality of service.
In the short term, low or moderate levels of inflation may not pose an overwhelming difficulty for business
planning, because costs of doing business and sales revenues may rise at similar rates. If, however, inflation
varies substantially over the short or medium term, then it may make sense for businesses to stick to shorter-
term strategies. The evidence as to whether relatively low rates of inflation reduce productivity is controversial
among economists. There is some evidence that if inflation can be held to moderate levels of less than 3% per
year, it need not prevent a nation's real economy from growing at a healthy pace. For some countries that have
experienced hyperinflation of several thousand percent per year, an annual inflation rate of 20-30% may feel
basically the same as zero. However, several economists have pointed to the suggestive fact that when U.S.
inflation heated up in the early 1970s--to 10%--U.S. growth in productivity slowed down, and when inflation
slowed down in the 1980s, productivity edged up again not long thereafter, as Figure 22.7 shows.

FIGURE 22.7 U.S. Inflation Rate and U.S. Labor Productivity, 1961-2020 Over the last several decades in the United
States, there have been times when rising inflation rates have been closely followed by lower productivity rates and
lower inflation rates have corresponded to increasing productivity rates. As the graph shows, however, this
correlation does not always exist.

      Any Benefits of Inflation?

       Although the economic effects of inflation are primarily negative, two countervailing points are worth noting.
       First, the impact of inflation will differ considerably according to whether it is creeping up slowly at 0% to 2%
       per year, galloping along at 10% to 20% per year, or racing to the point of hyperinflation at, say, 40% per
       month. Hyperinflation can rip an economy and a society apart. An annual inflation rate of 2%, 3%, or 4%,
       however, is a long way from a national crisis. Low inflation is also better than deflation which occurs with
       severe recessions.

       Second, economists sometimes argue that moderate inflation may help the economy by making wages in labor
       markets more flexible. The discussion in Unemployment pointed out that wages tend to be sticky in their
       downward movements and that unemployment can result. A little inflation could nibble away at real wages,
       and thus help real wages to decline if necessary. In this way, even if a moderate or high rate of inflation may act
       as sand in the gears of the economy, perhaps a low rate of inflation serves as oil for the gears of the labor
       market. This argument is controversial. A full analysis would have to account for all the effects of inflation. It
       does, however, offer another reason to believe that, all things considered, very low rates of inflation may not be
       especially harmful.

     22.5 Indexing and Its Limitations

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain the relationship between indexing and inflation
         · Identify three ways the government can control inflation through macroeconomic policy

       When a price, wage, or interest rate is adjusted automatically with inflation, economists use the term indexed.
       An indexed payment increases according to the index number that measures inflation. Those in private
       markets and government programs observe a wide range of indexing arrangements. Since the negative effects
       of inflation depend in large part on having inflation unexpectedly affect one part of the economy but not
       another--say, increasing the prices that people pay but not the wages that workers receive--indexing will take
       some of the sting out of inflation.

      Indexing in Private Markets

       In the 1970s and 1980s, labor unions commonly negotiated wage contracts that had cost-of-living
       adjustments (COLAs) which guaranteed that their wages would keep up with inflation. These contracts were
       sometimes written as, for example, COLA plus 3%. Thus, if inflation was 5%, the wage increase would
       automatically be 8%, but if inflation rose to 9%, the wage increase would automatically be 12%. COLAs are a
       form of indexing applied to wages.

       Loans often have built-in inflation adjustments, too, so that if the inflation rate rises by two percentage points,
       then the interest rate that a financial institution charges on the loan rises by two percentage points as well. An
       adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) is a type of loan that one can use to purchase a home in which the interest
       rate varies with the rate of inflation. Often, a borrower will be able to receive a lower interest rate if borrowing
       with an ARM, compared to a fixed-rate loan. The reason is that with an ARM, the lender is protected against the
       risk that higher inflation will reduce the real loan payments, and so the risk premium part of the interest rate
       can be correspondingly lower.

       A number of ongoing or long-term business contracts also have provisions that prices will adjust automatically
       according to inflation. Sellers like such contracts because they are not locked into a low nominal selling price if
       inflation turns out higher than expected. Buyers like such contracts because they are not locked into a high
       buying price if inflation turns out to be lower than expected. A contract with automatic adjustments for
       inflation in effect agrees on a real price for the borrower to pay, rather than a nominal price.

Indexing in Government Programs

Many government programs are indexed to inflation. The U.S. income tax code is designed so that as a person's
income rises above certain levels, the tax rate on the marginal income earned rises as well. That is what the
expression "move into a higher tax bracket" means. For example, according to the basic tax tables from the
Internal Revenue Service, in 2020, a married person filing jointly owed 10% of all taxable income from $0 to
$19,750; 12% of all income from $19,751 to $80,250; 22% of all taxable income from $80,251 to $171,050;
24% of all taxable income from $171,051 to $326,600; 32% of all taxable income from $326,601 to $414,700;
35% of all taxable income from $414,701 to $622,050; and 37% of all income from $622,051 and above.

Because of the many complex provisions in the rest of the tax code, it is difficult to determine exactly the taxes
an individual owes the government based on these numbers, but the numbers illustrate the basic theme that
tax rates rise as the marginal dollar of income rises. Until the late 1970s, if nominal wages increased along
with inflation, people were moved into higher tax brackets and owed a higher proportion of their income in
taxes, even though their real income had not risen. In 1981, the government eliminated this "bracket creep".
Now, the income levels where higher tax rates kick in are indexed to rise automatically with inflation.

The Social Security program offers two examples of indexing. Since the passage of the Social Security Indexing
Act of 1972, the level of Social Security benefits increases each year along with the Consumer Price Index. Also,
Social Security is funded by payroll taxes, which the government imposes on the income earned up to a certain
amount--$137,700 in 2020. The government adjusts this level of income upward each year according to the
rate of inflation, so that an indexed increase in the Social Security tax base accompanies the indexed rise in the
benefit level.

As yet another example of a government program affected by indexing, in 1996 the U.S., government began
offering indexed bonds. Bonds are means by which the U.S. government (and many private-sector companies
as well) borrows money; that is, investors buy the bonds, and then the government repays the money with
interest. Traditionally, government bonds have paid a fixed rate of interest. This policy gave a government that
had borrowed an incentive to encourage inflation, because it could then repay its past borrowing in inflated
dollars at a lower real interest rate. However, indexed bonds promise to pay a certain real rate of interest above
whatever inflation rate occurs. In the case of a retiree trying to plan for the long term and worried about the
risk of inflation, for example, indexed bonds that guarantee a rate of return higher than inflation--no matter
the level of inflation--can be a very comforting investment.

Might Indexing Reduce Concern over Inflation?

Indexing may seem like an obviously useful step. After all, when individuals, firms, and government programs
are indexed against inflation, then people can worry less about arbitrary redistributions and other effects of
inflation.

However, some of the fiercest opponents of inflation express grave concern about indexing. They point out that
indexing is always partial. Not every employer will provide COLAs for workers. Not all companies can assume
that costs and revenues will rise in lockstep with the general rates of inflation. Not all interest rates for
borrowers and savers will change to match inflation exactly. However, as partial inflation indexing spreads, the
political opposition to inflation may diminish. After all, older people whose Social Security benefits are
protected against inflation, or banks that have loaned their money with adjustable-rate loans, no longer have
as much reason to care whether inflation heats up. In a world where some people are indexed against inflation
and some are not, financially savvy businesses and investors may seek out ways to be protected against
inflation, while the financially unsophisticated and small businesses may feel it the most.

A Preview of Policy Discussions of Inflation

This chapter has focused on how economists measure inflation, historical experience with inflation, how to
adjust nominal variables into real ones, how inflation affects the economy, and how indexing works. We have
554 22 · Inflation

       barely hinted at the causes of inflation, and we have not addressed government policies to deal with inflation.
       We will examine these issues in depth in other chapters. However, it is useful to offer a preview here.
       We can sum up the cause of inflation in one phrase: Too many dollars chasing too few goods. The great surges
       of inflation early in the twentieth century came after wars, which are a time when government spending is very
       high, but consumers have little to buy, because production is going to the war effort. Governments also
       commonly impose price controls during wartime. After the war, the price controls end and pent-up buying
       power surges forth, driving up inflation. Otherwise, if too few dollars are chasing too many goods, then
       inflation will decline or even turn into deflation. Therefore, we typically associate slowdowns in economic
       activity, as in major recessions and the Great Depression, with a reduction in inflation or even outright
       deflation.
       The policy implications are clear. If we are to avoid inflation, the amount of purchasing power in the economy
       must grow at roughly the same rate as the production of goods. Macroeconomic policies that the government
       can use to affect the amount of purchasing power--through taxes, spending, and regulation of interest rates
       and credit--can thus cause inflation to rise or reduce inflation to lower levels.

                BRING IT HOME
      Inflation in a Pandemic--A Return to the 1970s, or a Temporary Adjustment?

       The pandemic-induced recession caused all sorts of disruptions to our economy, including inflation. During the
       pandemic, the prices for goods like gas and cars fell as people shifted to remote work and canceled travel plans. But
       as the economy started to recover from the pandemic in early 2021, we started to see large increases in these
       prices. Higher prices were also fueled by the injections of cash into the economy through stimulus checks and
       unemployment benefits. The pandemic also caused shortages throughout the global supply chain, further pushing
       prices up (you'll learn more about this idea in a few chapters when we talk about aggregate supply and demand).
       With headline annualized inflation rates in 2021 exceeding 6%, the question in the next few years is whether we'll
       see permanently high inflation rates of 9%, 10%, or more, like we did in the 1970s and early-1980s. Some
       economists believe the pandemic-induced inflation is just a transitory adjustment--indeed, used car and gasoline
       prices rose dramatically in 2010 and 2011 as well, as we were recovering from the Great Recession. Others are
       more concerned that the inflation is permanent. Shortages continue to exist throughout the economy as of early
       2022, and if consumers expect higher inflation, it can be a self-fulfilling prophecy, as they start buying things now in
       order to avoid future bouts of inflation.
       As you learned about earlier, inflation is a major concern of consumers, if less of an issue among economists. But
       inflation should be matched by increases in living standards, otherwise there could be major implications for the
       economy.

Key Concepts and Summary

22.1 Tracking Inflation

Economists measure the price level by using a basket of goods and services and calculating how the total cost
of buying that basket of goods will increase over time. Economists often express the price level in terms of
index numbers, which transform the cost of buying the basket of goods and services into a series of numbers
in the same proportion to each other, but with an arbitrary base year of 100. We measure the inflation rate as
the percentage change between price levels or index numbers over time.

22.2 How to Measure Changes in the Cost of Living

Measuring price levels with a fixed basket of goods will always have two problems: the substitution bias, by
which a fixed basket of goods does not allow for buying more of what becomes relatively less expensive and
less of what becomes relatively more expensive; and the quality/new goods bias, by which a fixed basket
cannot account for improvements in quality and the advent of new goods. These problems can be reduced in
556 22 · Self-Check Questions

degree--for example, by allowing the basket of goods to evolve over time--but we cannot totally eliminate them.
The most commonly cited measure of inflation is the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is based on a basket of
goods representing what the typical consumer buys. The Core Inflation Index further breaks down the CPI by
excluding volatile economic commodities. Several price indices are not based on baskets of consumer goods.
The GDP deflator is based on all GDP components. The Producer Price Index is based on prices of supplies and
inputs bought by producers of goods and services. An Employment Cost Index measures wage inflation in the
labor market. An International Price Index is based on the prices of merchandise that is exported or imported.

22.3 How the U.S. and Other Countries Experience Inflation

In the U.S. economy, the annual inflation rate in the last two decades has typically been around 2% to 4%. The
periods of highest inflation in the United States in the twentieth century occurred during the years after World
Wars I and II, and in the 1970s. The period of lowest inflation--actually, with deflation--was the 1930s Great
Depression.

22.4 The Confusion Over Inflation

Unexpected inflation will tend to hurt those whose money received, in terms of wages and interest payments,
does not rise with inflation. In contrast, inflation can help those who owe money that they can pay in less
valuable, inflated dollars. Low rates of inflation have relatively little economic impact over the short term. Over
the medium and the long term, even low rates of inflation can complicate future planning. High rates of
inflation can muddle price signals in the short term and prevent market forces from operating efficiently, and
can vastly complicate long-term savings and investment decisions.

22.5 Indexing and Its Limitations

A payment is indexed if it is automatically adjusted for inflation. Examples of indexing in the private sector
include wage contracts with cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) and loan agreements like adjustable-rate
mortgages (ARMs). Examples of indexing in the public sector include tax brackets and Social Security
payments.

     for a new highway benefit or lose?

 9. How should an increase in inflation affect the interest rate on an adjustable-rate mortgage?

10. A fixed-rate mortgage has the same interest rate over the life of the loan, whether the mortgage is for 15 or
      30 years. By contrast, an adjustable-rate mortgage changes with market interest rates over the life of the
      mortgage. If inflation falls unexpectedly by 3%, what would likely happen to a homeowner with an
      adjustable-rate mortgage?

Critical Thinking Questions

22. Inflation rates, like most statistics, are imperfect measures. Can you identify some ways that the inflation
      rate for fruit does not perfectly capture the rising price of fruit?

23. Given the federal budget deficit in recent years, some economists have argued that by adjusting Social
      Security payments for inflation using the CPI, Social Security is overpaying recipients. What is their
      argument, and do you agree or disagree with it?

24. Why is the GDP deflator not an accurate measure of inflation as it impacts a household?

25. Imagine that the government statisticians who calculate the inflation rate have been updating the basic
      basket of goods once every 10 years, but now they decide to update it every five years. How will this
      change affect the amount of substitution bias and quality/new goods bias?

26. Describe a situation, either a government policy situation, an economic problem, or a private sector
      situation, where using the CPI to convert from nominal to real would be more appropriate than using the
      GDP deflator.

27. Describe a situation, either a government policy situation, an economic problem, or a private sector
      situation, where using the GDP deflator to convert from nominal to real would be more appropriate than
      using the CPI.

28. Why do you think the U.S. experience with inflation over the last 50 years has been so much milder than in
      many other countries?

29. If, over time, wages and salaries on average rise at least as fast as inflation, why do people worry about
      how inflation affects incomes?

30. Who in an economy is the big winner from inflation?

31. If a government gains from unexpected inflation when it borrows, why would it choose to offer indexed
      bonds?

32. Do you think perfect indexing is possible? Why or why not?

Problems

33. The index number representing the price level changes from 110 to 115 in one year, and then from 115 to
      120 the next year. Since the index number increases by five each year, is five the inflation rate each year?
      Is the inflation rate the same each year? Explain your answer.

34. The total price of purchasing a basket of goods in the United Kingdom over four years is: year 1=£940,
      year 2=£970, year 3=£1000, and year 4=£1070. Calculate two price indices, one using year 1 as the base
      year (set equal to 100) and the other using year 4 as the base year (set equal to 100). Then, calculate the
      inflation rate based on the first price index. If you had used the other price index, would you get a different
      inflation rate? If you are unsure, do the calculation and find out.

35. Within 1 or 2 percentage points, what has the U.S. inflation rate been during the last 20 years? Draw a
      graph to show the data.

Introduction to the International Trade and Capital Flows

More than Meets the Eye in the Congo

How much do you interact with the global financial system? Do you think not much? Think again. Suppose you take
562 23 · The International Trade and Capital Flows

       out a student loan, or you deposit money into your bank account. You just affected domestic savings and borrowing.
       Now say you are at the mall and buy two T-shirts "made in China," and later contribute to a charity that helps
       refugees. What is the impact? You affected how much money flows into and out of the United States. If you open an
       IRA savings account and put money in an international mutual fund, you are involved in the flow of money overseas.
       While your involvement may not seem as influential as that of someone like the president, who can increase or
       decrease foreign aid and, thereby, have a huge impact on money flows in and out of the country, you do interact with
       the global financial system on a daily basis.

       The balance of payments--a term you will meet soon--seems like a huge topic, but once you learn the specific
       components of trade and money, it all makes sense. Along the way, you may have to give up some common
       misunderstandings about trade and answer some questions: If a country is running a trade deficit, is that bad? Is a
       trade surplus good? For example, look at the Democratic Republic of the Congo (often referred to as "Congo"), a
       large country in Central Africa. In 2013, it ran a trade surplus of $1 billion, so it must be doing well, right? In
       contrast, the trade deficit in the United States was $508 billion in 2013. Do these figures suggest that the United
       States economy is performing worse than the Congolese economy? Not necessarily. The U.S. trade deficit tends to
       worsen as the economy strengthens. In contrast, high poverty rates in the Congo persist, and these rates are not
       going down even with the positive trade balance. Clearly, it is more complicated than simply asserting that running a
       trade deficit is bad for the economy. You will learn more about these issues and others in this chapter.

       The balance of trade (or trade balance) is any gap between a nation's dollar value of its exports, or what its
       producers sell abroad, and a nation's dollar value of imports, or the foreign-made products and services that
       households and businesses purchase. Recall from The Macroeconomic Perspective that if exports exceed
       imports, the economy has a trade surplus. If imports exceed exports, the economy has a trade deficit. If exports
       and imports are equal, then trade is balanced, but what happens when trade is out of balance and large trade
       surpluses or deficits exist?

       Germany, for example, has had substantial trade surpluses in recent decades, in which exports have greatly
       exceeded imports. According to the World Bank, in 2020, Germany ran a trade surplus of $242 billion. In
       contrast, the U.S. economy in recent decades has experienced large trade deficits, in which imports have
       considerably exceeded exports. In 2020, for example, U.S. imports exceeded exports by $651 billion.

       A series of financial crises triggered by unbalanced trade can lead economies into deep recessions. These
       crises begin with large trade deficits. At some point, foreign investors become pessimistic about the economy
       and move their money to other countries. The economy then drops into deep recession, with real GDP often
       falling up to 10% or more in a single year. This happened to Mexico in 1995 when their GDP fell 8.1%. A
       number of countries in East Asia--Thailand, South Korea, Malaysia, and Indonesia--succumbed to the same
       economic illness in 1997-1998 (called the Asian Financial Crisis). In the late 1990s and into the early 2000s,
       Russia and Argentina had the identical experience. What are the connections between imbalances of trade in
       goods and services and the flows of international financial capital that set off these economic avalanches?

       We will start by examining the balance of trade in more detail, by looking at some patterns of trade balances in
       the United States and around the world. Then we will examine the intimate connection between international
       flows of goods and services and international flows of financial capital, which to economists are really just two
       sides of the same coin. People often assume that trade surpluses like those in Germany must be a positive sign
       for an economy, while trade deficits like those in the United States must be harmful. As it turns out, both trade
       surpluses and deficits can be either good or bad. We will see why in this chapter.

23.1 Measuring Trade Balances

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Explain merchandise trade balance, current account balance, and unilateral transfers
  · Identify components of the U.S. current account balance
  · Calculate the merchandise trade balance and current account balance using import and export data for a

      country

A few decades ago, it was common to track the solid or physical items that planes, trains, and trucks
transported between countries as a way of measuring the balance of trade. Economists call this measurement
the merchandise trade balance. In most high-income economies, including the United States, goods comprise
less than half of a country's total production, while services comprise more than half. The last two decades
have seen a surge in international trade in services, powered by technological advances in
telecommunications and computers that have made it possible to export or import customer services, finance,
law, advertising, management consulting, software, construction engineering, and product design. Most global
trade still takes the form of goods rather than services, and the government announces and the media
prominently report the merchandise trade balance. Old habits are hard to break. Economists, however,
typically rely on broader measures such as the balance of trade or the current account balance which
includes other international flows of income and foreign aid.

Components of the U.S. Current Account Balance

Table 23.1 breaks down the four main components of the U.S. current account balance for the last quarter of
2015 (seasonally adjusted). The first line shows the merchandise trade balance; that is, exports and imports of
goods. Because imports exceed exports, the trade balance in the final column is negative, showing a
merchandise trade deficit. We can explain how the government collects this trade information in the following
Clear It Up feature.

         CLEAR IT UP

How does the U.S. government collect trade statistics?

Do not confuse the balance of trade (which tracks imports and exports), with the current account balance, which
includes not just exports and imports, but also income from investment and transfers.
564 23 · The International Trade and Capital Flows

       The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) within the U.S. Department of Commerce compiles statistics on the balance
       of trade using a variety of different sources. Merchandise importers and exporters must file monthly documents with
       the Census Bureau, which provides the basic data for tracking trade. To measure international trade in
       services--which can happen over a telephone line or computer network without shipping any physical goods--the
       BEA carries out a set of surveys. Another set of BEA surveys tracks investment flows, and there are even specific
       surveys to collect travel information from U.S. residents visiting Canada and Mexico. For measuring unilateral
       transfers, the BEA has access to official U.S. government spending on aid, and then also carries out a survey of
       charitable organizations that make foreign donations.
       The BEA then cross-checks this information on international flows of goods and capital against other available data.
       For example, the Census Bureau also collects data from the shipping industry, which it can use to check the data on
       trade in goods. All companies involved in international flows of capital--including banks and companies making
       financial investments like stocks--must file reports, which the U.S. Department of the Treasury ultimately checks.
       The BEA also can cross check information on foreign trade by looking at data collected by other countries on their
       foreign trade with the United States, and also at the data collected by various international organizations. Take these
       data sources, stir carefully, and you have the U.S. balance of trade statistics. Much of the statistics that we cite in
       this chapter come from these sources.

       The second row of Table 23.1 provides data on trade in services. Here, the U.S. economy is running a surplus.
       Although the level of trade in services is still relatively small compared to trade in goods, the importance of
       services has expanded substantially over the last few decades. For example, U.S. exports of services were equal
       to about one-half of U.S. exports of goods in 2020, compared to one-fifth in 1980.
       The third component of the current account balance, labeled "income payments," refers to money that U.S.
       financial investors received on their foreign investments (money flowing into the United States) and payments
       to foreign investors who had invested their funds here (money flowing out of the United States). The reason for
       including this money on foreign investment in the overall measure of trade, along with goods and services, is
       that, from an economic perspective, income is just as much an economic transaction as car, wheat, or oil
       shipments: it is just trade that is happening in the financial capital market.
       The final category of the current account balance is unilateral transfers, which are payments that
       government, private charities, or individuals make in which they send money abroad without receiving any
       direct good or service. Economic or military assistance from the U.S. government to other countries fits into
       this category, as does spending abroad by charities to address poverty or social inequalities. When an
       individual in the United States sends money overseas, as is the case with some immigrants, it is also counted
       in this category. The current account balance treats these unilateral payments like imports, because they also
       involve a stream of payments leaving the country. For the U.S. economy, unilateral transfers are almost always
       negative. This pattern, however, does not always hold. In 1991, for example, when the United States led an
       international coalition against Saddam Hussein's Iraq in the Gulf War, many other nations agreed that they
       would make payments to the United States to offset the U.S. war expenses. These payments were large enough
       that, in 1991, the overall U.S. balance on unilateral transfers was a positive $10 billion.

       income payments to calculate the merchandise balance and the current account balance.

TABLE 23.2 Calculating Merchandise Balance and Current Account Balance

Use the information given below to fill in Table 23.2, and then calculate:

  · The merchandise balance
  · The current account balance

Known information:

  · Unilateral transfers: $130
  · Exports in goods: $1,046
  · Exports in services: $509
  · Imports in goods: $1,562
  · Imports in services: $371
  · Income received by U.S. investors on foreign stocks and bonds: $561
  · Income received by foreign investors on U.S. assets: $472

Step 1. Focus on goods and services first. Enter the dollar amount of exports of both goods and services under
the Export column.

Step 2. Enter imports of goods and services under the Import column.

Step 3. Under the Export column and in the row for Income payments, enter the financial flows of money coming
back to the United States. U.S. investors are earning this income from abroad.

Step 4. Under the Import column and in the row for Income payments, enter the financial flows of money going
out of the United States to foreign investors. Foreign investors are earning this money on U.S. assets, like stocks.

Step 5. Unilateral transfers are money flowing out of the United States in the form of, for example, military aid,
foreign aid, and global charities. Because the money leaves the country, enter it under Imports and in the final
column as well, as a negative.

Step 6. Calculate the trade balance by subtracting imports from exports in both goods and services. Enter this in
the final Balance column. This can be positive or negative.

Step 7. Subtract the income payments flowing out of the country (under Imports) from the money coming back to
the United States (under Exports) and enter this amount under the Balance column.

Step 8. Enter unilateral transfers as a negative amount under the Balance column.
566 23 · The International Trade and Capital Flows

Step 9. The merchandise trade balance is the difference between exports of goods and imports of goods--the
first number under Balance.

Step 10. Now sum up your columns for Exports, Imports, and Balance. The final balance number is the current
account balance.

The merchandise balance of trade is the difference between exports and imports. In this case, it is equal to
$1,046 - $1,562, a trade deficit of -$516 billion. The current account balance is -$419 billion. See the
completed Table 23.3.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Analyze graphs of the current account balance and the merchandise trade balance
  · Identify patterns in U.S. trade surpluses and deficits
  · Compare the U.S. trade surpluses and deficits to other countries' trade surpluses and deficits

We present the history of the U.S. current account balance in recent decades in several different ways. Figure
23.2 (a) shows the current account balance and the merchandise trade balance--the latter of which is simply
the balance on goods exported versus imported--in dollar terms. Figure 23.2 (b) shows the current account
balance and merchandise account balance yet again, this time as a share of the GDP for that year. By dividing
the trade deficit in each year by GDP in that year, Figure 23.2 (b) factors out both inflation and growth in the
real economy.

FIGURE 23.2 Current Account Balance and Merchandise Trade Balance, 1960-2020 (a) The current account
balance and the merchandise trade balance in billions of dollars from 1960 to 2020. The merchandise trade balance
is the trade balance on goods only. If the lines are above zero dollars, the United States was running a positive trade
balance and current account balance. If the lines fall below zero dollars, the United States is running a trade deficit
and a deficit in its current account balance. (b) This shows the same items--trade balance and current account
balance--in relationship to the size of the U.S. economy, or GDP, from 1960 to 2020.
By either measure, the U.S. balance of trade pattern is clear. From the 1960s into the 1970s, the U.S. economy
had mostly small trade surpluses--that is, the graphs in Figure 23.2 show positive numbers. However, starting
in the 1980s, the trade deficit increased rapidly, and after a tiny surplus in 1991, the current account trade
deficit became even larger in the late 1990s and into the mid-2000s. However, the trade deficit declined in
2009 after the recession had taken hold, then rebounded partially in 2010 and remained stable up through
2019, before falling again in 2020.

Table 23.4 shows the U.S. trade picture in 2013 compared with some other economies from around the world.
While the U.S. economy has consistently run trade deficits in recent years, Japan and many European nations,
among them France and Germany, have consistently run trade surpluses. Some of the other countries listed
include Brazil, the largest economy in Latin America; Nigeria, along with South Africa competing to be the
largest economy in Africa; and China, India, and Korea. The first column offers one measure of an economy's
globalization: exports of goods and services as a percentage of GDP. The second column shows the trade
balance. Usually, most countries have trade surpluses or deficits that are less than 5% of GDP. As you can see,
the U.S. current account balance is -2.6% of GDP, while Germany's is 8.4% of GDP.

23.3 Trade Balances and Flows of Financial Capital

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Explain the connection between trade balances and financial capital flows
  · Calculate comparative advantage
  · Explain balanced trade in terms of investment and capital flows

As economists see it, trade surpluses can be either good or bad, depending on circumstances, and trade
deficits can be good or bad, too. The challenge is to understand how the international flows of goods and
services are connected with international flows of financial capital. In this module we will illustrate the
intimate connection between trade balances and flows of financial capital in two ways: a parable of trade
between Robinson Crusoe and Friday, and a circular flow diagram representing flows of trade and payments.

A Two-Person Economy: Robinson Crusoe and Friday

To understand how economists view trade deficits and surpluses, consider a parable based on the story of
Robinson Crusoe. Crusoe, as you may remember from the classic novel by Daniel Defoe first published in 1719,
was shipwrecked on a desert island. After living alone for some time, he is joined by a second person, whom he
names Friday. Think about the balance of trade in a two-person economy like that of Robinson and Friday.

Robinson and Friday trade goods and services. Perhaps Robinson catches fish and trades them to Friday for
coconuts, or Friday weaves a hat out of tree fronds and trades it to Robinson for help in carrying water. For a
period of time, each individual trade is self-contained and complete. Because each trade is voluntary, both
Robinson and Friday must feel that they are receiving fair value for what they are giving. As a result, each
person's exports are always equal to his imports, and trade is always in balance between the two. Neither
person experiences either a trade deficit or a trade surplus.

However, one day Robinson approaches Friday with a proposition. Robinson wants to dig ditches for an
irrigation system for his garden, but he knows that if he starts this project, he will not have much time left to
fish and gather coconuts to feed himself each day. He proposes that Friday supply him with a certain number
of fish and coconuts for several months, and then after that time, he promises to repay Friday out of the extra
produce that he will be able to grow in his irrigated garden. If Friday accepts this offer, then a trade imbalance
comes into being. For several months, Friday will have a trade surplus: that is, he is exporting to Robinson
more than he is importing. More precisely, he is giving Robinson fish and coconuts, and at least for the
moment, he is receiving nothing in return. Conversely, Robinson will have a trade deficit, because he is
importing more from Friday than he is exporting.

This parable raises several useful issues in thinking about what a trade deficit and a trade surplus really mean
in economic terms. The first issue that this story of Robinson and Friday raises is this: Is it better to have a
trade surplus or a trade deficit? The answer, as in any voluntary market interaction, is that if both parties agree
to the transaction, then they may both be better off. Over time, if Robinson's irrigated garden is a success, it is
certainly possible that both Robinson and Friday can benefit from this agreement.

The parable raises a second issue: What can go wrong? Robinson's proposal to Friday introduces an element of
uncertainty. Friday is, in effect, making a loan of fish and coconuts to Robinson, and Friday's happiness with
this arrangement will depend on whether Robinson repays that loan as planned, in full and on time. Perhaps
Robinson spends several months loafing and never builds the irrigation system, or perhaps Robinson has been
too optimistic about how much he will be able to grow with the new irrigation system, which turns out not to be
very productive. Perhaps, after building the irrigation system, Robinson decides that he does not want to repay
Friday as much as he previously agreed. Any of these developments will prompt a new round of negotiations
between Friday and Robinson. Why the repayment failed is likely to shape Friday's attitude toward these
renegotiations. If Robinson worked very hard and the irrigation system just did not increase production as
intended, Friday may have some sympathy. If Robinson loafed or if he just refuses to pay, Friday may become
irritated.

A third issue that the parable raises is that an intimate relationship exists between a trade deficit and
international borrowing, and between a trade surplus and international lending. The size of Friday's trade
surplus is exactly how much he is lending to Robinson. The size of Robinson's trade deficit is exactly how much
he is borrowing from Friday. To economists, a trade surplus literally means the same thing as an outflow of
financial capital, and a trade deficit literally means the same thing as an inflow of financial capital. This last
insight is worth exploring in greater detail, which we will do in the following section.

The story of Robinson and Friday also provides a good opportunity to consider the law of comparative
advantage, which you learn more about in the International Trade chapter. The following Work It Out feature
steps you through calculating comparative advantage for the wheat and cloth traded between the United States
and Great Britain in the 1800s.

Calculating Comparative Advantage

In the 1800s, the United States and Britain traded wheat and cloth. Table 23.5 shows the varying hours of labor
per unit of output.

               Wheat (in            Cloth (in       Relative labor cost of wheat  Relative labor cost of cloth
                bushels)             yards)                       (Pw/Pc)                      (Pc/Pw)

Britain

TABLE 23.5

Step 1. Observe from Table 23.5 that, in the United States, it takes eight hours to supply a bushel of wheat and
nine hours to supply a yard of cloth. In contrast, it takes four hours to supply a bushel of wheat and three hours
to supply a yard of cloth in Britain.

Step 2. Recognize the difference between absolute advantage and comparative advantage. Britain has an
absolute advantage (lowest cost) in each good, since it takes a lower amount of labor to make each good in
Britain. Britain also has a comparative advantage in the production of cloth (lower opportunity cost in cloth (3/4
versus 9/8)). The United States has a comparative advantage in wheat production (lower opportunity cost of 8/9
versus 4/3).

Step 3. Determine the relative price of one good in terms of the other good. The price of wheat, in this example, is
the amount of cloth you have to give up. To find this price, convert the hours per unit of wheat and cloth into units
per hour. To do so, observe that in the United States it takes eight hours to make a bushel of wheat, so workers
can process 1/8 of a bushel of wheat in an hour. It takes nine hours to make a yard of cloth in the United States,
so workers can produce 1/9 of a yard of cloth in an hour. If you divide the amount of cloth (1/9 of a yard) by the
amount of wheat you give up (1/8 of a bushel) in an hour, you find the price (8/9) of one good (wheat) in terms of
the other (cloth).

The Balance of Trade as the Balance of Payments

The connection between trade balances and international flows of financial capital is so close that economists
sometimes describe the balance of trade as the balance of payments. Each category of the current account
balance involves a corresponding flow of payments between a given country and the rest of the world economy.

Figure 23.3 shows the flow of goods and services and payments between one country--the United States in this
example--and the rest of the world. The top line shows U.S. exports of goods and services, while the second line
shows financial payments from purchasers in other countries back to the U.S. economy. The third line then
shows U.S. imports of goods, services, and investment, and the fourth line shows payments from the home
economy to the rest of the world. Flow of goods and services (lines one and three) show up in the current
account, while we find flow of funds (lines two and four) in the financial account.

The bottom four lines in Figure 23.3 show the flows of investment income. In the first of the bottom lines, we
see investments made abroad with funds flowing from the home country to the rest of the world. Investment
income stemming from an investment abroad then runs in the other direction from the rest of the world to the
home country. Similarly, we see on the bottom third line, an investment from the rest of the world into the

home country and investment income (bottom fourth line) flowing from the home country to the rest of the
world. We find the investment income (bottom lines two and four) in the current account, while investment to
the rest of the world or into the home country (lines one and three) is in the financial account. This figure does
not show unilateral transfers, the fourth item in the current account.

FIGURE 23.3 Flow of Investment Goods and Capital Each element of the current account balance involves a flow of
financial payments between countries. The top line shows exports of goods and services leaving the home country;
the second line shows the money that the home country receives for those exports. The third line shows imports
that the home country receives; the fourth line shows the payments that the home country sent abroad in exchange
for these imports.
A current account deficit means that, the country is a net borrower from abroad. Conversely, a positive current
account balance means a country is a net lender to the rest of the world. Just like the parable of Robinson and
Friday, the lesson is that a trade surplus means an overall outflow of financial investment capital, as domestic
investors put their funds abroad, while a deficit in the current account balance is exactly equal to the overall or
net inflow of foreign investment capital from abroad.
It is important to recognize that an inflow and outflow of foreign capital does not necessarily refer to a debt that
governments owe to other governments, although government debt may be part of the picture. Instead, these
international flows of financial capital refer to all of the ways in which private investors in one country may
invest in another country--by buying real estate, companies, and financial investments like stocks and bonds.

       capital--in the context of the overall levels of savings and financial investment in the economy.

      Understanding the Determinants of the Trade and Current Account Balance

       The national saving and investment identity provides a useful way to understand the determinants of the
       trade and current account balance. In a nation's financial capital market, the quantity of financial capital
       supplied at any given time must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded for purposes of making
       investments. What is on the supply and demand sides of financial capital? See the following Clear It Up feature
       for the answer to this question.

                CLEAR IT UP

      What comprises the supply and demand of financial capital?

       A country's national savings is the total of its domestic savings by household and companies (private savings) as
       well as the government (public savings). If a country is running a trade deficit, it means money from abroad is
       entering the country and the government considers it part of the supply of financial capital.
       The demand for financial capital (money) represents groups that are borrowing the money. Businesses need to
       borrow to finance their investments in factories, materials, and personnel. When the federal government runs a
       budget deficit, it is also borrowing money from investors by selling Treasury bonds. Therefore, both business
       investment and the federal government can demand (or borrow) the supply of savings.

       There are two main sources for the supply of financial capital in the U.S. economy: saving by individuals and
       firms, called S, and the inflow of financial capital from foreign investors, which is equal to the trade deficit (M -
       X), or imports minus exports. There are also two main sources of demand for financial capital in the U.S.
       economy: private sector investment, I, and government borrowing, where the government needs to borrow
       when government spending, G, is higher than the taxes collected, T. We can express this national savings and
       investment identity in algebraic terms:

       Again, in this equation, S is private savings, T is taxes, G is government spending, M is imports, X is exports,
       and I is investment. This relationship is true as a matter of definition because, for the macro economy, the
       quantity supplied of financial capital must be equal to the quantity demanded.
       However, certain components of the national savings and investment identity can switch between the supply
       side and the demand side. Some countries, like the United States in most years since the 1970s, have budget
       deficits, which mean the government is spending more than it collects in taxes, and so the government needs
       to borrow funds. In this case, the government term would be G - T > 0, showing that spending is larger than
       taxes, and the government would be a demander of financial capital on the right-hand side of the equation
       (that is, a borrower), not a supplier of financial capital on the left-hand side. However, if the government runs a
       budget surplus so that the taxes exceed spending, as the U.S. government did from 1998 to 2001, then the
       government in that year was contributing to the supply of financial capital (T - G > 0), and would appear on the
       left (supplier or saving) side of the national savings and investment identity.
       Similarly, if a national economy runs a trade surplus, the trade sector will involve an outflow of financial capital
       to other countries. A trade surplus means that the domestic financial capital is in surplus within a country and
       can be invested in other countries.
       The fundamental notion that total quantity of financial capital demanded equals total quantity of financial
       capital supplied must always remain true. Domestic savings will always appear as part of the supply of
       financial capital and domestic investment will always appear as part of the demand for financial capital.

However, the government and trade balance elements of the equation can move back and forth as either
suppliers or demanders of financial capital, depending on whether government budgets and the trade balance
are in surplus or deficit.

Domestic Saving and Investment Determine the Trade Balance

One insight from the national saving and investment identity is that a nation's own levels of domestic saving
and investment determine a nation's balance of trade. To understand this point, rearrange the identity to put
the balance of trade all by itself on one side of the equation. Consider first the situation with a trade deficit, and
then the situation with a trade surplus.
In the case of a trade deficit, the national saving and investment identity can be rewritten as:

In this case, domestic investment is higher than domestic saving, including both private and government
saving. The only way that domestic investment can exceed domestic saving is if capital is flowing into a
country from abroad. After all, that extra financial capital for investment has to come from someplace.
Now consider a trade surplus from the standpoint of the national saving and investment identity:

In this case, domestic savings (both private and public) is higher than domestic investment. That extra
financial capital will be invested abroad.
This connection of domestic saving and investment to the trade balance explains why economists view the
balance of trade as a fundamentally macroeconomic phenomenon. As the national saving and investment
identity shows, the performance of certain sectors of an economy, like cars or steel, do not determine the trade
balance. Further, whether the nation's trade laws and regulations encourage free trade or protectionism also
does not determine the trade balance (see Globalization and Protectionism).

Exploring Trade Balances One Factor at a Time

The national saving and investment identity also provides a framework for thinking about what will cause
trade deficits to rise or fall. Begin with the version of the identity that has domestic savings and investment on
the left and the trade deficit on the right:

Now, consider the factors on the left-hand side of the equation one at a time, while holding the other factors
constant.
As a first example, assume that the level of domestic investment in a country rises, while the level of private
and public saving remains unchanged. Table 23.6 shows the result in the first row under the equation. Since
the equality of the national savings and investment identity must continue to hold--it is, after all, an identity
that must be true by definition--the rise in domestic investment will mean a higher trade deficit. This situation
occurred in the U.S. economy in the late 1990s. Because of the surge of new information and communications
technologies that became available, business investment increased substantially. A fall in private saving
during this time and a rise in government saving more or less offset each other. As a result, the financial
capital to fund that business investment came from abroad, which is one reason for the very high U.S. trade
deficits of the late 1990s and early 2000s.

TABLE 23.6 Causes of a Changing Trade Balance

As a second scenario, assume that the level of domestic savings rises, while the level of domestic investment
and public savings remain unchanged. In this case, the trade deficit would decline. As domestic savings rises,
there would be less need for foreign financial capital to meet investment needs. For this reason, a policy
proposal often made for reducing the U.S. trade deficit is to increase private saving--although exactly how to
increase the overall rate of saving has proven controversial.

As a third scenario, imagine that the government budget deficit increased dramatically, while domestic
investment and private savings remained unchanged. This scenario occurred in the U.S. economy in the
mid-1980s. The federal budget deficit increased from $79 billion in 1981 to $221 billion in 1986--an increase
in the demand for financial capital of $142 billion. The current account balance collapsed from a surplus of $5
billion in 1981 to a deficit of $147 billion in 1986--an increase in the supply of financial capital from abroad of
$152 billion. The connection at that time is clear: a sharp increase in government borrowing increased the U.S.
economy's demand for financial capital, and foreign investors through the trade deficit primarily supplied that
increase. The following Work It Out feature walks you through a scenario in which private domestic savings
has to rise by a certain amount to reduce a trade deficit.

                                                                                                          WORK IT OUT

 Solving Problems with the Saving and Investment Identity

  Use the saving and investment identity to answer the following question: Country A has a trade deficit of $200
  billion, private domestic savings of $500 billion, a government deficit of $200 billion, and private domestic
  investment of $500 billion. To reduce the $200 billion trade deficit by $100 billion, by how much does private
  domestic savings have to increase?

  Step 1. Write out the savings investment formula solving for the trade deficit or surplus on the left:

Step 2. In the formula, put the amount for the trade deficit in as a negative number (X - M). The left side of your
formula is now:

Step 3. Enter the private domestic savings (S) of $500 in the formula:

Step 4. Enter the private domestic investment (I) of $500 into the formula:

  Step 5. The government budget surplus or balance is represented by (T - G). Enter a budget deficit amount for (T
  - G) of -200:

  Step 6. Your formula now is:

  The question is: To reduce your trade deficit (X - M) of -200 to -100 (in billions of dollars), by how much will
  savings have to rise?

  Step 7. Summarize the answer: Private domestic savings needs to rise by $100 billion, to a total of $600 billion,
  for the two sides of the equation to remain equal (-100 = -100).

Short-Term Movements in the Business Cycle and the Trade Balance

In the short run, whether an economy is in a recession or on the upswing can affect trade imbalances. A
recession tends to make a trade deficit smaller, or a trade surplus larger, while a period of strong economic
growth tends to make a trade deficit larger, or a trade surplus smaller. These are not hard-and-fast rules,
however.
As an example, note in Figure 23.2 that the U.S. trade deficit declined by almost half from 2006 to 2009. One
primary reason for this change is that during the recession, as the U.S. economy slowed down, it purchased
fewer of all goods, including fewer imports from abroad. However, buying power abroad fell less, and so U.S.
exports did not fall by as much. On the other hand, during the 2020 pandemic-induced recession, the trade
deficit expanded (current account balance plummeted) as the U.S. economy became more reliant on other
countries for goods and services.
Conversely, in the mid-2000s, when the U.S. trade deficit became very large, a contributing short-term reason
is that the U.S. economy was growing. As a result, there was considerable aggressive buying in the U.S.
economy, including the buying of imports. Thus, a trade deficit (or a much lower trade surplus) often
accompanies a rapidly growing domestic economy, while a trade surplus (or a much lower trade deficit)
accompanies a slowing or recessionary domestic economy.
Regardless of whether the trade deficit falls or rises during expansions or downturns, when the trade deficit
rises, it necessarily means a greater net inflow of foreign financial capital. The national saving and investment
identity teaches that the rest of the economy can absorb this inflow of foreign financial capital in several
different ways. For example, reduced private savings could offset the additional inflow of financial capital from
abroad, leaving domestic investment and public saving unchanged. Alternatively, the inflow of foreign
financial capital could result in higher domestic investment, leaving private and public saving unchanged. Yet
another possibility is that greater government borrowing could absorb the inflow of foreign financial capital,
leaving domestic saving and investment unchanged. The national saving and investment identity does not
specify which of these scenarios, alone or in combination, will occur--only that one of them must occur.

         · Identify three ways in which borrowing money or running a trade deficit can result in a weaker economy

       Because flows of trade always involve flows of financial payments, flows of international trade are actually the
       same as flows of international financial capital. The question of whether trade deficits or surpluses are good or
       bad for an economy is, in economic terms, exactly the same question as whether it is a good idea for an
       economy to rely on net inflows of financial capital from abroad or to make net investments of financial capital
       abroad. Conventional wisdom often holds that borrowing money is foolhardy, and that a prudent country, like a
       prudent person, should always rely on its own resources. While it is certainly possible to borrow too much--as
       anyone with an overloaded credit card can testify--borrowing at certain times can also make sound economic
       sense. For both individuals and countries, there is no economic merit in a policy of abstaining from
       participation in financial capital markets.

       It makes economic sense to borrow when you are buying something with a long-run payoff; that is, when you
       are making an investment. For this reason, it can make economic sense to borrow for a college education,
       because the education will typically allow you to earn higher wages, and so to repay the loan and still come out
       ahead. It can also make sense for a business to borrow in order to purchase a machine that will last 10 years, as
       long as the machine will increase output and profits by more than enough to repay the loan. Similarly, it can
       make economic sense for a national economy to borrow from abroad, as long as it wisely invests the money in
       ways that will tend to raise the nation's economic growth over time. Then, it will be possible for the national
       economy to repay the borrowed money over time and still end up better off than before.

       One vivid example of a country that borrowed heavily from abroad, invested wisely, and did perfectly well is
       the United States during the nineteenth century. The United States ran a trade deficit in 40 of the 45 years
       from 1831 to 1875, which meant that it was importing capital from abroad over that time. However, that
       financial capital was mostly invested in projects like railroads that brought a substantial economic payoff. (See
       the following Clear It Up feature for more on this.)

       A more recent example along these lines is the experience of South Korea, which had trade deficits during
       much of the 1970s--and so was an importer of capital over that time. However, South Korea also had high rates
       of investment in physical plant and equipment, and its economy grew rapidly. From the mid-1980s into the
       mid-1990s, South Korea often had trade surpluses--that is, it was repaying its past borrowing by sending
       capital abroad.

       In contrast, some countries have run large trade deficits, borrowed heavily in global capital markets, and
       ended up in all kinds of trouble. Two specific sorts of trouble are worth examining. First, a borrower nation can
       find itself in a bind if it does not invest the incoming funds from abroad in a way that leads to increased
       productivity. Several of Latin America's large economies, including Mexico and Brazil, ran large trade deficits
       and borrowed heavily from abroad in the 1970s, but the inflow of financial capital did not boost productivity
       sufficiently, which meant that these countries faced enormous troubles repaying the money borrowed when
       economic conditions shifted during the 1980s. Similarly, it appears that a number of African nations that
       borrowed foreign funds in the 1970s and 1980s did not invest in productive economic assets. As a result,
       several of those countries later faced large interest payments, with no economic growth to show for the
       borrowed funds.

Are trade deficits always harmful?

For most years of the nineteenth century, U.S. imports exceeded exports and the U.S. economy had a trade deficit.
Yet the string of trade deficits did not hold back the economy at all. Instead, the trade deficits contributed to the
strong economic growth that gave the U.S. economy the highest per capita GDP in the world by around 1900.

The U.S. trade deficits meant that the U.S. economy was receiving a net inflow of foreign capital from abroad. Much
of that foreign capital flowed into two areas of investment--railroads and public infrastructure like roads, water
systems, and schools--which were important to helping the U.S. economy grow.

We should not overstate the effect of foreign investment capital on U.S. economic growth. In most years the foreign
financial capital represented no more than 6-10% of the funds that the government used for overall physical
investment in the economy. Nonetheless, the trade deficit and the accompanying investment funds from abroad
were clearly a help, not a hindrance, to the U.S. economy in the nineteenth century.

A second "trouble" is: What happens if the foreign money flows in, and then suddenly flows out again? We
raised this scenario at the start of the chapter. In the mid-1990s, a number of countries in East Asia--Thailand,
Indonesia, Malaysia, and South Korea--ran large trade deficits and imported capital from abroad. However, in
1997 and 1998 many foreign investors became concerned about the health of these economies, and quickly
pulled their money out of stock and bond markets, real estate, and banks. The extremely rapid departure of
that foreign capital staggered the banking systems and economies of these countries, plunging them into deep
recession. We investigate and discuss the links between international capital flows, banks, and recession in
The Impacts of Government Borrowing.

While a trade deficit is not always harmful, there is no guarantee that running a trade surplus will bring robust
economic health. For example, Germany and Japan ran substantial trade surpluses for most of the last three
decades. Regardless of their persistent trade surpluses, both countries have experienced occasional recessions
and neither country has had especially robust annual growth in recent years. Read more about Japan's trade
surplus in the next Clear It Up feature.

Watch this video (http://openstax.org/l/tradedeficit) on whether or not trade deficit is good for the economy.

The sheer size and persistence of the U.S. trade deficits and inflows of foreign capital since the 1980s are a
legitimate cause for concern. The huge U.S. economy will not be destabilized by an outflow of international
capital as easily as, say, the comparatively tiny economies of Thailand and Indonesia were in 1997-1998. Even
an economy that is not knocked down, however, can still be shaken. American policymakers should certainly
be paying attention to those cases where a pattern of extensive and sustained current account deficits and
foreign borrowing has gone badly--if only as a cautionary tale.

         CLEAR IT UP

Are trade surpluses always beneficial? Considering Japan since the 1990s.

Perhaps no economy around the world is better known for its trade surpluses than Japan. Since 1990, the size of
these surpluses has often been near $100 billion per year. When Japan's economy was growing vigorously in the
1960s and 1970s, many, especially non-economists, described its large trade surpluses either a cause or a result of
its robust economic health. However, from a standpoint of economic growth, Japan's economy has been teetering in
and out of recession since 1990, with real GDP growth averaging only about 1% per year, and an unemployment rate
578 23 · The International Trade and Capital Flows

       that has been creeping higher. Clearly, a whopping trade surplus is no guarantee of economic good health.

       Instead, Japan's trade surplus reflects that Japan has a very high rate of domestic savings, more than the Japanese
       economy can invest domestically, and so it invests the extra funds abroad. In Japan's slow economy, consumption
       of imports is relatively low, and the growth of consumption is relatively slow. Thus, Japan's exports continually
       exceed its imports, leaving the trade surplus continually high. Recently, Japan's trade surpluses began to
       deteriorate. In 2013, Japan ran a trade deficit due to the high cost of imported oil. By 2015, Japan again had a
       surplus and continues to run one today.

     23.6 The Difference between Level of Trade and the Trade Balance

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Identify three factors that influence a country's level of trade
         · Differentiate between balance of trade and level of trade

       A nation's level of trade may at first sound like much the same issue as the balance of trade, but these two are
       actually quite separate. It is perfectly possible for a country to have a very high level of trade--measured by its
       exports of goods and services as a share of its GDP--while it also has a near-balance between exports and
       imports. A high level of trade indicates that the nation exports a good portion of its production. It is also
       possible for a country's trade to be a relatively low share of GDP, relative to global averages, but for the
       imbalance between its exports and its imports to be quite large. We emphasized this general theme earlier in
       Measuring Trade Balances, which offered some illustrative figures on trade levels and balances.

       A country's level of trade tells how much of its production it exports. We measure this by the percent of exports
       out of GDP. It indicates the degree of an economy's globalization. Some countries, such as Germany, have a
       high level of trade--they export almost 50% of their total production. The balance of trade tells us if the country
       is running a trade surplus or trade deficit. A country can have a low level of trade but a high trade deficit. (For
       example, the United States only exports around 10% of its GDP, but it has a trade deficit of over $600 billion.)

       Three factors strongly influence a nation's level of trade: the size of its economy, its geographic location, and its
       history of trade. Large economies like the United States can do much of their trading internally, while small
       economies like Sweden have less ability to provide what they want internally and tend to have higher ratios of
       exports and imports to GDP. Nations that are neighbors tend to trade more, since costs of transportation and
       communication are lower. Moreover, some nations have long and established patterns of international trade,
       while others do not.

       Consequently, a relatively small economy like Sweden, with many nearby trading partners across Europe and a
       long history of foreign trade, has a high level of trade. Brazil and India, which are fairly large economies that
       have often sought to inhibit trade in recent decades, have lower levels of trade; whereas, the United States and
       Japan are extremely large economies that have comparatively few nearby trading partners. Both countries
       actually have quite low levels of trade by world standards. The ratio of exports to GDP in either the United
       States or in Japan is about half of the world average.

       The balance of trade is a separate issue from the level of trade. The United States has a low level of trade, but
       had enormous trade deficits for most years from the mid-1980s into the 2000s. Japan has a low level of trade
       by world standards, but has typically shown large trade surpluses in recent decades. Nations like Germany and
       the United Kingdom have medium to high levels of trade by world standards, but Germany had a moderate
       trade surplus in 2020, while the United Kingdom had a moderate trade deficit. Their trade picture was roughly
       in balance in the late 1990s. Sweden had a high level of trade and a moderate trade surplus in 2020, while
       Canada had a high level of trade and a moderate trade deficit that same year.

       In short, it is quite possible for nations with a relatively low level of trade, expressed as a percentage of GDP, to

                                                                                             23.6 · The Difference between Level of Trade and the Trade Balance 579

have relatively large trade deficits. It is also quite possible for nations with a near balance between exports and
imports to worry about the consequences of high levels of trade for the economy. It is not inconsistent to
believe that a high level of trade is potentially beneficial to an economy, because of the way it allows nations to
play to their comparative advantages, and to also be concerned about any macroeconomic instability caused
by a long-term pattern of large trade deficits. The following Clear It Up feature discusses how this sort of
dynamic played out in Colonial India.

         CLEAR IT UP

Are trade surpluses always beneficial? Considering Colonial India.

India was formally under British rule from 1858 to 1947. During that time, India consistently had trade surpluses
with Great Britain. Anyone who believes that trade surpluses are a sign of economic strength and dominance while
trade deficits are a sign of economic weakness must find this pattern odd, since it would mean that colonial India
was successfully dominating and exploiting Great Britain for almost a century--which was not true.

Instead, India's trade surpluses with Great Britain meant that each year there was an overall flow of financial capital
from India to Great Britain. In India, many heavily criticized this financial capital flow as the "drain," and they viewed
eliminating the financial capital drain as one of the many reasons why India would benefit from achieving
independence.

Final Thoughts about Trade Balances

Trade deficits can be a good or a bad sign for an economy, and trade surpluses can be a good or a bad sign.
Even a trade balance of zero--which just means that a nation is neither a net borrower nor lender in the
international economy--can be either a good or bad sign. The fundamental economic question is not whether a
nation's economy is borrowing or lending at all, but whether the particular borrowing or lending in the
particular economic conditions of that country makes sense.

It is interesting to reflect on how public attitudes toward trade deficits and surpluses might change if we could
somehow change the labels that people and the news media affix to them. If we called a trade deficit "attracting
foreign financial capital"--which accurately describes what a trade deficit means--then trade deficits might
look more attractive. Conversely, if we called a trade surplus "shipping financial capital abroad"--which
accurately captures what a trade surplus does--then trade surpluses might look less attractive. Either way, the
key to understanding trade balances is to understand the relationships between flows of trade and flows of
international payments, and what these relationships imply about the causes, benefits, and risks of different
kinds of trade balances. The first step along this journey of understanding is to move beyond knee-jerk
reactions to terms like "trade surplus," "trade balance," and "trade deficit."

More than Meets the Eye in the Congo

Now that you see the big picture, you undoubtedly realize that all of the economic choices you make, such as
depositing savings or investing in an international mutual fund, do influence the flow of goods and services as well
as the flows of money around the world.

You now know that a trade surplus does not necessarily tell us whether an economy is performing well or not. The
Democratic Republic of the Congo ran a trade surplus in 2013, as we learned in the beginning of the chapter. Yet its
current account balance was -$2.8 billion. However, the return of political stability and the rebuilding in the
aftermath of the civil war there has meant a flow of investment and financial capital into the country. In this case, a
negative current account balance means the country is being rebuilt--and that is a good thing.

Key Concepts and Summary

23.1 Measuring Trade Balances

The trade balance measures the gap between a country's exports and its imports. In most high-income
economies, goods comprise less than half of a country's total production, while services comprise more than
half. The last two decades have seen a surge in international trade in services; however, most global trade still
takes the form of goods rather than services. The current account balance includes the trade in goods,
services, and money flowing into and out of a country from investments and unilateral transfers.

23.2 Trade Balances in Historical and International Context

The United States developed large trade surpluses in the early 1980s, swung back to a tiny trade surplus in
1991, and then had even larger trade deficits in the late 1990s and early 2000s. As we will see below, a trade
deficit necessarily means a net inflow of financial capital from abroad, while a trade surplus necessarily means
a net outflow of financial capital from an economy to other countries.

23.3 Trade Balances and Flows of Financial Capital

International flows of goods and services are closely connected to the international flows of financial capital. A
current account deficit means that, after taking all the flows of payments from goods, services, and income
together, the country is a net borrower from the rest of the world. A current account surplus is the opposite and
means the country is a net lender to the rest of the world.

23.4 The National Saving and Investment Identity

The national saving and investment identity is based on the relationship that the total quantity of financial
capital supplied from all sources must equal the total quantity of financial capital demanded from all sources.
If S is private saving, T is taxes, G is government spending, M is imports, X is exports, and I is investment, then
for an economy with a current account deficit and a budget deficit:

                                   

A recession tends to increase the trade balance (meaning a higher trade surplus or lower trade deficit), while
economic boom will tend to decrease the trade balance (meaning a lower trade surplus or a larger trade
deficit).

23.5 The Pros and Cons of Trade Deficits and Surpluses

Trade surpluses are no guarantee of economic health, and trade deficits are no guarantee of economic
weakness. Either trade deficits or trade surpluses can work out well or poorly, depending on whether a
government wisely invests the corresponding flows of financial capital.

23.6 The Difference between Level of Trade and the Trade Balance

There is a difference between the level of a country's trade and the balance of trade. The government measures
its level of trade by the percentage of exports out of GDP, or the size of the economy. Small economies that have
nearby trading partners and a history of international trade will tend to have higher levels of trade. Larger
economies with few nearby trading partners and a limited history of international trade will tend to have lower
levels of trade. The level of trade is different from the trade balance. The level of trade depends on a country's
history of trade, its geography, and the size of its economy. A country's balance of trade is the dollar difference
between its exports and imports.

Trade deficits and trade surpluses are not necessarily good or bad--it depends on the circumstances. Even if a
country is borrowing, if it invests that money in productivity-boosting investments it can lead to an
improvement in long-term economic growth.

Introduction to the Aggregate Supply-Aggregate Demand Model

         BRING IT HOME
From Housing Bubble to Housing Bust

The United States experienced rising home ownership rates for most of the last two decades. Between 1990 and
2006, the U.S. housing market grew. Homeownership rates grew from 64% to a high of over 69% between 2004 and
2005. For many people, this was a period in which they could either buy first homes or buy a larger and more
expensive home. During this time mortgage values tripled. Housing became more accessible to Americans and was
considered to be a safe financial investment. Figure 24.2 shows how new single family home sales peaked in 2005
at 1,279,000 units.

       FIGURE 24.2 New Single Family Houses Sold From the early 1990s up through 2005, the number of new single
       family houses sold rose steadily. In 2006, the number dropped dramatically and this dramatic decline continued
       through 2011. Beginning in 2012, the number of new houses sold began to climb back up. (Source: U.S. Census
       Bureau)
       The housing bubble began to show signs of bursting in 2005, as delinquency and late payments began to grow and
       an oversupply of new homes on the market became apparent. Dropping home values contributed to a decrease in
       the overall wealth of the household sector and caused homeowners to pull back on spending. Several mortgage
       lenders were forced to file for bankruptcy because homeowners were not making their payments, and by 2008 the
       problem had spread throughout the financial markets. Lenders clamped down on credit and the housing bubble
       burst. Financial markets were now in crisis and unable or unwilling to even extend credit to credit-worthy
       customers.
       The housing bubble and the crisis in the financial markets were major contributors to the Great Recession that led to
       unemployment rates over 10% and falling GDP. While the United States is still recovering from the impact of the
       Great Recession, it has made substantial progress in restoring financial market stability through implementing
       aggressive fiscal and monetary policy.
       The economic history of the United States is cyclical in nature with recessions and expansions. Some of these
       fluctuations are severe, such as the economic downturn that occurred during the Great Depression in the 1930s
       which lasted several years. Why does the economy grow at different rates in different years? What are the causes of
       the cyclical behavior of the economy? This chapter will introduce an important model, the aggregate
       demand-aggregate supply model, to begin our understanding of why economies expand and contract over time.

       A key part of macroeconomics is the use of models to analyze macro issues and problems. How is the rate of
       economic growth connected to changes in the unemployment rate? Is there a reason why unemployment and
       inflation seem to move in opposite directions: lower unemployment and higher inflation from 1997 to 2000,
       higher unemployment and lower inflation in the early 2000s, lower unemployment and higher inflation in the
       mid-2000s, and then higher unemployment and lower inflation in 2009? Why did the current account deficit
       rise so high, but then decline in 2009?
       To analyze questions like these, we must move beyond discussing macroeconomic issues one at a time, and
       begin building economic models that will capture the relationships and interconnections between them. The
       next three chapters take up this task. This chapter introduces the macroeconomic model of aggregate supply
       and aggregate demand, how the two interact to reach a macroeconomic equilibrium, and how shifts in
       aggregate demand or aggregate supply will affect that equilibrium. This chapter also relates the model of
       aggregate supply and aggregate demand to the three goals of economic policy (growth, unemployment, and

inflation), and provides a framework for thinking about many of the connections and tradeoffs between these
goals. The chapter on The Keynesian Perspective focuses on the macroeconomy in the short run, where
aggregate demand plays a crucial role. The chapter on The Neoclassical Perspective explores the
macroeconomy in the long run, where aggregate supply plays a crucial role.

24.1 Macroeconomic Perspectives on Demand and Supply

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Explain Say's Law and understand why it primarily applies in the long run
  · Explain Keynes' Law and understand why it primarily applies in the short run

Macroeconomists over the last two centuries have often divided into two groups: those who argue that supply
is the most important determinant of the size of the macroeconomy while demand just tags along, and those
who argue that demand is the most important factor in the size of the macroeconomy while supply just tags
along.

Say's Law and the Macroeconomics of Supply

Those economists who emphasize the role of supply in the macroeconomy often refer to the work of a famous
early nineteenth century French economist named Jean-Baptiste Say (1767-1832). Say's law is: "Supply
creates its own demand." As a matter of historical accuracy, it seems clear that Say never actually wrote down
this law and that it oversimplifies his beliefs, but the law lives on as useful shorthand for summarizing a point
of view.

The intuition behind Say's law is that each time a good or service is produced and sold, it generates income
that is earned for someone: a worker, a manager, an owner, or those who are workers, managers, and owners at
firms that supply inputs along the chain of production. We alluded to this earlier in our discussion of the
National Income approach to measuring GDP. The forces of supply and demand in individual markets will
cause prices to rise and fall. The bottom line remains, however, that every sale represents income to someone,
and so, Say's law argues, a given value of supply must create an equivalent value of demand somewhere else in
the economy. Because Jean-Baptiste Say, Adam Smith, and other economists writing around the turn of the
nineteenth century who discussed this view were known as "classical" economists, modern economists who
generally subscribe to the Say's law view on the importance of supply for determining the size of the
macroeconomy are called neoclassical economists.

If supply always creates exactly enough demand at the macroeconomic level, then (as Say himself recognized)
it is hard to understand why periods of recession and high unemployment should ever occur. To be sure, even
if total supply always creates an equal amount of total demand, the economy could still experience a situation
of some firms earning profits while other firms suffer losses. Nevertheless, a recession is not a situation where
all business failures are exactly counterbalanced by an offsetting number of successes. A recession is a
situation in which the economy as a whole is shrinking in size, business failures outnumber the remaining
success stories, and many firms end up suffering losses and laying off workers.

Say's law that supply creates its own demand does seem a good approximation for the long run. Over periods
of some years or decades, as the productive power of an economy to supply goods and services increases, total
demand in the economy grows at roughly the same pace. However, over shorter time horizons of a few months
or even years, recessions or even depressions occur in which firms, as a group, seem to face a lack of demand
for their products.

Keynes' Law and the Macroeconomics of Demand

The alternative to Say's law, with its emphasis on supply, is Keynes' law: "Demand creates its own supply." As a
matter of historical accuracy, just as Jean-Baptiste Say never wrote down anything as simpleminded as Say's
law, John Maynard Keynes never wrote down Keynes' law, but the law is a useful simplification that conveys a
588 24 · The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model

       certain point of view.

       When Keynes wrote his influential work The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money during the
       1930s Great Depression, he pointed out that during the Depression, the economy's capacity to supply goods
       and services had not changed much. U.S. unemployment rates soared higher than 20% from 1933 to 1935, but
       the number of possible workers had not increased or decreased much. Factories closed, but machinery and
       equipment had not disappeared. Technologies that had been invented in the 1920s were not un-invented and
       forgotten in the 1930s. Thus, Keynes argued that the Great Depression--and many ordinary recessions as
       well--were not caused by a drop in the ability of the economy to supply goods as measured by labor, physical
       capital, or technology. He argued the economy often produced less than its full potential, not because it was
       technically impossible to produce more with the existing workers and machines, but because a lack of demand
       in the economy as a whole led to inadequate incentives for firms to produce. In such cases, he argued, the level
       of GDP in the economy was not primarily determined by the potential of what the economy could supply, but
       rather by the amount of total demand.

       Keynes' law seems to apply fairly well in the short run of a few months to a few years, when many firms
       experience either a drop in demand for their output during a recession or so much demand that they have
       trouble producing enough during an economic boom. However, demand cannot tell the whole macroeconomic
       story, either. After all, if demand was all that mattered at the macroeconomic level, then the government could
       make the economy as large as it wanted just by pumping up total demand through a large increase in the
       government spending component or by legislating large tax cuts to push up the consumption component.
       Economies do, however, face genuine limits to how much they can produce, limits determined by the quantity
       of labor, physical capital, technology, and the institutional and market structures that bring these factors of
       production together. These constraints on what an economy can supply at the macroeconomic level do not
       disappear just because of an increase in demand.

      Combining Supply and Demand in Macroeconomics

       Two insights emerge from this overview of Say's law with its emphasis on macroeconomic supply and Keynes'
       law with its emphasis on macroeconomic demand. The first conclusion, which is not exactly a hot news flash,
       is that an economic approach focused only on the supply side or only on the demand side can be only a partial
       success. We need to take into account both supply and demand. The second conclusion is that since Keynes'
       law applies more accurately in the short run and Say's law applies more accurately in the long run, the
       tradeoffs and connections between the three goals of macroeconomics may be different in the short run and
       the long run.

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain the aggregate supply curve and how it relates to real GDP and potential GDP
         · Explain the aggregate demand curve and how it is influenced by price levels
         · Interpret the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model
         · Identify the point of equilibrium in the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model
         · Define short run aggregate supply and long run aggregate supply

       To build a useful macroeconomic model, we need a model that shows what determines total supply or total
       demand for the economy, and how total demand and total supply interact at the macroeconomic level. We call
       this the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model. This module will explain aggregate supply, aggregate
       demand, and the equilibrium between them. The following modules will discuss the causes of shifts in
       aggregate supply and aggregate demand.

The Aggregate Supply Curve and Potential GDP

Firms make decisions about what quantity to supply based on the profits they expect to earn. They determine
profits, in turn, by the price of the outputs they sell and by the prices of the inputs, like labor or raw materials,
that they need to buy. Aggregate supply (AS) refers to the total quantity of output (i.e. real GDP) firms will
produce and sell. The aggregate supply (AS) curve shows the total quantity of output (i.e. real GDP) that firms
will produce and sell at each price level.
Figure 24.3 shows an aggregate supply curve. In the following paragraphs, we will walk through the elements
of the diagram one at a time: the horizontal and vertical axes, the aggregate supply curve itself, and the
meaning of the potential GDP vertical line.

FIGURE 24.3 The Aggregate Supply Curve Aggregate supply (AS) slopes up, because as the price level for outputs
rises, with the price of inputs remaining fixed, firms have an incentive to produce more to earn higher profits. The
potential GDP line shows the maximum that the economy can produce with full employment of workers and physical
capital.
The diagram's horizontal axis shows real GDP--that is, the level of GDP adjusted for inflation. The vertical axis
shows the price level, which measures the average price of all goods and services produced in the economy. In
other words, the price level in the AD-AS model is what we called the GDP Deflator in The Macroeconomic
Perspective. Remember that the price level is different from the inflation rate. Visualize the price level as an
index number, like the Consumer Price Index, while the inflation rate is the percentage change in the price
level over time.
As the price level rises, real GDP rises as well. Why? The price level on the vertical axis represents prices for
final goods or outputs bought in the economy--i.e. the GDP deflator--not the price level for intermediate goods
and services that are inputs to production. Thus, the AS curve describes how suppliers will react to a higher
price level for final outputs of goods and services, while holding the prices of inputs like labor and energy
constant. If firms across the economy face a situation where the price level of what they produce and sell is
rising, but their costs of production are not rising, then the lure of higher profits will induce them to expand
production. In other words, an aggregate supply curve shows how producers as a group will respond to an
increase in aggregate demand.
An AS curve's slope changes from nearly flat at its far left to nearly vertical at its far right. At the far left of the
aggregate supply curve, the level of output in the economy is far below potential GDP, which we define as the
amount of real GDP an economy can produce by fully employing its existing levels of labor, physical capital,
and technology, in the context of its existing market and legal institutions. At these relatively low levels of
output, levels of unemployment are high, and many factories are running only part-time, or have closed their
590 24 · The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model

       doors. In this situation, a relatively small increase in the prices of the outputs that businesses sell--while
       assuming no rise in input prices--can encourage a considerable surge in the quantity of aggregate supply
       because so many workers and factories are ready to swing into production.
       As the GDP increases, however, some firms and industries will start running into limits: perhaps nearly all of
       the expert workers in a certain industry will have jobs or factories in certain geographic areas or industries
       will be running at full speed. In the AS curve's intermediate area, a higher price level for outputs continues to
       encourage a greater quantity of output--but as the increasingly steep upward slope of the aggregate supply
       curve shows, the increase in real GDP in response to a given rise in the price level will not be as large. (Read the
       following Clear It Up feature to learn why the AS curve crosses potential GDP.)

                CLEAR IT UP
      Why does AS cross potential GDP?

       Economists typically draw the aggregate supply curve to cross the potential GDP line. This shape may seem
       puzzling: How can an economy produce at an output level which is higher than its "potential" or "full employment"
       GDP? The economic intuition here is that if prices for outputs were high enough, producers would make fanatical
       efforts to produce: all workers would be on double-overtime, all machines would run 24 hours a day, seven days a
       week. Such hyper-intense production would go beyond using potential labor and physical capital resources fully, to
       using them in a way that is not sustainable in the long term. Thus, it is possible for production to sprint above
       potential GDP, but only in the short run.

       At the far right, the aggregate supply curve becomes nearly vertical. At this quantity, higher prices for outputs
       cannot encourage additional output, because even if firms want to expand output, the inputs of labor and
       machinery in the economy are fully employed. In this example, the vertical line in the exhibit shows that
       potential GDP occurs at a total output of 9,500. When an economy is operating at its potential GDP, machines
       and factories are running at capacity, and the unemployment rate is relatively low--at the natural rate of
       unemployment. For this reason, potential GDP is sometimes also called full-employment GDP.

      The Aggregate Demand Curve

       Aggregate demand (AD) refers to the amount of total spending on domestic goods and services in an
       economy. (Strictly speaking, AD is what economists call total planned expenditure. We will further explain this
       distinction in the appendix The Expenditure-Output Model . For now, just think of aggregate demand as total
       spending.) It includes all four components of demand: consumption, investment, government spending, and
       net exports (exports minus imports). This demand is determined by a number of factors, but one of them is the
       price level--recall though, that the price level is an index number such as the GDP deflator that measures the
       average price of the things we buy. The aggregate demand (AD) curve shows the total spending on domestic
       goods and services at each price level.
       Figure 24.4 presents an aggregate demand (AD) curve. Just like the aggregate supply curve, the horizontal axis
       shows real GDP and the vertical axis shows the price level. The AD curve slopes down, which means that
       increases in the price level of outputs lead to a lower quantity of total spending. The reasons behind this shape
       are related to how changes in the price level affect the different components of aggregate demand. The
       following components comprise aggregate demand: consumption spending (C), investment spending (I),
       government spending (G), and spending on exports (X) minus imports (M): C + I + G + X - M.

FIGURE 24.4 The Aggregate Demand Curve Aggregate demand (AD) slopes down, showing that, as the price level
rises, the amount of total spending on domestic goods and services declines.
The wealth effect holds that as the price level increases, the buying power of savings that people have stored up
in bank accounts and other assets will diminish, eaten away to some extent by inflation. Because a rise in the
price level reduces people's wealth, consumption spending will fall as the price level rises.
The interest rate effect is that as prices for outputs rise, the same purchases will take more money or credit to
accomplish. This additional demand for money and credit will push interest rates higher. In turn, higher
interest rates will reduce borrowing by businesses for investment purposes and reduce borrowing by
households for homes and cars--thus reducing consumption and investment spending.
The foreign price effect points out that if prices rise in the United States while remaining fixed in other
countries, then goods in the United States will be relatively more expensive compared to goods in the rest of
the world. U.S. exports will be relatively more expensive, and the quantity of exports sold will fall. U.S. imports
from abroad will be relatively cheaper, so the quantity of imports will rise. Thus, a higher domestic price level,
relative to price levels in other countries, will reduce net export expenditures.
Among economists all three of these effects are controversial, in part because they do not seem to be very
large. For this reason, the aggregate demand curve in Figure 24.4 slopes downward fairly steeply. The steep
slope indicates that a higher price level for final outputs reduces aggregate demand for all three of these
reasons, but that the change in the quantity of aggregate demand as a result of changes in price level is not
very large.

Step 1. Draw your x- and y-axis. Label the x-axis Real GDP and the y-axis Price Level.
Step 2. Plot AD on your graph.
Step 3. Plot AS on your graph.
Step 4. Look at Figure 24.5 which provides a visual to aid in your analysis.

  Step 6. Look at the graph to determine where equilibrium is located. We can see that this equilibrium is fairly far
  from where the AS curve becomes near-vertical (or at least quite steep) which seems to start at about $750 of
  real output. This implies that the economy is not close to potential GDP. Thus, unemployment will be high. In the

  concern, since such changes are likely to be small.
  Step 7. Determine what the steep portion of the AS curve indicates. Where the AS curve is steep, the economy is
  at or close to potential GDP.
  Step 8. Draw conclusions from the given information:

    · If equilibrium occurs in the flat range of AS, then economy is not close to potential GDP and will be
        experiencing unemployment, but stable price level.

    · If equilibrium occurs in the steep range of AS, then the economy is close or at potential GDP and will be
        experiencing rising price levels or inflationary pressures, but will have a low unemployment rate.

Equilibrium in the Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model

The intersection of the aggregate supply and aggregate demand curves shows the equilibrium level of real GDP
and the equilibrium price level in the economy. At a relatively low price level for output, firms have little
incentive to produce, although consumers would be willing to purchase a large quantity of output. As the price
level rises, aggregate supply rises and aggregate demand falls until the equilibrium point is reached.
Figure 24.6 combines the AS curve from Figure 24.3 and the AD curve from Figure 24.4 and places them both
on a single diagram. In this example, the equilibrium point occurs at point E, at a price level of 90 and an
output level of 8,800.

FIGURE 24.6 Aggregate Supply and Aggregate Demand The equilibrium, where aggregate supply (AS) equals

Confusion sometimes arises between the aggregate supply and aggregate demand model and the
microeconomic analysis of demand and supply in particular markets for goods, services, labor, and capital.
Read the following Clear It Up feature to gain an understanding of whether AS and AD are macro or micro.

         CLEAR IT UP
Are AS and AD macro or micro?

These aggregate supply and demand models and the microeconomic analysis of demand and supply in particular
markets for goods, services, labor, and capital have a superficial resemblance, but they also have many underlying
differences.
594 24 · The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model

       For example, the vertical and horizontal axes have distinctly different meanings in macroeconomic and
       microeconomic diagrams. The vertical axis of a microeconomic demand and supply diagram expresses a price (or
       wage or rate of return) for an individual good or service. This price is implicitly relative: it is intended to be compared
       with the prices of other products (for example, the price of pizza relative to the price of fried chicken). In contrast,
       the vertical axis of an aggregate supply and aggregate demand diagram expresses the level of a price index like the
       Consumer Price Index or the GDP deflator--combining a wide array of prices from across the economy. The price
       level is absolute: it is not intended to be compared to any other prices since it is essentially the average price of all
       products in an economy. The horizontal axis of a microeconomic supply and demand curve measures the quantity of
       a particular good or service. In contrast, the horizontal axis of the aggregate demand and aggregate supply diagram
       measures GDP, which is the sum of all the final goods and services produced in the economy, not the quantity in a
       specific market.

       In addition, the economic reasons for the shapes of the curves in the macroeconomic model are different from the
       reasons behind the shapes of the curves in microeconomic models. Demand curves for individual goods or services
       slope down primarily because of the existence of substitute goods, not the wealth effects, interest rate, and foreign
       price effects associated with aggregate demand curves. The slopes of individual supply and demand curves can
       have a variety of different slopes, depending on the extent to which quantity demanded and quantity supplied react
       to price in that specific market, but the slopes of the AS and AD curves are much the same in every diagram
       (although as we shall see in later chapters, short-run and long-run perspectives will emphasize different parts of the
       AS curve).

       In short, just because the AD/AS diagram has two lines that cross, do not assume that it is the same as every other
       diagram where two lines cross. The intuitions and meanings of the macro and micro diagrams are only distant
       cousins from different branches of the economics family tree.

      Defining SRAS and LRAS

       In the Clear It Up feature titled "Why does AS cross potential GDP?" we differentiated between short run
       changes in aggregate supply which the AS curve shows and long run changes in aggregate supply which the
       vertical line at potential GDP defines. In the short run, if demand is too low (or too high), it is possible for
       producers to supply less GDP (or more GDP) than potential. In the long run, however, producers are limited to
       producing at potential GDP. For this reason, we may also refer to what we have been calling the AS curve as the
       short run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve. We may also refer to the vertical line at potential GDP as the long
       run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve.

     24.3 Shifts in Aggregate Supply

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain how productivity growth changes the aggregate supply curve
         · Explain how changes in input prices change the aggregate supply curve

       The original equilibrium in the AD/AS diagram will shift to a new equilibrium if the AS or AD curve shifts.
       When the aggregate supply curve shifts to the right, then at every price level, producers supply a greater
       quantity of real GDP. When the AS curve shifts to the left, then at every price level, producers supply a lower
       quantity of real GDP. This module discusses two of the most important factors that can lead to shifts in the AS
       curve: productivity growth and changes in input prices.

      How Productivity Growth Shifts the AS Curve

       In the long run, the most important factor shifting the AS curve is productivity growth. Productivity means
       how much output can be produced with a given quantity of labor. One measure of this is output per worker or
       GDP per capita. Over time, productivity grows so that the same quantity of labor can produce more output.

                                                                                                                                              24.3 · Shifts in Aggregate Supply 595

Historically, the real growth in GDP per capita in an advanced economy like the United States has averaged
about 2% to 3% per year, but productivity growth has been faster during certain extended periods like the
1960s and the late 1990s through the early 2000s, or slower during periods like the 1970s. A higher level of
productivity shifts the AS curve to the right, because with improved productivity, firms can produce a greater
quantity of output at every price level. Figure 24.7 (a) shows an outward shift in productivity over two time
periods. The AS curve shifts out from SRAS0 to SRAS1 to SRAS2, and the equilibrium shifts from E0 to E1 to E2.
Note that with increased productivity, workers can produce more GDP. Thus, full employment corresponds to a
higher level of potential GDP, which we show as a rightward shift in LRAS from LRAS0 to LRAS1 to LRAS2.

FIGURE 24.7 Shifts in Aggregate Supply (a) The rise in productivity causes the SRAS curve to shift to the right. The
original equilibrium E0 is at the intersection of AD and SRAS0. When SRAS shifts right, then the new equilibrium E1 is
at the intersection of AD and SRAS1, and then yet another equilibrium, E2, is at the intersection of AD and SRAS2.
Shifts in SRAS to the right, lead to a greater level of output and to downward pressure on the price level. (b) A higher
price for inputs means that at any given price level for outputs, a lower real GDP will be produced so aggregate
supply will shift to the left from SRAS0 to SRAS1. The new equilibrium, E1, has a reduced quantity of output and a
higher price level than the original equilibrium (E0).
A shift in the SRAS curve to the right will result in a greater real GDP and downward pressure on the price
level, if aggregate demand remains unchanged. However, if this shift in SRAS results from gains in productivity
growth, which we typically measure in terms of a few percentage points per year, the effect will be relatively
small over a few months or even a couple of years. Recall how in Choice in a World of Scarcity, we said that a
nation's production possibilities frontier is fixed in the short run, but shifts out in the long run? This is the
same phenomenon using a different model.

How Changes in Input Prices Shift the AS Curve

Higher prices for inputs that are widely used across the entire economy can have a macroeconomic impact on
aggregate supply. Examples of such widely used inputs include labor and energy products. Increases in the
price of such inputs will cause the SRAS curve to shift to the left, which means that at each given price level for
outputs, a higher price for inputs will discourage production because it will reduce the possibilities for earning
profits. Figure 24.7 (b) shows the aggregate supply curve shifting to the left, from SRAS0 to SRAS1, causing the
equilibrium to move from E0 to E1. The movement from the original equilibrium of E0 to the new equilibrium
596 24 · The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model

       of E1 will bring a nasty set of effects: reduced GDP or recession, higher unemployment because the economy is
       now further away from potential GDP, and an inflationary higher price level as well. For example, the U.S.
       economy experienced recessions in 1974-1975, 1980-1982, 1990-91, 2001, and 2007-2009 that were each
       preceded or accompanied by a rise in the key input of oil prices. In the 1970s, this pattern of a shift to the left
       in SRAS leading to a stagnant economy with high unemployment and inflation was nicknamed stagflation.

       Conversely, a decline in the price of a key input like oil will shift the SRAS curve to the right, providing an
       incentive for more to be produced at every given price level for outputs. From 1985 to 1986, for example, the
       average price of crude oil fell by almost half, from $24 a barrel to $12 a barrel. Similarly, from 1997 to 1998,
       the price of a barrel of crude oil dropped from $17 per barrel to $11 per barrel. In both cases, the plummeting
       oil price led to a situation like that which we presented earlier in Figure 24.7 (a), where the outward shift of
       SRAS to the right allowed the economy to expand, unemployment to fall, and inflation to decline.

       Along with energy prices, two other key inputs that may shift the SRAS curve are the cost of labor, or wages,
       and the cost of imported goods that we use as inputs for other products. In these cases as well, the lesson is
       that lower prices for inputs cause SRAS to shift to the right, while higher prices cause it to shift back to the left.
       Note that, unlike changes in productivity, changes in input prices do not generally cause LRAS to shift, only
       SRAS.

      Other Supply Shocks

       The aggregate supply curve can also shift due to shocks to input goods or labor. For example, an unexpected
       early freeze could destroy a large number of agricultural crops, a shock that would shift the AS curve to the left
       since there would be fewer agricultural products available at any given price.

       Similarly, shocks to the labor market can affect aggregate supply. An extreme example might be an overseas
       war that required a large number of workers to cease their ordinary production in order to go fight for their
       country. In this case, SRAS and LRAS would both shift to the left because there would be fewer workers
       available to produce goods at any given price.

       Another example in this vein is a pandemic, like the COVID-19 pandemic. A pandemic causes many workers to
       become sick, temporarily reducing the supply of workers by a large amount. Further, workers might be
       cautious to go back to work in a pandemic because of health or safety concerns. While the shock to labor
       supply might not be permanent, it can cause a reduction in the supply of many goods and services, reflected in
       a leftward shift in the short-run aggregate supply curve. At various points during the COVID-19-induced
       pandemic, computer chips for automobiles, meat, and other consumer services were in short supply because
       of worker shortages around the world.

     24.4 Shifts in Aggregate Demand

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain how imports influence aggregate demand
         · Identify ways in which business confidence and consumer confidence can affect aggregate demand
         · Explain how government policy can change aggregate demand
         · Evaluate why economists disagree on the topic of tax cuts

       As we mentioned previously, the components of aggregate demand are consumption spending (C), investment
       spending (I), government spending (G), and spending on exports (X) minus imports (M). (Read the following
       Clear It Up feature for explanation of why imports are subtracted from exports and what this means for
       aggregate demand.) A shift of the AD curve to the right means that at least one of these components increased
       so that a greater amount of total spending would occur at every price level. A shift of the AD curve to the left
       means that at least one of these components decreased so that a lesser amount of total spending would occur
       at every price level. The Keynesian Perspective will discuss the components of aggregate demand and the

factors that affect them. Here, the discussion will sketch two broad categories that could cause AD curves to
shift: changes in consumer or firm behavior and changes in government tax or spending policy.

         CLEAR IT UP

Do imports diminish aggregate demand?

We have seen that the formula for aggregate demand is AD = C + I + G + X - M, where M is the total value of imported
goods. Why is there a minus sign in front of imports? Does this mean that more imports will result in a lower level of
aggregate demand? The short answer is yes, because aggregate demand is defined as total demand for domestically
produced goods and services.

When an American buys a foreign product, for example, it gets counted along with all the other consumption. Thus,
the income generated does not go to American producers, but rather to producers in another country. It would be
wrong to count this as part of domestic demand. Therefore, imports added in consumption are subtracted back out
in the M term of the equation.

Because of the way in which we write the demand equation, it is easy to make the mistake of thinking that imports
are bad for the economy. Just keep in mind that every negative number in the M term has a corresponding positive
number in the C or I or G term, and they always cancel out.

How Changes by Consumers and Firms Can Affect AD

When consumers feel more confident about the future of the economy, they tend to consume more. If business
confidence is high, then firms tend to spend more on investment, believing that the future payoff from that
investment will be substantial. Conversely, if consumer or business confidence drops, then consumption and
investment spending decline.

The University of Michigan publishes a survey of consumer confidence and constructs an index of consumer
confidence each month. The survey results are then reported at http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu
(http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/), which break down the change in consumer confidence among different
income levels. According to that index, consumer confidence averaged around 90 prior to the Great Recession,
and then it fell to below 60 in late 2008, which was the lowest it had been since 1980. During the 2010s,
confidence has climbed from a 2011 low of 55.8 back to a level in the upper 90s, before falling to the lower 70s
in 2020 due to the COIVD-19 pandemic, which economists consider close to a healthy state.

The Organization for Economic Development and Cooperation (OECD) publishes one measure of business
confidence: the "business tendency surveys". The OECD collects business opinion survey data for 21 countries
on future selling prices and employment, among other business climate elements. After sharply declining
during the Great Recession, the measure has risen above zero again and is back to long-term averages (the
indicator dips below zero when business outlook is weaker than usual). Of course, either of these survey
measures is not very precise. They can however, suggest when confidence is rising or falling, as well as when it
is relatively high or low compared to the past.

Because economists associate a rise in confidence with higher consumption and investment demand, it will
lead to an outward shift in the AD curve, and a move of the equilibrium, from E0 to E1, to a higher quantity of
output and a higher price level, as Figure 24.8 (a) shows.

Consumer and business confidence often reflect macroeconomic realities; for example, confidence is usually
high when the economy is growing briskly and low during a recession. However, economic confidence can
sometimes rise or fall for reasons that do not have a close connection to the immediate economy, like a risk of
war, election results, foreign policy events, or a pessimistic prediction about the future by a prominent public
figure. U.S. presidents, for example, must be careful in their public pronouncements about the economy. If they
offer economic pessimism, they risk provoking a decline in confidence that reduces consumption and

       investment and shifts AD to the left, and in a self-fulfilling prophecy, contributes to causing the recession that
       the president warned against in the first place. Figure 24.8 (b) shows a shift of AD to the left, and the
       corresponding movement of the equilibrium, from E0 to E1, to a lower quantity of output and a lower price
       level.

       FIGURE 24.8 Shifts in Aggregate Demand (a) An increase in consumer confidence or business confidence can shift
       AD to the right, from AD0 to AD1. When AD shifts to the right, the new equilibrium (E1) will have a higher quantity of
       output and also a higher price level compared with the original equilibrium (E0). In this example, the new
       equilibrium (E1) is also closer to potential GDP. An increase in government spending or a cut in taxes that leads to a
       rise in consumer spending can also shift AD to the right. (b) A decrease in consumer confidence or business
       confidence can shift AD to the left, from AD0 to AD1. When AD shifts to the left, the new equilibrium (E1) will have a
       lower quantity of output and also a lower price level compared with the original equilibrium (E0). In this example,
       the new equilibrium (E1) is also farther below potential GDP. A decrease in government spending or higher taxes
       that leads to a fall in consumer spending can also shift AD to the left.

      How Government Macroeconomic Policy Choices Can Shift AD

       Government spending is one component of AD. Thus, higher government spending will cause AD to shift to the
       right, as in Figure 24.8 (a), while lower government spending will cause AD to shift to the left, as in Figure 24.8
       (b). For example, in the United States, government spending declined by 3.2% of GDP during the 1990s, from
       21% of GDP in 1991, and to 17.8% of GDP in 1998. However, from 2005 to 2009, the peak of the Great
       Recession, government spending increased from 19% of GDP to 21.4% of GDP. If changes of a few percentage
       points of GDP seem small to you, remember that since GDP was about $14.4 trillion in 2009, a seemingly small
       change of 2% of GDP is equal to close to $300 billion. Since 2009, government expenditures have gone back

down to around 17-18% of GDP, although in 2020 they rose to 18.5%.
Tax policy can affect consumption and investment spending, too. Tax cuts for individuals will tend to increase
consumption demand, while tax increases will tend to diminish it. Tax policy can also pump up investment
demand by offering lower tax rates for corporations or tax reductions that benefit specific kinds of investment.
Shifting C or I will shift the AD curve as a whole.
During a recession, when unemployment is high and many businesses are suffering low profits or even losses,
the U.S. Congress often passes tax cuts. During the 2001 recession, for example, the U.S. Congress enacted a
tax cut into law. At such times, the political rhetoric often focuses on how people experiencing hard times need
relief from taxes. The aggregate supply and aggregate demand framework, however, offers a complementary
rationale, as Figure 24.9 illustrates. The original equilibrium during a recession is at point E0, relatively far
from the full employment level of output. The tax cut, by increasing consumption, shifts the AD curve to the
right. At the new equilibrium (E1), real GDP rises and unemployment falls and, because in this diagram the
economy has not yet reached its potential or full employment level of GDP, any rise in the price level remains
muted. Read the following Clear It Up feature to consider the question of whether economists favor tax cuts or
oppose them.

FIGURE 24.9 Recession and Full Employment in the AD/AS Model Whether the economy is in a recession is
illustrated in the AD/AS model by how close the equilibrium is to the potential GDP line as indicated by the vertical
LRAS line. In this example, the level of output Y0 at the equilibrium E0 is relatively far from the potential GDP line, so
it can represent an economy in recession, well below the full employment level of GDP. In contrast, the level of
output Y1 at the equilibrium E1 is relatively close to potential GDP, and so it would represent an economy with a
lower unemployment rate.

         CLEAR IT UP
Do economists favor tax cuts or oppose them?

One of the most fundamental divisions in American politics over the last few decades has been between those who
believe that the government should cut taxes substantially and those who disagree. Ronald Reagan rode into the
presidency in 1980 partly because of his promise, soon carried out, to enact a substantial tax cut. George Bush lost
his bid for reelection against Bill Clinton in 1992 partly because he had broken his 1988 promise: "Read my lips! No
new taxes!" In the 2000 presidential election, both George W. Bush and Al Gore advocated substantial tax cuts and
600 24 · The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model

       Bush succeeded in pushing a tax cut package through Congress early in 2001. More recently in 2017 and 2018,
       Donald Trump initiated a new round of tax cuts throughout the economy, and President Biden promised his own set
       of tax cuts in his 2021 spending bills.

       What side do economists take? Do they support broad tax cuts or oppose them? The answer, unsatisfying to zealots
       on both sides, is that it depends. One issue is whether equally large government spending cuts accompany the tax
       cuts. Economists differ, as does any broad cross-section of the public, on how large government spending should be
       and what programs the government might cut back. A second issue, more relevant to the discussion in this chapter,
       concerns how close the economy is to the full employment output level. In a recession, when the AD and AS curves
       intersect far below the full employment level, tax cuts can make sense as a way of shifting AD to the right. However,
       when the economy is already performing extremely well, tax cuts may shift AD so far to the right as to generate
       inflationary pressures, with little gain to GDP.

       With the AD/AS framework in mind, many economists might readily believe that the 1981 Reagan tax cuts, which
       took effect just after two serious recessions, were beneficial economic policy. Similarly, Congress enacted the 2001
       Bush tax cuts and the 2009 Obama tax cuts during recessions. However, some of the same economists who favor
       tax cuts during recession would be much more dubious about identical tax cuts at a time the economy is performing
       well and cyclical unemployment is low.

       Government spending and tax rate changes can be useful tools to affect aggregate demand. We will discuss
       these in greater detail in the Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy chapter and The Impacts of Government
       Borrowing. Other policy tools can shift the aggregate demand curve as well. For example, as we will discuss in
       the Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation chapter, the Federal Reserve can affect interest rates and credit
       availability. Higher interest rates tend to discourage borrowing and thus reduce both household spending on
       big-ticket items like houses and cars and investment spending by business. Conversely, lower interest rates
       will stimulate consumption and investment demand. Interest rates can also affect exchange rates, which in
       turn will have effects on the export and import components of aggregate demand.

       Clarifying the details of these alternative policies and how they affect the components of aggregate demand
       can wait for The Keynesian Perspective chapter. Here, the key lesson is that a shift of the aggregate demand
       curve to the right leads to a greater real GDP and to upward pressure on the price level. Conversely, a shift of
       aggregate demand to the left leads to a lower real GDP and a lower price level. Whether these changes in output
       and price level are relatively large or relatively small, and how the change in equilibrium relates to potential
       GDP, depends on whether the shift in the AD curve is happening in the AS curve's relatively flat or relatively
       steep portion.

     24.5 How the AD/AS Model Incorporates Growth, Unemployment, and Inflation

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Use the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model to show periods of economic growth and recession
         · Explain how unemployment and inflation impact the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model
         · Evaluate the importance of the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model

       The AD/AS model can convey a number of interlocking relationships between the three macroeconomic goals
       of growth, unemployment, and low inflation. Moreover, the AD/AS framework is flexible enough to
       accommodate both the Keynes' law approach that focuses on aggregate demand and the short run, while also
       including the Say's law approach that focuses on aggregate supply and the long run. These advantages are
       considerable. Every model is a simplified version of the deeper reality and, in the context of the AD/AS model,
       the three macroeconomic goals arise in ways that are sometimes indirect or incomplete. In this module, we
       consider how the AD/AS model illustrates the three macroeconomic goals of economic growth, low
       unemployment, and low inflation.

Growth and Recession in the AD/AS Diagram

In the AD/AS diagram, long-run economic growth due to productivity increases over time will be represented
by a gradual shift to the right of aggregate supply. The vertical line representing potential GDP (or the "full
employment level of GDP") will gradually shift to the right over time as well. Earlier Figure 24.7 (a) showed a
pattern of economic growth over three years, with the AS curve shifting slightly out to the right each year.
However, the factors that determine the speed of this long-term economic growth rate--like investment in
physical and human capital, technology, and whether an economy can take advantage of catch-up growth--do
not appear directly in the AD/AS diagram.

In the short run, GDP falls and rises in every economy, as the economy dips into recession or expands out of
recession. The AD/AS diagram illustrates recessions when the equilibrium level of real GDP is substantially
below potential GDP, as we see at the equilibrium point E0 in Figure 24.9. From another standpoint, in years of
resurgent economic growth the equilibrium will typically be close to potential GDP, as equilibrium point E1 in
that earlier figure shows.

Unemployment in the AD/AS Diagram

We described two types of unemployment in the Unemployment chapter. Short run variations in
unemployment (cyclical unemployment) are caused by the business cycle as the economy expands and
contracts. Over the long run, in the United States, the unemployment rate typically hovers around 5% (give or
take one percentage point or so), when the economy is healthy. In many of the national economies across
Europe, the unemployment rate in recent decades has only dropped to about 10% or a bit lower, even in good
economic years. We call this baseline level of unemployment that occurs year-in and year-out the natural rate
of unemployment and we determine it by how well the structures of market and government institutions in the
economy lead to a matching of workers and employers in the labor market. Potential GDP can imply different
unemployment rates in different economies, depending on the natural rate of unemployment for that
economy.

The AD/AS diagram shows cyclical unemployment by how close the economy is to the potential or full GDP
employment level. Returning to Figure 24.9, relatively low cyclical unemployment for an economy occurs
when the level of output is close to potential GDP, as in the equilibrium point E1. Conversely, high cyclical
unemployment arises when the output is substantially to the left of potential GDP on the AD/AS diagram, as at
the equilibrium point E0. Although we do not show the factors that determine the natural rate of
unemployment separately in the AD/AS model, they are implicitly part of what determines potential GDP or
full employment GDP in a given economy.

Inflationary Pressures in the AD/AS Diagram

Inflation fluctuates in the short run. Higher inflation rates have typically occurred either during or just after
economic booms: for example, the biggest spurts of inflation in the U.S. economy during the twentieth century
followed the wartime booms of World War I and World War II. Conversely, rates of inflation generally decline
during recessions. As an extreme example, inflation actually became negative--a situation called
"deflation"--during the Great Depression. Even during the relatively short 1991-1992 recession, the inflation
rate declined from 5.4% in 1990 to 3.0% in 1992. During the relatively short 2001 recession, the rate of
inflation declined from 3.4% in 2000 to 1.6% in 2002. During the deep recession of 2007-2009, the inflation
rate declined from 3.8% in 2008 to -0.4% in 2009. Some countries have experienced bouts of high inflation
that lasted for years. In the U.S. economy since the mid-1980s, inflation does not seem to have had any long-
term trend to be substantially higher. Instead, it has stayed in the 1-5% range annually.

The AD/AS framework implies two ways that inflationary pressures may arise. One possible trigger is if
aggregate demand continues to shift to the right when the economy is already at or near potential GDP and full
employment, thus pushing the macroeconomic equilibrium into the AS curve's steep portion. In Figure 24.10
(a), there is a shift of aggregate demand to the right. The new equilibrium E1 is clearly at a higher price level
602 24 · The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model

       than the original equilibrium E0. In this situation, the aggregate demand in the economy has soared so high
       that firms in the economy are not capable of producing additional goods, because labor and physical capital
       are fully employed, and so additional increases in aggregate demand can only result in a rise in the price level.

       FIGURE 24.10 Sources of Inflationary Pressure in the AD/AS Model (a) A shift in aggregate demand, from AD0 to
       AD1, when it happens in the area of the SRAS curve that is near potential GDP, will lead to a higher price level and to
       pressure for a higher price level and inflation. The new equilibrium (E1) is at a higher price level (P1) than the
       original equilibrium. (b) A shift in aggregate supply, from SRAS0 to SRAS1, will lead to a lower real GDP and to
       pressure for a higher price level and inflation. The new equilibrium (E1) is at a higher price level (P1), while the
       original equilibrium (E0) is at the lower price level (P0).
       An alternative source of inflationary pressures can occur due to a rise in input prices that affects many or most
       firms across the economy--perhaps an important input to production like oil or labor--and causes the
       aggregate supply curve to shift back to the left. In Figure 24.10 (b), the SRAS curve's shift to the left also
       increases the price level from P0 at the original equilibrium (E0) to a higher price level of P1 at the new
       equilibrium (E1). In effect, the rise in input prices ends up, after the final output is produced and sold, passing
       along in the form of a higher price level for outputs.
       The AD/AS diagram shows only a one-time shift in the price level. It does not address the question of what
       would cause inflation either to vanish after a year, or to sustain itself for several years. There are two
       explanations for why inflation may persist over time. One way that continual inflationary price increases can
       occur is if the government continually attempts to stimulate aggregate demand in a way that keeps pushing the
       AD curve when it is already in the SRAS curve's steep portion. A second possibility is that, if inflation has been
       occurring for several years, people might begin to expect a certain level of inflation. If they do, then these
       expectations will cause prices, wages and interest rates to increase annually by the amount of the inflation
       expected. These two reasons are interrelated, because if a government fosters a macroeconomic environment
       with inflationary pressures, then people will grow to expect inflation. However, the AD/AS diagram does not
       show these patterns of ongoing or expected inflation in a direct way.

      Importance of the Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model

       Macroeconomics takes an overall view of the economy, which means that it needs to juggle many different
       concepts. For example, start with the three macroeconomic goals of growth, low inflation, and low

unemployment. Aggregate demand has four elements: consumption, investment, government spending, and
exports less imports. Aggregate supply reveals how businesses throughout the economy will react to a higher
price level for outputs. Finally, a wide array of economic events and policy decisions can affect aggregate
demand and aggregate supply, including government tax and spending decisions; consumer and business
confidence; changes in prices of key inputs like oil; and technology that brings higher levels of productivity.
The aggregate demand/aggregate supply model is one of the fundamental diagrams in this course (like the
budget constraint diagram that we introduced in the Choice in a World of Scarcity chapter and the supply and
demand diagram in the Demand and Supply chapter) because it provides an overall framework for bringing
these factors together in one diagram. Some version of the AD/AS model will appear in every chapter in the
rest of this book.

24.6 Keynes' Law and Say's Law in the AD/AS Model

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Identify the neoclassical zone, the intermediate zone, and the Keynesian zone in the aggregate demand/
      aggregate supply model

  · Use an aggregate demand/aggregate supply model as a diagnostic test to understand the current state of
      the economy

We can use the AD/AS model to illustrate both Say's law that supply creates its own demand and Keynes' law
that demand creates its own supply. Consider the SRAS curve's three zones which Figure 24.11 identifies: the
Keynesian zone, the neoclassical zone, and the intermediate zone.

FIGURE 24.11 Keynes, Neoclassical, and Intermediate Zones in the Aggregate Supply Curve Near the equilibrium
Ek, in the Keynesian zone at the far left of the SRAS curve, small shifts in AD, either to the right or the left, will affect
the output level Yk, but will not much affect the price level. In the Keynesian zone, AD largely determines the
quantity of output. Near the equilibrium En, in the neoclassical zone at the SRAS curve's far right, small shifts in AD,
either to the right or the left, will have relatively little effect on the output level Yn, but instead will have a greater
effect on the price level. In the neoclassical zone, the near-vertical SRAS curve close to the level of potential GDP
largely determines the quantity of output. In the intermediate zone around equilibrium Ei, movement in AD to the
right will increase both the output level and the price level, while a movement in AD to the left would decrease both
the output level and the price level.
604 24 · The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model

       Focus first on the Keynesian zone, that portion of the SRAS curve on the far left which is relatively flat. If the
       AD curve crosses this portion of the SRAS curve at an equilibrium point like Ek, then certain statements about
       the economic situation will follow. In the Keynesian zone, the equilibrium level of real GDP is far below
       potential GDP, the economy is in recession, and cyclical unemployment is high. If aggregate demand shifted to
       the right or left in the Keynesian zone, it will determine the resulting level of output (and thus unemployment).
       However, inflationary price pressure is not much of a worry in the Keynesian zone, since the price level does
       not vary much in this zone.

       Now, focus your attention on the neoclassical zone of the SRAS curve, which is the near-vertical portion on the
       right-hand side. If the AD curve crosses this portion of the SRAS curve at an equilibrium point like En where
       output is at or near potential GDP, then the size of potential GDP pretty much determines the level of output in
       the economy. Since the equilibrium is near potential GDP, cyclical unemployment is low in this economy,
       although structural unemployment may remain an issue. In the neoclassical zone, shifts of aggregate demand
       to the right or the left have little effect on the level of output or employment. The only way to increase the size
       of the real GDP in the neoclassical zone is for AS to shift to the right. However, shifts in AD in the neoclassical
       zone will create pressures to change the price level.

       Finally, consider the SRAS curve's intermediate zone in Figure 24.11. If the AD curve crosses this portion of
       the SRAS curve at an equilibrium point like Ei, then we might expect unemployment and inflation to move in
       opposing directions. For instance, a shift of AD to the right will move output closer to potential GDP and thus
       reduce unemployment, but will also lead to a higher price level and upward pressure on inflation. Conversely, a
       shift of AD to the left will move output further from potential GDP and raise unemployment, but will also lead
       to a lower price level and downward pressure on inflation.

       This approach of dividing the SRAS curve into different zones works as a diagnostic test that we can apply to
       an economy, like a doctor checking a patient for symptoms. First, figure out in what zone the economy is. This
       will clarify the economic issues, tradeoffs, and policy choices. Some economists believe that the economy is
       strongly predisposed to be in one zone or another. Thus, hard-line Keynesian economists believe that the
       economies are in the Keynesian zone most of the time, and so they view the neoclassical zone as a theoretical
       abstraction. Conversely, hard-line neoclassical economists argue that economies are in the neoclassical zone
       most of the time and that the Keynesian zone is a distraction. The Keynesian Perspective and The Neoclassical
       Perspective should help to clarify the underpinnings and consequences of these contrasting views of the
       macroeconomy.

      The Pandemic-Induced Recession: Supply or Demand?

       We mentioned earlier that a pandemic could cause a shock in the short- or long-run aggregate supply curve by
       temporarily reducing labor supply and slowing or stopping production of goods and services. Pandemics can also
       affect aggregate demand. When people are hesitant to spend or travel, or if they are not allowed to spend or travel
       because of social restrictions, this will affect spending in the economy. Consumers spend less at restaurants, hotels,
       and travel, among other areas, while firms stop investing because of the lack of demand and an uncertain future.
       Both actions lead to a leftward shift in the aggregate demand curve.

       While there is some debate over whether the pandemic-induced recession that the U.S. economy experienced in
       2020 was primarily a supply- or demand-driven one, most likely, it is a combination of both. In March and April
       2020, workers left the labor market en masse, and later in the year, they were hesitant to return due to health and
       safety concerns. Many people were also forced to cancel travel plans or voluntarily did so out of concern for their
       safety, further reducing aggregate demand. These changes caused deep cuts in the global economy that continued
       to be felt two years after the initial pandemic-induced shocks.

Key Concepts and Summary

24.1 Macroeconomic Perspectives on Demand and Supply

Neoclassical economists emphasize Say's law, which holds that supply creates its own demand. Keynesian
economists emphasize Keynes' law, which holds that demand creates its own supply. Many mainstream
economists take a Keynesian perspective, emphasizing the importance of aggregate demand, for the short run,
and a neoclassical perspective, emphasizing the importance of aggregate supply, for the long run.

24.2 Building a Model of Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply

The upward-sloping short run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve shows the positive relationship between the
price level and the level of real GDP in the short run. Aggregate supply slopes up because when the price level
for outputs increases, while the price level of inputs remains fixed, the opportunity for additional profits
encourages more production. The aggregate supply curve is near-horizontal on the left and near-vertical on
the right. In the long run, we show the aggregate supply by a vertical line at the level of potential output, which
is the maximum level of output the economy can produce with its existing levels of workers, physical capital,
technology, and economic institutions.

The downward-sloping aggregate demand (AD) curve shows the relationship between the price level for
outputs and the quantity of total spending in the economy. It slopes down because of: (a) the wealth effect,
which means that a higher price level leads to lower real wealth, which reduces the level of consumption; (b)
the interest rate effect, which holds that a higher price level will mean a greater demand for money, which will
tend to drive up interest rates and reduce investment spending; and (c) the foreign price effect, which holds
that a rise in the price level will make domestic goods relatively more expensive, discouraging exports and
606 24 · Key Concepts and Summary

encouraging imports.

24.3 Shifts in Aggregate Supply

The aggregate demand/aggregate supply (AD/AS) diagram shows how AD and AS interact. The intersection of
the AD and AS curves shows the equilibrium output and price level in the economy. Movements of either AS or
AD will result in a different equilibrium output and price level. The aggregate supply curve will shift out to the
right as productivity increases. It will shift back to the left as the price of key inputs rises, and will shift out to
the right if the price of key inputs falls. If the AS curve shifts back to the left, the combination of lower output,
higher unemployment, and higher inflation, called stagflation, occurs. If AS shifts out to the right, a
combination of lower inflation, higher output, and lower unemployment is possible.

24.4 Shifts in Aggregate Demand

The AD curve will shift out as the components of aggregate demand--C, I, G, and X-M--rise. It will shift back to
the left as these components fall. These factors can change because of different personal choices, like those
resulting from consumer or business confidence, or from policy choices like changes in government spending
and taxes. If the AD curve shifts to the right, then the equilibrium quantity of output and the price level will
rise. If the AD curve shifts to the left, then the equilibrium quantity of output and the price level will fall.
Whether equilibrium output changes relatively more than the price level or whether the price level changes
relatively more than output is determined by where the AD curve intersects with the AS curve.

The AD/AS diagram superficially resembles the microeconomic supply and demand diagram on the surface,
but in reality, what is on the horizontal and vertical axes and the underlying economic reasons for the shapes
of the curves are very different. We can illustrate long-term economic growth in the AD/AS framework by a
gradual shift of the aggregate supply curve to the right. We illustrate a recession when the intersection of AD
and AS is substantially below potential GDP, while we illustrate an expanding economy when the intersection
of AS and AD is near potential GDP.

24.5 How the AD/AS Model Incorporates Growth, Unemployment, and Inflation

Cyclical unemployment is relatively large in the AD/AS framework when the equilibrium is substantially below
potential GDP. Cyclical unemployment is small in the AD/AS framework when the equilibrium is near potential
GDP. The natural rate of unemployment, as determined by the labor market institutions of the economy, is
built into what economists mean by potential GDP, but does not otherwise appear in an AD/AS diagram. The
AD/AS framework shows pressures for inflation to rise or fall when the movement from one equilibrium to
another causes the price level to rise or to fall. The balance of trade does not appear directly in the AD/AS
diagram, but it appears indirectly in several ways. Increases in exports or declines in imports can cause shifts
in AD. Changes in the price of key imported inputs to production, like oil, can cause shifts in AS. The AD/AS
model is the key model we use in this book to understand macroeconomic issues.

24.6 Keynes' Law and Say's Law in the AD/AS Model

We can divide the SRAS curve into three zones. Keynes' law says demand creates its own supply, so that
changes in aggregate demand cause changes in real GDP and employment. We can show Keynes' law on the
horizontal Keynesian zone of the aggregate supply curve. The Keynesian zone occurs at the left of the SRAS
curve where it is fairly flat, so movements in AD will affect output, but have little effect on the price level. Say's
law says supply creates its own demand. Changes in aggregate demand have no effect on real GDP and
employment, only on the price level. We can show Say's law on the vertical neoclassical zone of the aggregate
supply curve. The neoclassical zone occurs at the right of the SRAS curve where it is fairly vertical, and so
movements in AD will affect the price level, but have little impact on output. The intermediate zone in the
middle of the SRAS curve is upward-sloping, so a rise in AD will cause higher output and price level, while a fall
in AD will lead to a lower output and price level.

Introduction to the Keynesian Perspective

         BRING IT HOME

The Great Recession

The 2008-2009 Great Recession hit the U.S. economy hard. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the
number of unemployed Americans rose from 6.8 million in May 2007 to 15.4 million in October 2009. During that
time, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated that approximately 170,000 small businesses closed. Mass layoffs peaked
in February 2009 when employers gave 326,392 workers notice. U.S. productivity and output fell as well. Job
losses, declining home values, declining incomes, and uncertainty about the future caused consumption
expenditures to decrease. According to the BLS, household spending dropped by 7.8%.

Home foreclosures and the meltdown in U.S. financial markets called for immediate action by Congress, the
President, and the Federal Reserve Bank. For example, the government implemented programs such as the
American Restoration and Recovery Act to help millions of people by providing tax credits for homebuyers, paying
614 25 · The Keynesian Perspective

       "cash for clunkers," and extending unemployment benefits. From cutting back on spending, filing for
       unemployment, and losing homes, millions of people were affected by the recession. While the United States is now
       on the path to recovery, people will feel the impact for many years to come.
       What caused this recession and what prevented the economy from spiraling further into another depression?
       Policymakers looked to the lessons learned from the 1930s Great Depression and to John Maynard Keynes' models
       to analyze the causes and find solutions to the country's economic woes. The Keynesian perspective is the subject
       of this chapter.
       We have learned that the level of economic activity, for example output, employment, and spending, tends to
       grow over time. In The Keynesian Perspective we learned the reasons for this trend. The Macroeconomic
       Perspective pointed out that the economy tends to cycle around the long-run trend. In other words, the
       economy does not always grow at its average growth rate. Sometimes economic activity grows at the trend rate,
       sometimes it grows more than the trend, sometimes it grows less than the trend, and sometimes it actually
       declines. You can see this cyclical behavior in Figure 25.2.

       FIGURE 25.2 U.S. Real Domestic Product, Percent Changes 1930-2020 The chart tracks the percent change in
       Real GDP since 1930. The magnitude of both recessions and peaks was quite large between 1930 and 1945.
       (Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis, "National Economic Accounts," https://apps.bea.gov/itable/index.cfm)
       This empirical reality raises two important questions: How can we explain the cycles, and to what extent can
       we moderate them? This chapter (on the Keynesian perspective) and The Neoclassical Perspective explore
       those questions from two different points of view, building on what we learned in The Aggregate Demand/
       Aggregate Supply Model.

25.1 Aggregate Demand in Keynesian Analysis

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Explain real GDP, recessionary gaps, and inflationary gaps
  · Recognize the Keynesian AD/AS model
  · Identify the determining factors of both consumption expenditure and investment expenditure
  · Analyze the factors that determine government spending and net exports
The Keynesian perspective focuses on aggregate demand. The idea is simple: firms produce output only if they
expect it to sell. Thus, while the availability of the factors of production determines a nation's potential GDP,
the amount of goods and services that actually sell, known as real GDP, depends on how much demand exists
across the economy. Figure 25.3 illustrates this point.

FIGURE 25.3 The Keynesian AD/AS Model The Keynesian View of the AD/AS Model uses an SRAS curve, which is
horizontal at levels of output below potential and vertical at potential output. Thus, when beginning from potential
output, any decrease in AD affects only output, but not prices. Any increase in AD affects only prices, not output.
Keynes argued that, for reasons we explain shortly, aggregate demand is not stable--that it can change
unexpectedly. Suppose the economy starts where AD intersects SRAS at P0 and Yp. Because Yp is potential
output, the economy is at full employment. Because AD is volatile, it can easily fall. Thus, even if we start at Yp,
if AD falls, then we find ourselves in what Keynes termed a recessionary gap. The economy is in equilibrium
but with less than full employment, as Y1 in Figure 25.3 shows. Keynes believed that the economy would tend
to stay in a recessionary gap, with its attendant unemployment, for a significant period of time.
In the same way (although we do not show it in the figure), if AD increases, the economy could experience an
inflationary gap, where demand is attempting to push the economy past potential output. Consequently, the
economy experiences inflation. The key policy implication for either situation is that government needs to step
in and close the gap, increasing spending during recessions and decreasing spending during booms to return
aggregate demand to match potential output.
Recall from The Aggregate Supply-Aggregate Demand Model that aggregate demand is total spending,
economy-wide, on domestic goods and services. (Aggregate demand (AD) is actually what economists call total
planned expenditure. Read the appendix on The Expenditure-Output Model for more on this.) You may also
remember that aggregate demand is the sum of four components: consumption expenditure, investment
expenditure, government spending, and spending on net exports (exports minus imports). In the following
sections, we will examine each component through the Keynesian perspective.

What Determines Consumption Expenditure?

Consumption expenditure is spending by households and individuals on durable goods, nondurable goods,
and services. Durable goods are items that last and provide value over time, such as automobiles. Nondurable
goods are things like groceries--once you consume them, they are gone. Recall from The Macroeconomic
616 25 · The Keynesian Perspective

       Perspective that services are intangible things consumers buy, like healthcare or entertainment.

       Keynes identified three factors that affect consumption:

         · Disposable income: For most people, the single most powerful determinant of how much they consume is
             how much income they have in their take-home pay, also known as disposable income, which is income
             after taxes.

         · Expected future income: Consumer expectations about future income also are important in determining
             consumption. If consumers feel optimistic about the future, they are more likely to spend and increase
             overall aggregate demand. News of recession and troubles in the economy will make them pull back on
             consumption.

         · Wealth or credit: When households experience a rise in wealth, they may be willing to consume a higher
             share of their income and to save less. When the U.S. stock market rose dramatically in the late 1990s, for
             example, U.S. savings rates declined, probably in part because people felt that their wealth had increased
             and there was less need to save. How do people spend beyond their income, when they perceive their
             wealth increasing? The answer is borrowing. On the other side, when the U.S. stock market declined about
             40% from March 2008 to March 2009, people felt far greater uncertainty about their economic future, so
             savings rates increased while consumption declined.

       Finally, Keynes noted that a variety of other factors combine to determine how much people save and spend. If
       household preferences about saving shift in a way that encourages consumption rather than saving, then AD
       will shift out to the right.

       various groups of people.

      What Determines Investment Expenditure?

       We call spending on new capital goods investment expenditure. Investment falls into four categories:
       producer's durable equipment and software, nonresidential structures (such as factories, offices, and retail
       locations), changes in inventories, and residential structures (such as single-family homes, townhouses, and
       apartment buildings). Businesses conduct the first three types of investment, while households conduct the
       last.

       Keynes's treatment of investment focuses on the key role of expectations about the future in influencing
       business decisions. When a business decides to make an investment in physical assets, like plants or
       equipment, or in intangible assets, like skills or a research and development project, that firm considers both
       the expected investment benefits (future profit expectations) and the investment costs (interest rates).

         · Expectations of future profits: The clearest driver of investment benefits is expectations for future profits.
             When we expect an economy to grow, businesses perceive a growing market for their products. Their
             higher degree of business confidence will encourage new investment. For example, in the second half of
             the 1990s, U.S. investment levels surged from 18% of GDP in 1994 to 21% in 2000. However, when a
             recession started in 2001, U.S. investment levels quickly sank back to 18% of GDP by 2002.

         · Interest rates also play a significant role in determining how much investment a firm will make. Just as
             individuals need to borrow money to purchase homes, so businesses need financing when they purchase
             big ticket items. The cost of investment thus includes the interest rate. Even if the firm has the funds, the
             interest rate measures the opportunity cost of purchasing business capital. Lower interest rates stimulate
             investment spending and higher interest rates reduce it.

       Many factors can affect the expected profitability on investment. For example, if the energy prices decline,
       then investments that use energy as an input will yield higher profits. If government offers special incentives

                                                                                                                         25.1 · Aggregate Demand in Keynesian Analysis 617

for investment (for example, through the tax code), then investment will look more attractive; conversely, if
government removes special investment incentives from the tax code, or increases other business taxes, then
investment will look less attractive. As Keynes noted, business investment is the most variable of all the
components of aggregate demand.

What Determines Government Spending?

The third component of aggregate demand is federal, state, and local government spending. Although we
usually view the United States as a market economy, government still plays a significant role in the economy.
As we discuss in Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities and Positive Externalities and Public
Goods, government provides important public services such as national defense, transportation
infrastructure, and education.

Keynes recognized that the government budget offered a powerful tool for influencing aggregate demand. Not
only could more government spending stimulate AD (or less government spending reduce it), but lowering or
raising tax rates could influence consumption and investment spending. Keynes concluded that during
extreme times like deep recessions, only the government had the power and resources to move aggregate
demand. For example, during the 2020 pandemic-induced recession, the federal government gave money to
state and local governments and to households to support the economy when many firms and governments
needed to shut down or suffered a large decline in revenue and needed to lay off workers.

What Determines Net Exports?

Recall that exports are domestically produced products that sell abroad while imports are foreign produced
products that consumers purchase domestically. Since we define aggregate demand as spending on domestic
goods and services, export expenditures add to AD, while import expenditures subtract from AD.

Two sets of factors can cause shifts in export and import demand: changes in relative growth rates between
countries and changes in relative prices between countries. What is happening in the countries' economies
that would be purchasing those exports heavily affects the level of demand for a nation's exports. For example,
if major importers of American-made products like Canada, Japan, and Germany have recessions, exports of
U.S. products to those countries are likely to decline. Conversely, the amount of income in the domestic
economy directly affects the quantity of a nation's imports: more income will bring a higher level of imports.

Relative prices of goods in domestic and international markets can also affect exports and imports. If U.S.
goods are relatively cheaper compared with goods made in other places, perhaps because a group of U.S.
producers has mastered certain productivity breakthroughs, then U.S. exports are likely to rise. If U.S. goods
become relatively more expensive, perhaps because a change in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and
other currencies has pushed up the price of inputs to production in the United States, then exports from U.S.
producers are likely to decline.

Table 25.1 summarizes the reasons we have explained for changes in aggregate demand.

25.2 The Building Blocks of Keynesian Analysis

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Evaluate the Keynesian view of recessions through an understanding of sticky wages and prices and the
      importance of aggregate demand

  · Explain the coordination argument, menu costs, and macroeconomic externality
  · Analyze the impact of the expenditure multiplier

Now that we have a clear understanding of what constitutes aggregate demand, we return to the Keynesian
argument using the model of aggregate demand/aggregate supply (AD/AS). (For a similar treatment using
Keynes' income-expenditure model, see the appendix on The Expenditure-Output Model.)

Keynesian economics focuses on explaining why recessions and depressions occur and offering a policy
prescription for minimizing their effects. The Keynesian view of recession is based on two key building blocks.
First, aggregate demand is not always automatically high enough to provide firms with an incentive to hire
enough workers to reach full employment. Second, the macroeconomy may adjust only slowly to shifts in
aggregate demand because of sticky wages and prices, which are wages and prices that do not respond to
decreases or increases in demand. We will consider these two claims in turn, and then see how they are
represented in the AD/AS model.

The first building block of the Keynesian diagnosis is that recessions occur when the level of demand for goods
and services is less than what is produced when labor is fully employed. In other words, the intersection of
aggregate supply and aggregate demand occurs at a level of output less than the level of GDP consistent with
full employment. Suppose the stock market crashes, as in 1929, or suppose the housing market collapses, as in
2008. In either case, household wealth will decline, and consumption expenditure will follow. Suppose

businesses see that consumer spending is falling or face restrictions from a pandemic that curtail their
operations. That will reduce expectations of the profitability of investment, so businesses will decrease
investment expenditure.

This seemed to be the case during the Great Depression, since the physical capacity of the economy to supply
goods did not alter much. No flood or earthquake or other natural disaster ruined factories in 1929 or 1930. No
outbreak of disease decimated the ranks of workers. No key input price, like the price of oil, soared on world
markets. The U.S. economy in 1933 had just about the same factories, workers, and state of technology as it
had had four years earlier in 1929--and yet the economy had shrunk dramatically. This also seems to be what
happened in 2008.

As Keynes recognized, the events of the Depression contradicted Say's law that "supply creates its own
demand." Although production capacity existed, the markets were not able to sell their products. As a result,
real GDP was less than potential GDP.

Wage and Price Stickiness

Keynes also pointed out that although AD fluctuated, prices and wages did not immediately respond as
economists often expected. Instead, prices and wages are "sticky," making it difficult to restore the economy to
full employment and potential GDP. Keynes emphasized one particular reason why wages were sticky: the
coordination argument. This argument points out that, even if most people would be willing--at least
hypothetically--to see a decline in their own wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also
experienced such a decline, a market-oriented economy has no obvious way to implement a plan of
coordinated wage reductions. Unemployment proposed a number of reasons why wages might be sticky
downward, most of which center on the argument that businesses avoid wage cuts because they may in one
way or another depress morale and hurt the productivity of the existing workers.

Some modern economists have argued in a Keynesian spirit that, along with wages, other prices may be sticky,
too. Many firms do not change their prices every day or even every month. When a firm considers changing
prices, it must consider two sets of costs. First, changing prices uses company resources: managers must
analyze the competition and market demand and decide the new prices, they must update sales materials,
change billing records, and redo product and price labels. Second, frequent price changes may leave
customers confused or angry--especially if they discover that a product now costs more than they expected.
These costs of changing prices are called menu costs--like the costs of printing a new set of menus with
different prices in a restaurant. Prices do respond to forces of supply and demand, but from a macroeconomic
perspective, the process of changing all prices throughout the economy takes time.

To understand the effect of sticky wages and prices in the economy, consider Figure 25.4 (a) illustrating the
overall labor market, while Figure 25.4 (b) illustrates a market for a specific good or service. The original
equilibrium (E0) in each market occurs at the intersection of the demand curve (D0) and supply curve (S0).
When aggregate demand declines, the demand for labor shifts to the left (to D1) in Figure 25.4 (a) and the
demand for goods shifts to the left (to D1) in Figure 25.4 (b). However, because of sticky wages and prices, the
wage remains at its original level (W0) for a period of time and the price remains at its original level (P0).

As a result, a situation of excess supply--where the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded at the
existing wage or price--exists in markets for both labor and goods, and Q1 is less than Q0 in both Figure 25.4 (a)
and Figure 25.4 (b). When many labor markets and many goods markets all across the economy find
themselves in this position, the economy is in a recession; that is, firms cannot sell what they wish to produce
at the existing market price and do not wish to hire all who are willing to work at the existing market wage. The
620 25 · The Keynesian Perspective

       Clear It Up feature discusses this problem in more detail.

       FIGURE 25.4 Sticky Prices and Falling Demand in the Labor and Goods Market In both (a) and (b), demand shifts
       left from D0 to D1. However, the wage in (a) and the price in (b) do not immediately decline. In (a), the quantity
       demanded of labor at the original wage (W0) is Q0, but with the new demand curve for labor (D1), it will be Q1.
       Similarly, in (b), the quantity demanded of goods at the original price (P0) is Q0, but at the new demand curve (D1) it
       will be Q1. An excess supply of labor will exist, which we call unemployment. An excess supply of goods will also
       exist, where the quantity demanded is substantially less than the quantity supplied. Thus, sticky wages and sticky
       prices, combined with a drop in demand, bring about unemployment and recession.

      Why Was the Pace of Wage Adjustments Slow?

       The recovery after the Great Recession in the United States was slow. In fact, many low-wage workers at
       McDonalds, Dominos, and Walmart threatened to strike for higher wages. Their plight was part of a larger trend in
       job growth and pay in the post-recession recovery.

The National Employment Law Project compiled data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and found that, during the
Great Recession, 60% of job losses were in medium-wage occupations. Most of them were replaced during the
recovery period with lower-wage jobs in the service, retail, and food industries. Figure 25.5 illustrates this data.
Wages in the service, retail, and food industries are at or near minimum wage and tend to be both downwardly and
upwardly "sticky." Wages are downwardly sticky due to minimum wage laws. They may be upwardly sticky if
insufficient competition in low-skilled labor markets enables employers to avoid raising wages that would reduce
their profits. At the same time, however, the Consumer Price Index increased 11% between 2007 and 2012,
pushing real wages down.

The Two Keynesian Assumptions in the AD/AS Model

Figure 25.6 is the AD/AS diagram which illustrates these two Keynesian assumptions--the importance of
aggregate demand in causing recession and the stickiness of wages and prices. Note that because of the
stickiness of wages and prices, the aggregate supply curve is flatter than either supply curve (labor or specific
good). In fact, if wages and prices were so sticky that they did not fall at all, the aggregate supply curve would
be completely flat below potential GDP, as Figure 25.6 shows. This outcome is an important example of a
macroeconomic externality, where what happens at the macro level is different from what happens at the
micro level. For example, a firm should respond to a decrease in demand for its product by cutting its price to
increase sales. However, as already noted, menu costs may lead to sticky prices, and sticky prices in the
aggregate prevent aggregate demand from rebounding (which we would show as a movement along the AD
curve in response to a lower price level). Similarly, the coordination argument may lead to sticky wages, and
sticky wages will lead to a flat SRAS curve and GDP less than potential.
The original equilibrium of this economy occurs where the aggregate demand function (AD0) intersects with
AS. Since this intersection occurs at potential GDP (Yp), the economy is operating at full employment. When
aggregate demand shifts to the left, all the adjustment occurs through decreased real GDP. There is no
decrease in the price level. Since the equilibrium occurs at Y1, the economy experiences substantial
unemployment.

FIGURE 25.6 A Keynesian Perspective of Recession This figure illustrates the two key assumptions behind
Keynesian economics. A recession begins when aggregate demand declines from AD0 to AD1. The recession persists
because of the assumption of fixed wages and prices, which makes the SRAS flat below potential GDP. If that were
not the case, the price level would fall also, raising GDP and limiting the recession. Instead the intersection E1
occurs in the flat portion of the SRAS curve where GDP is less than potential.

The Expenditure Multiplier

A key concept in Keynesian economics is the expenditure multiplier. The expenditure multiplier is the idea
that not only does spending affect the equilibrium level of GDP, but that spending is powerful. More precisely, it
means that, theoretically, a change in spending causes a more than proportionate change in GDP.
622 25 · The Keynesian Perspective

       The reason for the expenditure multiplier is that one person's spending becomes another person's income,
       and given certain conditions, this leads to additional spending and additional income so that the cumulative
       impact on GDP is larger than the initial increase in spending. (Research has shown that some expenditure
       multipliers are less than one. For example, tax cuts for the wealthy have an expenditure multiplier of less than
       one.) The appendix on The Expenditure-Output Model provides the details of the multiplier process, but the
       concept is important enough for us to summarize here. While the multiplier is important for understanding
       the effectiveness of fiscal policy, it occurs whenever any autonomous increase in spending occurs.
       Additionally, the multiplier operates in a negative as well as a positive direction. Thus, when investment
       spending collapsed during the Great Depression, it caused a much larger decrease in real GDP. The size of the
       multiplier is critical and was a key element in discussions of the effectiveness of the Obama administration's
       fiscal stimulus package, officially titled the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

         · Analyze the Keynesian policy for reducing unemployment and inflation
       The simplified AD/AS model that we have used so far is fully consistent with Keynes's original model. More
       recent research, though, has indicated that in the real world, an aggregate supply curve is more curved than
       the right angle that we used in this chapter. Rather, the real-world AS curve is very flat at levels of output far
       below potential ("the Keynesian zone"), very steep at levels of output above potential ("the neoclassical zone")
       and curved in between ("the intermediate zone"). Figure 25.7 illustrates this. The typical aggregate supply
       curve leads to the concept of the Phillips curve.

the right or the left, will have relatively little effect on the output level Yn, but instead will have a greater effect on
the price level. In the neoclassical zone, the near-vertical SRAS curve close to the level of potential GDP (as
represented by the LRAS line) largely determines the quantity of output. In the intermediate zone around
equilibrium Ei, movement in AD to the right will increase both the output level and the price level, while a movement
in AD to the left would decrease both the output level and the price level.

The Discovery of the Phillips Curve

In the 1950s, A.W. Phillips, an economist at the London School of Economics, was studying the Keynesian
analytical framework. The Keynesian theory implied that during a recession inflationary pressures are low, but
when the level of output is at or even pushing beyond potential GDP, the economy is at greater risk for inflation.
Phillips analyzed 60 years of British data and did find that tradeoff between unemployment and inflation,
which became known as the Phillips curve. Figure 25.8 shows a theoretical Phillips curve, and the following
Work It Out feature shows how the pattern appears for the United States.

FIGURE 25.8 A Keynesian Phillips Curve Tradeoff between Unemployment and Inflation A Phillips curve illustrates a
tradeoff between the unemployment rate and the inflation rate. If one is higher, the other must be lower. For
example, point A illustrates a 5% inflation rate and a 4% unemployment. If the government attempts to reduce
inflation to 2%, then it will experience a rise in unemployment to 7%, as point B shows.

                                                                                                          WORK IT OUT

         break down during the 1970s as the Phillips Curve shifted out to the right.
         Over this longer period of time, the Phillips curve appears to have shifted out. There is no tradeoff any more.

      The Instability of the Phillips Curve

       During the 1960s, economists viewed the Phillips curve as a policy menu. A nation could choose low inflation
       and high unemployment, or high inflation and low unemployment, or anywhere in between. Economies could
       use fiscal and monetary policy to move up or down the Phillips curve as desired. Then a curious thing
       happened. When policymakers tried to exploit the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, the result

was an increase in both inflation and unemployment. What had happened? The Phillips curve shifted.
The U.S. economy experienced this pattern in the deep recession from 1973 to 1975, and again in back-to-
back recessions from 1980 to 1982. Many nations around the world saw similar increases in unemployment
and inflation. This pattern became known as stagflation. (Recall from The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate
Supply Model that stagflation is an unhealthy combination of high unemployment and high inflation.) Perhaps
most important, stagflation was a phenomenon that traditional Keynesian economics could not explain.
Economists have concluded that two factors cause the Phillips curve to shift. The first is supply shocks, like the
mid-1970s oil crisis, which first brought stagflation into our vocabulary. The second is changes in people's
expectations about inflation. In other words, there may be a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment
when people expect no inflation, but when they realize inflation is occurring, the tradeoff disappears. Both
factors (supply shocks and changes in inflationary expectations) cause the aggregate supply curve, and thus
the Phillips curve, to shift.
In short, we should interpret a downward-sloping Phillips curve as valid for short-run periods of several years,
but over longer periods, when aggregate supply shifts, the downward-sloping Phillips curve can shift so that
unemployment and inflation are both higher (as in the 1970s and early 1980s) or both lower (as in the early
1990s or first decade of the 2000s).

Keynesian Policy for Fighting Unemployment and Inflation

Keynesian macroeconomics argues that the solution to a recession is expansionary fiscal policy, such as tax
cuts to stimulate consumption and investment, or direct increases in government spending that would shift
the aggregate demand curve to the right. For example, if aggregate demand was originally at ADr in Figure
25.11, so that the economy was in recession, the appropriate policy would be for government to shift aggregate
demand to the right from ADr to ADf, where the economy would be at potential GDP and full employment.
Keynes noted that while it would be nice if the government could spend additional money on housing, roads,
and other amenities, he also argued that if the government could not agree on how to spend money in practical
ways, then it could spend in impractical ways. For example, Keynes suggested building monuments, like a
modern equivalent of the Egyptian pyramids. He proposed that the government could bury money
underground, and let mining companies start digging up the money again. These suggestions were slightly
tongue-in-cheek, but their purpose was to emphasize that a Great Depression is no time to quibble over the
specifics of government spending programs and tax cuts when the goal should be to pump up aggregate
demand by enough to lift the economy to potential GDP.

FIGURE 25.11 Fighting Recession and Inflation with Keynesian Policy If an economy is in recession, with an
626 25 · The Keynesian Perspective

       equilibrium at Er, then the Keynesian response would be to enact a policy to shift aggregate demand to the right
       from ADr toward ADf. If an economy is experiencing inflationary pressures with an equilibrium at Ei, then the
       Keynesian response would be to enact a policy response to shift aggregate demand to the left, from ADi toward ADf.

       The other side of Keynesian policy occurs when the economy is operating above potential GDP. In this
       situation, unemployment is low, but inflationary rises in the price level are a concern. The Keynesian response
       would be contractionary fiscal policy, using tax increases or government spending cuts to shift AD to the left.
       The result would be downward pressure on the price level, but very little reduction in output or very little rise
       in unemployment. If aggregate demand was originally at ADi in Figure 25.11, so that the economy was
       experiencing inflationary rises in the price level, the appropriate policy would be for government to shift
       aggregate demand to the left, from ADi toward ADf, which reduces the pressure for a higher price level while
       the economy remains at full employment.

       In the Keynesian economic model, too little aggregate demand brings unemployment and too much brings
       inflation. Thus, you can think of Keynesian economics as pursuing a "Goldilocks" level of aggregate demand:
       not too much, not too little, but looking for what is just right.

     25.4 The Keynesian Perspective on Market Forces

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain the Keynesian perspective on market forces
         · Analyze the role of government policy in economic management

       Ever since the birth of Keynesian economics in the 1930s, controversy has simmered over the extent to which
       government should play an active role in managing the economy. In the aftermath of the human devastation
       and misery of the Great Depression, many people--including many economists--became more aware of
       vulnerabilities within the market-oriented economic system. Some supporters of Keynesian economics
       advocated a high degree of government planning in all parts of the economy.

       However, Keynes himself was careful to separate the issue of aggregate demand from the issue of how well
       individual markets worked. He argued that individual markets for goods and services were appropriate and
       useful, but that sometimes that level of aggregate demand was just too low. When 10 million people are willing
       and able to work, but one million of them are unemployed, he argued, individual markets may be doing a
       perfectly good job of allocating the efforts of the nine million workers--the problem is that insufficient
       aggregate demand exists to support jobs for all 10 million. Thus, he believed that, while government should
       ensure that overall level of aggregate demand is sufficient for an economy to reach full employment, this task
       did not imply that the government should attempt to set prices and wages throughout the economy, nor to take
       over and manage large corporations or entire industries directly.

       Even if one accepts the Keynesian economic theory, a number of practical questions remain. In the real world,
       can government economists identify potential GDP accurately? Is a desired increase in aggregate demand
       better accomplished by a tax cut or by an increase in government spending? Given the inevitable delays and
       uncertainties as governments enact policies into law, is it reasonable to expect that the government can
       implement Keynesian economics? Can fixing a recession really be just as simple as pumping up aggregate
       demand? Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy will probe these issues. The Keynesian approach, with its
       focus on aggregate demand and sticky prices, has proved useful in understanding how the economy fluctuates
       in the short run and why recessions and cyclical unemployment occur. In The Neoclassical Perspective, we will
       consider some of the shortcomings of the Keynesian approach and why it is not especially well-suited for long-
       run macroeconomic analysis.

The Pandemic-Induced Recession and the Keynesian Perspective

The pandemic-induced recession of 2020 was unique. Unlike the Great Recession of 2007-2009 discussed in most
of this chapter, it was not started by the burst of a housing bubble. It was started by a virus that caused sickness and
death for millions of people worldwide and required substantial social policy in order to control its spread.

In some ways, the latest recession was influenced by fluctuations in aggregate demand. At its depth in April 2020,
over 20 million people were unemployed, causing a massive decline in consumption and aggregate demand. As
businesses were forced to shutter or move their operations online, many were pessimistic or uncertain about the
future state of the economy, causing investment to decline. The federal government attempted to correct this
aggregate demand shock through small business loans, direct aid to state and local governments, expanded
unemployment insurance, and stimulus checks. As a result of all these measures, the economy was able to bounce
back somewhat over the remainder of 2020. However, even at the start of 2022, millions of people remained out of
work as new variants threatened to upend the economy once again.

The Keynesian perspective would have economic policy continue to focus on aggregate and restoring confidence in
the economy. President Biden's proposals largely reflect these goals, but with millions of workers still out of the
labor market and a virus that is still not contained, it remains to be seen whether those policy prescriptions will be
enough "medicine" to bring the economy back to normalcy.

Key Concepts and Summary

25.1 Aggregate Demand in Keynesian Analysis

Aggregate demand is the sum of four components: consumption, investment, government spending, and net
exports. Consumption will change for a number of reasons, including movements in income, taxes,
expectations about future income, and changes in wealth levels. Investment will change in response to its
expected profitability, which in turn is shaped by expectations about future economic growth, the creation of
new technologies, the price of key inputs, and tax incentives for investment. Investment will also change when
interest rates rise or fall. Political considerations determine government spending and taxes. Exports and
imports change according to relative growth rates and prices between two economies.

25.2 The Building Blocks of Keynesian Analysis

Keynesian economics is based on two main ideas: (1) aggregate demand is more likely than aggregate supply
to be the primary cause of a short-run economic event like a recession; (2) wages and prices can be sticky, and
so, in an economic downturn, unemployment can result. The latter is an example of a macroeconomic
externality. While surpluses cause prices to fall at the micro level, they do not necessarily at the macro level.
Instead the adjustment to a decrease in demand occurs only through decreased quantities. One reason why
prices may be sticky is menu costs, the costs of changing prices. These include internal costs a business faces
in changing prices in terms of labeling, recordkeeping, and accounting, and also the costs of communicating
the price change to (possibly unhappy) customers. Keynesians also believe in the existence of the expenditure
multiplier--the notion that a change in autonomous expenditure causes a more than proportionate change in
GDP.

25.3 The Phillips Curve

A Phillips curve shows the tradeoff between unemployment and inflation in an economy. From a Keynesian
viewpoint, the Phillips curve should slope down so that higher unemployment means lower inflation, and vice
versa. However, a downward-sloping Phillips curve is a short-term relationship that may shift after a few years.

Keynesian macroeconomics argues that the solution to a recession is expansionary fiscal policy, such as tax
cuts to stimulate consumption and investment, or direct increases in government spending that would shift
the aggregate demand curve to the right. The other side of Keynesian policy occurs when the economy is

are a concern. The Keynesian response would be contractionary fiscal policy, using tax increases or

25.4 The Keynesian Perspective on Market Forces

The Keynesian prescription for stabilizing the economy implies government intervention at the
macroeconomic level--increasing aggregate demand when private demand falls and decreasing aggregate
demand when private demand rises. This does not imply that the government should be passing laws or
regulations that set prices and quantities in microeconomic markets.

Navigating Uncharted Waters

The Great Recession ended in June 2009 after 18 months, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research
(NBER). The NBER examines a variety of measures of economic activity to gauge the economy's overall health.
These measures include real income, wholesale and retail sales, employment, and industrial production. In the
years since the official end of this historic economic downturn, it has become clear that the Great Recession was
two-pronged, hitting the U.S. economy with the collapse of the housing market and the failure of the financial
system's credit institutions, further contaminating global economies. While the stock market rapidly lost trillions of
dollars of value, consumer spending dried up, and companies began cutting jobs, economic policymakers were
struggling with how to best combat and prevent a national, and even global economic collapse. In the end,
policymakers used a number of controversial monetary and fiscal policies to support the housing market and
domestic industries as well as to stabilize the financial sector. Some of these initiatives included:

         · Federal Reserve Bank purchase of both traditional and nontraditional assets off banks' balance sheets. By doing
             this, the Fed injected money into the banking system and increased the amounts of funds available to lend to
             the business sector and consumers. This also dropped short-term interest rates to as low as zero percent,
             which had the effect of devaluing U.S. dollars in the global market and boosting exports.

         · The Congress and the President also passed several pieces of legislation that would stabilize the financial
             market. The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), passed in late 2008, allowed the government to inject cash
             into troubled banks and other financial institutions and help support General Motors and Chrysler as they faced
             bankruptcy and threatened job losses throughout their supply chain. The American Recovery and Reinvestment
             Act in early 2009 provided tax rebates to low- and middle-income households to encourage consumer
             spending.

       Four years after the end of the Great Recession, the economy had yet to return to its pre-recession levels of
       productivity and growth. Annual productivity increased only 1.9% between 2009 and 2012 compared to its 2.7%
       annual growth rate between 2000 and 2007, unemployment remained above the natural rate, and real GDP
       continued to lag behind potential growth. The actions the government took to stabilize the economy were under
       scrutiny and debate about their effectiveness continues. In this chapter, we will discuss the neoclassical perspective
       on economics and compare it to the Keynesian perspective, using both the Great Recession and the more recent
       pandemic-induced recession as examples.

       In Chicago, Illinois, the highest recorded temperature was 105° in July 1995, while the lowest recorded
       temperature was 27° below zero in January 1958. Understanding why these extreme weather patterns
       occurred would be interesting. However, if you wanted to understand the typical weather pattern in Chicago,
       instead of focusing on one-time extremes, you would need to look at the entire pattern of data over time.

       A similar lesson applies to the study of macroeconomics. It is interesting to study extreme situations, like the
       1930s Great Depression, the 2008-2009 Great Recession, or the pandemic-induced recession of 2020. If you
       want to understand the whole picture, however, you need to look at the long term. Consider the unemployment
       rate. The unemployment rate has fluctuated from as low as 3.5% in 1969 to as high as 9.7% in 1982 and 8.1%
       in 2020. Even as the U.S. unemployment rate rose during recessions and declined during expansions, it kept
       returning to the general neighborhood of 5.0%. When the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office carried out
       its long-range economic forecasts in 2010, it assumed that from 2015 to 2020, after the recession has passed,
       the unemployment rate would be 5.0%. In February 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic, the unemployment
       rate reached a historic low of 3.5% and is back to below 5% as of early 2022. From a long-run perspective, the
       economy seems to keep adjusting back to this rate of unemployment.

       As the name "neoclassical" implies, this perspective of how the macroeconomy works is a "new" view of the
       "old" classical model of the economy. The classical view, the predominant economic philosophy until the Great
       Depression, was that short-term fluctuations in economic activity would rather quickly, with flexible prices,
       adjust back to full employment. This view of the economy implied a vertical aggregate supply curve at full
       employment GDP, and prescribed a "hands off" policy approach. For example, if the economy were to slip into
       recession (a leftward shift of the aggregate demand curve), it would temporarily exhibit a surplus of goods.
       Falling prices would eliminate this surplus, and the economy would return to full employment level of GDP. No
       active fiscal or monetary policy was needed. In fact, the classical view was that expansionary fiscal or
       monetary policy would only cause inflation, rather than increase GDP. The deep and lasting impact of the Great
       Depression changed this thinking and Keynesian economics, which prescribed active fiscal policy to alleviate
       weak aggregate demand, became the more mainstream perspective.

26.1 The Building Blocks of Neoclassical Analysis

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Explain the importance of potential GDP in the long run
  · Analyze the role of flexible prices
  · Interpret a neoclassical model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply
  · Evaluate different ways for measuring the speed of macroeconomic adjustment

The neoclassical perspective on macroeconomics holds that, in the long run, the economy will fluctuate
around its potential GDP and its natural rate of unemployment. This chapter begins with two building blocks of
neoclassical economics: (1) potential GDP determines the economy's size and (2) wages and prices will adjust
in a flexible manner so that the economy will adjust back to its potential GDP level of output. The key policy
implication is this: The government should focus more on long-term growth and on controlling inflation than
on worrying about recession or cyclical unemployment. This focus on long-run growth rather than the short-
run fluctuations in the business cycle means that neoclassical economics is more useful for long-run
macroeconomic analysis and Keynesian economics is more useful for analyzing the macroeconomic short
run. Let's consider the two neoclassical building blocks in turn, and how we can embody them in the aggregate
demand/aggregate supply model.

The Importance of Potential GDP in the Long Run

Over the long run, the level of potential GDP determines the size of real GDP. When economists refer to
"potential GDP" they are referring to that level of output that an economy can achieve when all resources (land,
labor, capital, and entrepreneurial ability) are fully employed. While the unemployment rate in labor markets
will never be zero, full employment in the labor market refers to zero cyclical unemployment. There will still be
some level of unemployment due to frictional or structural unemployment, but when the economy is operating
with zero cyclical unemployment, economists say that the economy is at the natural rate of unemployment or
at full employment.

Economists benchmark actual or real GDP against the potential GDP to determine how well the economy is
performing. As explained in Economic Growth, we can explain GDP growth by increases in investment in
physical capital and human capital per person as well as advances in technology. Physical capital per person
refers to the amount and kind of machinery and equipment available to help people get work done. Compare,
for example, your productivity in typing a term paper on a typewriter to working on your laptop with word
processing software. Clearly, you will be able to be more productive using word processing software. The
technology and level of capital of your laptop and software has increased your productivity. More broadly, the
development of GPS technology and Universal Product Codes (those barcodes on every product we buy) has
made it much easier for firms to track shipments, tabulate inventories, and sell and distribute products. These
two technological innovations, and many others, have increased a nation's ability to produce goods and
services for a given population. Likewise, increasing human capital involves increasing levels of knowledge,
education, and skill sets per person through vocational or higher education. Physical and human capital
improvements with technological advances will increase overall productivity and, thus, GDP.

To see how these improvements have increased productivity and output at the national level, we should
examine evidence from the United States. The United States experienced significant growth in the twentieth
century due to phenomenal changes in infrastructure, equipment, and technological improvements in
physical capital and human capital. The population more than tripled in the twentieth century, from 76 million
in 1900 to over 300 million in 2016. The human capital of modern workers is far higher today because the
education and skills of workers have risen dramatically. In 1900, only about one-eighth of the U.S. population
had completed high school and just one person in 40 had completed a four-year college degree. By 2010, about
8.5% of Americans age 25 or older had a high school degree and about 28% had a four-year college degree as
well. In 2019, 33% of Americans age 25 or older had a four-year college degree. The average amount of
634 26 · The Neoclassical Perspective

       physical capital per worker has grown dramatically. The technology available to modern workers is
       extraordinarily better than a century ago: cars, airplanes, electrical machinery, smartphones, computers,
       chemical and biological advances, materials science, health care--the list of technological advances could run
       on and on. More workers, higher skill levels, larger amounts of physical capital per worker, and amazingly
       better technology, and potential GDP for the U.S. economy has clearly increased a great deal since 1900.
       This growth has fallen below its potential GDP and, at times, has exceeded its potential. For example from
       2008 to 2009, the U.S. economy tumbled into recession and remained below its potential until 2018. After the
       pandemic-induced recession of March and April 2020, the economy again fell below potential GDP and
       remains there as of early 2022. At other times, like in the late 1990s or from 2018 to 2020, the economy ran at
       potential GDP--or even slightly ahead. Figure 26.2 shows the actual data for the increase in real GDP since
       1960. The slightly smoother line shows the potential GDP since 1960 as estimated by the nonpartisan
       Congressional Budget Office. Most economic recessions and upswings are times when the economy is 1-3%
       below or above potential GDP in a given year. Clearly, short-run fluctuations around potential GDP do exist, but
       over the long run, the upward trend of potential GDP determines the size of the economy.

       FIGURE 26.2 Potential and Actual GDP (in 2012 Dollars), 1958-2020 Actual GDP falls below potential GDP during
       and after recessions, like the recessions of 1980 and 1981-82, 1990-91, 2001, and 2008-2009 and continues
       below potential GDP until 2019, when it goes slightly above potential. In other cases, actual GDP can be above
       potential GDP for a time, as in the late 1990s.
       In the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model, we show potential GDP as a vertical line. Neoclassical
       economists who focus on potential GDP as the primary determinant of real GDP argue that the long-run
       aggregate supply curve is located at potential GDP--that is, we draw the long-run aggregate supply curve as a
       vertical line at the level of potential GDP, as Figure 26.3 shows. A vertical LRAS curve means that the level of
       aggregate supply (or potential GDP) will determine the economy's real GDP, regardless of the level of aggregate
       demand. Over time, increases in the quantity and quality of physical capital, increases in human capital, and
       technological advancements shift potential GDP and the vertical LRAS curve gradually to the right. Economists
       often describe this gradual increase in an economy's potential GDP as a nation's long-term economic growth.

FIGURE 26.3 A Vertical AS Curve In the neoclassical model, we draw the aggregate supply curve as a vertical line
at the level of potential GDP. If AS is vertical, then it determines the level of real output, no matter where we draw
the aggregate demand curve. Over time, the LRAS curve shifts to the right as productivity increases and potential
GDP expands.

The Role of Flexible Prices

How does the macroeconomy adjust back to its level of potential GDP in the long run? What if aggregate
demand increases or decreases? Economists base the neoclassical view of how the macroeconomy adjusts on
the insight that even if wages and prices are "sticky", or slow to change, in the short run, they are flexible over
time. To understand this better, let's follow the connections from the short-run to the long-run macroeconomic
equilibrium.
The aggregate demand and aggregate supply diagram in Figure 26.4 shows two aggregate supply curves. We
draw the original upward sloping aggregate supply curve (SRAS0) is a short-run or Keynesian AS curve. The
vertical aggregate supply curve (LRASn) is the long-run or neoclassical AS curve, which is located at potential
GDP. The original aggregate demand curve, labeled AD0, so that the original equilibrium occurs at point E0, at
which point the economy is producing at its potential GDP.

FIGURE 26.4 The Rebound to Potential GDP after AD Increases The original equilibrium (E0), at an output level of
500 and a price level of 120, happens at the intersection of the aggregate demand curve (AD0) and the short-run
aggregate supply curve (SRAS0). The output at E0 is equal to potential GDP. Aggregate demand shifts right from AD0
to AD1. The new equilibrium is E1, with a higher output level of 550 and an increase in the price level to 125. With
636 26 · The Neoclassical Perspective

       unemployment rates unsustainably low, eager employers bid up wages, which shifts short-run aggregate supply to
       the left, from SRAS0 to SRAS1. The new equilibrium (E2) is at the same original level of output, 500, but at a higher
       price level of 130. Thus, the long-run aggregate supply curve (LRASn), which is vertical at the level of potential GDP,
       determines the level of real GDP in this economy in the long run.
       Now, imagine that some economic event boosts aggregate demand: perhaps a surge of export sales or a rise in
       business confidence that leads to more investment, perhaps a policy decision like higher government
       spending, or perhaps a tax cut that leads to additional aggregate demand. The short-run Keynesian analysis is
       that the rise in aggregate demand will shift the aggregate demand curve out to the right, from AD0 to AD1,
       leading to a new equilibrium at point E1 with higher output, lower unemployment, and pressure for an
       inflationary rise in the price level.
       In the long-run neoclassical analysis, however, the chain of economic events is just beginning. As economic
       output rises above potential GDP, the level of unemployment falls. The economy is now above full employment
       and there is a labor shortage. Eager employers are trying to bid workers away from other companies and to
       encourage their current workers to exert more effort and to work longer hours. This high demand for labor will
       drive up wages. Most employers review their workers salaries only once or twice a year, and so it will take time
       before the higher wages filter through the economy. As wages do rise, it will mean a leftward shift in the short-
       run Keynesian aggregate supply curve back to SRAS1, because the price of a major input to production has
       increased. The economy moves to a new equilibrium (E2). The new equilibrium has the same level of real GDP
       as did the original equilibrium (E0), but there has been an inflationary increase in the price level.
       This description of the short-run shift from E0 to E1 and the long-run shift from E1 to E2 is a step-by-step way
       of making a simple point: the economy cannot sustain production above its potential GDP in the long run. An
       economy may produce above its level of potential GDP in the short run, under pressure from a surge in
       aggregate demand. Over the long run, however, that surge in aggregate demand ends up as an increase in the
       price level, not as a rise in output.
       The rebound of the economy back to potential GDP also works in response to a shift to the left in aggregate
       demand. Figure 26.5 again starts with two aggregate supply curves, with SRAS0 showing the original upward
       sloping short-run Keynesian AS curve and LRASn showing the vertical long-run neoclassical aggregate supply
       curve. A decrease in aggregate demand--for example, because of a decline in consumer confidence that leads
       to less consumption and more saving--causes the original aggregate demand curve AD0 to shift back to AD1.
       The shift from the original equilibrium (E0) to the new equilibrium (E1) results in a decline in output. The
       economy is now below full employment and there is a surplus of labor. As output falls below potential GDP,
       unemployment rises. While a lower price level (i.e., deflation) is rare in the United States, it does happen
       occasionally during very weak periods of economic activity. For practical purposes, we might consider a lower
       price level in the AD-AS model as indicative of disinflation, which is a decline in the inflation rate. Thus, the
       long-run aggregate supply curve LRASn, which is vertical at the level of potential GDP, ultimately determines
       this economy's real GDP.

FIGURE 26.5 A Rebound Back to Potential GDP from a Shift to the Left in Aggregate Demand The original
equilibrium (E0), at an output level of 500 and a price level of 120, happens at the intersection of the aggregate
demand curve (AD0) and the short-run aggregate supply curve (SRAS0). The output at E0 is equal to potential GDP.
Aggregate demand shifts left, from AD0 to AD1. The new equilibrium is at E1, with a lower output level of 450 and
downward pressure on the price level of 115. With high unemployment rates, wages are held down. Lower wages
are an economy-wide decrease in the price of a key input, which shifts short-run aggregate supply to the right, from
SRAS0 to SRAS1. The new equilibrium (E2) is at the same original level of output, 500, but at a lower price level of
110.
Again, from the neoclassical perspective, this short-run scenario is only the beginning of the chain of events.
The higher level of unemployment means more workers looking for jobs. As a result, employers can hold down
on pay increases--or perhaps even replace some of their higher-paid workers with unemployed people willing
to accept a lower wage. As wages stagnate or fall, this decline in the price of a key input means that the short-
run Keynesian aggregate supply curve shifts to the right from its original (SRAS0 to SRAS1). The overall impact
in the long run, as the macroeconomic equilibrium shifts from E0 to E1 to E2, is that the level of output returns
to potential GDP, where it started. There is, however, downward pressure on the price level. Thus, in the
neoclassical view, changes in aggregate demand can have a short-run impact on output and on
unemployment--but only a short-run impact. In the long run, when wages and prices are flexible, potential
GDP and aggregate supply determine real GDP's size.

How Fast Is the Speed of Macroeconomic Adjustment?

How long does it take for wages and prices to adjust, and for the economy to rebound to its potential GDP? This
subject is highly contentious. Keynesian economists argue that if the adjustment from recession to potential
GDP takes a very long time, then neoclassical theory may be more hypothetical than practical. In response to
John Maynard Keynes' immortal words, "In the long run we are all dead," neoclassical economists respond that
even if the adjustment takes as long as, say, ten years the neoclassical perspective remains of central
importance in understanding the economy.
One subset of neoclassical economists holds that wage and price adjustment in the macroeconomy might be
quite rapid. The theory of rational expectations holds that people form the most accurate possible
expectations about the future that they can, using all information available to them. In an economy where most
people have rational expectations, economic adjustments may happen very quickly.
To understand how rational expectations may affect the speed of price adjustments, think about a situation in
the real estate market. Imagine that several events seem likely to push up home values in the neighborhood.
Perhaps a local employer announces that it plans to hire many more people or the city announces that it will
638 26 · The Neoclassical Perspective

       build a local park or a library in that neighborhood. The theory of rational expectations points out that even
       though none of the changes will happen immediately, home prices in the neighborhood will rise immediately,
       because the expectation that homes will be worth more in the future will lead buyers to be willing to pay more
       in the present. The amount of the immediate increase in home prices will depend on how likely it seems that
       the announcements about the future will actually happen and on how distant the local jobs and neighborhood
       improvements are in the future. The key point is that, because of rational expectations, prices do not wait on
       events, but adjust immediately.

       At a macroeconomic level, the theory of rational expectations points out that if the aggregate supply curve is
       vertical over time, then people should rationally expect this pattern. When a shift in aggregate demand occurs,
       people and businesses with rational expectations will know that its impact on output and employment will be
       temporary, while its impact on the price level will be permanent. If firms and workers perceive the outcome of
       the process in advance, and if all firms and workers know that everyone else is perceiving the process in the
       same way, then they have no incentive to go through an extended series of short-run scenarios, like a firm first
       hiring more people when aggregate demand shifts out and then firing those same people when aggregate
       supply shifts back. Instead, everyone will recognize where this process is heading--toward a change in the
       price level--and then will act on that expectation. In this scenario, the expected long-run change in the price
       level may happen very quickly, without a drawn-out zigzag of output and employment first moving one way
       and then the other.

       The theory that people and firms have rational expectations can be a useful simplification, but as a statement
       about how people and businesses actually behave, the assumption seems too strong. After all, many people
       and firms are not especially well informed, either about what is happening in the economy or about how the
       economy works. An alternate assumption is that people and firms act with adaptive expectations: they look at
       past experience and gradually adapt their beliefs and behavior as circumstances change, but are not perfect
       synthesizers of information and accurate predictors of the future in the sense of rational expectations theory.
       If most people and businesses have some form of adaptive expectations, then the adjustment from the short
       run and long run will be traced out in incremental steps that occur over time.

       The empirical evidence on the speed of macroeconomic adjustment of prices and wages is not clear-cut. The
       speed of macroeconomic adjustment probably varies among different countries and time periods. A
       reasonable guess is that the initial short-run effect of a shift in aggregate demand might last two to five years,
       before the adjustments in wages and prices cause the economy to adjust back to potential GDP. Thus, one
       might think of the short run for applying Keynesian analysis as time periods less than two to five years, and the
       long run for applying neoclassical analysis as longer than five years. For practical purposes, this guideline is
       frustratingly imprecise, but when analyzing a complex social mechanism like an economy as it evolves over
       time, some imprecision seems unavoidable.

     26.2 The Policy Implications of the Neoclassical Perspective

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Analyze the impacts of fiscal and monetary policy on aggregate supply and aggregate demand
         · Explain the neoclassical Phillips curve, noting its tradeoff between inflation and unemployment
         · Identify clear distinctions between neoclassical economics and Keynesian economics

       To understand the policy recommendations of the neoclassical economists, it helps to start with the Keynesian
       perspective. Suppose a decrease in aggregate demand causes the economy to go into recession with high
       unemployment. The Keynesian response would be to use government policy to stimulate aggregate demand
       and eliminate the recessionary gap. The neoclassical economists believe that the Keynesian response, while
       perhaps well intentioned, will not have a good outcome for reasons we will discuss shortly. Since the
       neoclassical economists believe that the economy will correct itself over time, the only advantage of a

Keynesian stabilization policy would be to accelerate the process and minimize the time that the unemployed
are out of work. Is that the likely outcome?

Keynesian macroeconomic policy requires some optimism about the government's ability to recognize a
situation of too little or too much aggregate demand, and to adjust aggregate demand accordingly with the
right level of changes in taxes or spending, all enacted in a timely fashion. After all, neoclassical economists
argue, it takes government statisticians months to produce even preliminary estimates of GDP so that
politicians know whether a recession is occurring--and those preliminary estimates may be revised
substantially later. Moreover, there is the question of timely action. The political process can take more months
to enact a tax cut or a spending increase. Political or economic considerations may determine the amount of
tax or spending changes. Then the economy will take still more months to put into effect changes in aggregate
demand through spending and production. When economists and policy makers consider all of these time lags
and political realities, active fiscal policy may fail to address the current problem, and could even make the
future economy worse. The average U.S. post-World War II recession has lasted only about a year. By the time
government policy activates, the recession will likely be over. As a consequence, the only result of government
fine-tuning will be to stimulate the economy when it is already recovering (or to contract the economy when it
is already falling). In other words, an active macroeconomic policy is likely to exacerbate the cycles rather than
dampen them. Some neoclassical economists believe a large part of the business cycles we observe are due to
flawed government policy. To learn about this issue further, read the following Clear It Up feature.

         CLEAR IT UP

Why and how do economists measure inflation expectations?

People take expectations about inflation into consideration every time they make a major purchase, such as a house
or a car. As inflation fluctuates, so too does the nominal interest rate on loans to buy these goods. The nominal
interest rate is comprised of the real rate, plus an expected inflation factor. Expected inflation also tells economists
about how the public views the economy's direction. Suppose the public expects inflation to increase. This could be
the result of positive demand shock due to an expanding economy and increasing aggregate demand. It could also
be the result of a negative supply shock, perhaps from rising energy prices, and decreasing aggregate supply. In
either case, the public may expect the central bank to engage in contractionary monetary policy to reduce inflation,
and this policy results in higher interest rates. If, however economists expect inflation to decrease, the public may
anticipate a recession. In turn, the public may expect expansionary monetary policy, and lower interest rates, in the
short run. By monitoring expected inflation, economists garner information about the effectiveness of
macroeconomic policies. Additionally, monitoring expected inflation allows for projecting the direction of real
interest rates that isolate for the effect of inflation. This information is necessary for making decisions about
financing investments.

Expectations about inflation may seem like a highly theoretical concept, but, in fact the Federal Reserve Bank
measures, inflation expectations based upon early research conducted by Joseph Livingston, a financial journalist
for the Philadelphia Inquirer. In 1946, he started a twice-a-year survey of economists about their expectations of
inflation. After Livingston's death in 1969, the Federal Reserve Bank and other economic research agencies such as
the Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan, the American Statistical Association, and the National
Bureau of Economic Research continued the survey.

Current Federal Reserve research compares these expectations to actual inflation that has occurred, and the
results, so far, are mixed. Economists' forecasts, however, have become notably more accurate in the last few
decades. Economists are actively researching how inflation expectations and other economic variables form and
change.

      The Neoclassical Phillips Curve Tradeoff

       The Keynesian Perspective introduced the Phillips curve and explained how it is derived from the aggregate
       supply curve. The short run upward sloping aggregate supply curve implies a downward sloping Phillips
       curve; thus, there is a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment in the short run. By contrast, a
       neoclassical long-run aggregate supply curve will imply a vertical shape for the Phillips curve, indicating no
       long run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment. Figure 26.6 (a) shows the vertical AS curve, with three
       different levels of aggregate demand, resulting in three different equilibria, at three different price levels. At
       every point along that vertical AS curve, potential GDP and the rate of unemployment remains the same.
       Assume that for this economy, the natural rate of unemployment is 5%. As a result, the long-run Phillips curve
       relationship, in Figure 26.6 (b), is a vertical line, rising up from 5% unemployment, at any level of inflation.
       Read the following Work It Out feature for additional information on how to interpret inflation and
       unemployment rates.

       FIGURE 26.6 From a Long-Run AS Curve to a Long-Run Phillips Curve (a) With a vertical LRAS curve, shifts in
       aggregate demand do not alter the level of output but do lead to changes in the price level. Because output is
       unchanged between the equilibria E0, E1, and E2, all unemployment in this economy will be due to the natural rate
       of unemployment. (b) If the natural rate of unemployment is 5%, then the Phillips curve will be vertical. That is,
       regardless of changes in the price level, the unemployment rate remains at 5%.

Tracking Inflation and Unemployment Rates

Suppose that you have collected data for years on inflation and unemployment rates and recorded them in a
table, such as Table 26.1. How do you interpret that information?

Year Inflation Rate Unemployment Rate

1970        2%  4%

1975        3%  3%

1980        2%  4%

1985        1%  6%

1990        1%  4%

1995        4%  2%

2000        5%  4%

TABLE 26.1

Step 1. Plot the data points in a graph with inflation rate on the vertical axis and unemployment rate on the
horizontal axis. Your graph will appear similar to Figure 26.7.

                                                         FIGURE 26.7 Inflation Rates

Step 2. What patterns do you see in the data? You should notice that there are years when unemployment falls
but inflation rises, and other years where unemployment rises and inflation falls.

Step 3. Can you determine the natural rate of unemployment from the data or from the graph? As you analyze the
graph, it appears that the natural rate of unemployment lies at 4%. This is the rate that the economy appears to
adjust back to after an apparent change in the economy. For example, in 1975 the economy appeared to have an
increase in aggregate demand. The unemployment rate fell to 3% but inflation increased from 2% to 3%. By
1980, the economy had adjusted back to 4% unemployment and the inflation rate had returned to 2%. In 1985,
the economy looks to have suffered a recession as unemployment rose to 6% and inflation fell to 1%. This would
be consistent with a decrease in aggregate demand. By 1990, the economy recovered back to 4%
unemployment, but at a lower inflation rate of 1%. In 1995 the economy again rebounded and unemployment
fell to 2%, but inflation increased to 4%, which is consistent with a large increase in aggregate demand. The
642 26 · The Neoclassical Perspective

         economy adjusted back to 4% unemployment but at a higher rate of inflation of 5%. Then in 2000, both
         unemployment and inflation increased to 5% and 4%, respectively.

         Step 4. Do you see the Phillips curve(s) in the data? If we trace the downward sloping trend of data points, we
         could see a short-run Phillips curve that exhibits the inverse tradeoff between higher unemployment and lower
         inflation rates. If we trace the vertical line of data points, we could see a long-run Phillips curve at the 4% natural
         rate of unemployment.

       The unemployment rate on the long-run Phillips curve will be the natural rate of unemployment. A small
       inflationary increase in the price level from AD0 to AD1 will have the same natural rate of unemployment as a
       larger inflationary increase in the price level from AD0 to AD2. The macroeconomic equilibrium along the
       vertical aggregate supply curve can occur at a variety of different price levels, and the natural rate of
       unemployment can be consistent with all different rates of inflation. The great economist Milton Friedman
       (1912-2006) summed up the neoclassical view of the long-term Phillips curve tradeoff in a 1967 speech:
       "[T]here is always a temporary trade-off between inflation and unemployment; there is no permanent trade-
       off."

       In the Keynesian perspective, the primary focus is on getting the level of aggregate demand right in
       relationship to an upward-sloping aggregate supply curve. That is, the government should adjust AD so that
       the economy produces at its potential GDP, not so low that cyclical unemployment results and not so high that
       inflation results. In the neoclassical perspective, aggregate supply will determine output at potential GDP, the
       natural rate of unemployment determines unemployment, and shifts in aggregate demand are the primary
       determinant of changes in the price level.

      Fighting Unemployment or Inflation?

       As we explained in Unemployment, economists divide unemployment into two categories: cyclical
       unemployment and the natural rate of unemployment, which is the sum of frictional and structural
       unemployment. Cyclical unemployment results from fluctuations in the business cycle and is created when
       the economy is producing below potential GDP--giving potential employers less incentive to hire. When the
       economy is producing at potential GDP, cyclical unemployment will be zero. Because of labor market
       dynamics, in which people are always entering or exiting the labor force, the unemployment rate never falls to
       0%, not even when the economy is producing at or even slightly above potential GDP. Probably the best we can
       hope for is for the number of job vacancies to equal the number of job seekers. We know that it takes time for
       job seekers and employers to find each other, and this time is the cause of frictional unemployment. Most
       economists do not consider frictional unemployment to be a "bad" thing. After all, there will always be workers
       who are unemployed while looking for a job that is a better match for their skills. There will always be
       employers that have an open position, while looking for a worker that is a better match for the job. Ideally,
       these matches happen quickly, but even when the economy is very strong there will be some natural
       unemployment and this is what the natural rate of unemployment measures.

       The neoclassical view of unemployment tends to focus attention away from the cyclical unemployment
       problem--that is, unemployment caused by recession--while putting more attention on the unemployment
       rate issue that prevails even when the economy is operating at potential GDP. To put it another way, the
       neoclassical view of unemployment tends to focus on how the government can adjust public policy to reduce
       the natural rate of unemployment. Such policy changes might involve redesigning unemployment and welfare
       programs so that they support those in need, but also offer greater encouragement for job-hunting. It might

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                     26.2 · The Policy Implications of the Neoclassical Perspective 643

involve redesigning business rules with an eye to whether they are unintentionally discouraging businesses
from taking on new employees. It might involve building institutions to improve the flow of information about
jobs and the mobility of workers, to help bring workers and employers together more quickly. For those
workers who find that their skills are permanently no longer in demand (for example, the structurally
unemployed), economists can design policy to provide opportunities for retraining so that these workers can
reenter the labor force and seek employment.
Neoclassical economists will not tend to see aggregate demand as a useful tool for reducing unemployment;
after all, with a vertical aggregate supply curve determining economic output, then aggregate demand has no
long-run effect on unemployment. Instead, neoclassical economists believe that aggregate demand should be
allowed to expand only to match the gradual shifts of aggregate supply to the right--keeping the price level
much the same and inflationary pressures low.
If aggregate demand rises rapidly in the neoclassical model, in the long run it leads only to inflationary
pressures. Figure 26.8 shows a vertical LRAS curve and three different levels of aggregate demand, rising from
AD0 to AD1 to AD2. As the macroeconomic equilibrium rises from E0 to E1 to E2, the price level rises, but real
GDP does not budge; nor does the rate of unemployment, which adjusts to its natural rate. Conversely,
reducing inflation has no long-term costs, either. Think about Figure 26.8 in reverse, as the aggregate demand
curve shifts from AD2 to AD1 to AD0, and the equilibrium moves from E2 to E1 to E0. During this process, the
price level falls, but, in the long run, neither real GDP nor the natural unemployment rate changes.

FIGURE 26.8 How Aggregate Demand Determines the Price Level in the Long Run As aggregate demand shifts to
the right, from AD0 to AD1 to AD2, real GDP in this economy and the level of unemployment do not change. However,
there is inflationary pressure for a higher price level as the equilibrium changes from E0 to E1 to E2.

Fighting Recession or Encouraging Long-Term Growth?

Neoclassical economists believe that the economy will rebound out of a recession or eventually contract during
an expansion because prices and wage rates are flexible and will adjust either upward or downward to restore
the economy to its potential GDP. Thus, the key policy question for neoclassicals is how to promote growth of
potential GDP. We know that economic growth ultimately depends on the growth rate of long-term productivity.
644 26 · The Neoclassical Perspective

Productivity measures how effective inputs are at producing outputs. We know that U.S. productivity has
grown on average about 2% per year. That means that the same amount of inputs produce 2% more output
than the year before. We also know that productivity growth varies a great deal in the short term due to cyclical
factors. It also varies somewhat in the long term. From 1953-1972, U.S. labor productivity (as measured by
output per hour in the business sector) grew at 3.2% per year. From 1973-1992, productivity growth declined
significantly to 1.8% per year. Then, from 1993-2010, productivity growth increased to around 2% per year. In
recent years, it has grown less than 2% per year, although it did pick up in 2019 and 2020 to over 2% again.
The neoclassical economists believe the underpinnings of long-run productivity growth to be an economy's
investments in human capital, physical capital, and technology, operating together in a market-oriented
environment that rewards innovation. Government policy should focus on promoting these factors.

Summary of Neoclassical Macroeconomic Policy Recommendations

Let's summarize what neoclassical economists recommend for macroeconomic policy. Neoclassical
economists do not believe in "fine-tuning" the economy. They believe that a stable economic environment with
a low rate of inflation fosters economic growth. Similarly, tax rates should be low and unchanging. In this
environment, private economic agents can make the best possible investment decisions, which will lead to
optimal investment in physical and human capital as well as research and development to promote
improvements in technology.

26.3 Balancing Keynesian and Neoclassical Models

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Evaluate how neoclassical economists and Keynesian economists react to recessions
  · Analyze the interrelationship between the neoclassical and Keynesian economic models

We can compare finding the balance between Keynesian and Neoclassical models to the challenge of riding
two horses simultaneously. When a circus performer stands on two horses, with a foot on each one, much of
the excitement for the viewer lies in contemplating the gap between the two. As modern macroeconomists ride
into the future on two horses--with one foot on the short-term Keynesian perspective and one foot on the long-
term neoclassical perspective--the balancing act may look uncomfortable, but there does not seem to be any
way to avoid it. Each approach, Keynesian and neoclassical, has its strengths and weaknesses.

The short-term Keynesian model, built on the importance of aggregate demand as a cause of business cycles
and a degree of wage and price rigidity, does a sound job of explaining many recessions and why cyclical
unemployment rises and falls. By focusing on the short-run aggregate demand adjustments, Keynesian
economics risks overlooking the long-term causes of economic growth or the natural rate of unemployment
that exist even when the economy is producing at potential GDP.

The neoclassical model, with its emphasis on aggregate supply, focuses on the underlying determinants of
output and employment in markets, and thus tends to put more emphasis on economic growth and how labor
markets work. However, the neoclassical view is not especially helpful in explaining why unemployment
moves up and down over short time horizons of a few years. Nor is the neoclassical model especially helpful
when the economy is mired in an especially deep and long-lasting recession, like the 1930s Great Depression.
Keynesian economics tends to view inflation as a price that might sometimes be paid for lower unemployment;
neoclassical economics tends to view inflation as a cost that offers no offsetting gains in terms of lower
unemployment.

Macroeconomics cannot, however, be summed up as an argument between one group of economists who are
pure Keynesians and another group who are pure neoclassicists. Instead, many mainstream economists
believe both the Keynesian and neoclassical perspectives. Robert Solow, the Nobel laureate in economics in
1987, described the dual approach in this way:

      At short time scales, I think, something sort of `Keynesian' is a good approximation, and surely better
      than anything straight `neoclassical.' At very long time scales, the interesting questions are best
      studied in a neoclassical framework, and attention to the Keynesian side of things would be a minor
      distraction. At the five-to-ten-year time scale, we have to piece things together as best we can, and
      look for a hybrid model that will do the job.

Many modern macroeconomists spend considerable time and energy trying to construct models that blend the
most attractive aspects of the Keynesian and neoclassical approaches. It is possible to construct a somewhat
complex mathematical model where aggregate demand and sticky wages and prices matter in the short run,
but wages, prices, and aggregate supply adjust in the long run. However, creating an overall model that
encompasses both short-term Keynesian and long-term neoclassical models is not easy.

Navigating Uncharted Waters--The Great Recession and Pandemic-Induced Recession of 2020

Were the policies that the government implemented to stabilize the economy and financial markets during the Great
Recession of 2007-2009, and the pandemic-induced recession of 2020 effective? Many economists from both the
Keynesian and neoclassical schools have found that they were, although to varying degrees. Regarding the Great
Recession, Alan Blinder of Princeton University and Mark Zandi for Moody's Analytics found that, without fiscal
646 26 · The Neoclassical Perspective

       policy, GDP decline would have been significantly more than its 3.3% in 2008 followed by its 0.1% decline in 2009.
       They also estimated that there would have been 8.5 million more job losses had the government not intervened in
       the market with the TARP to support the financial industry and key automakers General Motors and Chrysler.
       Federal Reserve Bank economists Carlos Carvalho, Stefano Eusip, and Christian Grisse found in their study, Policy
       Initiatives in the Global Recession: What Did Forecasters Expect? that once the government implemented policies,
       forecasters adapted their expectations to these policies. They were more likely to anticipate increases in investment
       due to lower interest rates brought on by monetary policy and increased economic growth resulting from fiscal
       policy.
       The neoclassical perspective can also shed light on the country's experience with policy during the pandemic-
       induced recession of 2020. It was mentioned earlier that one criticism made by proponents of the neoclassical
       perspective is that government policy is often too slow to react to a recession. However after the pandemic hit, the
       federal government quickly responded with aid to state and local governments, increased unemployment insurance,
       aid to businesses forced to shut down, and stimulus checks to boost spending. There is no doubt that the economic
       fallout from the pandemic would have been much worse without these policies. Some economists even argue that
       the government helped too much and that the high inflation the U.S. economy experienced starting mid-2021 is due
       to the real output growing faster than potential, but it is too early (as of early 2022) to tell if that argument is correct.
       By focusing on potential GDP instead of short-run demand, the neoclassical perspective also makes an important
       point about how the size of the economy determines its ability to grow. Since the pandemic hit, millions of workers
       have stayed out of the labor market due to early retirement, health and safety concerns, the availability of childcare,
       and school closures. As mentioned in Unemployment, these changes have caused labor force participation to
       remain lower than its historical average. The pandemic has also made it harder for future workers to acquire skills
       they need to be productive in the labor market. The longer these dynamics are at play, the more harm it will do to
       potential GDP.

Key Concepts and Summary

26.1 The Building Blocks of Neoclassical Analysis

The neoclassical perspective argues that, in the long run, the economy will adjust back to its potential GDP
level of output through flexible price levels. Thus, the neoclassical perspective views the long-run AS curve as
vertical. A rational expectations perspective argues that people have excellent information about economic
events and how the economy works and that, as a result, price and other economic adjustments will happen
very quickly. In adaptive expectations theory, people have limited information about economic information
and how the economy works, and so price and other economic adjustments can be slow.

26.2 The Policy Implications of the Neoclassical Perspective

Neoclassical economists tend to put relatively more emphasis on long-term growth than on fighting recession,
because they believe that recessions will fade in a few years and long-term growth will ultimately determine
the standard of living. They tend to focus more on reducing the natural rate of unemployment caused by
economic institutions and government policies than the cyclical unemployment caused by recession.

Neoclassical economists also see no social benefit to inflation. With an upward-sloping Keynesian AS curve,
inflation can arise because an economy is approaching full employment. With a vertical long-run neoclassical
AS curve, inflation does not accompany any rise in output. If aggregate supply is vertical, then aggregate
demand does not affect the quantity of output. Instead, aggregate demand can only cause inflationary changes
in the price level. A vertical aggregate supply curve, where the quantity of output is consistent with many
different price levels, also implies a vertical Phillips curve.

26.3 Balancing Keynesian and Neoclassical Models

The Keynesian perspective considers changes to aggregate demand to be the cause of business cycle
fluctuations. Keynesians are likely to advocate that policy makers actively attempt to reverse recessionary and
inflationary periods because they are not convinced that the self-correcting economy can easily return to full
employment.

The neoclassical perspective places more emphasis on aggregate supply. Neoclassical economists believe that
long term productivity growth determines the potential GDP level and that the economy typically will return to
full employment after a change in aggregate demand. Skeptical of the effectiveness and timeliness of
Keynesian policy, neoclassical economists are more likely to advocate a hands-off, or fairly limited, role for
active stabilization policy.

While Keynesians would tend to advocate an acceptable tradeoff between inflation and unemployment when
counteracting a recession, neoclassical economists argue that no such tradeoff exists. Any short-term gains in
lower unemployment will eventually vanish and the result of active policy will only be inflation.

The Many Disguises of Money: From Cowries to Crypto

Here is a trivia question: In the history of the world, what item did people use for money over the broadest
geographic area and for the longest period of time? The answer is not gold, silver, or any precious metal. It is the
cowrie, a mollusk shell found mainly off the Maldives Islands in the Indian Ocean. Cowries served as money as early
as 700 B.C. in China. By the 1500s, they were in widespread use across India and Africa. For several centuries after
that, cowries were the means for exchange in markets including southern Europe, western Africa, India, and China:
everything from buying lunch or a ferry ride to paying for a shipload of silk or rice. Cowries were still acceptable as a
652 27 · Money and Banking

       way of paying taxes in certain African nations in the early twentieth century.

       What made cowries work so well as money? First, they are extremely durable--lasting a century or more. As the late
       economic historian Karl Polyani put it, they can be "poured, sacked, shoveled, hoarded in heaps" while remaining
       "clean, dainty, stainless, polished, and milk-white." Second, parties could use cowries either by counting shells of a
       certain size, or--for large purchases--by measuring the weight or volume of the total shells they would exchange.
       Third, it was impossible to counterfeit a cowrie shell, but dishonest people could counterfeit gold or silver coins by
       making copies with cheaper metals. Finally, in the heyday of cowrie money, from the 1500s into the 1800s,
       governments, first the Portuguese, then the Dutch and English, tightly controlled collecting cowries. As a result, the
       supply of cowries grew quickly enough to serve the needs of commerce, but not so quickly that they were no longer
       scarce. Money throughout the ages has taken many different forms and continues to evolve even today with the
       advent of cryptocurrency. What do you think money is?

       The discussion of money and banking is a central component in studying macroeconomics. At this point, you
       should have firmly in mind the main goals of macroeconomics from Welcome to Economics!: economic
       growth, low unemployment, and low inflation. We have yet to discuss money and its role in helping to achieve
       our macroeconomic goals.

       You should also understand Keynesian and neoclassical frameworks for macroeconomic analysis and how we
       can embody these frameworks in the aggregate demand/aggregate supply (AD/AS) model. With the goals and
       frameworks for macroeconomic analysis in mind, the final step is to discuss the two main categories of
       macroeconomic policy: monetary policy, which focuses on money, banking and interest rates; and fiscal
       policy, which focuses on government spending, taxes, and borrowing. This chapter discusses what economists
       mean by money, and how money is closely interrelated with the banking system. Monetary Policy and Bank
       Regulation furthers this discussion.

     27.1 Defining Money by Its Functions

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain the various functions of money
         · Contrast commodity money and fiat money

       Money for the sake of money is not an end in itself. You cannot eat dollar bills or wear your bank account.
       Ultimately, the usefulness of money rests in exchanging it for goods or services. As the American writer and
       humorist Ambrose Bierce (1842-1914) wrote in 1911, money is a "blessing that is of no advantage to us
       excepting when we part with it." Money is what people regularly use when purchasing or selling goods and
       services, and thus both buyers and sellers must widely accept money. This concept of money is intentionally
       flexible, because money has taken a wide variety of forms in different cultures.

      Barter and the Double Coincidence of Wants

       To understand the usefulness of money, we must consider what the world would be like without money. How
       would people exchange goods and services? Economies without money typically engage in the barter system.
       Barter--literally trading one good or service for another--is highly inefficient for trying to coordinate the
       trades in a modern advanced economy. In an economy without money, an exchange between two people would
       involve a double coincidence of wants, a situation in which two people each want some good or service that
       the other person can provide. For example, if an accountant wants a pair of shoes, this accountant must find
       someone who has a pair of shoes in the correct size and who is willing to exchange the shoes for some hours of
       accounting services. Such a trade is likely to be difficult to arrange. Think about the complexity of such trades
       in a modern economy, with its extensive division of labor that involves thousands upon thousands of different
       jobs and goods.

                                                                                                                                      27.1 · Defining Money by Its Functions 653

Another problem with the barter system is that it does not allow us to easily enter into future contracts for
purchasing many goods and services. For example, if the goods are perishable it may be difficult to exchange
them for other goods in the future. Imagine a farmer wanting to buy a tractor in six months using a fresh crop
of strawberries. Additionally, while the barter system might work adequately in small economies, it will keep
these economies from growing. The time that individuals would otherwise spend producing goods and
services and enjoying leisure time they spend bartering.

Functions for Money

Money solves the problems that the barter system creates. (We will get to its definition soon.) First, money
serves as a medium of exchange, which means that money acts as an intermediary between the buyer and the
seller. Instead of exchanging accounting services for shoes, the accountant now exchanges accounting services
for money. The accountant then uses this money to buy shoes. To serve as a medium of exchange, people must
widely accept money as a method of payment in the markets for goods, labor, and financial capital.

Second, money must serve as a store of value. In a barter system, we saw the example of the shoemaker
trading shoes for accounting services. However, she risks having her shoes go out of style, especially if she
keeps them in a warehouse for future use--their value will decrease with each season. Shoes are not a good
store of value. Holding money is a much easier way of storing value. You know that you do not need to spend it
immediately because it will still hold its value the next day, or the next year. This function of money does not
require that money is a perfect store of value. In an economy with inflation, money loses some buying power
each year, but it remains money.

Third, money serves as a unit of account, which means that it is the ruler by which we measure values. For
example, an accountant may charge $100 to file your tax return. That $100 can purchase two pair of shoes at
$50 a pair. Money acts as a common denominator, an accounting method that simplifies thinking about trade-
offs.

Finally, another function of money is that it must serve as a standard of deferred payment. This means that if
money is usable today to make purchases, it must also be acceptable to make purchases today that the
purchaser will pay in the future. Loans and future agreements are stated in monetary terms and the standard
of deferred payment is what allows us to buy goods and services today and pay in the future. Thus, money
serves all of these functions-- it is a medium of exchange, store of value, unit of account, and standard of
deferred payment.

Commodity versus Fiat Money

Money has taken a wide variety of forms in different cultures. People have used gold, silver, cowrie shells,
cigarettes, and even cocoa beans as money. Although we use these items as commodity money, they also have
a value from use as something other than money. For example, people have used gold throughout the ages as
money although today we do not use it as money but rather value it for its other attributes. Gold is a good
conductor of electricity and the electronics and aerospace industry use it. Other industries use gold too, such
as to manufacture energy efficient reflective glass for skyscrapers and is used in the medical industry as well.
Of course, gold also has value because of its beauty and malleability in creating jewelry.

As commodity money, gold has historically served its purpose as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and
as a unit of account. Commodity-backed currencies are dollar bills or other currencies with values backed up
by gold or other commodities held at a bank. During much of its history, gold and silver backed the money
supply in the United States. Interestingly, antique dollars dated as late as 1957, have "Silver Certificate"
printed over the portrait of George Washington, as Figure 27.2 shows. This meant that the holder could take
the bill to the appropriate bank and exchange it for a dollar's worth of silver.
654 27 · Money and Banking

       FIGURE 27.2 A Silver Certificate and a Modern U.S. Bill Until 1958, silver certificates were commodity-backed
       money--backed by silver, as indicated by the words "Silver Certificate" printed on the bill. Today, The Federal
       Reserve backs U.S. bills, but as fiat money (inconvertible paper money made legal tender by a government decree).
       (Credit: "One Dollar Bills" by "The.Comedian"/Flickr Creative Commons, CC BY 2.0)
       As economies grew and became more global in nature, the use of commodity monies became more
       cumbersome. Countries moved towards the use of fiat money. Fiat money has no intrinsic value, but is
       declared by a government to be a country's legal tender. The United States' paper money, for example, carries
       the statement: "THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER FOR ALL DEBTS, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE." In other words, by
       government decree, if you owe a debt, then legally speaking, you can pay that debt with the U.S. currency, even
       though it is not backed by a commodity. The only backing of our money is universal faith and trust that the
       currency has value, and nothing more.

     27.2 Measuring Money: Currency, M1, and M2

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Contrast M1 money supply and M2 money supply
         · Classify monies as M1 money supply or M2 money supply
       Cash in your pocket certainly serves as money; however, what about checks or credit cards? Are they money,
       too? Rather than trying to state a single way of measuring money, economists offer broader definitions of
       money based on liquidity. Liquidity refers to how quickly you can use a financial asset to buy a good or service.
       For example, cash is very liquid. You can use your $10 bill easily to buy a hamburger at lunchtime. However,
       $10 that you have in your savings account is not so easy to use. You must go to the bank or ATM machine and
       withdraw that cash to buy your lunch. Thus, $10 in your savings account is less liquid.
       The Federal Reserve Bank, which is the central bank of the United States, is a bank regulator and is
       responsible for monetary policy and defines money according to its liquidity. There are two definitions of
       money: M1 and M2 money supply. Historically, M1 money supply included those monies that are very liquid
       such as cash, checkable (demand) deposits, and traveler's checks, while M2 money supply included those
       monies that are less liquid in nature; M2 included M1 plus savings and time deposits, certificates of deposits,
       and money market funds. Beginning in May 2020, the Federal Reserve changed the definition of both M1 and

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                          27.2 · Measuring Money: Currency, M1, and M2 655

M2. The biggest change is that savings moved to be part of M1. M1 money supply now includes cash, checkable
(demand) deposits, and savings. M2 money supply is now measured as M1 plus time deposits, certificates of
deposits, and money market funds.

M1 money supply includes coins and currency in circulation--the coins and bills that circulate in an
economy that the U.S. Treasury does not hold at the Federal Reserve Bank, or in bank vaults. Closely related to
currency are checkable deposits, also known as demand deposits. These are the amounts held in checking
accounts. They are called demand deposits or checkable deposits because the banking institution must give
the deposit holder his money "on demand" when the customer writes a check or uses a debit card. These items
together--currency, and checking accounts in banks--comprise the definition of money known as M1, which
the Federal Reserve System measures daily.

As mentioned, M1 now includes savings deposits in banks, which are bank accounts on which you cannot
write a check directly, but from which you can easily withdraw the money at an automatic teller machine or
bank.

A broader definition of money, M2 includes everything in M1 but also adds other types of deposits. Many banks
and other financial institutions also offer a chance to invest in money market funds, where they pool together
the deposits of many individual investors and invest them in a safe way, such as short-term government bonds.
Another ingredient of M2 are the relatively small (that is, less than about $100,000) certificates of deposit (CDs)
or time deposits, which are accounts that the depositor has committed to leaving in the bank for a certain
period of time, ranging from a few months to a few years, in exchange for a higher interest rate. In short, all
these types of M2 are money that you can withdraw and spend, but which require a greater effort to do so than
the items in M1. Figure 27.3 should help in visualizing the relationship between M1 and M2. Note that M1 is
included in the M2 calculation.
656 27 · Money and Banking

FIGURE 27.3 The Relationship between M1 and M2 Money M1 and M2 money have several definitions, ranging from
narrow to broad. M1 = coins and currency in circulation + checkable (demand) deposit + savings deposits. M2 = M1
+ money market funds + certificates of deposit + other time deposits.

The Federal Reserve System is responsible for tracking the amounts of M1 and M2 and prepares a weekly
release of information about the money supply. To provide an idea of what these amounts sound like,
according to the Federal Reserve Bank's measure of the U.S. money stock, at the end of November 2021, M1 in
the United States was $20.3 trillion, while M2 was $21.4 trillion. Table 27.1 provides a breakdown of the
portion of each type of money that comprised M1 and M2 in November 2021, as provided by the Federal
Reserve Bank.

Components of M1 in the U.S. (November 2021, Seasonally Adjusted) $ billions

Currency                           $2,114.6

The lines separating M1 and M2 can become a little blurry. Sometimes businesses do not treat elements of M1
alike. For example, some businesses will not accept personal checks for large amounts, but will accept
traveler's checks or cash. Changes in banking practices and technology have made the savings accounts in M2
more similar to the checking accounts in M1. For example, some savings accounts will allow depositors to
write checks, use automatic teller machines, and pay bills over the internet, which has made it easier to access
savings accounts. As with many other economic terms and statistics, the important point is to know the
strengths and limitations of the various definitions of money, not to believe that such definitions are as clear-
cut to economists as, say, the definition of nitrogen is to chemists.

Where does "plastic money" like debit cards, credit cards, and smart money fit into this picture? A debit card,
like a check, is an instruction to the user's bank to transfer money directly and immediately from your bank
account to the seller. It is important to note that in our definition of money, it is checkable deposits that are
money, not the paper check or the debit card. Although you can make a purchase with a credit card, the
financial institution does not consider it money but rather a short term loan from the credit card company to
you. When you make a credit card purchase, the credit card company immediately transfers money from its
checking account to the seller, and at the end of the month, the credit card company sends you a bill for what
you have charged that month. Until you pay the credit card bill, you have effectively borrowed money from the
credit card company. With a smart card, you can store a certain value of money on the card and then use the
card to make purchases. Some "smart cards" used for specific purposes, like long-distance phone calls or
making purchases at a campus bookstore and cafeteria, are not really all that smart, because you can only use
them for certain purchases or in certain places.

In short, credit cards, debit cards, and smart cards are different ways to move money when you make a
purchase. However, having more credit cards or debit cards does not change the quantity of money in the
economy, any more than printing more checks increases the amount of money in your checking account.

One key message underlying this discussion of M1 and M2 is that money in a modern economy is not just
paper bills and coins. Instead, money is closely linked to bank accounts. The banking system largely conducts
macroeconomic policies concerning money. The next section explains how banks function and how a nation's
banking system has the power to create money.

     27.3 The Role of Banks

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain how banks act as intermediaries between savers and borrowers
         · Evaluate the relationship between banks, savings and loans, and credit unions
         · Analyze the causes of bankruptcy and recessions
       Somebody once asked the late bank robber named Willie Sutton why he robbed banks. He answered: "That's
       where the money is." While this may have been true at one time, from the perspective of modern economists,
       Sutton is both right and wrong. He is wrong because the overwhelming majority of money in the economy is
       not in the form of currency sitting in vaults or drawers at banks, waiting for a robber to appear. Most money is
       in the form of bank accounts, which exist only as electronic records on computers. From a broader
       perspective, however, the bank robber was more right than he may have known. Banking is intimately
       interconnected with money and consequently, with the broader economy.
       Banks make it far easier for a complex economy to carry out the extraordinary range of transactions that occur
       in goods, labor, and financial capital markets. Imagine for a moment what the economy would be like if
       everybody had to make all payments in cash. When shopping for a large purchase or going on vacation you
       might need to carry hundreds of dollars in a pocket or purse. Even small businesses would need stockpiles of
       cash to pay workers and to purchase supplies. A bank allows people and businesses to store this money in
       either a checking account or savings account, for example, and then withdraw this money as needed through
       the use of a direct withdrawal, writing a check, or using a debit card.
       Banks are a critical intermediary in what we call the payment system, which helps an economy exchange
       goods and services for money or other financial assets. Also, those with extra money that they would like to
       save can store their money in a bank rather than look for an individual who is willing to borrow it from them
       and then repay them at a later date. Those who want to borrow money can go directly to a bank rather than
       trying to find someone to lend them cash. Transaction costs are the costs associated with finding a lender or a
       borrower for this money. Thus, banks lower transactions costs and act as financial intermediaries--they bring
       savers and borrowers together. Along with making transactions much safer and easier, banks also play a key
       role in creating money.

      Banks as Financial Intermediaries

       An "intermediary" is one who stands between two other parties. Banks are a financial intermediary--that is,
       an institution that operates between a saver who deposits money in a bank and a borrower who receives a loan
       from that bank. Financial intermediaries include other institutions in the financial market such as insurance
       companies and pension funds, but we will not include them in this discussion because they are not depository
       institutions, which are institutions that accept money deposits and then use these to make loans. All the
       deposited funds mingle in one big pool, which the financial institution then lends. Figure 27.4 illustrates the
       position of banks as financial intermediaries, with deposits flowing into a bank and loans flowing out. Of
       course, when banks make loans to firms, the banks will try to funnel financial capital to healthy businesses
       that have good prospects for repaying the loans, not to firms that are suffering losses and may be unable to
       repay.

FIGURE 27.4 Banks as Financial Intermediaries Banks act as financial intermediaries because they stand between
savers and borrowers. Savers place deposits with banks, and then receive interest payments and withdraw money.
Borrowers receive loans from banks and repay the loans with interest. In turn, banks return money to savers in the
form of withdrawals, which also include interest payments from banks to savers.

         CLEAR IT UP
How are banks, savings and loans, and credit unions related?

Banks have a couple of close cousins: savings institutions and credit unions. Banks, as we explained, receive
deposits from individuals and businesses and make loans with the money. Savings institutions are also sometimes
called "savings and loans" or "thrifts." They also take loans and make deposits. However, from the 1930s until the
1980s, federal law limited how much interest savings institutions were allowed to pay to depositors. They were also
required to make most of their loans in the form of housing-related loans, either to homebuyers or to real-estate
developers and builders.
A credit union is a nonprofit financial institution that its members own and run. Members of each credit union decide
who is eligible to be a member. Usually, potential members would be everyone in a certain community, or groups of
employees, or members of a certain organization. The credit union accepts deposits from members and focuses on
making loans back to its members. While there are more credit unions than banks and more banks than savings and
loans, the total assets of credit unions are growing.
In 2008, there were 7,085 banks. Due to the bank failures of 2007-2009 and bank mergers, there were 5,571
banks in the United States at the end of the fourth quarter in 2014. By 2020, there were 4,374 commercial banks
and 627 savings institutions. According to the National Credit Union Association, as of September 2021 there were
4,990 credit unions with assets totaling $2.0 trillion. A day of "Transfer Your Money" took place in 2009 out of
general public disgust with big bank bailouts. People were encouraged to transfer their deposits to credit unions.
This has grown into the ongoing Move Your Money Project. Consequently, some now hold assets with a total value as
large as $111 billion.

A Bank's Balance Sheet

A balance sheet is an accounting tool that lists assets and liabilities. An asset is something of value that you
own and you can use to produce something. For example, you can use the cash you own to pay your tuition. If
you own a home, this is also an asset. A liability is a debt or something you owe. Many people borrow money to
buy homes. In this case, a home is the asset, but the mortgage is the liability. The net worth is the asset value
minus how much is owed (the liability). A bank's balance sheet operates in much the same way. A bank's net
worth as bank capital. We also refer to a bank has assets such as cash held in its vaults, monies that the bank
660 27 · Money and Banking

       holds at the Federal Reserve bank (called "reserves"), loans that it makes to customers, and bonds.

       Figure 27.5 illustrates a hypothetical and simplified balance sheet for the Safe and Secure Bank. Because of the
       two-column format of the balance sheet, with the T-shape formed by the vertical line down the middle and the
       horizontal line under "Assets" and "Liabilities," we sometimes call it a T-account.

                                             FIGURE 27.5 A Balance Sheet for the Safe and Secure Bank

       The "T" in a T-account separates the assets of a firm, on the left, from its liabilities, on the right. All firms use
       T-accounts, though most are much more complex. For a bank, the assets are the financial instruments that
       either the bank is holding (its reserves) or those instruments where other parties owe money to the bank--like
       loans made by the bank and U.S. Government Securities, such as U.S. treasury bonds purchased by the bank.
       Liabilities are what the bank owes to others. Specifically, the bank owes any deposits made in the bank to those
       who have made them. The net worth of the bank is the total assets minus total liabilities. Net worth is included
       on the liabilities side to have the T account balance to zero. For a healthy business, net worth will be positive.
       For a bankrupt firm, net worth will be negative. In either case, on a bank's T-account, assets will always equal
       liabilities plus net worth.

       When bank customers deposit money into a checking account, savings account, or a certificate of deposit, the
       bank views these deposits as liabilities. After all, the bank owes these deposits to its customers, when the
       customers wish to withdraw their money. In the example in Figure 27.5, the Safe and Secure Bank holds $10
       million in deposits.

       Loans are the first category of bank assets in Figure 27.5. Say that a family takes out a 30-year mortgage loan to
       purchase a house, which means that the borrower will repay the loan over the next 30 years. This loan is
       clearly an asset from the bank's perspective, because the borrower has a legal obligation to make payments to
       the bank over time. However, in practical terms, how can we measure the value of the mortgage loan that the
       borrower is paying over 30 years in the present? One way of measuring the value of something--whether a loan
       or anything else--is by estimating what another party in the market is willing to pay for it. Many banks issue
       home loans, and charge various handling and processing fees for doing so, but then sell the loans to other
       banks or financial institutions who collect the loan payments. We call the market where financial institutions
       make loans to borrowers the primary loan market, while the market in which financial institutions buy and sell
       these loans is the secondary loan market.

       One key factor that affects what financial institutions are willing to pay for a loan, when they buy it in the
       secondary loan market, is the perceived riskiness of the loan: that is, given the borrower's characteristics, such
       as income level and whether the local economy is performing strongly, what proportion of loans of this type
       will the borrower repay? The greater the risk that a borrower will not repay loan, the less that any financial
       institution will pay to acquire the loan. Another key factor is to compare the interest rate the financial
       institution charged on the original loan with the current interest rate in the economy. If the original loan
       requires the borrower to pay a low interest rate, but current interest rates are relatively high, then a financial
       institution will pay less to acquire the loan. In contrast, if the original loan requires the borrower to pay a high
       interest rate, while current interest rates are relatively low, then a financial institution will pay more to acquire
       the loan. For the Safe and Secure Bank in this example, the total value of its loans if they sold them to other
       financial institutions in the secondary market is $5 million.

       The second category of bank asset is bonds, which are a common mechanism for borrowing, used by the
       federal and local government, and also private companies, and nonprofit organizations. A bank takes some of
       the money it has received in deposits and uses the money to buy bonds--typically bonds issued that the U.S.

government issues. Government bonds are low-risk because the government is virtually certain to pay off the
bond, albeit at a low rate of interest. These bonds are an asset for banks in the same way that loans are an
asset: The bank will receive a stream of payments in the future. In our example, the Safe and Secure Bank
holds bonds worth a total value of $4 million.

The final entry under assets is reserves, which is money that the bank keeps on hand, and that it does not lend
or invest in bonds--and thus does not lead to interest payments. The Federal Reserve requires that banks keep
a certain percentage of depositors' money on "reserve," which means either in their vaults or at the Federal
Reserve Bank. We call this a reserve requirement. (Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation will explain how the
level of these required reserves are one policy tool that governments have to influence bank behavior.) Prior to
the financial crisis of 2008-2009, also known as the Great Recession, banks received no interest on the
reserves they kept with their regional Federal Reserve bank. This represented an opportunity cost--the
foregone interest earned for keeping any excess reserves. Therefore, banks tended to keep only the minimum
amount of required reserves. When banks choose to keep only the minimum amount of required reserves (or
slightly more than that minimum), in other words when banks are at or slightly above their reserve
requirement, we call this limited reserves. When banks choose to keep significantly more than their reserve
requirement, they have a large amount of excess reserves. We call this ample reserves. Additionally, banks
may also want to keep a certain amount of reserves on hand in excess of what is required. The Safe and Secure
Bank is holding $2 million in reserves.

We define net worth of a bank as its total assets minus its total liabilities. For the Safe and Secure Bank in
Figure 27.5, net worth is equal to $1 million; that is, $11 million in assets minus $10 million in liabilities. For a
financially healthy bank, the net worth will be positive. If a bank has negative net worth and depositors tried to
withdraw their money, the bank would not be able to give all depositors their money.

Solman's "Making Sense of Financial News."

How Banks Go Bankrupt

A bank that is bankrupt will have a negative net worth, meaning its assets will be worth less than its liabilities.
How can this happen? Again, looking at the balance sheet helps to explain.

A well-run bank will assume that a small percentage of borrowers will not repay their loans on time, or at all,
and factor these missing payments into its planning. Remember, the calculations of the banks' expenses every
year include a factor for loans that borrowers do not repay, and the value of a bank's loans on its balance sheet
assumes a certain level of riskiness because some customers will not repay loans. Even if a bank expects a
certain number of loan defaults, it will suffer if the number of loan defaults is much greater than expected, as
can happen during a recession. For example, if the Safe and Secure Bank in Figure 27.5 experienced a wave of
unexpected defaults, so that its loans declined in value from $5 million to $3 million, then the assets of the Safe
and Secure Bank would decline so that the bank had negative net worth.

         CLEAR IT UP

What led to the 2008-2009 financial crisis?

Many banks make mortgage loans so that people can buy a home, but then do not keep the loans on their books as
an asset. Instead, the bank sells the loan. These loans are "securitized," which means that they are bundled
together into a financial security that a financial institution sells to investors. Investors in these mortgage-backed
securities receive a rate of return based on the level of payments that people make on all the mortgages that stand
behind the security.
662 27 · Money and Banking

       Securitization offers certain advantages. If a bank makes most of its loans in a local area, then the bank may be
       financially vulnerable if the local economy declines, so that many people are unable to make their payments.
       However, if a bank sells its local loans, and then buys a mortgage-backed security based on home loans in many
       parts of the country, it can avoid exposure to local financial risks. (In the simple example in the text, banks just own
       "bonds." In reality, banks can own a number of financial instruments, as long as these financial investments are safe
       enough to satisfy the government bank regulators.) From the standpoint of a local homebuyer, securitization offers
       the benefit that a local bank does not need to have significant extra funds to make a loan, because the bank is only
       planning to hold that loan for a short time, before selling the loan so that it can pool it into a financial security.

       However, securitization also offers one potentially large disadvantage. If a bank plans to hold a mortgage loan as an
       asset, the bank has an incentive to scrutinize the borrower carefully to ensure that the customer is likely to repay
       the loan. However, a bank that plans to sell the loan may be less careful in making the loan in the first place. The
       bank will be more willing to make what we call "subprime loans," which are loans that have characteristics like low
       or zero down-payment, little scrutiny of whether the borrower has a reliable income, and sometimes low payments
       for the first year or two that will be followed by much higher payments. Economists dubbed some of the subprime
       loans made by financial institutions in the mid-2000s NINJA loans: loans that financial institutions made even
       though the borrower had demonstrated No Income, No Job, or Assets.

       Financial institutions typically sold these subprime loans and turned them into financial securities--but with a twist.
       The idea was that if losses occurred on these mortgage-backed securities, certain investors would agree to take the
       first, say, 5% of such losses. Other investors would agree to take, say, the next 5% of losses. By this approach, still
       other investors would not need to take any losses unless these mortgage-backed financial securities lost 25% or
       30% or more of their total value. These complex securities, along with other economic factors, encouraged a large
       expansion of subprime loans in the mid-2000s.

       The economic stage was now set for a banking crisis. Banks thought they were buying only ultra-safe securities,
       because even though the securities were ultimately backed by risky subprime mortgages, the banks only invested in
       the part of those securities where they were protected from small or moderate levels of losses. However, as housing
       prices fell after 2007, and the deepening recession made it harder for many people to make their mortgage
       payments, many banks found that their mortgage-backed financial assets could be worth much less than they had
       expected--and so the banks were faced with staring bankruptcy. In the 2008-2011 period, 318 banks failed in the
       United States.

       The risk of an unexpectedly high level of loan defaults can be especially difficult for banks because a bank's
       liabilities, namely it customers' deposits. Customers can withdraw funds quickly but many of the bank's assets
       like loans and bonds will only be repaid over years or even decades. This asset-liability time mismatch--the
       ability for customers to withdraw bank's liabilities in the short term while customers repay its assets in the
       long term--can cause severe problems for a bank. For example, imagine a bank that has loaned a substantial
       amount of money at a certain interest rate, but then sees interest rates rise substantially. The bank can find
       itself in a precarious situation. If it does not raise the interest rate it pays to depositors, then deposits will flow
       to other institutions that offer the higher interest rates that are now prevailing. However, if the bank raises the
       interest rates that it pays to depositors, it may end up in a situation where it is paying a higher interest rate to
       depositors than it is collecting from those past loans that it at lower interest rates. Clearly, the bank cannot
       survive in the long term if it is paying out more in interest to depositors than it is receiving from borrowers.

       How can banks protect themselves against an unexpectedly high rate of loan defaults and against the risk of an
       asset-liability time mismatch? One strategy is for a bank to diversify its loans, which means lending to a
       variety of customers. For example, suppose a bank specialized in lending to a niche market--say, making a
       high proportion of its loans to construction companies that build offices in one downtown area. If that one area
       suffers an unexpected economic downturn, the bank will suffer large losses. However, if a bank loans both to
       consumers who are buying homes and cars and also to a wide range of firms in many industries and

geographic areas, the bank is less exposed to risk. When a bank diversifies its loans, those categories of
borrowers who have an unexpectedly large number of defaults will tend to be balanced out, according to
random chance, by other borrowers who have an unexpectedly low number of defaults. Thus, diversification of
loans can help banks to keep a positive net worth. However, if a widespread recession occurs that touches
many industries and geographic areas, diversification will not help.
Along with diversifying their loans, banks have several other strategies to reduce the risk of an unexpectedly
large number of loan defaults. For example, banks can sell some of the loans they make in the secondary loan
market, as we described earlier, and instead hold a greater share of assets in the form of government bonds or
reserves. Nevertheless, in a lengthy recession, most banks will see their net worth decline because customers
will not repay a higher share of loans in tough economic times.

27.4 How Banks Create Money

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Utilize the money multiplier formula to determine how banks create money in an environment of limited
      reserves

  · Analyze and create T-account balance sheets
  · Evaluate the risks and benefits of money and banks
Banks and money are intertwined. It is not just that most money is in the form of bank accounts. If banks
choose to hold only limited reserves, the banking system can literally create money through the process of
making loans. Let's see how.

Money Creation by a Single Bank

Start with a hypothetical bank called Singleton Bank. The bank has $10 million in deposits. The T-account
balance sheet for Singleton Bank, when it holds all of the deposits in its vaults, is in Figure 27.6. At this stage,
Singleton Bank is simply storing money for depositors and is using these deposits to make loans. In this
simplified example, Singleton Bank cannot earn any interest income from these loans and cannot pay its
depositors an interest rate either.

                        FIGURE 27.6 Singleton Bank's Balance Sheet: Receives $10 million in Deposits
The Federal Reserve requires Singleton Bank to keep $1 million on reserve (10% of total deposits). It will loan
out the remaining $9 million. By loaning out the $9 million and charging interest, it will be able to make
interest payments to depositors and earn interest income for Singleton Bank (for now, we will keep it simple
and not put interest income on the balance sheet). Instead of becoming just a storage place for deposits,
Singleton Bank can become a financial intermediary between savers and borrowers.
This change in business plan alters Singleton Bank's balance sheet, as Figure 27.7 shows. Singleton's assets
have changed. It now has $1 million in reserves and a loan to Hank's Auto Supply of $9 million. The bank still
has $10 million in deposits.

                      FIGURE 27.7 Singleton Bank's Balance Sheet: 10% Reserves, One Round of Loans
Singleton Bank lends $9 million to Hank's Auto Supply. The bank records this loan by making an entry on the
664 27 · Money and Banking

       balance sheet to indicate that it has made a loan. This loan is an asset, because it will generate interest income
       for the bank. Of course, the loan officer will not allow let Hank to walk out of the bank with $9 million in cash.
       The bank issues Hank's Auto Supply a cashier's check for the $9 million. Hank deposits the loan in his regular
       checking account with First National. The deposits at First National rise by $9 million and its reserves also rise
       by $9 million, as Figure 27.8 shows. First National must hold 10% of additional deposits as required reserves
       but is free to loan out the rest

                                                         FIGURE 27.8 First National Balance Sheet
       Making loans that are deposited into a demand deposit account increases the M1 money supply. Remember
       the definition of M1 includes checkable (demand) deposits, which one can easily use as a medium of exchange
       to buy goods and services. Notice that the money supply is now $19 million: $10 million in deposits in
       Singleton bank and $9 million in deposits at First National. Obviously as Hank's Auto Supply writes checks to
       pay its bills the deposits will draw down. However, the bigger picture is that a bank must hold enough money in
       reserves to meet its liabilities. The rest the bank loans out. In this example so far, bank lending has expanded
       the money supply by $9 million.
       Now, First National must hold only 10% as required reserves ($900,000) but can lend out the other 90% ($8.1
       million) in a loan to Jack's Chevy Dealership as Figure 27.9 shows.

                                                         FIGURE 27.9 First National Balance Sheet
       If Jack's deposits the loan in its checking account at Second National, the money supply just increased by an
       additional $8.1 million, as Figure 27.10 shows.

                                                 FIGURE 27.10 Second National Bank's Balance Sheet
       How is this money creation possible? It is possible because there are multiple banks in the financial system,
       they are required to hold only a fraction of their deposits, and loans end up deposited in other banks, which
       increases deposits and, in essence, the money supply.

      The Money Multiplier and a Multi-Bank System

       In a system with multiple banks that are holding only limited reserves, Singleton Bank deposited the initial
       excess reserve amount that it decided to lend to Hank's Auto Supply into First National Bank, which is free to
       loan out $8.1 million. If all banks loan out their excess reserves, the money supply will expand. In a multi-bank
       system, institutions determine the amount of money that the system can create by using the money multiplier.
       This tells us by how many times a loan will be "multiplied" as it is spent in the economy and then re-deposited
       in other banks.
       Fortunately, a formula exists for calculating the total of these many rounds of lending in a banking system. The

                              27.4 · How Banks Create Money 665

money multiplier formula is:

We then multiply the money multiplier by the change in excess reserves to determine the total amount of M1
money supply created in the banking system. See the Work it Out feature to walk through the multiplier
calculation.

                                                                                                          WORK IT OUT

 Using the Money Multiplier Formula

  Using the money multiplier for the example in this text:
  Step 1. In the case of Singleton Bank, for whom the reserve requirement is 10% (or 0.10), the money multiplier is
  1 divided by .10, which is equal to 10.
  Step 2. We have identified that the excess reserves are $9 million, so, using the formula we can determine the
  total change in the M1 money supply:

  Step 3. Thus, we can say that, in this example, the total quantity of money generated in this economy after all
  rounds of lending are completed will be $90 million.

Cautions about the Money Multiplier

The money multiplier will depend on the proportion of reserves that the Federal Reserve Band requires banks
to hold. Additionally, a bank can also choose to hold extra reserves. Banks may decide to vary how much they
hold in reserves for two reasons: macroeconomic conditions and government rules. When an economy is in
recession, banks are likely to hold a higher proportion of reserves because they fear that customers are less
likely to repay loans when the economy is slow. The Federal Reserve may also raise or lower the required
reserves held by banks as a policy move to affect the quantity of money in an economy, as Monetary Policy and
Bank Regulation will discuss.

The process of how banks create money shows how the quantity of money in an economy is closely linked to
the quantity of lending or credit in the economy. All the money in the economy, except for the original reserves,
is a result of bank loans that institutions repeatedly re-deposit and loan.

Finally, the money multiplier depends on people re-depositing the money that they receive in the banking
system. If people instead store their cash in safe-deposit boxes or in shoeboxes hidden in their closets, then
banks cannot recirculate the money in the form of loans. Central banks have an incentive to assure that bank
deposits are safe because if people worry that they may lose their bank deposits, they may start holding more
money in cash, instead of depositing it in banks, and the quantity of loans in an economy will decline. Low-
income countries have what economists sometimes refer to as "mattress savings," or money that people are
hiding in their homes because they do not trust banks. When mattress savings in an economy are substantial,
banks cannot lend out those funds and the money multiplier cannot operate as effectively. The overall quantity
of money and loans in such an economy will decline.

      Money and Banks--Benefits and Dangers

       Money and banks are marvelous social inventions that help a modern economy to function. Compared with the
       alternative of barter, money makes market exchanges vastly easier in goods, labor, and financial markets.
       Banking makes money still more effective in facilitating exchanges in goods and labor markets. Moreover, the
       process of banks making loans in financial capital markets is intimately tied to the creation of money.
       However, the extraordinary economic gains that are possible through money and banking also suggest some
       possible corresponding dangers. If banks are not working well, it sets off a decline in convenience and safety of
       transactions throughout the economy. If the banks are under financial stress, because of a widespread decline
       in the value of their assets, loans may become far less available, which can deal a crushing blow to sectors of
       the economy that depend on borrowed money like business investment, home construction, and car
       manufacturing. The 2008-2009 Great Recession illustrated this pattern.

      The Many Disguises of Money: From Cowries to Crypto

       The global economy has come a long way since it started using cowrie shells as currency. We have moved away from
       commodity and commodity-backed paper money to fiat currency. As technology and global integration increases,
       the need for paper currency is diminishing, too. Every day, we witness the increased use of debit and credit cards.
       The latest creation and a new form of money is cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is digital currency that is not
       controlled by any single entity, such as a company or country. In this sense, it is not a fiat currency because it is not
       issued by a central bank and is not necessarily supported by governments as legal tender. Instead, transactions and
       ownership are maintained in a decentralized manner, and the value (vis-à-vis, say, the U.S. dollar) is determined
       primarily by market forces--i.e., supply and demand. Governments can affect the value of a cryptocurrency by
       regulating its use within their country's boundaries, but in the end, the price of a cryptocurrency comes down to
       supply and demand. Cryptocurrencies have come a long way since 2009 when Bitcoin was first invented, and the
       recent two to three years has seen an explosion of different cryptocurrencies being used across the globe.
       It is important to note that in order to be considered as money, cryptocurrency still needs to satisfy the three
       requirements: it needs to be valid as a store of value, it needs to be valid as a unit of account, and it must be able to
       be used as a medium of exchange. While the first two of these requirements can be satisfied easily by expressing
       the currency in terms of another, such as the U.S. dollar, and through its secure ownership rules, its use as a medium
       of exchange--to be used to buy and sell goods and services--is more complicated. While cryptocurrencies are used
       in many illicit transactions, it is less common to see them accepted as forms of payment for regular things like
       groceries or your rent.
       Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency, and thus the one most likely to be considered real money since it can be
       used to purchase the most goods and services. Other popular cryptocurrencies as of early 2022 (in terms of trade
       volume) are Ethereum and Binance Coin. Many other cryptocurrencies exist, but their more widespread adoption as
       a medium of exchange is yet to be seen.

Key Concepts and Summary

27.1 Defining Money by Its Functions

Money is what people in a society regularly use when purchasing or selling goods and services. If money were
not available, people would need to barter with each other, meaning that each person would need to identify
others with whom they have a double coincidence of wants--that is, each party has a specific good or service
that the other desires. Money serves several functions: a medium of exchange, a unit of account, a store of
value, and a standard of deferred payment. There are two types of money: commodity money, which is an item
used as money, but which also has value from its use as something other than money; and fiat money, which
has no intrinsic value, but is declared by a government to be the country's legal tender.

27.2 Measuring Money: Currency, M1, and M2

We measure money with several definitions: M1 includes currency and money in checking accounts (demand
deposits). Traveler's checks are also a component of M1, but are declining in use. M2 includes all of M1, plus
savings deposits, time deposits like certificates of deposit, and money market funds.

27.3 The Role of Banks

Banks facilitate using money for transactions in the economy because people and firms can use bank accounts
when selling or buying goods and services, when paying a worker or receiving payment, and when saving
money or receiving a loan. In the financial capital market, banks are financial intermediaries; that is, they
operate between savers who supply financial capital and borrowers who demand loans. A balance sheet
(sometimes called a T-account) is an accounting tool which lists assets in one column and liabilities in another.
The bank's liabilities are its deposits. The bank's assets include its loans, its ownership of bonds, and its
reserves (which it does not loan out). We calculate a bank's net worth by subtracting its liabilities from its
assets. Banks run a risk of negative net worth if the value of their assets declines. The value of assets can
decline because of an unexpectedly high number of defaults on loans, or if interest rates rise and the bank
suffers an asset-liability time mismatch in which the bank is receiving a low interest rate on its long-term
loans but must pay the currently higher market interest rate to attract depositors. Banks can protect
themselves against these risks by choosing to diversify their loans or to hold a greater proportion of their
assets in bonds and reserves. If banks hold only a fraction of their deposits as reserves, then the process of
banks' lending money, re-depositing those loans in banks, and the banks making additional loans will create
money in the economy.

27.4 How Banks Create Money

We define the money multiplier as the quantity of money that the banking system can generate from each $1 of
bank reserves. The formula for calculating the multiplier is 1/reserve ratio, where the reserve ratio is the
fraction of deposits that the bank wishes to hold as reserves. The quantity of money in an economy and the
quantity of credit for loans are inextricably intertwined. When banks choose to hold only limited reserves, the

Introduction to Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation

         BRING IT HOME
The Problem of the Zero Percent Interest Rate Lower Bound

Most economists believe that monetary policy (the manipulation of interest rates and credit conditions by a nation's
central bank) has a powerful influence on a nation's economy. Monetary policy works when the central bank reduces
interest rates and makes credit more available. As a result, business investment and other types of spending
increase, causing GDP and employment to grow.
However, what if the interest rates banks pay are close to zero already? They cannot be made negative, can they?
That would mean that lenders pay borrowers for the privilege of taking their money. Yet, this was the situation the
672 28 · Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation

       U.S. Federal Reserve found itself in both at the end of the 2008-2009 recession and during the COVID-19 recession
       of 2020. The federal funds rate, which is the interest rate for banks that the Federal Reserve targets with its
       monetary policy, was slightly above 5% in 2007. By 2009, it had fallen to 0.16%. It then fell again from over 2% to
       0.05% in March 2020.

       During the Great Recession, the Federal Reserve's situation was further complicated because fiscal policy, the other
       major tool for managing the economy, was constrained by fears that the federal budget deficit and the public debt
       were already too high. What were the Federal Reserve's options? How could the Federal Reserve use monetary
       policy to stimulate the economy? And while fiscal policy was more aggressive in 2020, the economic situation has in
       some cases been more severe and additional financial support was necessary. The solution to the problem of the
       lower bound in both recessions, as we will see in this chapter, was to change the rules of the game.

       Money, loans, and banks are all interconnected. Money is deposited in bank accounts, which is then loaned to
       businesses, individuals, and other banks. When the interlocking system of money, loans, and banks works
       well, economic transactions smoothly occur in goods and labor markets and savers are connected with
       borrowers. If the money and banking system does not operate smoothly, the economy can either fall into
       recession or suffer prolonged inflation.

       The government of every country has public policies that support the system of money, loans, and banking.
       However, these policies do not always work perfectly. This chapter discusses how monetary policy works and
       what may prevent it from working perfectly.

     28.1 The Federal Reserve Banking System and Central Banks

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain the structure and organization of the U.S. Federal Reserve
         · Discuss how central banks impact monetary policy, promote financial stability, and provide banking

             services

       In making decisions about the money supply, a central bank decides whether to raise or lower interest rates
       and, in this way, to influence macroeconomic policy, whose goal is low unemployment and low inflation. The
       central bank is also responsible for regulating all or part of the nation's banking system to protect bank
       depositors and insure the health of the bank's balance sheet.

       We call the organization responsible for conducting monetary policy and ensuring that a nation's financial
       system operates smoothly the central bank. Most nations have central banks or currency boards. Some
       prominent central banks around the world include the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the
       Bank of England. In the United States, we call the central bank the Federal Reserve--often abbreviated as just
       "the Fed." This section explains the U.S. Federal Reserve's organization and identifies the major central bank's
       responsibilities.

      Structure/Organization of the Federal Reserve

       Unlike most central banks, the Federal Reserve is semi-decentralized, mixing government appointees with
       representation from private-sector banks. At the national level, it is run by a Board of Governors, consisting of
       seven members appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the Senate. Appointments
       are for 14-year terms and they are arranged so that one term expires January 31 of every even-numbered year.
       The purpose of the long and staggered terms is to insulate the Board of Governors as much as possible from
       political pressure so that governors can make policy decisions based only on their economic merits.
       Additionally, except when filling an unfinished term, each member only serves one term, further insulating
       decision-making from politics. The Fed's policy decisions do not require congressional approval, and the
       President cannot ask for a Federal Reserve Governor to resign as the President can with cabinet positions.

One member of the Board of Governors is designated as the Chair. For example, from 1987 until early 2006,
the Chair was Alan Greenspan. From 2006 until 2014, Ben Bernanke held the post. From 2014 to 2018, Janet
Yellen was the Chair. The current Chair is Jerome Powell. See the following Clear It Up feature to find out more
about the former and current Chair.

What individual can make a financial market crash or soar just by making a public statement? It is not Bill Gates or
Warren Buffett. It is not even the President of the United States. The answer is the Chair of the Federal Reserve
Board of Governors. In 2018, President Donald Trump appointed Jerome H. Powell to a 4-year term as chair of the
Federal Reserve, replacing Janet Yellen, who served as the first female chair of the Federal Reserve from
2014-2018 and who now serves as the Treasury Secretary in the Biden administration. In November 2021, Powell
was nominated for a second term by President Biden; this appointment was confirmed in early-2022.
Powell played a pivotal role during the COVID-19 recession and its aftermath; in March 2020, under his leadership
the Fed acted quickly to reduce the effective federal funds rate and expand its lending and bond-buying actions,
similar to what Ben Bernanke did during the Great Recession. A centrist at heart, Powell has been criticized for
fueling asset prices, even though in his many speeches and testimony before Congress he has consistently
emphasized low unemployment rates and has been more tolerant of inflation than others on the Federal Reserve
Board. Powell is not an academic economist by training or career--he has a J.D. from Georgetown Law and worked
for many years at investment banks and on corporate boards--but this lack of "ivory tower" influences has helped
guide a practical approach to economic problems, for which he is best known.

The Fed Chair is first among equals on the Board of Governors. While they have only one vote, the Chair
controls the agenda, and is the Fed's public voice, so they have more power and influence than one might
expect.

       The commercial banks in each district elect a Board of Directors for each regional Federal Reserve bank, and
       that board chooses a president for each regional Federal Reserve district. Thus, the Federal Reserve System
       includes both federally and private-sector appointed leaders.

      What Does a Central Bank Do?

       The Federal Reserve, like most central banks, is designed to perform three important functions:
        1. To conduct monetary policy
        2. To promote stability of the financial system
        3. To provide banking services to commercial banks and other depository institutions, and to provide

             banking services to the federal government.
       The first two functions are sufficiently important that we will discuss them in their own modules. The third
       function we will discuss here.
       The Federal Reserve provides many of the same services to banks as banks provide to their customers. For
       example, all commercial banks have an account at the Fed where they deposit reserves. Similarly, banks can
       obtain loans from the Fed through the "discount window" facility, which we will discuss in more detail later.
       The Fed is also responsible for check processing. When you write a check, for example, to buy groceries, the
       grocery store deposits the check in its bank account. Then, the grocery store's bank returns the physical check
       (or an image of that actual check) to your bank, after which it transfers funds from your bank account to the
       grocery store's account. The Fed is responsible for each of these actions.
       On a more mundane level, the Federal Reserve ensures that enough currency and coins are circulating
       through the financial system to meet public demands. For example, each year the Fed increases the amount of
       currency available in banks around the Christmas shopping season and reduces it again in January.
       Finally, the Fed is responsible for assuring that banks are in compliance with a wide variety of consumer
       protection laws. For example, banks are forbidden from discriminating on the basis of age, race, sex, or marital
       status. Banks are also required to disclose publicly information about the loans they make for buying houses
       and how they distribute the loans geographically, as well as by sex and race of the loan applicants.

28.2 Bank Regulation

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Discuss the relationship between bank regulation and monetary policy
  · Explain bank supervision
  · Explain how deposit insurance and lender of last resort are two strategies to protect against bank runs

A safe and stable national financial system is a critical concern of the Federal Reserve. The goal is not only to
protect individuals' savings, but to protect the integrity of the financial system itself. This esoteric task is
usually behind the scenes, but came into view during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, when for a brief period of
time, critical parts of the financial system failed and firms became unable to obtain financing for ordinary
parts of their business. Imagine if suddenly you were unable to access the money in your bank accounts
because your checks were not accepted for payment and your debit cards were declined. This gives an idea of a
failure of the payments/financial system.

Bank regulation is intended to maintain banks' solvency by avoiding excessive risk. Regulation falls into a
number of categories, including reserve requirements, capital requirements, and restrictions on the types of
investments banks may make. In Money and Banking, we learned that banks are required to hold a minimum
percentage of their deposits on hand as reserves. "On hand" is a bit of a misnomer because, while a portion of
bank reserves are held as cash in the bank, the majority are held in the bank's account at the Federal Reserve,
and their purpose is to cover desired withdrawals by depositors. Another part of bank regulation is restrictions
on the types of investments banks are allowed to make. Banks are permitted to make loans to businesses,
individuals, and other banks. They can purchase U.S. Treasury securities but, to protect depositors, they are
not permitted to invest in the stock market or other assets that are perceived as too risky.

Bank capital is the difference between a bank's assets and its liabilities. In other words, it is a bank's net worth.
A bank must have positive net worth; otherwise it is insolvent or bankrupt, meaning it would not have enough
assets to pay back its liabilities. Regulation requires that banks maintain a minimum net worth, usually
expressed as a percent of their assets, to protect their depositors and other creditors.

Policy and Bank Regulation."

Bank Supervision

Several government agencies monitor banks' balance sheets to make sure they have positive net worth and are
not taking too high a level of risk. Within the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency has a national staff of bank examiners who conduct on-site reviews of the 1,500 or so of the
largest national banks. The bank examiners also review any foreign banks that have branches in the United
States. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency also monitors and regulates about 800 savings and loan
institutions.

The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) supervises credit unions, which are nonprofit banks that
their members run and own. There are about 5,000 credit unions in the U.S. economy today, although the
typical credit union is small compared to most banks.

The Federal Reserve also has some responsibility for supervising financial institutions. For example, we call
conglomerate firms that own banks and other businesses "bank holding companies." While other regulators
like the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency supervises the banks, the Federal Reserve supervises the
holding companies.
676 28 · Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation

       When bank supervision (and bank-like institutions such as savings and loans and credit unions) works well,
       most banks will remain financially healthy most of the time. If the bank supervisors find that a bank has low or
       negative net worth, or is making too high a proportion of risky loans, they can require that the bank change its
       behavior--or, in extreme cases, even force the bank to close or be sold to a financially healthy bank.
       Bank supervision can run into both practical and political questions. The practical question is that measuring
       the value of a bank's assets is not always straightforward. As we discussed in Money and Banking, a bank's
       assets are its loans, and the value of these assets depends on estimates about the risk that customers will not
       repay these loans. These issues can become even more complex when a bank makes loans to banks or firms in
       other countries, or arranges financial deals that are much more complex than a basic loan.
       The political question arises because a bank supervisor's decision to require a bank to close or to change its
       financial investments is often controversial, and the bank supervisor often comes under political pressure
       from the bank's owners and the local politicians to keep quiet and back off.
       For example, many observers have pointed out that Japan's banks were in deep financial trouble through most
       of the 1990s; however, nothing substantial had been done about it by the early 2000s. A similar unwillingness
       to confront problems with struggling banks is visible across the rest of the world, in East Asia, Latin America,
       Eastern Europe, Russia, and elsewhere.
       In the United States, the government passed laws in the 1990s requiring that bank supervisors make their
       findings open and public, and that they act as soon as they identify a problem. However, as many U.S. banks
       were staggered by the 2008-2009 recession, critics of the bank regulators asked pointed questions about why
       the regulators had not foreseen the banks' financial shakiness earlier, before such large losses had a chance to
       accumulate.

      Bank Runs

       Back in the nineteenth century and during the first few decades of the twentieth century (around and during
       the Great Depression), putting your money in a bank could be nerve-wracking. Imagine that the net worth of
       your bank became negative, so that the bank's assets were not enough to cover its liabilities. In this situation,
       whoever withdrew their deposits first received all of their money, and those who did not rush to the bank
       quickly enough, lost their money. We call depositors racing to the bank to withdraw their deposits, as Figure
       28.4 shows a bank run. In the movie It's a Wonderful Life, the bank manager, played by Jimmy Stewart, faces a
       mob of worried bank depositors who want to withdraw their money, but manages to allay their fears by
       allowing some of them to withdraw a portion of their deposits--using the money from his own pocket that was
       supposed to pay for his honeymoon.

situation. (Credit: "Depression: "Runs on Banks" by National Archives and Records Administration, Public Domain)

The risk of bank runs created instability in the banking system. Even a rumor that a bank might experience
negative net worth could trigger a bank run and, in a bank run, even healthy banks could be destroyed.
Because a bank loans out most of the money it receives, and because it keeps only limited reserves on hand, a
bank run of any size would quickly drain any of the bank's available cash. When the bank had no cash
remaining, it only intensified the fears of remaining depositors that they could lose their money. Moreover, a
bank run at one bank often triggered a chain reaction of runs on other banks. In the late nineteenth and early
twentieth century, bank runs were typically not the original cause of a recession--but they could make a
recession much worse.

Deposit Insurance

To protect against bank runs, Congress has put two strategies into place: deposit insurance and the lender of
last resort. Deposit insurance is an insurance system that makes sure depositors in a bank do not lose their
money, even if the bank goes bankrupt. About 70 countries around the world, including all of the major
economies, have deposit insurance programs. In the United States, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(FDIC) is responsible for deposit insurance. Banks pay an insurance premium to the FDIC. The insurance
premium is based on the bank's level of deposits, and then adjusted according to the riskiness of a bank's
financial situation. In 2009, for example, a fairly safe bank with a high net worth might have paid 10-20 cents
in insurance premiums for every $100 in bank deposits, while a risky bank with very low net worth might have
paid 50-60 cents for every $100 in bank deposits.

Bank examiners from the FDIC evaluate the banks' balance sheets, looking at the asset and liability values to
determine the risk level. The FDIC provides deposit insurance for about 4,914 banks (as of the third quarter of
2021). Even if a bank fails, the government guarantees that depositors will receive up to $250,000 of their
money in each account, which is enough for almost all individuals, although not sufficient for many
businesses. Since the United States enacted deposit insurance in the 1930s, no one has lost any of their
insured deposits. Bank runs no longer happen at insured banks.

Lender of Last Resort

The problem with bank runs is not that insolvent banks will fail; they are, after all, bankrupt and need to be
shut down. The problem is that bank runs can cause solvent banks to fail and spread to the rest of the financial
system. To prevent this, the Fed stands ready to lend to banks and other financial institutions when they
cannot obtain funds from anywhere else. This is known as the lender of last resort role. For banks, the central
bank acting as a lender of last resort helps to reinforce the effect of deposit insurance and to reassure bank
customers that they will not lose their money.

The lender of last resort task can arise in other financial crises, as well. During the 1987 stock market crash
panic, when U.S. stock values fell by 25% in a single day, the Federal Reserve made a number of short-term
emergency loans so that the financial system could keep functioning. During the 2008-2009 recession, we can
interpret the Fed's "quantitative easing" policies (discussed below) as a willingness to make short-term credit
available as needed in a time when the banking and financial system was under stress.

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

      environment of ample reserves
678 28 · Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation

       The Federal Reserve's most important function is to conduct the nation's monetary policy. Article I, Section 8
       of the U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power "to coin money" and "to regulate the value thereof." As part of
       the 1913 legislation that created the Federal Reserve, Congress delegated these powers to the Fed. Monetary
       policy involves managing interest rates and credit conditions, which influences the level of economic activity,
       as we describe in more detail below.

       We discussed in Money and Banking the difference between when banks keep limited reserves and when
       banks keep ample reserves. In an environment of limited reserves, a central bank has three traditional tools to
       implement monetary policy in the economy:

         · Open market operations
         · Changing reserve requirements
         · Changing the discount rate

       In discussing how these three tools work, it is useful to think of the central bank as a "bank for banks"--that is,
       each private-sector bank has its own account at the central bank. As noted, these monetary policy tools are
       used in an environment of limited reserves. However, since the financial crisis of 2008-2009, also known as
       the Great Recession, banks have kept what we defined earlier as ample reserves. As such, the FOMC no longer
       utilizes the limited reserves tools. But, there is nothing that says banks will not return to keeping limited
       reserves, so understanding how these tools work is still important. We will discuss each of these monetary
       policy tools in the sections below.

      Open Market Operations

       Since the early 1920s, the most common monetary policy tool in the U.S. has been open market operations.
       These take place when the central bank sells or buys U.S. Treasury bonds in order to influence the quantity of
       bank reserves and the level of interest rates. The specific interest rate targeted in open market operations is
       the federal funds rate. The name is a bit of a misnomer since the federal funds rate is the interest rate that
       commercial banks charge making overnight loans to other banks. As such, it is a very short term interest rate,
       but one that reflects credit conditions in financial markets very well.

       The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) makes the decisions regarding these open market operations.
       The FOMC comprises seven members of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors. It also includes five voting
       members who the Board draws, on a rotating basis, from the regional Federal Reserve Banks. The New York
       district president is a permanent FOMC voting member and the Board fills other four spots on a rotating,
       annual basis, from the other 11 districts. The FOMC typically meets every six weeks, but it can meet more
       frequently if necessary. The FOMC tries to act by consensus; however, the Federal Reserve's chairman has
       traditionally played a very powerful role in defining and shaping that consensus. For the Federal Reserve, and
       for most central banks, open market operations have, over the last few decades, been the most commonly used
       tool of monetary policy.

       To understand how open market operations affect the money supply in a limited reserves environment,
       assume that Happy Bank starts with $460 million in assets, divided among reserves, bonds and loans, and
       $400 million in liabilities in the form of deposits, with a net worth of $60 million. When the central bank
       purchases $20 million in bonds from Happy Bank, the bond holdings of Happy Bank fall by $20 million and the
       bank's reserves rise by $20 million. However, Happy Bank only wants to hold $40 million in reserves, so the
       bank decides to loan out the extra $20 million in reserves and its loans rise by $20 million. The central bank's
       open market operation causes Happy Bank to make loans instead of holding its assets in the form of

government bonds, which expands the money supply. As the new loans are deposited in banks throughout the
economy, these banks will, in turn, loan out some of the deposits they receive, triggering the money multiplier
that we discussed in Money and Banking. To see the impact on Happy Bank's balance sheet, refer to the
appendix How Open Market Operations Affect Balance Sheets in a Limited Reserves Environment.

Where did the Federal Reserve get the $20 million that it used to purchase the bonds? A central bank has the
power to create money. In practical terms, the Federal Reserve would write a check to Happy Bank, so that
Happy Bank can have that money credited to its bank account at the Federal Reserve. In truth, the Federal
Reserve created the money to purchase the bonds out of thin air--or with a few clicks on some computer keys.

Open market operations can also reduce the quantity of money and loans in an economy. When Happy Bank
purchases $30 million in bonds, Happy Bank sends $30 million of its reserves to the central bank, but now
holds an additional $30 million in bonds. However, Happy Bank wants to hold $40 million in reserves, as in our
previous example, so it will adjust down the quantity of its loans by $30 million, to bring its reserves back to
the desired level. In practical terms, a bank can easily reduce its quantity of loans. At any given time, a bank is
receiving payments on loans that it made previously and also making new loans. If the bank just slows down or
briefly halts making new loans, and instead adds those funds to its reserves, then its overall quantity of loans
will decrease. A decrease in the quantity of loans also means fewer deposits in other banks, and other banks
reducing their lending as well, as the money multiplier that we discussed in Money and Banking takes effect.
To see the impact on Happy Bank's balance sheet, refer to the appendix How Open Market Operations Affect
Balance Sheets in a Limited Reserves Environment. What about all those bonds? How do they affect the money
supply? Read the following Clear It Up feature for the answer.

         CLEAR IT UP

Does selling or buying bonds increase the money supply?

Is it a sale of bonds by the central bank which increases bank reserves and lowers interest rates or is it a purchase
of bonds by the central bank? The easy way to keep track of this is to treat the central bank as being outside the
banking system. When a central bank buys bonds, money is flowing from the central bank to individual banks in the
economy, increasing the money supply in circulation. When a central bank sells bonds, then money from individual
banks in the economy is flowing into the central bank--reducing the quantity of money in the economy.

The Federal Reserve was founded in the aftermath of the 1907 Financial Panic when many banks failed as a
result of bank runs. As mentioned earlier, since banks make profits by lending out their deposits, no bank,
even those that are not bankrupt, can withstand a bank run. As a result of the Panic, the Federal Reserve was
founded to be the "lender of last resort." In the event of a bank run, sound banks, (banks that were not
bankrupt) could borrow as much cash as they needed from the Fed's discount "window" to quell the bank run.
We call the interest rate banks pay for such loans the discount rate. (They are so named because the bank
makes loans against its outstanding loans "at a discount" of their face value.) Once depositors became
convinced that the bank would be able to honor their withdrawals, they no longer had a reason to make a run
on the bank. In short, the Federal Reserve was originally intended to provide credit passively, but in the years
since its founding, the Fed has taken on a more active role with monetary policy.

Changing the Discount Rate

In the Federal Reserve Act, the phrase "...to afford means of rediscounting commercial paper" is contained in
its long title. This was the main tool for monetary policy when the Fed was initially created. Today, the Federal
Reserve has even more tools at its disposal, including quantitative easing, overnight repurchase agreements,
and interest on excess reserves. This illustrates how monetary policy has evolved and how it continues to do
so.

The second traditional method for conducting monetary policy in a limited reserve environment is to raise or
680 28 · Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation

       lower the discount rate. If the central bank raises the discount rate, then commercial banks will reduce their
       borrowing of reserves from the Fed, and instead call in loans to replace those reserves. Since fewer loans are
       available, the money supply falls and market interest rates rise. If the central bank lowers the discount rate it
       charges to banks, the process works in reverse.

       In recent decades, the Federal Reserve has made relatively few discount loans. Before a bank borrows from the
       Federal Reserve to fill out its required reserves, the bank is expected to first borrow from other available
       sources, like other banks. This is encouraged by the Fed charging a higher discount rate than the federal funds
       rate. Given that most banks borrow little at the discount rate, changing the discount rate up or down has little
       impact on their behavior. More importantly, the Fed has found from experience that open market operations
       are a more precise and powerful means of executing any desired monetary policy.

      Changing Reserve Requirements

       A potential third method of conducting monetary policy in a limited reserves environment is for the central
       bank to raise or lower the reserve requirement, which, as we noted earlier, is the percentage of each bank's
       deposits that it is legally required to hold either as cash in their vault or on deposit with the central bank. If
       banks are required to hold a greater amount in reserves, they have less money available to lend out. If banks
       are allowed to hold a smaller amount in reserves, they will have a greater amount of money available to lend
       out.

       Until very recently, the Federal Reserve required banks to hold reserves equal to 0% of the first $14.5 million
       in deposits, then to hold reserves equal to 3% of the deposits up to $103.6 million, and 10% of any amount
       above $103.6 million. The Fed makes small changes in the reserve requirements almost every year. For
       example, the $103.6 million dividing line is sometimes bumped up or down by a few million dollars. Today,
       these rates are no longer in effect; as of March 2020 (when the pandemic-induced recession hit), the 10% and
       3% requirements were reduced to 0%, effectively eliminating the reserve requirement for all depository
       institutions.

       The Fed rarely uses large changes in reserve requirements to execute monetary policy; the pandemic was an
       exception for obvious reasons. Also, a sudden demand that all banks increase their reserves would be
       extremely disruptive and difficult for them to comply. While loosening requirements too much might create a
       danger of banks' inability to meet withdrawal demands, the benefits of reducing the reserve requirements in
       March 2020 exceeded the risks.

       In the following section, we will discuss how interest on excess reserves is used as a monetary policy tool.

      Monetary Policy and Ample Reserves

       As we noted previously, banks in the United States have historically had very little reason to keep more than
       their minimum required reserves because their regional Federal Reserve bank did not pay any interest on
       those reserves. This behavior changed dramatically during the 2008-2009 financial crisis.

       During this period of time, 389 banks failed. The banks that survived responded to the financial crisis by
       increasing their reserves well beyond their required minimum. Combined with the measures undertaken by
       the FOMC and the U.S. government to respond to the financial crisis, banks' reserves increased from around
       $15 billion in 2007, to $2.7 trillion by late 2014. While reserves did decrease to around $1.7 trillion by 2017,
       this was no longer an environment of limited reserves, but an environment of ample reserves. In fact, in 2019,
       the FOMC issued a statement indicating that monetary policy would be based on ample reserves. While it may
       be a good decision for banks to keep ample reserves, as we know, the banking system facilitates both short-
       term and long-term economic activity when it makes loans to finance consumption, for business investment
       and expansion, and to help fund and support innovation, among many other possibilities. In a sense, loans
       allow for the economy to ultimately become more productive, causing an increase in long-run economic
       growth. The point is that we need the banking system to be willing to make loans and not just keep ample

                                                                                                                  28.3 · How a Central Bank Executes Monetary Policy 681

excess reserves. However, when banks are keeping a trillion or more dollars as excess reserves, these are
funds that they are choosing not to lend out, potentially causing the economy to grow at a slower rate than it
otherwise might.

How then can the FOMC incentivize banks to lend out these excess reserves? This is where the interest rate on
reserve balances (IORB) comes in. The IORB is the interest rate paid to banks for their holdings of excess
reserves. Congress granted the Federal Reserve the ability to pay this interest in 2006. The policy was
originally slated to begin in 2011, but the financial crisis accelerated its start date to 2008. (For a few years
there were two separate rates, the interest rate on required reserves and the interest rate on excess reserves,
but these two were combined into the IORB in 2021.) The FOMC controls the IORB directly. It sets the IORB at
whatever rate it chooses, based on macroeconomic conditions and forecasts.

We can now explore how the IORB may affect banks' decisions to hold more or fewer excess reserves. As we
noted in our discussion of open market operations, the federal funds rate (FFR) is the specific interest rate
targeted by the FOMC. The federal funds market is where banks borrow and lend their excess reserves from
one another over a very short period of time, often described as overnight. It is a market, as we explained in
Demand and Supply, with supply, demand, and a price. In the federal funds market, you can think of the FFR
as the price a bank gets paid for lending (or selling) excess reserves in the federal funds market, and you can
think of the FFR as the price a bank pays for borrowing (or buying) those excess reserves. The FFR is targeted
by the FOMC because as the FFR increases and decreases, most other interest rates eventually increase or
decrease too. In Monetary Policy and Economic Outcomes, we'll show how changes in interest rates affect the
macroeconomy.

To illustrate how changes in the IORB can affect the FFR, assume that the IORB is 2%, which means that a bank
can earn 2% on its excess reserves, free of risk. Because in the federal funds market, the lending period is
often very short-term, sometimes even shorter than one day, those loans are nearly risk-free. As a result, most
banks view the IORB as a very close alternative to the FFR. If the FFR also pays 2% interest, generally, a bank
will be indifferent to where it keeps its excess reserves.

Let's say that macroeconomic conditions convince the FOMC to lower the FFR. To do this, it will lower the IORB.
Let's see why. If the IORB decreases to 1.75%, banks will generally choose to reduce their excess reserves
holdings at their regional Federal Reserve bank and instead lend those excess reserves in the federal funds
market in order to earn the currently higher FFR of 2%. But this increase in the supply of excess reserves in
the federal funds market will act to lower the price in the federal funds market, which is the FFR.

When the FOMC lowers the IORB, it also tends to lower the discount rate at the same time. Some banks could
then engage in arbitrage, which is the simultaneous (or near-simultaneous) purchase and sale of a good to
profit from a difference in the price of that good across markets. In our example, if the discount rate also
decreases from 2% to 1.75%, a bank could borrow excess reserves from the Federal Reserve at the 1.75%
discount rate and then lend those same excess reserves in the federal funds market at 2%, earning $0.0025 on
every $1.00 borrowed. (This may not seem like much, but multiply this by $1 million or $10 million and it adds
up quickly.) But this arbitrage activity also ensures that the FFR will decrease as the FOMC desires because the
increase in the supply of excess reserves will cause the FFR to decrease, and as banks leave the federal funds
market to borrow from the Federal Reserve, the decrease in the demand for excess reserves will cause the FFR
to decrease too.

Alternatively, let's say that macroeconomic conditions convince the FOMC to raise the FFR. If the FOMC
increases the IORB to 2.25%, banks will then choose to keep more excess reserves at their regional Federal
Reserve bank and earn the higher IORB. This decrease in supply in the federal funds market will cause the FFR
to increase as well.

Arbitrage will also ensure that the FFR increases. As the IORB increases, banks will borrow more excess
reserves in the federal funds market and deposit them with their regional Federal Reserve bank in order to
682 28 · Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation

       earn a profit on the difference between the IORB and the FFR. This increase in demand will then cause the FFR
       to increase as well.

      Quantitative Easing

       The most powerful and commonly used of the three traditional tools of monetary policy--open market
       operations--works by expanding or contracting the money supply in a way that influences the interest rate. In
       late 2008, as the U.S. economy struggled with recession, the Federal Reserve had already reduced the interest
       rate to near-zero. With the recession still ongoing, the Fed decided to adopt an innovative and nontraditional
       policy known as quantitative easing (QE). This is the purchase of long-term government and private
       mortgage-backed securities by central banks to make credit available so as to stimulate aggregate demand.

       Quantitative easing differed from traditional monetary policy in several key ways. First, it involved the Fed
       purchasing long term Treasury bonds, rather than short term Treasury bills. In 2008, however, it was
       impossible to stimulate the economy any further by lowering short term rates because they were already as
       low as they could get. (Read the closing Bring it Home feature for more on this.) Therefore, Chairman Bernanke
       sought to lower long-term rates utilizing quantitative easing.

       This leads to a second way QE is different from traditional monetary policy. Instead of purchasing Treasury
       securities, the Fed also began purchasing private mortgage-backed securities, something it had never done
       before. During the financial crisis, which precipitated the recession, mortgage-backed securities were termed
       "toxic assets," because when the housing market collapsed, no one knew what these securities were worth,
       which put the financial institutions which were holding those securities on very shaky ground. By offering to
       purchase mortgage-backed securities, the Fed was both pushing long term interest rates down and also
       removing possibly "toxic assets" from the balance sheets of private financial firms, which would strengthen
       the financial system.

       Quantitative easing (QE) occurred in three episodes:

        1. During QE1, which began in November 2008, the Fed purchased $600 billion in mortgage-backed
             securities from government enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

        2. In November 2010, the Fed began QE2, in which it purchased $600 billion in U.S. Treasury bonds.
        3. QE3, began in September 2012 when the Fed commenced purchasing $40 billion of additional mortgage-

             backed securities per month. This amount was increased in December 2012 to $85 billion per month. The
             Fed stated that, when economic conditions permit, it will begin tapering (or reducing the monthly
             purchases). By October 2014, the Fed had announced the final $15 billion bond purchase, ending
             Quantitative Easing.

       We usually think of the quantitative easing policies that the Federal Reserve adopted (as did other central
       banks around the world) as temporary emergency measures. If these steps are to be temporary, then the
       Federal Reserve will need to stop making these additional loans and sell off the financial securities it has
       accumulated. The concern is that the process of quantitative easing may prove more difficult to reverse than it
       was to enact. The evidence suggests that QE1 was somewhat successful, but that QE2 and QE3 have been less
       so.

       Fast forward to March 2020, when the Fed under the leadership of Jerome Powell promised another round of
       asset purchases which was dubbed by some as "QE4," intended once again to provide liquidity to a distressed
       financial system in the wake of the pandemic. This round was much faster, increasing Fed assets by $2 trillion
       in just a few months. Recently, the Fed has begun to slow down the purchase of these assets once again through
       a taper, and the pace of the tapering is expected to increase through 2022. But as of the end of 2021, total Fed
       assets exceed $8 trillion, compared to $4 trillion in February 2020.

28.4 Monetary Policy and Economic Outcomes

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Contrast expansionary monetary policy and contractionary monetary policy
  · Explain how monetary policy impacts interest rates and aggregate demand
  · Evaluate Federal Reserve decisions over the last forty years
  · Explain the significance of quantitative easing (QE)
A monetary policy that lowers interest rates and stimulates borrowing is an expansionary monetary policy or
loose monetary policy. Conversely, a monetary policy that raises interest rates and reduces borrowing in the
economy is a contractionary monetary policy or tight monetary policy. This module will discuss how
expansionary and contractionary monetary policies affect interest rates and aggregate demand, and how such
policies will affect macroeconomic goals like unemployment and inflation. We will conclude with a look at the
Fed's monetary policy practice in recent decades.

The Effect of Monetary Policy on Interest Rates

Consider the market for loanable bank funds in Figure 28.5. The original equilibrium (E0) occurs at an 8%
interest rate and a quantity of funds loaned and borrowed of $10 billion. An expansionary monetary policy will
shift the supply of loanable funds to the right from the original supply curve (S0) to S1, leading to an
equilibrium (E1) with a lower 6% interest rate and a quantity $14 billion in loaned funds. Conversely, a
contractionary monetary policy will shift the supply of loanable funds to the left from the original supply curve
(S0) to S2, leading to an equilibrium (E2) with a higher 10% interest rate and a quantity of $8 billion in loaned
funds.

FIGURE 28.5 Monetary Policy and Interest Rates The original equilibrium occurs at E0. An expansionary monetary
policy will shift the supply of loanable funds to the right from the original supply curve (S0) to the new supply curve
(S1) and to a new equilibrium of E1, reducing the interest rate from 8% to 6%. A contractionary monetary policy will
shift the supply of loanable funds to the left from the original supply curve (S0) to the new supply (S2), and raise the
interest rate from 8% to 10%.
How does a central bank "raise" interest rates? When describing the central bank's monetary policy actions, it
is common to hear that the central bank "raised interest rates" or "lowered interest rates." We need to be clear
about this: more precisely, through open market operations the central bank changes bank reserves in a way
which affects the supply curve of loanable funds. As a result, Figure 28.5 shows that interest rates change. If
they do not meet the Fed's target, the Fed can supply more or less reserves until interest rates do.
Recall that the specific interest rate the Fed targets is the federal funds rate. The Federal Reserve has, since
684 28 · Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation

       1995, established its target federal funds rate in advance of any open market operations.
       Of course, financial markets display a wide range of interest rates, representing borrowers with different risk
       premiums and loans that they must repay over different periods of time. In general, when the federal funds
       rate drops substantially, other interest rates drop, too, and when the federal funds rate rises, other interest
       rates rise. However, a fall or rise of one percentage point in the federal funds rate--which remember is for
       borrowing overnight--will typically have an effect of less than one percentage point on a 30-year loan to
       purchase a house or a three-year loan to purchase a car. Monetary policy can push the entire spectrum of
       interest rates higher or lower, but the forces of supply and demand in those specific markets for lending and
       borrowing set the specific interest rates.

      The Effect of Monetary Policy on Aggregate Demand

       Monetary policy affects interest rates and the available quantity of loanable funds, which in turn affects several
       components of aggregate demand. Tight or contractionary monetary policy that leads to higher interest rates
       and a reduced quantity of loanable funds will reduce two components of aggregate demand. Business
       investment will decline because it is less attractive for firms to borrow money, and even firms that have money
       will notice that, with higher interest rates, it is relatively more attractive to put those funds in a financial
       investment than to make an investment in physical capital. In addition, higher interest rates will discourage
       consumer borrowing for big-ticket items like houses and cars. Conversely, loose or expansionary monetary
       policy that leads to lower interest rates and a higher quantity of loanable funds will tend to increase business
       investment and consumer borrowing for big-ticket items.
       If the economy is suffering a recession and high unemployment, with output below potential GDP,
       expansionary monetary policy can help the economy return to potential GDP. Figure 28.6 (a) illustrates this
       situation. This example uses a short-run upward-sloping Keynesian aggregate supply curve (SRAS). The
       original equilibrium during a recession of E0 occurs at an output level of 600. An expansionary monetary
       policy will reduce interest rates and stimulate investment and consumption spending, causing the original

equilibrium (E1) at the potential GDP level of output.
Conversely, if an economy is producing at a quantity of output above its potential GDP, a contractionary
monetary policy can reduce the inflationary pressures for a rising price level. In Figure 28.6 (b), the original
equilibrium (E0) occurs at an output of 750, which is above potential GDP. A contractionary monetary policy
will raise interest rates, discourage borrowing for investment and consumption spending, and cause the
original demand curve (AD0) to shift left to AD1, so that the new equilibrium (E1) occurs at the potential GDP
level of 700.
These examples suggest that monetary policy should be countercyclical; that is, it should act to
counterbalance the business cycles of economic downturns and upswings. The Fed should loosen monetary
policy when a recession has caused unemployment to increase and tighten it when inflation threatens. Of
course, countercyclical policy does pose a danger of overreaction. If loose monetary policy seeking to end a
recession goes too far, it may push aggregate demand so far to the right that it triggers inflation. If tight
monetary policy seeking to reduce inflation goes too far, it may push aggregate demand so far to the left that a
recession begins. Figure 28.7 (a) summarizes the chain of effects that connect loose and tight monetary policy
to changes in output and the price level.

FIGURE 28.7 The Pathways of Monetary Policy (a) In expansionary monetary policy the central bank causes the
supply of money and loanable funds to increase, which lowers the interest rate, stimulating additional borrowing for
investment and consumption, and shifting aggregate demand right. The result is a higher price level and, at least in
the short run, higher real GDP. (b) In contractionary monetary policy, the central bank causes the supply of money
and credit in the economy to decrease, which raises the interest rate, discouraging borrowing for investment and
consumption, and shifting aggregate demand left. The result is a lower price level and, at least in the short run,
lower real GDP.

Federal Reserve Actions Over Last Four Decades

For the period from 1970 through 2020, we can summarize Federal Reserve monetary policy by looking at how
it targeted the federal funds interest rate using open market operations.
Of course, telling the story of the U.S. economy since 1970 in terms of Federal Reserve actions leaves out many
other macroeconomic factors that were influencing unemployment, recession, economic growth, and inflation
over this time. The ten episodes of Federal Reserve action outlined in the sections below also demonstrate that
we should consider the central bank as one of the leading actors influencing the macro economy. As we noted
earlier, the single person with the greatest power to influence the U.S. economy is probably the Federal Reserve
chairperson.
Figure 28.8 shows how the Federal Reserve has carried out monetary policy by targeting the federal funds
interest rate in the last few decades. The graph shows the federal funds interest rate (remember, this interest
rate is set through open market operations), the unemployment rate, and the inflation rate since 1970.
Different episodes of monetary policy during this period are indicated in the figure.
686 28 · Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation

       FIGURE 28.8 Monetary Policy, Unemployment, and Inflation Through the episodes here, the Federal Reserve
       typically reacted to higher inflation with a contractionary monetary policy and a higher interest rate, and reacted to
       higher unemployment with an expansionary monetary policy and a lower interest rate.
       Episode 1
       Consider Episode 1 in the late 1970s. The rate of inflation was very high, exceeding 10% in 1979 and 1980, so
       the Federal Reserve used tight monetary policy to raise interest rates, with the federal funds rate rising from
       5.5% in 1977 to 16.4% in 1981. By 1983, inflation was down to 3.2%, but aggregate demand contracted sharply
       enough that back-to-back recessions occurred in 1980 and in 1981-1982, and the unemployment rate rose
       from 5.8% in 1979 to 9.7% in 1982.
       Episode 2
       In Episode 2, when economists persuaded the Federal Reserve in the early 1980s that inflation was declining,
       the Fed began slashing interest rates to reduce unemployment. The federal funds interest rate fell from 16.4%
       in 1981 to 6.8% in 1986. By 1986 or so, inflation had fallen to about 2% and the unemployment rate had come
       down to 7%, and was still falling.
       Episode 3
       However, in Episode 3 in the late 1980s, inflation appeared to be creeping up again, rising from 2% in 1986 up
       toward 5% by 1989. In response, the Federal Reserve used contractionary monetary policy to raise the federal
       funds rates from 6.6% in 1987 to 9.2% in 1989. The tighter monetary policy stopped inflation, which fell from
       above 5% in 1990 to under 3% in 1992, but it also helped to cause the 1990-1991 recession, and the
       unemployment rate rose from 5.3% in 1989 to 7.5% by 1992.
       Episode 4
       In Episode 4, in the early 1990s, when the Federal Reserve was confident that inflation was back under control,
       it reduced interest rates, with the federal funds interest rate falling from 8.1% in 1990 to 3.5% in 1992. As the
       economy expanded, the unemployment rate declined from 7.5% in 1992 to less than 5% by 1997.
       Episodes 5 and 6
       In Episodes 5 and 6, the Federal Reserve perceived a risk of inflation and raised the federal funds rate from 3%
       to 5.8% from 1993 to 1995. Inflation did not rise, and the period of economic growth during the 1990s
       continued. Then in 1999 and 2000, the Fed was concerned that inflation seemed to be creeping up so it raised
       the federal funds interest rate from 4.6% in December 1998 to 6.5% in June 2000. By early 2001, inflation was
       declining again, but a recession occurred in 2001. Between 2000 and 2002, the unemployment rate rose from

4.0% to 5.8%.

Episodes 7 and 8

In Episodes 7 and 8, the Federal Reserve conducted a loose monetary policy and slashed the federal funds rate
from 6.2% in 2000 to just 1.7% in 2002, and then again to 1% in 2003. They actually did this because of fear of
Japan-style deflation. This persuaded them to lower the Fed funds further than they otherwise would have. The
recession ended, but, unemployment rates were slow to decline in the early 2000s. Finally, in 2004, the
unemployment rate declined and the Federal Reserve began to raise the federal funds rate until it reached 5%
by 2007.

Episode 9

In Episode 9, as the Great Recession took hold in 2008, the Federal Reserve was quick to slash interest rates,
taking them down to 2% in 2008 and to nearly 0% in 2009. When the Fed had taken interest rates down to
near-zero, the economy was still deep in recession. Open market operations could not make the interest rate
turn negative. The Federal Reserve had to think "outside the box."

Episode 10

In Episode 10, which started in March 2020, the Fed cut interest rates again, reducing the target federal funds
rate from 2% to between 0-1/4% in a matter of weeks. Limited by the zero lower bound, the Fed once again had
to think "outside the box" in order to further support the financial system.

28.5 Pitfalls for Monetary Policy

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Analyze whether monetary policy decisions should be made more democratically
  · Calculate the velocity of money
  · Evaluate the central bank's influence on inflation, unemployment, asset bubbles, and leverage cycles
  · Calculate the effects of monetary stimulus

In the real world, effective monetary policy faces a number of significant hurdles. Monetary policy affects the
economy only after a time lag that is typically long and of variable length. Remember, monetary policy involves
a chain of events: the central bank must perceive a situation in the economy, hold a meeting, and make a
decision to react by tightening or loosening monetary policy. The change in monetary policy must percolate
through the banking system, changing the quantity of loans and affecting interest rates. When interest rates
change, businesses must change their investment levels and consumers must change their borrowing patterns
when purchasing homes or cars. Then it takes time for these changes to filter through the rest of the economy.

As a result of this chain of events, monetary policy has little effect in the immediate future. Instead, its primary
effects are felt perhaps one to three years in the future. The reality of long and variable time lags does not
mean that a central bank should refuse to make decisions. It does mean that central banks should be humble
about taking action, because of the risk that their actions can create as much or more economic instability as
they resolve.

Excess Reserves

Banks are legally required to hold a minimum level of reserves, but no rule prohibits them from holding
688 28 · Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation

       additional excess reserves above the legally mandated limit. For example, during a recession banks may be
       hesitant to lend, because they fear that when the economy is contracting, a high proportion of loan applicants
       become less likely to repay their loans.

       When many banks are choosing to hold excess reserves, expansionary monetary policy may not work well.
       This may occur because the banks are concerned about a deteriorating economy, while the central bank is
       trying to expand the money supply. If the banks prefer to hold excess reserves above the legally required level,
       the central bank cannot force individual banks to make loans. Similarly, sensible businesses and consumers
       may be reluctant to borrow substantial amounts of money in a recession, because they recognize that firms'
       sales and employees' jobs are more insecure in a recession, and they do not want to face the need to make
       interest payments. The result is that during an especially deep recession, an expansionary monetary policy
       may have little effect on either the price level or the real GDP.

       Japan experienced this situation in the 1990s and early 2000s. Japan's economy entered a period of very slow
       growth, dipping in and out of recession, in the early 1990s. By February 1999, the Bank of Japan had lowered
       the equivalent of its federal funds rate to 0%. It kept it there most of the time through 2003. Moreover, in the
       two years from March 2001 to March 2003, the Bank of Japan also expanded the country's money supply by
       about 50%--an enormous increase. Even this highly expansionary monetary policy, however, had no
       substantial effect on stimulating aggregate demand. Japan's economy continued to experience extremely slow
       growth into the mid-2000s.

                CLEAR IT UP

      Should monetary policy decisions be made more democratically?

       Should a nation's Congress or legislature comprised of elected representatives conduct monetary policy or should a
       politically appointed central bank that is more independent of voters take charge? Here are some of the arguments.

       The Case for Greater Democratic Control of Monetary Policy

       Elected representatives pass taxes and spending bills to conduct fiscal policy by passing tax and spending bills.
       They could handle monetary policy in the same way. They will sometimes make mistakes, but in a democracy, it is
       better to have elected officials who are accountable to voters make mistakes instead of political appointees. After
       all, the people appointed to the top governing positions at the Federal Reserve--and to most central banks around
       the world--are typically bankers and economists. They are not representatives of borrowers like small businesses or
       farmers nor are they representatives of labor unions. Central banks might not be so quick to raise interest rates if
       they had to pay more attention to firms and people in the real economy.

       The Case for an Independent Central Bank

       Because the central bank has some insulation from day-to-day politics, its members can take a nonpartisan look at
       specific economic situations and make tough, immediate decisions when necessary. The idea of giving a legislature
       the ability to create money and hand out loans is likely to end up badly, sooner or later. It is simply too tempting for
       lawmakers to expand the money supply to fund their projects. The long term result will be rampant inflation. Also, a
       central bank, acting according to the laws passed by elected officials, can respond far more quickly than a
       legislature. For example, the U.S. budget takes months to debate, pass, and sign into law, but monetary policy
       decisions happen much more rapidly. Day-to-day democratic control of monetary policy is impractical and seems
       likely to lead to an overly expansionary monetary policy and higher inflation.

       The problem of excess reserves does not affect contractionary policy. Central bankers have an old saying that
       monetary policy can be like pulling and pushing on a string: when the central bank pulls on the string and uses
       contractionary monetary policy, it can definitely raise interest rates and reduce aggregate demand. However,
       when the central bank tries to push on the string of expansionary monetary policy, the string may sometimes

just fold up limp and have little effect, because banks decide not to loan out their excess reserves. Do not take
this analogy too literally--expansionary monetary policy usually does have real effects, after that
inconveniently long and variable lag. There are also times, like Japan's economy in the late 1990s and early
2000s, when expansionary monetary policy has been insufficient to lift a recession-prone economy.

Unpredictable Movements of Velocity

Velocity is a term that economists use to describe how quickly money circulates through the economy. We
define the velocity of money in a year as:

Specific measurements of velocity depend on the definition of the money supply used. Consider the velocity of
M1, the total amount of currency in circulation and checking account balances. In 2009, for example, M1 was
$1.7 trillion and nominal GDP was $14.3 trillion, so the velocity of M1 was 8.4 (which is $14.3 trillion/$1.7
trillion). A higher velocity of money means that the average dollar circulates more times in a year. A lower
velocity means that the average dollar circulates fewer times in a year.

See the following Clear It Up feature for a discussion of how deflation could affect monetary policy.

         CLEAR IT UP

What happens during episodes of deflation?

Deflation occurs when the rate of inflation is negative; that is, instead of money having less purchasing power over
time, as occurs with inflation, money is worth more. Deflation can make it very difficult for monetary policy to
address a recession.

Remember that the real interest rate is the nominal interest rate minus the rate of inflation. If the nominal interest
rate is 7% and the rate of inflation is 3%, then the borrower is effectively paying a 4% real interest rate. If the
nominal interest rate is 7% and there is deflation of 2%, then the real interest rate is actually 9%. In this way, an
unexpected deflation raises the real interest payments for borrowers. It can lead to a situation where borrowers do
not repay an unexpectedly high number of loans, and banks find that their net worth is decreasing or negative. When
banks are suffering losses, they become less able and eager to make new loans. Aggregate demand declines, which
can lead to recession.

Then the double-whammy: After causing a recession, deflation can make it difficult for monetary policy to work. Say
that the central bank uses expansionary monetary policy to reduce the nominal interest rate all the way to zero--but
the economy has 5% deflation. As a result, the real interest rate is 5%, and because a central bank cannot make the
nominal interest rate negative, expansionary policy cannot reduce the real interest rate further.

In the U.S. economy during the early 1930s, deflation was 6.7% per year from 1930-1933, which caused many
borrowers to default on their loans and many banks to end up bankrupt, which in turn contributed substantially to
the Great Depression. Not all episodes of deflation, however, end in economic depression. Japan, for example,
experienced deflation of slightly less than 1% per year from 1999-2002, which hurt the Japanese economy, but it
still grew by about 0.9% per year over this period. There is at least one historical example of deflation coexisting
with rapid growth. The U.S. economy experienced deflation of about 1.1% per year over the quarter-century from
1876-1900, but real GDP also expanded at a rapid clip of 4% per year over this time, despite some occasional
severe recessions.

The central bank should be on guard against deflation and, if necessary, use expansionary monetary policy to
prevent any long-lasting or extreme deflation from occurring. Except in severe cases like the Great Depression,
deflation does not guarantee economic disaster.

       Changes in velocity can cause problems for monetary policy. To understand why, rewrite the definition of
       velocity so that the money supply is on the left-hand side of the equation. That is:

       Recall from The Macroeconomic Perspective that

       Therefore,

       We sometimes call this equation the basic quantity equation of money but, as you can see, it is just the
       definition of velocity written in a different form. This equation must hold true, by definition.
       If velocity is constant over time, then a certain percentage rise in the money supply on the left-hand side of the
       basic quantity equation of money will inevitably lead to the same percentage rise in nominal GDP--although
       this change could happen through an increase in inflation, or an increase in real GDP, or some combination of
       the two. If velocity is changing over time but in a constant and predictable way, then changes in the money
       supply will continue to have a predictable effect on nominal GDP. If velocity changes unpredictably over time,
       however, then the effect of changes in the money supply on nominal GDP becomes unpredictable.
       Figure 28.9 illustrates the actual velocity of money in the U.S. economy as measured by using M1, the most
       common definition of the money supply. From 1960 up to about 1980, velocity appears fairly predictable; that
       is, it is increasing at a fairly constant rate. In the early 1980s, however, velocity as calculated with M1 becomes
       more variable. The reasons for these sharp changes in velocity remain a puzzle. Economists suspect that the
       changes in velocity are related to innovations in banking and finance which have changed how we are using
       money in making economic transactions: for example, the growth of electronic payments; a rise in personal
       borrowing and credit card usage; and accounts that make it easier for people to hold money in savings
       accounts, where it is counted as M2, right up to the moment that they want to write a check on the money and
       transfer it to M1. So far at least, it has proven difficult to draw clear links between these kinds of factors and the
       specific up-and-down fluctuations in M1. Given many changes in banking and the prevalence of electronic
       banking, economists now favor M2 as a measure of money rather than the narrower M1.

       FIGURE 28.9 Velocity Calculated Using M1 Velocity is the nominal GDP divided by the money supply for a given
       year. We can calculate different measures of velocity by using different measures of the money supply. Velocity, as
       calculated by using M1, has lacked a steady trend since the 1980s, instead bouncing up and down. Note also that
       the redefinition of M1 to include savings deposits in 2020 (see Money and Banking) drastically increased M1 in
       2020, causing velocity to plummet. (credit: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis)

Velocity Calculated Using M1
In the 1970s, when velocity as measured by M1 seemed predictable, a number of economists, led by Nobel
laureate Milton Friedman (1912-2006), argued that the best monetary policy was for the central bank to
increase the money supply at a constant growth rate. These economists argued that with the long and variable
lags of monetary policy, and the political pressures on central bankers, central bank monetary policies were as
likely to have undesirable as to have desirable effects. Thus, these economists believed that the monetary
policy should seek steady growth in the money supply of 3% per year. They argued that a steady monetary
growth rate would be correct over longer time periods, since it would roughly match the growth of the real
economy. In addition, they argued that giving the central bank less discretion to conduct monetary policy
would prevent an overly activist central bank from becoming a source of economic instability and uncertainty.
In this spirit, Friedman wrote in 1967: "The first and most important lesson that history teaches about what
monetary policy can do--and it is a lesson of the most profound importance--is that monetary policy can
prevent money itself from being a major source of economic disturbance."
As the velocity of M1 began to fluctuate in the 1980s, having the money supply grow at a predetermined and
unchanging rate seemed less desirable, because as the quantity theory of money shows, the combination of
constant growth in the money supply and fluctuating velocity would cause nominal GDP to rise and fall in
unpredictable ways. The jumpiness of velocity in the 1980s caused many central banks to focus less on the
rate at which the quantity of money in the economy was increasing, and instead to set monetary policy by
reacting to whether the economy was experiencing or in danger of higher inflation or unemployment.

Unemployment and Inflation

If you were to survey central bankers around the world and ask them what they believe should be the primary
task of monetary policy, the most popular answer by far would be fighting inflation. Most central bankers
believe that the neoclassical model of economics accurately represents the economy over the medium to long
term. Remember that in the neoclassical model of the economy, we draw the aggregate supply curve as a
vertical line at the level of potential GDP, as Figure 28.10 shows. In the neoclassical model, economists
determine the level of potential GDP (and the natural rate of unemployment that exists when the economy is
producing at potential GDP) by real economic factors. If the original level of aggregate demand is AD0, then an
expansionary monetary policy that shifts aggregate demand to AD1 only creates an inflationary increase in the
price level, but it does not alter GDP or unemployment. From this perspective, all that monetary policy can do
is to lead to low inflation or high inflation--and low inflation provides a better climate for a healthy and growing
economy. After all, low inflation means that businesses making investments can focus on real economic
issues, not on figuring out ways to protect themselves from the costs and risks of inflation. In this way, a
consistent pattern of low inflation can contribute to long-term growth.

FIGURE 28.10 Monetary Policy in a Neoclassical Model In a neoclassical view, monetary policy affects only the
price level, not the level of output in the economy. For example, an expansionary monetary policy causes aggregate
demand to shift from the original AD0 to AD1. However, the adjustment of the economy from the original equilibrium
692 28 · Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation

       (E0) to the new equilibrium (E1) represents an inflationary increase in the price level from P0 to P1, but has no effect
       in the long run on output or the unemployment rate. In fact, no shift in AD will affect the equilibrium quantity of
       output in this model.

       This vision of focusing monetary policy on a low rate of inflation is so attractive that many countries have
       rewritten their central banking laws since in the 1990s to have their bank practice inflation targeting, which
       means that the central bank is legally required to focus primarily on keeping inflation low. By 2014, central
       banks in 28 countries, including Austria, Brazil, Canada, Israel, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden,
       Thailand, and the United Kingdom faced a legal requirement to target the inflation rate. A notable exception is
       the Federal Reserve in the United States, which does not practice inflation-targeting. Instead, the law
       governing the Federal Reserve requires it to take both unemployment and inflation into account.

       Economists have no final consensus on whether a central bank should be required to focus only on inflation or
       should have greater discretion. For those who subscribe to the inflation targeting philosophy, the fear is that
       politicians who are worried about slow economic growth and unemployment will constantly pressure the
       central bank to conduct a loose monetary policy--even if the economy is already producing at potential GDP. In
       some countries, the central bank may lack the political power to resist such pressures, with the result of higher
       inflation, but no long-term reduction in unemployment. The U.S. Federal Reserve has a tradition of
       independence, but central banks in other countries may be under greater political pressure. For all of these
       reasons--long and variable lags, excess reserves, unstable velocity, and controversy over economic
       goals--monetary policy in the real world is often difficult. The basic message remains, however, that central
       banks can affect aggregate demand through the conduct of monetary policy and in that way influence
       macroeconomic outcomes.

      Asset Bubbles and Leverage Cycles

       One long-standing concern about having the central bank focus on inflation and unemployment is that it may
       be overlooking certain other economic problems that are coming in the future. For example, from 1994 to
       2000 during what was known as the "dot-com" boom, the U.S. stock market, which the Dow Jones Industrial
       Index measures (which includes 30 very large companies from across the U.S. economy), nearly tripled in
       value. The Nasdaq index, which includes many smaller technology companies, increased in value by a
       multiple of five from 1994 to 2000. These rates of increase were clearly not sustainable. Stock values as
       measured by the Dow Jones were almost 20% lower in 2009 than they had been in 2000. Stock values in the
       Nasdaq index were 50% lower in 2009 than they had been in 2000. The drop-off in stock market values
       contributed to the 2001 recession and the higher unemployment that followed.

       We can tell a similar story about housing prices in the mid-2000s. During the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s,
       housing prices increased at about 6% per year on average. During what came to be known as the "housing
       bubble" from 2003 to 2005, housing prices increased at almost double this annual rate. These rates of increase
       were clearly not sustainable. When housing prices fell in 2007 and 2008, many banks and households found
       that their assets were worth less than they expected, which contributed to the recession that started in 2007.

       At a broader level, some economists worry about a leverage cycle, where "leverage" is a term financial
       economists use to mean "borrowing." When economic times are good, banks and the financial sector are eager
       to lend, and people and firms are eager to borrow. Remember that a money multiplier determines the amount
       of money and credit in an economy --a process of loans made, money deposited, and more loans made. In good
       economic times, this surge of lending exaggerates the episode of economic growth. It can even be part of what
       lead prices of certain assets--like stock prices or housing prices--to rise at unsustainably high annual rates. At
       some point, when economic times turn bad, banks and the financial sector become much less willing to lend,
       and credit becomes expensive or unavailable to many potential borrowers. The sharp reduction in credit,
       perhaps combined with the deflating prices of a dot-com stock price bubble or a housing bubble, makes the
       economic downturn worse than it would otherwise be.

Thus, some economists have suggested that the central bank should not just look at economic growth,
inflation, and unemployment rates, but should also keep an eye on asset prices and leverage cycles. Such
proposals are quite controversial. If a central bank had announced in 1997 that stock prices were rising "too
fast" or in 2004 that housing prices were rising "too fast," and then taken action to hold down price increases,
many people and their elected political representatives would have been outraged. Neither the Federal
Reserve nor any other central banks want to take the responsibility of deciding when stock prices and housing
prices are too high, too low, or just right. As further research explores how asset price bubbles and leverage
cycles can affect an economy, central banks may need to think about whether they should conduct monetary
policy in a way that would seek to moderate these effects.
Let's end this chapter with a Work it Out exercise in how the Fed--or any central bank--would stir up the
economy by increasing the money supply.

                                                                                                          WORK IT OUT

 Calculating the Effects of Monetary Stimulus

  Suppose that the central bank wants to stimulate the economy by increasing the money supply. The bankers
  estimate that the velocity of money is 3, and that the price level will increase from 100 to 110 due to the
  stimulus. Using the quantity equation of money, what will be the impact of an $800 billion dollar increase in the
  money supply on the quantity of goods and services in the economy given an initial money supply of $4 trillion?
  Step 1. We begin by writing the quantity equation of money: MV = PQ. We know that initially V = 3, M = 4,000
  (billion) and P = 100. Substituting these numbers in, we can solve for Q:

  Step 2. Now we want to find the effect of the addition $800 billion in the money supply, together with the
  increase in the price level. The new equation is:

  Step 3. If we take the difference between the two quantities, we find that the monetary stimulus increased the
  quantity of goods and services in the economy by 10.9 billion.

The discussion in this chapter has focused on domestic monetary policy; that is, the view of monetary policy
within an economy. Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows explores the international dimension of
monetary policy, and how monetary policy becomes involved with exchange rates and international flows of
financial capital.

The Problem of the Zero Percent Interest Rate Lower Bound

In 2008, the U.S. Federal Reserve found itself in a difficult position. The federal funds rate was on its way to near
zero, which meant that traditional open market operations, by which the Fed purchases U.S. Treasury Bills to lower
short term interest rates, was no longer viable. This so called "zero bound problem," prompted the Fed, under then
Chair Ben Bernanke, to attempt some unconventional policies, collectively called quantitative easing. By early 2014,
quantitative easing nearly quintupled the amount of bank reserves. This likely contributed to the U.S. economy's
694 28 · Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation

       recovery, but the impact was muted, probably due to some of the hurdles mentioned in the last section of this
       module. The unprecedented increase in bank reserves also led to fears of inflation, which never bore out.
       Throughout the 2010s there have been no serious signs of inflation with core inflation around a stable 1.5-2%. As of
       early 2015, however, there have been no serious signs of a boom, with core inflation around a stable 1.7%.
       The Zero Lower Bound was encountered again in 2020 due to the pandemic, when the target federal funds rate
       dropped by over two percentage points in a matter of weeks. The Fed further responded by increasing asset
       purchases by an even greater amount, and at a faster rate, than in 2009. When the U.S. started experiencing higher-
       than-average inflation in 2021, the Fed chair Jerome Powell responded to criticisms by saying that the Fed was
       poised to consider rate increases and start tapering the rate of asset purchases into 2022. It remains to be seen
       whether inflation can be tamed moving forward, or if more aggressive policy measures will be required.

Key Concepts and Summary

28.1 The Federal Reserve Banking System and Central Banks

The most prominent task of a central bank is to conduct monetary policy, which involves changes to interest
rates and credit conditions, affecting the amount of borrowing and spending in an economy. Some prominent
central banks around the world include the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of
Japan, and the Bank of England.

28.2 Bank Regulation

A bank run occurs when there are rumors (possibly true, possibly false) that a bank is at financial risk of
having negative net worth. As a result, depositors rush to the bank to withdraw their money and put it
someplace safer. Even false rumors, if they cause a bank run, can force a healthy bank to lose its deposits and
be forced to close. Deposit insurance guarantees bank depositors that, even if the bank has negative net worth,
their deposits will be protected. In the United States, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) collects
deposit insurance premiums from banks and guarantees bank deposits up to $250,000. Bank supervision
involves inspecting the balance sheets of banks to make sure that they have positive net worth and that their
assets are not too risky. In the United States, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is responsible
for supervising banks and inspecting savings and loans and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA)
is responsible for inspecting credit unions. The FDIC and the Federal Reserve also play a role in bank
supervision.
696 28 · Self-Check Questions

When a central bank acts as a lender of last resort, it makes short-term loans available in situations of severe
financial panic or stress. The failure of a single bank can be treated like any other business failure. Yet if many
banks fail, it can reduce aggregate demand in a way that can bring on or deepen a recession. The combination
of deposit insurance, bank supervision, and lender of last resort policies help to prevent weaknesses in the
banking system from causing recessions.

28.3 How a Central Bank Executes Monetary Policy

In a limited reserves environment, the central bank has three traditional tools to conduct monetary policy:
open market operations, which involves buying and selling government bonds with banks; reserve
requirements, which determine what level of reserves a bank is legally required to hold; and discount rates,
which is the interest rate charged by the central bank on the loans that it gives to other commercial banks. In a
limited reserves environment, the most commonly used tool is open market operations. Since the financial
crisis, the U.S. banking system is in an ample reserves environment. The FOMC has moved away from the
traditional tools of a limited reserve environment and now uses changes in the interest rate on reserve
balances (IORB) as its main monetary policy tool.

28.4 Monetary Policy and Economic Outcomes

An expansionary (or loose) monetary policy raises the quantity of money and credit above what it otherwise
would have been and reduces interest rates, boosting aggregate demand, and thus countering recession. A
contractionary monetary policy, also called a tight monetary policy, reduces the quantity of money and credit
below what it otherwise would have been and raises interest rates, seeking to hold down inflation. During the
2008-2009 recession, central banks around the world also used quantitative easing to expand the supply of
credit.

28.5 Pitfalls for Monetary Policy

Monetary policy is inevitably imprecise, for a number of reasons: (a) the effects occur only after long and
variable lags; (b) if banks decide to hold excess reserves, monetary policy cannot force them to lend; and (c)
velocity may shift in unpredictable ways. The basic quantity equation of money is MV = PQ, where M is the
money supply, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level, and Q is the real output of the economy. Some
central banks, like the European Central Bank, practice inflation targeting, which means that the only goal of
the central bank is to keep inflation within a low target range. Other central banks, such as the U.S. Federal
Reserve, are free to focus on either reducing inflation or stimulating an economy that is in recession,
whichever goal seems most important at the time.

Is a Stronger Dollar Good for the U.S. Economy?

From 2002 to 2008, the U.S. dollar lost more than a quarter of its value in foreign currency markets. On January 1,
2002, one dollar was worth 1.11 euros. On April 24, 2008 it hit its lowest point with a dollar being worth 0.64 euros.
During this period, the trade deficit between the United States and the European Union grew from a yearly total of
approximately 85.7 billion dollars in 2002 to 95.8 billion dollars in 2008. Was this a good thing or a bad thing for the
U.S. economy?
We live in a global world. U.S. consumers buy trillions of dollars worth of imported goods and services each year, not
just from the European Union, but from all over the world. U.S. businesses sell trillions of dollars' worth of exports.
U.S. citizens, businesses, and governments invest trillions of dollars abroad every year. Foreign investors,
700 29 · Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows

       businesses, and governments invest trillions of dollars in the United States each year. Indeed, foreigners are a major
       buyer of U.S. federal debt.

       Many people feel that a weaker dollar is bad for America, that it's an indication of a weak economy, but is it? This
       chapter will help answer that question.

       The world has over 150 different currencies, from the Afghanistan afghani and the Albanian lek all the way
       through the alphabet to the Zambian kwacha and the Zimbabwean dollar. For international economic
       transactions, households or firms will wish to exchange one currency for another. Perhaps the need for
       exchanging currencies will come from a German firm that exports products to Russia, but then wishes to
       exchange the Russian rubles it has earned for euros, so that the firm can pay its workers and suppliers in
       Germany. Perhaps it will be a South African firm that wishes to purchase a mining operation in Angola, but to
       make the purchase it must convert South African rand to Angolan kwanza. Perhaps it will be an American
       tourist visiting China, who wishes to convert U.S. dollars to Chinese yuan to pay the hotel bill.

       Exchange rates can sometimes change very swiftly. For example, in the United Kingdom the pound was worth
       about $1.50 just before the nation voted to leave the European Union (also known as the Brexit vote), in June
       2016; the pound fell to $1.37 just after the vote and continued falling to reach 30-year lows a few months later.
       For firms engaged in international buying, selling, lending, and borrowing, these swings in exchange rates can
       have an enormous effect on profits.

       This chapter discusses the international dimension of money, which involves conversions from one currency
       to another at an exchange rate. An exchange rate is nothing more than a price--that is, the price of one
       currency in terms of another currency--and so we can analyze it with the tools of supply and demand. The first
       module of this chapter begins with an overview of foreign exchange markets: their size, their main
       participants, and the vocabulary for discussing movements of exchange rates. The following module uses
       demand and supply graphs to analyze some of the main factors that cause shifts in exchange rates. A final
       module then brings the central bank and monetary policy back into the picture. Each country must decide
       whether to allow the market to determine its exchange rate, or have the central bank intervene. All the choices
       for exchange rate policy involve distinctive tradeoffs and risks.

     29.1 How the Foreign Exchange Market Works

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Define "foreign exchange market"
         · Describe different types of investments like foreign direct investments (FDI), portfolio investments, and

             hedging
         · Explain how appreciating or depreciating currency affects exchange rates
         · Identify who benefits from a stronger currency and benefits from a weaker currency

       Most countries have different currencies, but not all. Sometimes small economies use an economically larger
       neighbor's currency. For example, Ecuador, El Salvador, and Panama have decided to dollarize--that is, to use
       the U.S. dollar as their currency. Sometimes nations share a common currency. A large-scale example of a
       common currency is the decision by 17 European nations--including some very large economies such as
       France, Germany, and Italy--to replace their former currencies with the euro at the start of 1999. With these
       exceptions, most of the international economy takes place in a situation of multiple national currencies in
       which both people and firms need to convert from one currency to another when selling, buying, hiring,
       borrowing, traveling, or investing across national borders. We call the market in which people or firms use one
       currency to purchase another currency the foreign exchange market.

       You have encountered the basic concept of exchange rates in earlier chapters. In The International Trade and
       Capital Flows, for example, we discussed how economists use exchange rates to compare GDP statistics from

countries where they measure GDP in different currencies. These earlier examples, however, took the actual
exchange rate as given, as if it were a fact of nature. In reality, the exchange rate is a price--the price of one
currency expressed in terms of units of another currency. The key framework for analyzing prices, whether in
this course, any other economics course, in public policy, or business examples, is the operation of supply and
demand in markets.

The Extraordinary Size of the Foreign Exchange Markets

If you travel to a foreign country that uses a different currency, you will undoubtedly need to make a trip to a
bank or foreign currency office to exchange whatever currency you're holding for that country's currency. Even
though this is a simple transaction, it is part of a very large market. The quantities traded in foreign exchange
markets are breathtaking. A 2019 Bank of International Settlements survey found that $5.3 trillion per day was
traded on foreign exchange markets, which makes the foreign exchange market the largest market in the world
economy. In contrast, 2019 U.S. real GDP was $21.4 trillion per year.

Your transaction is simple enough. Suppose you carry a $100 bill. You bring it into the foreign currency office
and look up, and you see a bunch of different numbers on a digital board. For example, if you are traveling to
Turkey, whose national currency is the Turkish Lira, one line of the board might read: "U.S. DOLLARS: BUY
5.50; SELL 5.80." This means that the office will give you 5.50 Turkish Lira in exchange for 1 U.S. dollar. If you
have $100, the office will give you 550 Turkish Lira. If you want to sell Turkish Lira for U.S. dollars, the office
will surely buy them from you, but not at the same exchange rate, since the office will make some money on the
exchange. So if you bring 550 Turkish Lira and ask for U.S. dollars, it will not give you 100 dollars, but instead
about $95. The important point is that this one transaction, when repeated all over the world for all sorts of
different transactions, ends up totaling $6.6 trillion worth of exchanges per day.

Table 29.1 shows the currencies most commonly traded on foreign exchange markets. The U.S. dollar
dominates the foreign exchange market, being on one side of 88.3% of all foreign exchange transactions. The
U.S. dollar is followed by the euro, the British pound, the Australian dollar, and the Japanese yen.

Demanders and Suppliers of Currency in Foreign Exchange Markets

In foreign exchange markets, demand and supply become closely interrelated, because a person or firm who
demands one currency must at the same time supply another currency--and vice versa. To get a sense of this,
it is useful to consider four groups of people or firms who participate in the market: (1) firms that are involved
in international trade of goods and services; (2) tourists visiting other countries; (3) international investors
buying ownership (or part-ownership) of a foreign firm; (4) international investors making financial
investments that do not involve ownership. Let's consider these categories in turn.

Firms that buy and sell on international markets find that their costs for workers, suppliers, and investors are
measured in the currency of the nation where their production occurs, but their revenues from sales are
measured in the currency of the different nation where their sales happened. Thus, a Chinese firm exporting
abroad will earn some other currency--say, U.S. dollars--but will need Chinese yuan to pay the workers,
suppliers, and investors who are based in China. In the foreign exchange markets, this firm will be a supplier of
U.S. dollars and a demander of Chinese yuan.

International tourists will supply their home currency to receive the currency of the country they are visiting.
For example, an American tourist who is visiting China will supply U.S. dollars into the foreign exchange
market and demand Chinese yuan.

We often divide financial investments that cross international boundaries, and require exchanging currency
into two categories. Foreign direct investment (FDI) refers to purchasing a firm (at least ten percent) in
another country or starting up a new enterprise in a foreign country For example, in 2008 the Belgian beer-
brewing company InBev bought the U.S. beer-maker Anheuser-Busch for $52 billion. To make this purchase,
InBev would have to supply euros (the currency of Belgium) to the foreign exchange market and demand U.S.
dollars.

The other kind of international financial investment, portfolio investment, involves a purely financial
investment that does not entail any management responsibility. An example would be a U.S. financial investor
who purchased U.K. government bonds, or deposited money in a British bank. To make such investments, the
American investor would supply U.S. dollars in the foreign exchange market and demand British pounds.

Business people often link portfolio investment to expectations about how exchange rates will shift. Look at a
U.S. financial investor who is considering purchasing U.K. issued bonds. For simplicity, ignore any bond
interest payment (which will be small in the short run anyway) and focus on exchange rates. Say that a British
pound is currently worth $1.50 in U.S. currency. However, the investor believes that in a month, the British

                                                                                                                         29.1 · How the Foreign Exchange Market Works 703

pound will be worth $1.60 in U.S. currency. Thus, as Figure 29.2 (a) shows, this investor would change $24,000
for 16,000 British pounds. In a month, if the pound is worth $1.60, then the portfolio investor can trade back to
U.S. dollars at the new exchange rate, and have $25,600--a nice profit. A portfolio investor who believes that
the foreign exchange rate for the pound will work in the opposite direction can also invest accordingly. Say that
an investor expects that the pound, now worth $1.50 in U.S. currency, will decline to $1.40. Then, as Figure
29.2 (b) shows, that investor could start off with £20,000 in British currency (borrowing the money if
necessary), convert it to $30,000 in U.S. currency, wait a month, and then convert back to approximately
£21,429 in British currency--again making a nice profit. Of course, this kind of investing comes without
guarantees, and an investor will suffer losses if the exchange rates do not move as predicted.

FIGURE 29.2 A Portfolio Investor Trying to Benefit from Exchange Rate Movements Expectations of a currency's
future value can drive its demand and supply in foreign exchange markets.
Many portfolio investment decisions are not as simple as betting that the currency's value will change in one
direction or the other. Instead, they involve firms trying to protect themselves from movements in exchange
rates. Imagine you are running a U.S. firm that is exporting to France. You have signed a contract to deliver
certain products and will receive 1 million euros a year from now. However, you do not know how much this
contract will be worth in U.S. dollars, because the dollar/euro exchange rate can fluctuate in the next year. Let's
say you want to know for sure what the contract will be worth, and not take a risk that the euro will be worth
less in U.S. dollars than it currently is. You can hedge, which means using a financial transaction to protect
yourself against a risk from one of your investments (in this case, currency risk from the contract). Specifically,
you can sign a financial contract and pay a fee that guarantees you a certain exchange rate one year from
now--regardless of what the market exchange rate is at that time. Now, it is possible that the euro will be worth
more in dollars a year from now, so your hedging contract will be unnecessary, and you will have paid a fee for
nothing. However, if the value of the euro in dollars declines, then you are protected by the hedge. When
parties wish to enter financial contracts like hedging, they normally rely on a financial institution or brokerage
company to handle the hedging. These companies either take a fee or create a spread in the exchange rate in
order to earn money through the service they provide.
Both foreign direct investment and portfolio investment involve an investor who supplies domestic currency
and demands a foreign currency. With portfolio investment, the client purchases less than ten percent of a
company. As such, business players often get involved with portfolio investment with a short term focus. With
foreign direct investment the investor purchases more than ten percent of a company and the investor
704 29 · Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows

typically assumes some managerial responsibility. Thus, foreign direct investment tends to have a more long-
run focus. As a practical matter, an investor can withdraw portfolio investments from a country much more
quickly than foreign direct investments. A U.S. portfolio investor who wants to buy or sell U.K. government
bonds can do so with a phone call or a few computer keyboard clicks. However, a U.S. firm that wants to buy or
sell a company, such as one that manufactures automobile parts in the United Kingdom, will find that planning
and carrying out the transaction takes a few weeks, even months. Table 29.2 summarizes the main categories
of currency demanders and suppliers.

TABLE 29.2 The Demand and Supply Line-ups in Foreign Exchange Markets

Participants in the Exchange Rate Market

The foreign exchange market does not involve the ultimate suppliers and demanders of foreign exchange
literally seeking each other. If Martina decides to leave her home in Venezuela and take a trip in the United
States, she does not need to find a U.S. citizen who is planning to take a vacation in Venezuela and arrange a
person-to-person currency trade. Instead, the foreign exchange market works through financial institutions,
and it operates on several levels.

Most people and firms who are exchanging a substantial quantity of currency go to a bank, and most banks
provide foreign exchange as a service to customers. These banks (and a few other firms), known as dealers,
then trade the foreign exchange. This is called the interbank market.

In the world economy, roughly 2,000 firms are foreign exchange dealers. The U.S. economy has less than 100
foreign exchange dealers, but the largest 12 or so dealers carry out more than half the total transactions. The
foreign exchange market has no central location, but the major dealers keep a close watch on each other at all
times.

The foreign exchange market is huge not because of the demands of tourists, firms, or even foreign direct
investment, but instead because of portfolio investment and the actions of interlocking foreign exchange
dealers. International tourism is a very large industry, involving about $1 trillion per year. Global exports are
about 23.5% of global GDP or about $19 trillion per year. Foreign direct investment totaled about $870 billion
in the end of 2021. These quantities are dwarfed, however, by the $6.6 trillion per day traded in foreign
exchange markets. Most transactions in the foreign exchange market are for portfolio investment--relatively
short-term movements of financial capital between currencies--and because of the large foreign exchange
dealers' actions as they constantly buy and sell with each other.

Strengthening and Weakening Currency

When the prices of most goods and services change, the price "rises or "falls". For exchange rates, the
terminology is different. When the exchange rate for a currency rises, so that the currency exchanges for more

                                                                                                                         29.1 · How the Foreign Exchange Market Works 705

of other currencies, we refer to it as appreciating or "strengthening." When the exchange rate for a currency
falls, so that a currency trades for less of other currencies, we refer to it as depreciating or "weakening."
To illustrate the use of these terms, consider the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar
since 1980, in Figure 29.3 (a). The vertical axis in Figure 29.3 (a) shows the price of $1 in U.S. currency,
measured in terms of Canadian currency. Clearly, exchange rates can move up and down substantially. A U.S.
dollar traded for $1.17 Canadian in 1980. The U.S. dollar appreciated or strengthened to $1.39 Canadian in
1986, depreciated or weakened to $1.15 Canadian in 1991, and then appreciated or strengthened to $1.60
Canadian by early in 2002, fell to roughly $1.20 Canadian in 2009, and then had a sharp spike up and decline
in 2009 and 2010. In August 2022, the U.S. dollar stood at $1.28 Canadian. The units in which we measure
exchange rates can be confusing, because we measure the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar exchange using a
different currency--the Canadian dollar. However, exchange rates always measure the price of one unit of
currency by using a different currency.

FIGURE 29.3 Strengthen or Appreciate vs. Weaken or Depreciate Exchange rates tend to fluctuate substantially,
even between bordering companies such as the United States and Canada. By looking closely at the time values, it is
clear that the values in part (a) are a mirror image of part (b), which demonstrates that the depreciation of one
currency correlates to the appreciation of the other and vice versa. This means that when comparing the exchange
rates between two countries (in this case, the United States and Canada), the depreciation (or weakening) of one
country (the U.S. dollar for this example) indicates the appreciation (or strengthening) of the other currency (which
in this example is the Canadian dollar). (Source: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)

       In looking at the exchange rate between two currencies, the appreciation or strengthening of one currency
       must mean the depreciation or weakening of the other. Figure 29.3 (b) shows the exchange rate for the
       Canadian dollar, measured in terms of U.S. dollars. The exchange rate of the U.S. dollar measured in Canadian
       dollars, in Figure 29.3 (a), is a perfect mirror image with the Canadian dollar exchange rate measured in U.S.
       dollars, in Figure 29.3 (b). A fall in the Canada $/U.S. $ ratio means a rise in the U.S. $/Canada $ ratio, and vice
       versa.

       With the price of a typical good or service, it is clear that higher prices benefit sellers and hurt buyers, while
       lower prices benefit buyers and hurt sellers. In the case of exchange rates, where the buyers and sellers are not
       always intuitively obvious, it is useful to trace how a stronger or weaker currency will affect different market
       participants. Consider, for example, the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on six different groups of economic
       actors, as Figure 29.4 shows: (1) U.S. exporters selling abroad; (2) foreign exporters (that is, firms selling
       imports in the U.S. economy); (3) U.S. tourists abroad; (4) foreign tourists visiting the United States; (5) U.S.
       investors (either foreign direct investment or portfolio investment) considering opportunities in other
       countries; (6) and foreign investors considering opportunities in the U.S. economy.

       FIGURE 29.4 How Do Exchange Rate Movements Affect Each Group? Exchange rate movements affect exporters,
       tourists, and international investors in different ways.
       For a U.S. firm selling abroad, a stronger U.S. dollar is a curse. A strong U.S. dollar means that foreign
       currencies are correspondingly weak. When this exporting firm earns foreign currencies through its export
       sales, and then converts them back to U.S. dollars to pay workers, suppliers, and investors, the stronger dollar
       means that the foreign currency buys fewer U.S. dollars than if the currency had not strengthened, and that the
       firm's profits (as measured in dollars) fall. As a result, the firm may choose to reduce its exports, or it may raise
       its selling price, which will also tend to reduce its exports. In this way, a stronger currency reduces a country's
       exports.
       Conversely, for a foreign firm selling in the U.S. economy, a stronger dollar is a blessing. Each dollar earned
       through export sales, when traded back into the exporting firm's home currency, will now buy more home
       currency than expected before the dollar had strengthened. As a result, the stronger dollar means that the
       importing firm will earn higher profits than expected. The firm will seek to expand its sales in the U.S.

economy, or it may reduce prices, which will also lead to expanded sales. In this way, a stronger U.S. dollar
means that consumers will purchase more from foreign producers, expanding the country's level of imports.

For a U.S. tourist abroad, who is exchanging U.S. dollars for foreign currency as necessary, a stronger U.S.
dollar is a benefit. The tourist receives more foreign currency for each U.S. dollar, and consequently the cost of
the trip in U.S. dollars is lower. When a country's currency is strong, it is a good time for citizens of that country
to tour abroad. Imagine a U.S. tourist who has saved up $5,000 for a trip to South Africa. In February 2018, $1
bought 11.9 South African rand, so the tourist had 59,500 rand to spend. By 2018, $1 bought 14.5 rand, which
for the tourist translates to 72,500 rand. For foreign visitors to the United States, the opposite pattern holds
true. A relatively stronger U.S. dollar means that their own currencies are relatively weaker, so that as they shift
from their own currency to U.S. dollars, they have fewer U.S. dollars than previously. When a country's
currency is strong, it is not an especially good time for foreign tourists to visit.

A stronger dollar injures the prospects of a U.S. financial investor who has already invested money in another
country. A U.S. financial investor abroad must first convert U.S. dollars to a foreign currency, invest in a foreign
country, and then later convert that foreign currency back to U.S. dollars. If in the meantime the U.S. dollar
becomes stronger and the foreign currency becomes weaker, then when the investor converts back to U.S.
dollars, the rate of return on that investment will be less than originally expected at the time it was made.

However, a stronger U.S. dollar boosts the returns of a foreign investor putting money into a U.S. investment.
That foreign investor converts from the home currency to U.S. dollars and seeks a U.S. investment, while later
planning to switch back to the home currency. If, in the meantime, the dollar grows stronger, then when the
time comes to convert from U.S. dollars back to the foreign currency, the investor will receive more foreign
currency than expected at the time the original investment was made.

The preceding paragraphs all focus on the case where the U.S. dollar becomes stronger. The first column in
Figure 29.4 illustrates the corresponding happy or unhappy economic reactions. The following Work It Out
feature centers the analysis on the opposite: a weaker dollar.

                                                                                                          WORK IT OUT

 Effects of a Weaker Dollar

  Let's work through the effects of a weaker dollar on a U.S. exporter, a foreign exporter into the United States, a
  U.S. tourist going abroad, a foreign tourist coming to the United States, a U.S. investor abroad, and a foreign
  investor in the United States.

  Step 1. Note that the demand for U.S. exports is a function of the price of those exports, which depends on the
  dollar price of those goods and the exchange rate of the dollar in terms of foreign currency. For example, a Ford
  pickup truck costs $25,000 in the United States. When it is sold in the United Kingdom, the price is $25,000 /
  $1.30 per British pound, or £19,231. The dollar affects the price foreigners face who may purchase U.S. exports.

  Step 2. Consider that, if the dollar weakens, the pound rises in value. If the pound rises to $2.00 per pound, then
  the price of a Ford pickup is now $25,000 / $2.00 = £12,500. A weaker dollar means the foreign currency buys
  more dollars, which means that U.S. exports appear less expensive.

  Step 3. Summarize that a weaker U.S. dollar leads to an increase in U.S. exports. For a foreign exporter, the
  outcome is just the opposite.

  Step 4. Suppose a brewery in England is interested in selling its Bass Ale to a grocery store in the United States.
  If the price of a six pack of Bass Ale is £6.00 and the exchange rate is $1.30 per British pound, the price for the
  grocery store is 6.00 × $1.30 = $7.80 per six pack. If the dollar weakens to $2.00 per pound, the price of Bass
  Ale is now 6.00 × $2.00 = $12.

  Step 5. Summarize that, from the perspective of U.S. purchasers, a weaker dollar means that foreign currency is
708 29 · Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows

         more expensive, which means that foreign goods are more expensive also. This leads to a decrease in U.S.
         imports, which is bad for the foreign exporter.
         Step 6. Consider U.S. tourists going abroad. They face the same situation as a U.S. importer--they are purchasing
         a foreign trip. A weaker dollar means that their trip will cost more, since a given expenditure of foreign currency
         (e.g., hotel bill) will take more dollars. The result is that the tourist may not stay as long abroad, and some may
         choose not to travel at all.
         Step 7. Consider that, for the foreign tourist to the United States, a weaker dollar is a boon. It means their
         currency goes further, so the cost of a trip to the United States will be less. Foreigners may choose to take longer
         trips to the United States, and more foreign tourists may decide to take U.S. trips.
         Step 8. Note that a U.S. investor abroad faces the same situation as a U.S. importer--they are purchasing a
         foreign asset. A U.S. investor will see a weaker dollar as an increase in the "price" of investment, since the same
         number of dollars will buy less foreign currency and thus less foreign assets. This should decrease the amount of
         U.S. investment abroad.
         Step 9. Note also that foreign investors in the Unites States will have the opposite experience. Since foreign
         currency buys more dollars, they will likely invest in more U.S. assets.

       At this point, you should have a good sense of the major players in the foreign exchange market: firms involved
       in international trade, tourists, international financial investors, banks, and foreign exchange dealers. The next
       module shows how players can use the tools of demand and supply in foreign exchange markets to explain the
       underlying causes of stronger and weaker currencies (we address "stronger" and "weaker" more in the
       following Clear It Up feature).

                CLEAR IT UP
      Why is a stronger currency not necessarily better?

       One common misunderstanding about exchange rates is that a "stronger" or "appreciating" currency must be better
       than a "weaker" or "depreciating" currency. After all, is it not obvious that "strong" is better than "weak"? Do not let
       the terminology confuse you. When a currency becomes stronger, so that it purchases more of other currencies, it
       benefits some in the economy and injures others. Stronger currency is not necessarily better, it is just different.

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain supply and demand for exchange rates
         · Define arbitrage
         · Explain purchasing power parity's importance when comparing countries.
       The foreign exchange market involves firms, households, and investors who demand and supply currencies
       coming together through their banks and the key foreign exchange dealers. Figure 29.5 (a) offers an example
       for the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Mexican peso. The vertical axis shows the exchange rate
       for U.S. dollars, which in this case is measured in pesos. The horizontal axis shows the quantity of U.S. dollars
       traded in the foreign exchange market each day. The demand curve (D) for U.S. dollars intersects with the
       supply curve (S) of U.S. dollars at the equilibrium point (E), which is an exchange rate of 10 pesos per dollar
       and a total volume of $8.5 billion.

FIGURE 29.5 Demand and Supply for the U.S. Dollar and Mexican Peso Exchange Rate (a) The quantity measured
on the horizontal axis is in U.S. dollars, and the exchange rate on the vertical axis is the price of U.S. dollars
measured in Mexican pesos. (b) The quantity measured on the horizontal axis is in Mexican pesos, while the price on
the vertical axis is the price of pesos measured in U.S. dollars. In both graphs, the equilibrium exchange rate occurs
at point E, at the intersection of the demand curve (D) and the supply curve (S).
Figure 29.5 (b) presents the same demand and supply information from the perspective of the Mexican peso.
The vertical axis shows the exchange rate for Mexican pesos, which is measured in U.S. dollars. The horizontal
axis shows the quantity of Mexican pesos traded in the foreign exchange market. The demand curve (D) for
Mexican pesos intersects with the supply curve (S) of Mexican pesos at the equilibrium point (E), which is an
exchange rate of 10 cents in U.S. currency for each Mexican peso and a total volume of 85 billion pesos. Note
that the two exchange rates are inverses: 10 pesos per dollar is the same as 10 cents per peso (or $0.10 per
peso). In the actual foreign exchange market, almost all of the trading for Mexican pesos is for U.S. dollars.
What factors would cause the demand or supply to shift, thus leading to a change in the equilibrium exchange
rate? We discuss the answer to this question in the following section.

Expectations about Future Exchange Rates

One reason to demand a currency on the foreign exchange market is the belief that the currency's value is
about to increase. One reason to supply a currency--that is, sell it on the foreign exchange market--is the
expectation that the currency's value is about to decline. For example, imagine that a leading business
newspaper, like the Wall Street Journal or the Financial Times, runs an article predicting that the Mexican peso
will appreciate in value. Figure 29.6 illustrates the likely effects of such an article. Demand for the Mexican
peso shifts to the right, from D0 to D1, as investors become eager to purchase pesos. Conversely, the supply of
pesos shifts to the left, from S0 to S1, because investors will be less willing to give them up. The result is that
the equilibrium exchange rate rises from 10 cents/peso to 12 cents/peso and the equilibrium exchange rate
rises from 85 billion to 90 billion pesos as the equilibrium moves from E0 to E1.
710 29 · Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows

       FIGURE 29.6 Exchange Rate Market for Mexican Peso Reacts to Expectations about Future Exchange Rates An
       announcement that the peso exchange rate is likely to strengthen in the future will lead to greater demand for the
       peso in the present from investors who wish to benefit from the appreciation. Similarly, it will make investors less
       likely to supply pesos to the foreign exchange market. Both the shift of demand to the right and the shift of supply to
       the left cause an immediate appreciation in the exchange rate.
       Figure 29.6 also illustrates some peculiar traits of supply and demand diagrams in the foreign exchange
       market. In contrast to all the other cases of supply and demand you have considered, in the foreign exchange
       market, supply and demand typically both move at the same time. Groups of participants in the foreign
       exchange market like firms and investors include some who are buyers and some who are sellers. An
       expectation of a future shift in the exchange rate affects both buyers and sellers--that is, it affects both demand
       and supply for a currency.
       The shifts in demand and supply curves both cause the exchange rate to shift in the same direction. In this
       example, they both make the peso exchange rate stronger. However, the shifts in demand and supply work in
       opposing directions on the quantity traded. In this example, the rising demand for pesos is causing the
       quantity to rise while the falling supply of pesos is causing quantity to fall. In this specific example, the result is
       a higher quantity. However, in other cases, the result could be that quantity remains unchanged or declines.
       This example also helps to explain why exchange rates often move quite substantially in a short period of a few
       weeks or months. When investors expect a country's currency to strengthen in the future, they buy the
       currency and cause it to appreciate immediately. The currency's appreciation can lead other investors to
       believe that future appreciation is likely--and thus lead to even further appreciation. Similarly, a fear that a
       currency might weaken quickly leads to an actual weakening of the currency, which often reinforces the belief
       that the currency will weaken further. Thus, beliefs about the future path of exchange rates can be self-
       reinforcing, at least for a time, and a large share of the trading in foreign exchange markets involves dealers
       trying to outguess each other on what direction exchange rates will move next.

      Differences across Countries in Rates of Return

       The motivation for investment, whether domestic or foreign, is to earn a return. If rates of return in a country
       look relatively high, then that country will tend to attract funds from abroad. Conversely, if rates of return in a
       country look relatively low, then funds will tend to flee to other economies. Changes in the expected rate of
       return will shift demand and supply for a currency. For example, imagine that interest rates rise in the United
       States as compared with Mexico. Thus, financial investments in the United States promise a higher return than
       previously. As a result, more investors will demand U.S. dollars so that they can buy interest-bearing assets
       and fewer investors will be willing to supply U.S. dollars to foreign exchange markets. Demand for the U.S.
       dollar will shift to the right, from D0 to D1, and supply will shift to the left, from S0 to S1, as Figure 29.7 shows.
       The new equilibrium (E1), will occur at an exchange rate of nine pesos/dollar and the same quantity of $8.5
       billion. Thus, a higher interest rate or rate of return relative to other countries leads a nation's currency to
       appreciate or strengthen, and a lower interest rate relative to other countries leads a nation's currency to

depreciate or weaken. Since a nation's central bank can use monetary policy to affect its interest rates, a
central bank can also cause changes in exchange rates--a connection that we will discuss in more detail later
in this chapter.

FIGURE 29.7 Exchange Rate Market for U.S. Dollars Reacts to Higher Interest Rates A higher rate of return for U.S.
dollars makes holding dollars more attractive. Thus, the demand for dollars in the foreign exchange market shifts to
the right, from D0 to D1, while the supply of dollars shifts to the left, from S0 to S1. The new equilibrium (E1) has a
stronger exchange rate than the original equilibrium (E0), but in this example, the equilibrium quantity traded does
not change.

Relative Inflation

If a country experiences a relatively high inflation rate compared with other economies, then the buying power
of its currency is eroding, which will tend to discourage anyone from wanting to acquire or to hold the
currency. Figure 29.8 shows an example based on an actual episode concerning the Mexican peso. In 1986-87,
Mexico experienced an inflation rate of over 200%. Not surprisingly, as inflation dramatically decreased the
peso's purchasing power in Mexico. The peso's exchange rate value declined as well. Figure 29.8 shows that the
demand for the peso on foreign exchange markets decreased from D0 to D1, while the peso's supply increased
from S0 to S1. The equilibrium exchange rate fell from $2.50 per peso at the original equilibrium (E0) to $0.50
per peso at the new equilibrium (E1). In this example, the quantity of pesos traded on foreign exchange
markets remained the same, even as the exchange rate shifted.

FIGURE 29.8 Exchange Rate Markets React to Higher Inflation If a currency is experiencing relatively high inflation,
then its buying power is decreasing and international investors will be less eager to hold it. Thus, a rise in inflation in
the Mexican peso would lead demand to shift from D0 to D1, and supply to increase from S0 to S1. Both movements
712 29 · Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows

       in demand and supply would cause the currency to depreciate. Here, we draw no effect on the quantity traded, but
       in truth it could be an increase or a decrease, depending on the actual movements of demand and supply.

      Purchasing Power Parity

       Over the long term, exchange rates must bear some relationship to the currency's buying power in terms of
       internationally traded goods. If at a certain exchange rate it was much cheaper to buy internationally traded
       goods--such as oil, steel, computers, and cars--in one country than in another country, businesses would start
       buying in the cheap country, selling in other countries, and pocketing the profits.

       For example, if a U.S. dollar is worth $1.30 in Canadian currency, then a car that sells for $20,000 in the United
       States should sell for $26,000 in Canada. If the price of cars in Canada were much lower than $26,000, then at
       least some U.S. car-buyers would convert their U.S. dollars to Canadian dollars and buy their cars in Canada. If
       the price of cars were much higher than $26,000 in this example, then at least some Canadian buyers would
       convert their Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars and go to the United States to purchase their cars. This is known
       as arbitrage, the process of buying and selling goods or currencies across international borders at a profit. It
       may occur slowly, but over time, it will force prices and exchange rates to align so that the price of
       internationally traded goods is similar in all countries.

       We call the exchange rate that equalizes the prices of internationally traded goods across countries the
       purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rate. A group of economists at the International Comparison
       Program, run by the World Bank, have calculated the PPP exchange rate for all countries, based on detailed
       studies of the prices and quantities of internationally tradable goods.

       The purchasing power parity exchange rate has two functions. First, economists often use PPP exchange rates
       for international comparison of GDP and other economic statistics. Imagine that you are preparing a table
       showing the size of GDP in many countries in several recent years, and for ease of comparison, you are
       converting all the values into U.S. dollars. When you insert the value for Japan, you need to use a yen/dollar
       exchange rate. However, should you use the market exchange rate or the PPP exchange rate? Market exchange
       rates bounce around. In 2014, the exchange rate was 105 yen/dollar, but in late 2015 the U.S. dollar exchange
       rate versus the yen was 121 yen/dollar. For simplicity, say that Japan's GDP was ¥500 trillion in both 2014 and
       2015. If you use the market exchange rates, then Japan's GDP will be $4.8 trillion in 2014 (that is, ¥500 trillion
       /(¥105/dollar)) and $4.1 trillion in 2015 (that is, ¥500 trillion /(¥121/dollar)).

       The misleading appearance of a changing Japanese economy occurs only because we used the market
       exchange rate, which often has short-run rises and falls. However, PPP exchange rates stay fairly constant and
       change only modestly, if at all, from year to year.

       The second function of PPP is that exchanges rates will often get closer to it as time passes. It is true that in the
       short and medium run, as exchange rates adjust to relative inflation rates, rates of return, and to expectations
       about how interest rates and inflation will shift, the exchange rates will often move away from the PPP
       exchange rate for a time. However, knowing the PPP will allow you to track and predict exchange rate
       relationships.

A central bank will be concerned about the exchange rate for multiple reasons: (1) Movements in the exchange
rate will affect the quantity of aggregate demand in an economy; (2) frequent substantial fluctuations in the
exchange rate can disrupt international trade and cause problems in a nation's banking system-this may
contribute to an unsustainable balance of trade and large inflows of international financial capital, which can
set up the economy for a deep recession if international investors decide to move their money to another
country. Let's discuss these scenarios in turn.

Exchange Rates, Aggregate Demand, and Aggregate Supply

Foreign trade in goods and services typically involves incurring the costs of production in one currency while
receiving revenues from sales in another currency. As a result, movements in exchange rates can have a
powerful effect on incentives to export and import, and thus on aggregate demand in the economy as a whole.

For example, in 1999, when the euro first became a currency, its value measured in U.S. currency was $1.16/
euro, which dropped to a low of about $0.83/euro in 2000. By the end of 2013, the euro had risen (and the U.S.
dollar had correspondingly weakened) to $1.37/euro. However, by the beginning of 2021, the exchange rate
was down to $1.12/euro. Consider the situation of a French firm that each year incurs 10 million in costs, and
sells its products in the United States for $10 million. At a time in 1999, when this firm converted $10 million
back to euros at the exchange rate of $1.06/euro (that is, $10 million × [1/$1.06]), it received 9.4 million, and
suffered a loss. In 2013, when this same firm converted $10 million back to euros at the exchange rate of
$1.37/euro (that is, $10 million × [1 euro/$1.37]), it received approximately 7.3 million and an even larger
loss. In the beginning of 2021, with the exchange rate back at $1.12/euro the firm would suffer a loss once
again. This example shows how a stronger euro discourages exports by the French firm, because it makes the
costs of production in the domestic currency higher relative to the sales revenues earned in another country.
From the point of view of the U.S. economy, the example also shows how a weaker U.S. dollar encourages
exports.

Since an increase in exports results in more dollars flowing into the economy, and an increase in imports
means more dollars are flowing out, it is easy to conclude that exports are "good" for the economy and imports
are "bad," but this overlooks the role of exchange rates. If an American consumer buys a Japanese car for
$20,000 instead of an American car for $30,000, it may be tempting to argue that the American economy has
lost out. However, the Japanese company will have to convert those dollars to yen to pay its workers and
operate its factories. Whoever buys those dollars will have to use them to purchase American goods and
services, so the money comes right back into the American economy. At the same time, the consumer saves
money by buying a less expensive import, and can use the extra money for other purposes.

Fluctuations in Exchange Rates

Exchange rates can fluctuate a great deal in the short run. As yet one more example, the Indian rupee moved
from 39 rupees/dollar in February 2008 to 51 rupees/dollar in March 2009, a decline of more than one-fourth
in the value of the rupee on foreign exchange markets. Figure 29.9 earlier showed that even two economically
developed neighboring economies like the United States and Canada can see significant movements in
exchange rates over a few years. For firms that depend on export sales, or firms that rely on imported inputs to
production, or even purely domestic firms that compete with firms tied into international trade--which in
many countries adds up to half or more of a nation's GDP--sharp movements in exchange rates can lead to
dramatic changes in profits and losses. A central bank may desire to keep exchange rates from moving too
much as part of providing a stable business climate, where firms can focus on productivity and innovation, not
on reacting to exchange rate fluctuations.

One of the most economically destructive effects of exchange rate fluctuations can happen through the
banking system. Financial institutions measure most international loans are measured in a few large
currencies, like U.S. dollars, European euros, and Japanese yen. In countries that do not use these currencies,
banks often borrow funds in the currencies of other countries, like U.S. dollars, but then lend in their own
714 29 · Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows

       domestic currency. The left-hand chain of events in Figure 29.9 shows how this pattern of international
       borrowing can work. A bank in Thailand borrows one million in U.S. dollars. Then the bank converts the
       dollars to its domestic currency--in the case of Thailand, the currency is the baht--at a rate of 40 baht/dollar.
       The bank then lends the baht to a firm in Thailand. The business repays the loan in baht, and the bank
       converts it back to U.S. dollars to pay off its original U.S. dollar loan.

       FIGURE 29.9 International Borrowing The scenario of international borrowing that ends on the left is a success
       story, but the scenario that ends on the right shows what happens when the exchange rate weakens.
       This process of borrowing in a foreign currency and lending in a domestic currency can work just fine, as long
       as the exchange rate does not shift. In the scenario outlined, if the dollar strengthens and the baht weakens, a
       problem arises. The right-hand chain of events in Figure 29.9 illustrates what happens when the baht
       unexpectedly weakens from 40 baht/dollar to 50 baht/dollar. The Thai firm still repays the loan in full to the
       bank. However, because of the shift in the exchange rate, the bank cannot repay its loan in U.S. dollars. (Of
       course, if the exchange rate had changed in the other direction, making the Thai currency stronger, the bank
       could have realized an unexpectedly large profit.)
       In 1997-1998, countries across eastern Asia, like Thailand, Korea, Malaysia, and Indonesia, experienced a
       sharp depreciation of their currencies, in some cases 50% or more. These countries had been experiencing
       substantial inflows of foreign investment capital, with bank lending increasing by 20% to 30% per year
       through the mid-1990s. When their exchange rates depreciated, the banking systems in these countries were
       bankrupt. Argentina experienced a similar chain of events in 2002. When the Argentine peso depreciated,

Argentina's banks found themselves unable to pay back what they had borrowed in U.S. dollars.
Banks play a vital role in any economy in facilitating transactions and in making loans to firms and consumers.
When most of a country's largest banks become bankrupt simultaneously, a sharp decline in aggregate
demand and a deep recession results. Since the main responsibilities of a central bank are to control the
money supply and to ensure that the banking system is stable, a central bank must be concerned about
whether large and unexpected exchange rate depreciation will drive most of the country's existing banks into
bankruptcy. For more on this concern, return to the chapter on The International Trade and Capital Flows.

Summing Up Public Policy and Exchange Rates

Every nation would prefer a stable exchange rate to facilitate international trade and reduce the degree of risk
and uncertainty in the economy. However, a nation may sometimes want a weaker exchange rate to stimulate
aggregate demand and reduce a recession, or a stronger exchange rate to fight inflation. The country must also
be concerned that rapid movements from a weak to a strong exchange rate may hurt its export industries,
while rapid movements from a strong to a weak exchange rate can hurt its banking sector. In short, every
choice of an exchange rate--whether it should be stronger or weaker, or fixed or changing--represents
potential tradeoffs.

29.4 Exchange Rate Policies

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Differentiate among a floating exchange rate, a soft peg, a hard peg, and a merged currency
  · Identify the tradeoffs that come with a floating exchange rate, a soft peg, a hard peg, and a merged

      currency
Exchange rate policies come in a range of different forms listed in Figure 29.10: let the foreign exchange
market determine the exchange rate; let the market set the value of the exchange rate most of the time, but
have the central bank sometimes intervene to prevent fluctuations that seem too large; have the central bank
guarantee a specific exchange rate; or share a currency with other countries. Let's discuss each type of
exchange rate policy and its tradeoffs.

FIGURE 29.10 A Spectrum of Exchange Rate Policies A nation may adopt one of a variety of exchange rate regimes,
from floating rates in which the foreign exchange market determines the rates to pegged rates where governments
intervene to manage the exchange rate's value, to a common currency where the nation adopts another country or
group of countries' currency.

Floating Exchange Rates

We refer to a policy which allows the foreign exchange market to set exchange rates as a floating exchange
rate. The U.S. dollar is a floating exchange rate, as are the currencies of about 40% of the countries in the world
economy. The major concern with this policy is that exchange rates can move a great deal in a short time.
Consider the U.S. exchange rate expressed in terms of another fairly stable currency, the Japanese yen, as
Figure 29.11 shows. On January 1, 2002, the exchange rate was 133 yen/dollar. On January 1, 2005, it was 103
yen/dollar. On June 1, 2007, it was 122 yen/dollar, on January 1, 2012, it was 77 yen per dollar, and on March 1,
2015, it was 120 yen per dollar. Since 2015, it has dropped again; by the end of December 2020, the exchange
716 29 · Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows

       rate stood at 103 yen per dollar. As investor sentiment swings back and forth, driving exchange rates up and
       down, exporters, importers, and banks involved in international lending are all affected. At worst, large
       movements in exchange rates can drive companies into bankruptcy or trigger a nationwide banking collapse.
       However, even in the moderate case of the yen/dollar exchange rate, these movements of roughly 30 percent
       back and forth impose stress on both economies as firms must alter their export and import plans to take the
       new exchange rates into account. Especially in smaller countries where international trade is a relatively large
       share of GDP, exchange rate movements can rattle their economies.

       FIGURE 29.11 U.S. Dollar Exchange Rate in Japanese Yen Even seemingly stable exchange rates such as the
       Japanese Yen to the U.S. Dollar can vary when closely examined over time. This figure shows a relatively stable rate
       between 2000 and 2007 of over 25%. Beginning in 2007 until 2012, there was a significant appreciation of the Yen
       (relative to the U.S. Dollar) by about 14% and again at the end of the year in 2014 also by about 14%. Since then,
       between 2016 and 2020 there was an appreciation of about 13% from 118 yen per dollar to 103 yen per dollar.
       (Source: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/DEXJPUS)
       However, movements of floating exchange rates have advantages, too. After all, prices of goods and services
       rise and fall throughout a market economy, as demand and supply shift. If an economy experiences strong
       inflows or outflows of international financial capital, or has relatively high inflation, or if it experiences strong
       productivity growth so that purchasing power changes relative to other economies, then it makes economic
       sense for the exchange rate to shift as well.
       Floating exchange rate advocates often argue that if government policies were more predictable and stable,
       then inflation rates and interest rates would be more predictable and stable. Exchange rates would bounce
       around less, too. The economist Milton Friedman (1912-2006), for example, wrote a defense of floating
       exchange rates in 1962 in his book Capitalism and Freedom:

             Being in favor of floating exchange rates does not mean being in favor of unstable exchange rates.
             When we support a free price system [for goods and services] at home, this does not imply that we
             favor a system in which prices fluctuate wildly up and down. What we want is a system in which prices
             are free to fluctuate but in which the forces determining them are sufficiently stable so that in fact
             prices move within moderate ranges. This is equally true in a system of floating exchange rates. The
             ultimate objective is a world in which exchange rates, while free to vary, are, in fact, highly stable
             because basic economic policies and conditions are stable.
       Advocates of floating exchange rates admit that, yes, exchange rates may sometimes fluctuate. They point out,
       however, that if a central bank focuses on preventing either high inflation or deep recession, with low and
       reasonably steady interest rates, then exchange rates will have less reason to vary.

Using Soft Pegs and Hard Pegs

When a government intervenes in the foreign exchange market so that the currency's exchange rate is
different from what the market would have produced, it establishes a "peg" for its currency. A soft peg is the
name for an exchange rate policy where the government usually allows the market to set exchange rate, but in
some cases, especially if the exchange rate seems to be moving rapidly in one direction, the central bank will
intervene in the market. With a hard peg exchange rate policy, the central bank sets a fixed and unchanging
value for the exchange rate. A central bank can implement soft peg and hard peg policies.
Suppose the market exchange rate for the Brazilian currency, the real, would be 35 cents/real with a daily
quantity of 15 billion real traded in the market, as the equilibrium E0 in Figure 29.12 (a) and Figure 29.12 (b)
show. However, Brazil's government decides that the exchange rate should be 30 cents/real, as Figure 29.12 (a)
shows. Perhaps Brazil sets this lower exchange rate to benefit its export industries. Perhaps it is an attempt to
stimulate aggregate demand by stimulating exports. Perhaps Brazil believes that the current market exchange
rate is higher than the long-term purchasing power parity value of the real, so it is minimizing fluctuations in
the real by keeping it at this lower rate. Perhaps the government set the target exchange rate sometime in the
past, and it is now maintaining it for the sake of stability. Whatever the reason, if Brazil's central bank wishes to
keep the exchange rate below the market level, it must face the reality that at this weaker exchange rate of 30
cents/real, the quantity demanded of its currency at 17 billion reals is greater than the quantity supplied of 13
billion reals in the foreign exchange market.

FIGURE 29.12 Pegging an Exchange Rate (a) If an exchange rate is pegged below what would otherwise be the
equilibrium, then the currency's quantity demanded will exceed the quantity supplied. (b) If an exchange rate is
pegged above what would otherwise be the equilibrium, then the currency's quantity supplied exceeds the quantity
demanded.
The Brazilian central bank could weaken its exchange rate in two ways. One approach is to use an
expansionary monetary policy that leads to lower interest rates. In foreign exchange markets, the lower
interest rates will reduce demand and increase supply of the real and lead to depreciation. Central banks do
not use this technique often because lowering interest rates to weaken the currency may be in conflict with the
country's monetary policy goals. Alternatively, Brazil's central bank could trade directly in the foreign
exchange market. The central bank can expand the money supply by creating reals, use the reals to purchase
foreign currencies, and avoid selling any of its own currency. In this way, it can fill the gap between quantity
demanded and quantity supplied of its currency.
Figure 29.12 (b) shows the opposite situation. Here, the Brazilian government desires a stronger exchange rate
of 40 cents/real than the market rate of 35 cents/real. Perhaps Brazil desires the stronger currency to reduce
aggregate demand and to fight inflation, or perhaps Brazil believes that that current market exchange rate is
718 29 · Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows

       temporarily lower than the long-term rate. Whatever the reason, at the higher desired exchange rate, the
       quantity supplied of 16 billion reals exceeds the quantity demanded of 14 billion reals.

       Brazil's central bank can use a contractionary monetary policy to raise interest rates, which will increase
       demand and reduce currency supply on foreign exchange markets, and lead to an appreciation. Alternatively,
       Brazil's central bank can trade directly in the foreign exchange market. In this case, with an excess supply of its
       own currency in foreign exchange markets, the central bank must use reserves of foreign currency, like U.S.
       dollars, to demand its own currency and thus cause an appreciation of its exchange rate.

       Both a soft peg and a hard peg policy require that the central bank intervene in the foreign exchange market.
       However, a hard peg policy attempts to preserve a fixed exchange rate at all times. A soft peg policy typically
       allows the exchange rate to move up and down by relatively small amounts in the short run of several months
       or a year, and to move by larger amounts over time, but seeks to avoid extreme short-term fluctuations.

      Tradeoffs of Soft Pegs and Hard Pegs

       When a country decides to alter the market exchange rate, it faces a number of tradeoffs. If it uses monetary
       policy to alter the exchange rate, it then cannot at the same time use monetary policy to address issues of
       inflation or recession. If it uses direct purchases and sales of foreign currencies in exchange rates, then it must
       face the issue of how it will handle its reserves of foreign currency. Finally, a pegged exchange rate can even
       create additional movements of the exchange rate. For example, even the possibility of government
       intervention in exchange rate markets will lead to rumors about whether and when the government will
       intervene, and dealers in the foreign exchange market will react to those rumors. Let's consider these issues in
       turn.

       One concern with pegged exchange rate policies is that they imply a country's monetary policy is no longer
       focused on controlling inflation or shortening recessions, but now must also take the exchange rate into
       account. For example, when a country pegs its exchange rate, it will sometimes face economic situations where
       it would like to have an expansionary monetary policy to fight recession--but it cannot do so because that
       policy would depreciate its exchange rate and break its hard peg. With a soft peg exchange rate policy, the
       central bank can sometimes ignore the exchange rate and focus on domestic inflation or recession--but in
       other cases the central bank may ignore inflation or recession and instead focus on its soft peg exchange rate.
       With a hard peg policy, domestic monetary policy is effectively no longer determined by domestic inflation or
       unemployment, but only by what monetary policy is needed to keep the exchange rate at the hard peg.

       Another issue arises when a central bank intervenes directly in the exchange rate market. If a central bank
       ends up in a situation where it is perpetually creating and selling its own currency on foreign exchange
       markets, it will be buying the currency of other countries, like U.S. dollars or euros, to hold as reserves. Holding
       large reserves of other currencies has an opportunity cost, and central banks will not wish to boost such
       reserves without limit.

       In addition, a central bank that causes a large increase in the supply of money is also risking an inflationary
       surge in aggregate demand. Conversely, when a central bank wishes to buy its own currency, it can do so by
       using its reserves of international currency like the U.S. dollar or the euro. However, if the central bank runs
       out of such reserves, it can no longer use this method to strengthen its currency. Thus, buying foreign
       currencies in exchange rate markets can be expensive and inflationary, while selling foreign currencies can
       work only until a central bank runs out of reserves.

       Yet another issue is that when a government pegs its exchange rate, it may unintentionally create another
       reason for additional fluctuation. With a soft peg policy, foreign exchange dealers and international investors
       react to every rumor about how or when the central bank is likely to intervene to influence the exchange rate,
       and as they react to rumors the exchange rate will shift up and down. Thus, even though the goal of a soft peg
       policy is to reduce short-term fluctuations of the exchange rate, the existence of the policy--when anticipated
       in the foreign exchange market--may sometimes increase short-term fluctuations as international investors

try to anticipate how and when the central bank will act. The following Clear It Up feature discusses the effects
of international capital flows--capital that flows across national boundaries as either portfolio investment or
direct investment.

         CLEAR IT UP

How do Tobin taxes control the flow of capital?

Some countries like Chile and Malaysia have sought to reduce movements in exchange rates by limiting international
financial capital inflows and outflows. The government can enact this policy either through targeted taxes or by
regulations.

Taxes on international capital flows are sometimes known as Tobin taxes, named after James Tobin, the 1981
Nobel laureate in economics who proposed such a tax in a 1972 lecture. For example, a government might tax all
foreign exchange transactions, or attempt to tax short-term portfolio investment while exempting long-term foreign
direct investment. Countries can also use regulation to forbid certain kinds of foreign investment in the first place or
to make it difficult for international financial investors to withdraw their funds from a country.

The goal of such policies is to reduce international capital flows, especially short-term portfolio flows, in the hope
that doing so will reduce the chance of large movements in exchange rates that can bring macroeconomic disaster.

However, proposals to limit international financial flows have severe practical difficulties. National governments
impose taxes, not international ones. If one government imposes a Tobin tax on exchange rate transactions carried
out within its territory, a firm based someplace like the Grand Caymans, an island nation in the Caribbean well-
known for allowing some financial wheeling and dealing might easily operate the exchange rate market. In an
interconnected global economy, if goods and services are allowed to flow across national borders, then payments
need to flow across borders, too. It is very difficult--in fact close to impossible--for a nation to allow only the flows
of payments that relate to goods and services, while clamping down or taxing other flows of financial capital. If a
nation participates in international trade, it must also participate in international capital movements.

Finally, countries all over the world, especially low-income countries, are crying out for foreign investment to help
develop their economies. Policies that discourage international financial investment may prevent some possible
harm, but they rule out potentially substantial economic benefits as well.

A hard peg exchange rate policy will not allow short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate. If the government
first announces a hard peg and then later changes its mind--perhaps the government becomes unwilling to
keep interest rates high or to hold high levels of foreign exchange reserves--then the result of abandoning a
hard peg could be a dramatic shift in the exchange rate.

In the mid-2000s, about one-third of the countries in the world used a soft peg approach and about one-
quarter used a hard peg approach. The general trend in the 1990s was to shift away from a soft peg approach
in favor of either floating rates or a hard peg. The concern is that a successful soft peg policy may, for a time,
lead to very little variation in exchange rates, so that firms and banks in the economy begin to act as if a hard
peg exists. When the exchange rate does move, the effects are especially painful because firms and banks have
not planned and hedged against a possible change. Thus, the argument went, it is better either to be clear that
the exchange rate is always flexible, or that it is fixed, but choosing an in-between soft peg option may end up
being worst of all.

A Merged Currency

A final approach to exchange rate policy is for a nation to choose a common currency shared with one or more
nations is also called a merged currency. A merged currency approach eliminates foreign exchange risk
altogether. Just as no one worries about exchange rate movements when buying and selling between New York
and California, Europeans know that the value of the euro will be the same in Germany and France and other
720 29 · Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows

European nations that have adopted the euro.

However, a merged currency also poses problems. Like a hard peg, a merged currency means that a nation has
given up altogether on domestic monetary policy, and instead has put its interest rate policies in other hands.
When Ecuador uses the U.S. dollar as its currency, it has no voice in whether the Federal Reserve raises or
lowers interest rates. The European Central Bank that determines monetary policy for the euro has
representatives from all the euro nations. However, from the standpoint of, say, Portugal, there will be times
when the decisions of the European Central Bank about monetary policy do not match the decisions that a
Portuguese central bank would have made.

The lines between these four different exchange rate policies can blend into each other. For example, a soft peg
exchange rate policy in which the government almost never acts to intervene in the exchange rate market will
look a great deal like a floating exchange rate. Conversely, a soft peg policy in which the government intervenes
often to keep the exchange rate near a specific level will look a lot like a hard peg. A decision to merge
currencies with another country is, in effect, a decision to have a permanently fixed exchange rate with those
countries, which is like a very hard exchange rate peg. Table 29.3 summarizes the range of exchange rates
policy choices, with their advantages and disadvantages.

Global macroeconomics would be easier if the whole world had one currency and one central bank. The
exchange rates between different currencies complicate the picture. If financial markets solely set exchange
rates, they fluctuate substantially as short-term portfolio investors try to anticipate tomorrow's news. If the
government attempts to intervene in exchange rate markets through soft pegs or hard pegs, it gives up at least
some of the power to use monetary policy to focus on domestic inflations and recessions, and it risks causing
even greater fluctuations in foreign exchange markets.

There is no consensus among economists about which exchange rate policies are best: floating, soft peg, hard
peg, or merged currencies. The choice depends both on how well a nation's central bank can implement a
specific exchange rate policy and on how well a nation's firms and banks can adapt to different exchange rate
policies. A national economy that does a fairly good job at achieving the four main economic goals of growth,
low inflation, low unemployment, and a sustainable balance of trade will probably do just fine most of the time
with any exchange rate policy. Conversely, no exchange rate policy is likely to save an economy that
consistently fails at achieving these goals. Alternatively, a merged currency applied across wide geographic
and cultural areas carries with it its own set of problems, such as the ability for countries to conduct their own
independent monetary policies.

Is a Stronger Dollar Good for the U.S. Economy?

The foreign exchange value of the dollar is a price and whether a higher price is good or bad depends on where you
are standing: sellers benefit from higher prices and buyers are harmed. A stronger dollar is good for U.S. imports
(and people working for U.S. importers) and U.S. investment abroad. It is also good for U.S. tourists going to other
countries, since their dollar goes further. However, a stronger dollar is bad for U.S. exports (and people working in
U.S. export industries); it is bad for foreign investment in the United States (leading, for example, to higher U.S.
interest rates); and it is bad for foreign tourists (as well as U.S hotels, restaurants, and others in the tourist industry).
In short, whether the U.S. dollar is good or bad is a more complex question than you may have thought. The
economic answer is "it depends."

Key Concepts and Summary

29.1 How the Foreign Exchange Market Works

In the foreign exchange market, people and firms exchange one currency to purchase another currency. The
demand for dollars comes from those U.S. export firms seeking to convert their earnings in foreign currency
back into U.S. dollars; foreign tourists converting their earnings in a foreign currency back into U.S. dollars;
and foreign investors seeking to make financial investments in the U.S. economy. On the supply side of the
foreign exchange market for the trading of U.S. dollars are foreign firms that have sold imports in the U.S.
economy and are seeking to convert their earnings back to their home currency; U.S. tourists abroad; and U.S.
investors seeking to make financial investments in foreign economies. When currency A can buy more of
currency B, then currency A has strengthened or appreciated relative to B. When currency A can buy less of
currency B, then currency A has weakened or depreciated relative to B. If currency A strengthens or
appreciates relative to currency B, then currency B must necessarily weaken or depreciate with regard to
currency A. A stronger currency benefits those who are buying with that currency and injures those who are
selling. A weaker currency injures those, like importers, who are buying with that currency and benefits those
who are selling with it, like exporters.

29.2 Demand and Supply Shifts in Foreign Exchange Markets

In the extreme short run, ranging from a few minutes to a few weeks, speculators who are trying to invest in
currencies that will grow stronger, and to sell currencies that will grow weaker influence exchange rates. Such
speculation can create a self-fulfilling prophecy, at least for a time, where an expected appreciation leads to a
stronger currency and vice versa. In the relatively short run, differences in rates of return influence exchange
rate markets. Countries with relatively high real rates of return (for example, high interest rates) will tend to
experience stronger currencies as they attract money from abroad, while countries with relatively low rates of
return will tend to experience weaker exchange rates as investors convert to other currencies.

                                                                                                                                               29 · Self-Check Questions 723

In the medium run of a few months or a few years, inflation rates influence exchange rate markets. Countries
with relatively high inflation will tend to experience less demand for their currency than countries with lower
inflation, and thus currency depreciation. Over long periods of many years, exchange rates tend to adjust
toward the purchasing power parity (PPP) rate, which is the exchange rate such that the prices of
internationally tradable goods in different countries, when converted at the PPP exchange rate to a common
currency, are similar in all economies.

29.3 Macroeconomic Effects of Exchange Rates

A central bank will be concerned about the exchange rate for several reasons. Exchange rates will affect
imports and exports, and thus affect aggregate demand in the economy. Fluctuations in exchange rates may
cause difficulties for many firms, but especially banks. The exchange rate may accompany unsustainable flows
of international financial capital.

29.4 Exchange Rate Policies

In a fixed exchange rate policy, a government determines its country's exchange rate in the foreign exchange
market. In a soft peg exchange rate policy, the foreign exchange market usually determines a country's
exchange rate, but the government sometimes intervenes to strengthen or weaken it. In a hard peg exchange
rate policy, the government chooses an exchange rate. A central bank can intervene in exchange markets in
two ways. It can raise or lower interest rates to make the currency stronger or weaker. It also can directly
purchase or sell its currency in foreign exchange markets. All exchange rates policies face tradeoffs. A hard
peg exchange rate policy will reduce exchange rate fluctuations, but means that a country must focus its
monetary policy on the exchange rate, not on fighting recession or controlling inflation. When a nation merges
its currency with another nation, it gives up on nationally oriented monetary policy altogether.

A soft peg exchange rate may create additional volatility as exchange rate markets try to anticipate when and
how the government will intervene. A flexible exchange rate policy allows monetary policy to focus on inflation
and unemployment, and allows the exchange rate to change with inflation and rates of return, but also raises a
risk that exchange rates may sometimes make large and abrupt movements. The spectrum of exchange rate
policies includes: (a) a floating exchange rate, (b) a pegged exchange rate, soft or hard, and (c) a merged
currency. Monetary policy can focus on a variety of goals: (a) inflation; (b) inflation or unemployment,
depending on which is the most dangerous obstacle; and (c) a long-term rule based policy designed to keep the
money supply stable and predictable.

No Yellowstone Park?

You had trekked all the way to see Yellowstone National Park in the beautiful month of October 2013, only to find
it... closed. Closed! Why?
For two weeks in October 2013, the U.S. federal government shut down. Many federal services, like the national
parks, closed and 800,000 federal employees were furloughed. Tourists were shocked and so was the rest of the
world: Congress and the President could not agree on a budget. Inside the Capitol, Republicans and Democrats
728 30 · Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy

       argued about spending priorities and whether to increase the national debt limit. Each year's budget, which is over
       $3 trillion of spending, must be approved by Congress and signed by the President. Two thirds of the budget are
       entitlements and other mandatory spending which occur without congressional or presidential action once the
       programs are established. Tied to the budget debate was the issue of increasing the debt ceiling--how high the U.S.
       government's national debt can be. The House of Representatives refused to sign on to the bills to fund the
       government unless they included provisions to stop or change the Affordable Health Care Act (more colloquially
       known as Obamacare). As the days progressed, the United States came very close to defaulting on its debt.

       October 2013 was not the first time the government shut down, and it was not the last. Several brief shutdowns
       occurred in the early 1980s, and they occurred periodically in the following years. The longest shutdown took place
       between December 2018 and January 2019, when funding a border wall was a core disagreement.

       Why does the federal budget create such intense debates? What would happen if the United States actually
       defaulted on its debt? In this chapter, we will examine the federal budget, taxation, and fiscal policy. We will also
       look at the annual federal budget deficits and the national debt.

       All levels of government--federal, state, and local--have budgets that show how much revenue the government
       expects to receive in taxes and other income and how the government plans to spend it. Budgets, however, can
       shift dramatically within a few years, as policy decisions and unexpected events disrupt earlier tax and
       spending plans.

       In this chapter, we revisit fiscal policy, which we first covered in Welcome to Economics! Fiscal policy is one of
       two policy tools for fine tuning the economy (the other is monetary policy). While policymakers at the Federal
       Reserve make monetary policy, Congress and the President make fiscal policy.

       The discussion of fiscal policy focuses on how federal government taxing and spending affects aggregate
       demand. All government spending and taxes affect the economy, but fiscal policy focuses strictly on federal
       government policies. We begin with an overview of U.S. government spending and taxes. We then discuss fiscal
       policy from a short-run perspective; that is, how government uses tax and spending policies to address
       recession, unemployment, and inflation; how periods of recession and growth affect government budgets; and
       the merits of balanced budget proposals.

     30.1 Government Spending

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Identify U.S. budget deficit and surplus trends over the past five decades
         · Explain the differences between the U.S. federal budget, and state and local budgets

       Government spending covers a range of services that the federal, state, and local governments provide. When
       the federal government spends more money than it receives in taxes in a given year, it runs a budget deficit.
       Conversely, when the government receives more money in taxes than it spends in a year, it runs a budget
       surplus. If government spending and taxes are equal, it has a balanced budget. For example, in 2020, the U.S.
       government experienced its largest budget deficit ever, as the federal government spent $3.1 trillion more than
       it collected in taxes. This deficit was about 15% of the size of the U.S. GDP in 2020, making it by far the largest
       budget deficit relative to GDP since the mammoth borrowing the government used to finance World War II. To
       put it into perspective, the previous record deficits were experienced during the Great Recession of
       2007-2009, when the deficit reached 9.6% of GDP.

       This section presents an overview of government spending in the United States.

      Total U.S. Government Spending

       Federal spending in nominal dollars (that is, dollars not adjusted for inflation) has grown by a multiple of more

than 38 over the last four decades, from $93.4 billion in 1960 to $6.8 trillion in 2020. Comparing spending over
time in nominal dollars is misleading because it does not take into account inflation or growth in population
and the real economy. A more useful method of comparison is to examine government spending as a percent
of GDP over time.
The top line in Figure 30.2 shows the federal spending level since 1960, expressed as a share of GDP. Despite a
widespread sense among many Americans that the federal government has been growing steadily larger, the
graph shows that federal spending has hovered in a range from 18% to 22% of GDP most of the time since
1960. For example, throughout the latter part of the 2010s, government expenditures were around 20% of GDP.
The other lines in Figure 30.2 show the major federal spending categories: national defense, Social Security,
health programs, and interest payments. From the graph, we see that national defense spending as a share of
GDP has generally declined since the 1960s, although there were some upward bumps in the 1980s buildup
under President Ronald Reagan and in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. In
contrast, Social Security and healthcare have grown steadily as a percent of GDP. Healthcare expenditures
include both payments for senior citizens (Medicare), and payments for low-income Americans (Medicaid).
State governments also partially fund Medicaid. Interest payments are the final main category of government
spending in Figure 30.2.

FIGURE 30.2 Federal Spending, 1960-2020 Since 1960, total federal spending has ranged from about 18% to 22%
of GDP. It climbed above that level in 2009, quickly dropped back down to that level by 2013, and again climbed
above that level in 2020. The share that the government has spent on national defense has generally declined, while
the share it has spent on Social Security and on healthcare expenses (mainly Medicare and Medicaid) has increased.
(Source: Economic Report of the President, 2021, Table B47, https://www.govinfo.gov/app/collection/erp/2021)
Each year, the government borrows funds from U.S. citizens and foreigners to cover its budget deficits. It does
this by selling securities (Treasury bonds, notes, and bills)--in essence borrowing from the public and
promising to repay with interest in the future. From 1961 to 1997, the U.S. government has run budget deficits,
and thus borrowed funds, in almost every year. It had budget surpluses from 1998 to 2001, and then returned
to deficits.
The interest payments on past federal government borrowing were typically 1-2% of GDP in the 1960s and
1970s but then climbed above 3% of GDP in the 1980s and stayed there until the late 1990s. The government
was able to repay some of its past borrowing by running surpluses from 1998 to 2001 and, with help from low
interest rates, the interest payments on past federal government borrowing had fallen back to 1.6% of GDP by
2020.
We investigate the government borrowing and debt patterns in more detail later in this chapter, but first we
730 30 · Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy

       need to clarify the difference between the deficit and the debt. The deficit is not the debt. The difference
       between the deficit and the debt lies in the time frame. The government deficit (or surplus) refers to what
       happens with the federal government budget each year. The government debt is accumulated over time. It is
       the sum of all past deficits and surpluses. If you borrow $10,000 per year for each of the four years of college,
       you might say that your annual deficit was $10,000, but your accumulated debt over the four years is $40,000.
       These four categories--national defense, Social Security, healthcare, and interest payments--generally account
       for roughly 60% of all federal spending, as Figure 30.3 shows. (Due to the large amount of one-time
       expenditures by the federal government in 2020 due to the pandemic, the 2019 statistics are presented here.)
       The remaining 40% wedge of the pie chart covers all other categories of federal government spending:
       international affairs; science and technology; natural resources and the environment; transportation; housing;
       education; income support for people in poverty; community and regional development; law enforcement and
       the judicial system; and the administrative costs of running the government.

       FIGURE 30.3 Slices of Federal Spending, 2019 About 60% of government spending goes to four major areas:
       national defense, Social Security, healthcare, and interest payments on past borrowing. This leaves about 40% of
       federal spending for all other functions of the U.S. government. (Source: https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/
       Historicals/)

      State and Local Government Spending

       Although federal government spending often gets most of the media attention, state and local government
       spending is also substantial--at about $3.3 trillion in 2021. Figure 30.4 shows that state and local government
       spending has increased during the last four decades from around 8% to around 14% today. The single biggest
       item is education, which accounts for about one-third of the total. The rest covers programs like highways,
       libraries, hospitals and healthcare, parks, and police and fire protection. Unlike the federal government, all
       states (except Vermont) have balanced budget laws, which means any gaps between revenues and spending
       must be closed by higher taxes, lower spending, drawing down their previous savings, or some combination of
       all of these.

FIGURE 30.4 State and Local Spending, 1960-2020 Spending by state and local government increased from about
10% of GDP in the early 1960s to 14-16% by the mid-1970s. It has remained at roughly that level since. The single
biggest spending item is education, including both K-12 spending and support for public colleges and universities,
which has been about 4-5% of GDP in recent decades. Source: (Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis,
https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/index_nipa.cfm.)
U.S. presidential candidates often run for office pledging to improve the public schools or to get tough on
crime. However, in the U.S. government system, these tasks are primarily state and local government
responsibilities. In fiscal year 2020 state and local governments spent about $970 billion per year on education
(including K-12 and college and university education), compared to only $100 billion by the federal
government. In other words, about 90 cents of every dollar spent on education happens at the state and local
level. A politician who really wants hands-on responsibility for reforming education or reducing crime might
do better to run for mayor of a large city or for state governor rather than for president of the United States.
Taxes are paid by most, but not all, people who work. Even if you are part of the so-called "1099" or "gig"
economy, you are considered an independent contractor and must pay taxes on the income you earn in those
occupations. Taxes are also paid by consumers whenever they purchase goods and services. Taxes are used for
all sorts of spending--from roads, to bridges, to schools (K-12 and public higher education), to police and other
public safety functions. Taxes fund vital public services that support our communities.

30.2 Taxation

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Differentiate among a regressive tax, a proportional tax, and a progressive tax
  · Identify major revenue sources for the U.S. federal budget
There are two main categories of taxes: those that the federal government collects and those that the state and
local governments collect. What percentage the government collects and for what it uses that revenue varies
greatly. The following sections will briefly explain the taxation system in the United States.

      Federal Taxes

       Just as many Americans erroneously think that federal spending has grown considerably, many also believe
       that taxes have increased substantially. The top line of Figure 30.5 shows total federal taxes as a share of GDP
       since 1960. Although the line rises and falls, it typically remains within the range of 17% to 20% of GDP, except
       for 2009-2011, when taxes fell substantially below this level, due to the Great Recession.

       FIGURE 30.5 Federal Taxes, 1960-2020 Federal tax revenues have been about 17-20% of GDP during most
       periods in recent decades. The primary sources of federal taxes are individual income taxes and the payroll taxes
       that finance Social Security and Medicare. Corporate income taxes and social insurance taxes provide smaller
       shares of revenue. (Source: Economic Report of the President, 2021. Table B-47, https://www.govinfo.gov/app/
       collection/erp/2021)
       Figure 30.5 also shows the taxation patterns for the main categories that the federal government taxes:
       individual income taxes, corporate income taxes, and social insurance and retirement receipts. When most
       people think of federal government taxes, the first tax that comes to mind is the individual income tax that is
       due every year on April 15 (or the first business day after). The personal income tax is the largest single source
       of federal government revenue, but it still represents less than half of federal tax revenue.
       The second largest source of federal revenue is the payroll tax (captured in social insurance and retirement
       receipts), which provides funds for Social Security and Medicare. Payroll taxes have increased steadily over
       time. Together, the personal income tax and the payroll tax accounted for over 85% of federal tax revenues in
       2020. Although personal income tax revenues account for more total revenue than the payroll tax, nearly
       three-quarters of households pay more in payroll taxes than in income taxes.
       The income tax is a progressive tax, which means that the tax rates increase as a household's income
       increases. Taxes also vary with marital status, family size, and other factors. The marginal tax rates (the tax
       due on all yearly income) for a single taxpayer range from 10% to 35%, depending on income, as the following
       Clear It Up feature explains.

                CLEAR IT UP
      How does the marginal rate work?

       Suppose that a single taxpayer's income is $35,000 per year. Also suppose that income from $0 to $9,075 is taxed
       at 10%, income from $9,075 to $36,900 is taxed at 15%, and, finally, income from $36,900 and beyond is taxed at
       25%. Since this person earns $35,000, their marginal tax rate is 15%.

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                                                                       30.2 · Taxation 733

The key fact here is that the federal income tax is designed so that tax rates increase as income increases, up to
a certain level. The payroll taxes that support Social Security and Medicare are designed in a different way.
First, the payroll taxes for Social Security are imposed at a rate of 12.4% up to a certain wage limit, set at
$137,700 in 2020. Medicare, on the other hand, pays for elderly healthcare, and is fixed at 2.9%, with no upper
ceiling.

In both cases, the employer and the employee split the payroll taxes. An employee only sees 6.2% deducted
from their paycheck for Social Security, and 1.45% from Medicare. However, as economists are quick to point
out, the employer's half of the taxes are probably passed along to the employees in the form of lower wages, so
in reality, the worker pays all of the payroll taxes. If you are a member of the "gig economy" and receive a 1099
tax statement, then you are considered an independent contractor and so you must pay the employee and
employer side of the payroll tax.

We also call the Medicare payroll tax a proportional tax; that is, a flat percentage of all wages earned. The
Social Security payroll tax is proportional up to the wage limit, but above that level it becomes a regressive
tax, meaning that people with higher incomes pay a smaller share of their income in tax.

The third-largest source of federal tax revenue, as Figure 30.5 shows is the corporate income tax. The
common name for corporate income is "profits." Over time, corporate income tax receipts have declined as a
share of GDP, from about 4% in the 1960s to an average of 1% to 2% of GDP in the past 40 years.

The federal government has a few other, smaller sources of revenue. It imposes an excise tax--that is, a tax on
a particular good--on gasoline, tobacco, and alcohol. As a share of GDP, the amount the government collects
from these taxes has stayed nearly constant over time, from about 2% of GDP in the 1960s to roughly 3% by
2020, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The government also imposes an estate and
gift tax on people who pass large amounts of assets to the next generation--either after death or during life in
the form of gifts. These estate and gift taxes collected about 0.2% of GDP in 2020. By a quirk of legislation, the
government repealed the estate and gift tax in 2010, but reinstated it in 2011. Other federal taxes, which are
also relatively small in magnitude, include tariffs the government collects on imported goods and charges for
inspections of goods entering the country.

State and Local Taxes

At the state and local level, taxes have been rising as a share of GDP over the last few decades to match the
gradual rise in spending, as Figure 30.6 illustrates. The main revenue sources for state and local governments
are sales taxes, property taxes, and revenue passed along from the federal government, but many state and
local governments also levy personal and corporate income taxes, as well as impose a wide variety of fees and
charges. The specific sources of tax revenue vary widely across state and local governments. Some states rely
more on property taxes, some on sales taxes, some on income taxes, and some more on revenues from the
federal government.

     30.3 Federal Deficits and the National Debt

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain the U.S. federal budget in terms of annual debt and accumulated debt
         · Understand how economic growth or decline can influence a budget surplus or budget deficit
       Having discussed the revenue (taxes) and expense (spending) side of the budget, we now turn to the annual
       budget deficit or surplus, which is the difference between the tax revenue collected and spending over a fiscal
       year, which starts October 1 and ends September 30 of the next year.
       Figure 30.7 shows the pattern of annual federal budget deficits and surpluses, back to 1930, as a share of GDP.
       When the line is above the horizontal axis, the budget is in surplus. When the line is below the horizontal axis,
       a budget deficit occurred. Clearly, the biggest deficits as a share of GDP during this time were incurred to
       finance World War II. Deficits were also large during the 1930s, the 1980s, the early 1990s, 2007-2009 (the
       Great Recession), and 2020 (the pandemic-induced recession).

       FIGURE 30.7 Pattern of Federal Budget Deficits and Surpluses, 1929-2020 The federal government has run budget
       deficits for decades. The budget was briefly in surplus in the late 1990s, before heading into deficit again in the first
       decade of the 2000s--and especially deep deficits in the 2007-2009 and 2020 recessions. (Source: Federal Reserve

Federal Surplus or Deficit as a Percentage of Gross Domestic Product

Debt/GDP Ratio

Another useful way to view the budget deficit is through the prism of accumulated debt rather than annual
deficits. The national debt refers to the total amount that the government has borrowed over time. In contrast,
the budget deficit refers to how much the government has borrowed in one particular year. Figure 30.8 shows
the ratio of debt/GDP since 1966. Until the 1970s, the debt/GDP ratio revealed a fairly clear pattern of federal
borrowing. The government ran up large deficits and raised the debt/GDP ratio in World War II, but from the
1950s to the 1970s the government ran either surpluses or relatively small deficits, and so the debt/GDP ratio
drifted down. Large deficits in the 1980s and early 1990s caused the ratio to rise sharply. When budget
surpluses arrived from 1998 to 2001, the debt/GDP ratio declined substantially. The budget deficits starting in
2002 then tugged the debt/GDP ratio higher--with a big jump when the recession took hold in 2008-2009.
There was another leap in the ratio in 2020.

FIGURE 30.8 Federal Debt as a Percentage of GDP, 1942-2014 Federal debt is the sum of annual budget deficits
and surpluses. Annual deficits do not always mean that the debt/GDP ratio is rising. During the 1960s and 1970s,
the government often ran small deficits, but since the debt was growing more slowly than the economy, the debt/
GDP ratio was declining over this time. In the 2008-2009 recession, the debt/GDP ratio rose sharply, before leveling
off through the later 2010s. In 2020, it rose sharply again. (Source: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/

The next Clear it Up feature discusses how the government handles the national debt.

         CLEAR IT UP
What is the national debt?

One year's federal budget deficit causes the federal government to sell Treasury bonds to make up the difference
between spending programs and tax revenues. The dollar value of all the outstanding Treasury bonds on which the
federal government owes money is equal to the national debt.

      The Path from Deficits to Surpluses to Deficits

       Why did the budget deficits suddenly turn to surpluses from 1998 to 2001 and why did the surpluses return to
       deficits in 2002? Why did the deficit become so large in 2020? Figure 30.9 suggests some answers. The graph
       combines the earlier information on total federal spending and taxes in a single graph, but focuses on the
       federal budget since 1990.

       FIGURE 30.9 Total Government Spending and Taxes as a Share of GDP, 1990-2020 When government spending
       exceeds taxes, the gap is the budget deficit. When taxes exceed spending, the gap is a budget surplus. The
       recessionary period starting in late 2007 saw higher spending and lower taxes, combining to create a large deficit in
       2009. The same thing happened in a more extreme way in 2020. (Source: Economic Report of the President, Tables
       B-46, https://www.govinfo.gov/app/collection/erp/2021)
       Government spending as a share of GDP declined steadily through the 1990s. The biggest single reason was
       that defense spending declined from 5.2% of GDP in 1990 to 3.0% in 2000, but interest payments by the
       federal government also fell by about 1.0% of GDP. However, federal tax collections increased substantially in
       the later 1990s, jumping from 18.1% of GDP in 1994 to 20.8% in 2000. Powerful economic growth in the late
       1990s fueled the boom in taxes. Personal income taxes rise as income goes up; payroll taxes rise as jobs and
       payrolls go up; corporate income taxes rise as profits go up. At the same time, government spending on
       transfer payments such as unemployment benefits, foods stamps, and welfare declined with more people
       working.
       This sharp increase in tax revenues and decrease in expenditures on transfer payments was largely
       unexpected even by experienced budget analysts, and so budget surpluses came as a surprise. However, in the
       early 2000s, many of these factors started running in reverse. Tax revenues sagged, due largely to the
       recession that started in March 2001, which reduced revenues. Congress enacted a series of tax cuts and
       President George W. Bush signed them into law, starting in 2001. In addition, government spending swelled
       due to increases in defense, healthcare, education, Social Security, and support programs for those who were
       hurt by the recession and the slow growth that followed. Deficits returned. When the severe recession hit in
       late 2007, spending climbed and tax collections fell to historically unusual levels, resulting in enormous
       deficits.
       Longer-term U.S. budget forecasts, a decade or more into the future, predict enormous deficits. The higher
       deficits during the 2007-2009 Great Recession and the 2020 pandemic-induced recession have repercussions,
       and the demographics will be challenging. The primary reason is the "baby boom"--the exceptionally high
       birthrates that began in 1946, right after World War II, and lasted for about two decades. Starting in 2010, the

front edge of the baby boom generation reached age 65, and in the next two decades, the proportion of
Americans over the age of 65 will increase substantially. During the 2020 recession, we saw another wave of
early retirements, and we are now in the middle of this major demographic shift. The current level of the
payroll taxes that support Social Security and Medicare will fall well short of the projected expenses of these
programs, as the following Clear It Up feature shows; thus, the forecast is for increasingly large budget deficits.
A decision to collect more revenue to support these programs or to decrease benefit levels would alter this
long-term forecast.

         CLEAR IT UP

What is the long-term budget outlook for Social Security and Medicare?

In 1946, just one American in 13 was over age 65. By 2000, it was one in eight. By 2030, one American in five will
be over age 65. Two enormous U.S. federal programs focus on the elderly--Social Security and Medicare. The
growing numbers of elderly Americans will increase spending on these programs, as well as on Medicaid. The
current payroll tax levied on workers, which supports all of Social Security and the hospitalization insurance part of
Medicare, will not be enough to cover the expected costs, so what are the options?

Long-term projections from the Congressional Budget Office in 2021 are that Medicare and Social Security spending
combined will rise from 8.7% of GDP in 2021 to about 10.8% by 2027-2031. If this rise in spending occurs, without
any corresponding rise in tax collections, then some mix of changes must occur: (1) taxes will need to increase
dramatically; (2) other spending will need to be cut dramatically; (3) the retirement age and/or age receiving
Medicare benefits will need to increase, or (4) the federal government will need to run extremely large budget
deficits.

Some proposals suggest removing the cap on wages subject to the payroll tax, so that those with very high incomes
would have to pay the tax on the entire amount of their wages. Other proposals suggest moving Social Security and
Medicare from systems in which workers pay for retirees toward programs that set up accounts where workers save
funds over their lifetimes and then draw out after retirement to pay for healthcare.

The United States is not alone in this problem. Providing the promised level of retirement and health benefits to a
growing proportion of elderly with a falling proportion of workers is an even more severe problem in many European
nations and in Japan. How to pay promised levels of benefits to the elderly will be a difficult public policy decision.

In the next module we shift to the use of fiscal policy to counteract business cycle fluctuations. In addition, we
will explore proposals requiring a balanced budget--that is, for government spending and taxes to be equal
each year. The Impacts of Government Borrowing will also cover how fiscal policy and government borrowing
will affect national saving--and thus affect economic growth and trade imbalances.

30.4 Using Fiscal Policy to Fight Recession, Unemployment, and Inflation

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Explain how expansionary fiscal policy can shift aggregate demand and influence the economy
  · Explain how contractionary fiscal policy can shift aggregate demand and influence the economy

Fiscal policy is the use of government spending and tax policy to influence the path of the economy over time.
Graphically, we see that fiscal policy, whether through changes in spending or taxes, shifts the aggregate
demand outward in the case of expansionary fiscal policy and inward in the case of contractionary fiscal
policy. We know from the chapter on economic growth that over time the quantity and quality of our resources
grow as the population and thus the labor force get larger, as businesses invest in new capital, and as
technology improves. The result of this is regular shifts to the right of the aggregate supply curves, as Figure
30.10 illustrates.
738 30 · Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy

       The original equilibrium occurs at E0, the intersection of aggregate demand curve AD0 and aggregate supply
       curve SRAS0, at an output level of 200 and a price level of 90. One year later, aggregate supply has shifted to the
       right to SRAS1 in the process of long-term economic growth, and aggregate demand has also shifted to the
       right to AD1, keeping the economy operating at the new level of potential GDP. The new equilibrium (E1) is an
       output level of 206 and a price level of 92. One more year later, aggregate supply has again shifted to the right,
       now to SRAS2, and aggregate demand shifts right as well to AD2. Now the equilibrium is E2, with an output
       level of 212 and a price level of 94. In short, the figure shows an economy that is growing steadily year to year,
       producing at its potential GDP each year, with only small inflationary increases in the price level.

       FIGURE 30.10 A Healthy, Growing Economy In this well-functioning economy, each year aggregate supply and
       aggregate demand shift to the right so that the economy proceeds from equilibrium E0 to E1 to E2. Each year, the
       economy produces at potential GDP with only a small inflationary increase in the price level. However, if aggregate
       demand does not smoothly shift to the right and match increases in aggregate supply, growth with deflation can
       develop.
       Aggregate demand and aggregate supply do not always move neatly together. Think about what causes shifts in
       aggregate demand over time. As aggregate supply increases, incomes tend to go up. This tends to increase
       consumer and investment spending, shifting the aggregate demand curve to the right, but in any given period
       it may not shift the same amount as aggregate supply. What happens to government spending and taxes?
       Government spends to pay for the ordinary business of government- items such as national defense, social
       security, and healthcare, as Figure 30.10 shows. Tax revenues, in part, pay for these expenditures. The result
       may be an increase in aggregate demand more than or less than the increase in aggregate supply. Aggregate
       demand may fail to increase along with aggregate supply, or aggregate demand may even shift left, for a
       number of possible reasons: households become hesitant about consuming; firms decide against investing as
       much; or perhaps the demand from other countries for exports diminishes.
       For example, investment by private firms in physical capital in the U.S. economy boomed during the late
       1990s, rising from 14.1% of GDP in 1993 to 17.2% in 2000, before falling back to 15.2% by 2002. Conversely, if
       shifts in aggregate demand run ahead of increases in aggregate supply, inflationary increases in the price level
       will result. Business cycles of recession and recovery are the consequence of shifts in aggregate supply and
       aggregate demand. As these occur, the government may choose to use fiscal policy to address the difference.
       Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation shows us that a central bank can use its powers over the banking system
       to engage in countercyclical--or "against the business cycle"--actions. If recession threatens, the central bank
       uses an expansionary monetary policy to increase the money supply, increase the quantity of loans, reduce
       interest rates, and shift aggregate demand to the right. If inflation threatens, the central bank uses
       contractionary monetary policy to reduce the money supply, reduce the quantity of loans, raise interest rates,

and shift aggregate demand to the left. Fiscal policy is another macroeconomic policy tool for adjusting
aggregate demand by using either government spending or taxation policy.

Expansionary Fiscal Policy

Expansionary fiscal policy increases the level of aggregate demand, through either increases in government
spending or reductions in tax rates. Expansionary policy can do this by (1) increasing consumption by raising
disposable income through cuts in personal income taxes or payroll taxes; (2) increasing investment spending
by raising after-tax profits through cuts in business taxes; and (3) increasing government purchases through
increased federal government spending on final goods and services and raising federal grants to state and
local governments to increase their expenditures on final goods and services. Contractionary fiscal policy does
the reverse: it decreases the level of aggregate demand by decreasing consumption, decreasing investment,
and decreasing government spending, either through cuts in government spending or increases in taxes. The
aggregate demand/aggregate supply model is useful in judging whether expansionary or contractionary fiscal
policy is appropriate.
Consider first the situation in Figure 30.11, which is similar to the U.S. economy during the 2007-2009
recession. The intersection of aggregate demand (AD0) and aggregate supply (SRAS0) is occurring below the
level of potential GDP as the LRAS curve indicates. At the equilibrium (E0), a recession occurs and
unemployment rises. In this case, expansionary fiscal policy using tax cuts or increases in government
spending can shift aggregate demand to AD1, closer to the full-employment level of output. In addition, the
price level would rise back to the level P1 associated with potential GDP.

FIGURE 30.11 Expansionary Fiscal Policy The original equilibrium (E0) represents a recession, occurring at a
quantity of output (Y0) below potential GDP. However, a shift of aggregate demand from AD0 to AD1, enacted
through an expansionary fiscal policy, can move the economy to a new equilibrium output of E1 at the level of
potential GDP which the LRAS curve shows. Since the economy was originally producing below potential GDP, any
inflationary increase in the price level from P0 to P1 that results should be relatively small.
Should the government use tax cuts or spending increases, or a mix of the two, to carry out expansionary fiscal
policy? During the 2007-2009 Great Recession, the U.S. economy suffered a 3.1% cumulative loss of GDP. That
may not sound like much, but it's more than one year's average growth rate of GDP. Over that time frame, the
unemployment rate doubled from 5% to 10%. The choice between whether to use tax or spending tools often
has a political tinge. As a general statement, conservatives and Republicans prefer to see expansionary fiscal
policy carried out by tax cuts, while liberals and Democrats prefer that the government implement
expansionary fiscal policy through spending increases. In a bipartisan effort to address the extreme situation,
the Obama administration and Congress passed an $830 billion expansionary policy in early 2009 involving
both tax cuts and increases in government spending. At the same time, however, the federal stimulus was
740 30 · Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy

       partially offset when state and local governments, whose budgets were hard hit by the recession, began cutting
       their spending.
       Events were even more severe during the more recent pandemic-induced recession. In a single quarter
       (Quarter 2 of 2020), GDP fell by over 9%, or at an annualized rate of about 34%. Policymakers were quick to
       respond with expanded unemployment insurance, aid to state and local governments (so that they didn't have
       to cut their spending like they did during the Great Recession), grants and tax breaks for small businesses, and
       perhaps most significantly, stimulus checks sent to over 100 million households, totaling thousands of dollars
       each. Since these were mostly spending measures, they were supported more by Democrats than by
       Republicans, although both groups recognized the severity of the problem and were largely in agreement early
       on. Especially during the debates over later rounds of the stimulus checks, many discussions were had over
       the appropriate size and target of the checks. Ultimately, compromises were made and no side got exactly what
       it wanted.
       The conflict over which policy tool to use can be frustrating to those who want to categorize economics as
       "liberal" or "conservative," or who want to use economic models to argue against their political opponents.
       However, advocates of smaller government, who seek to reduce taxes and government spending can use the
       AD AS model, as well as advocates of bigger government, who seek to raise taxes and government spending.
       Economic studies of specific taxing and spending programs can help inform decisions about whether the
       government should change taxes or spending, and in what ways. Ultimately, decisions about whether to use tax
       or spending mechanisms to implement macroeconomic policy is a political decision rather than a purely
       economic one.

      Contractionary Fiscal Policy

       Fiscal policy can also contribute to pushing aggregate demand beyond potential GDP in a way that leads to
       inflation. As Figure 30.12 shows, a very large budget deficit pushes up aggregate demand, so that the
       intersection of aggregate demand (AD0) and aggregate supply (SRAS0) occurs at equilibrium E0, which is an
       output level above potential GDP. Economists sometimes call this an "overheating economy" where demand is
       so high that there is upward pressure on wages and prices, causing inflation. In this situation, contractionary
       fiscal policy involving federal spending cuts or tax increases can help to reduce the upward pressure on the
       price level by shifting aggregate demand to the left, to AD1, and causing the new equilibrium E1 to be at
       potential GDP, where aggregate demand intersects the LRAS curve.

       FIGURE 30.12 A Contractionary Fiscal Policy The economy starts at the equilibrium quantity of output Y0, which is
       above potential GDP. The extremely high level of aggregate demand will generate inflationary increases in the price
       level. A contractionary fiscal policy can shift aggregate demand down from AD0 to AD1, leading to a new equilibrium

output E1, which occurs at potential GDP, where AD1 intersects the LRAS curve.

Again, the AD-AS model does not dictate how the government should carry out this contractionary fiscal
policy. Some may prefer spending cuts; others may prefer tax increases; still others may say that it depends on
the specific situation. The model only argues that, in this situation, the government needs to reduce aggregate
demand.

30.5 Automatic Stabilizers

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Describe how the federal government can use discretionary fiscal policy to stabilize the economy
  · Identify examples of automatic stabilizers
  · Understand how a government can use standardized employment budget to identify automatic stabilizers

In 2020, more than 20 million people could collect unemployment insurance benefits to replace some of their
salaries. Federal fiscal policies include discretionary fiscal policy, when the government passes a new law
that explicitly changes tax or spending levels. The 2020 stimulus checks and increases in state and local
government aid are an example. Changes in tax and spending levels can also occur automatically, due to
automatic stabilizers, such as unemployment insurance and food stamps, which are programs that are
already laws that stimulate aggregate demand in a recession and hold down aggregate demand in a potentially
inflationary boom.

Counterbalancing Recession and Boom

Consider first the situation where aggregate demand has risen sharply, causing the equilibrium to occur at a
level of output above potential GDP. This situation will increase inflationary pressure in the economy. The
policy prescription in this setting would be a dose of contractionary fiscal policy, implemented through some
combination of higher taxes and lower spending. To some extent, both changes happen automatically. On the
tax side, a rise in aggregate demand means that workers and firms throughout the economy earn more.
Because taxes are based on personal income and corporate profits, a rise in aggregate demand automatically
increases tax payments. On the spending side, stronger aggregate demand typically means lower
unemployment and fewer layoffs, and so there is less need for government spending on unemployment
benefits, welfare, Medicaid, and other programs in the social safety net.

The process works in reverse, too. If aggregate demand were to fall sharply so that a recession occurs, then the
prescription would be for expansionary fiscal policy--some mix of tax cuts and spending increases. The lower
level of aggregate demand and higher unemployment will tend to pull down personal incomes and corporate
profits, an effect that will reduce the amount of taxes owed automatically. Higher unemployment and a weaker
economy should lead to increased government spending on unemployment benefits, welfare, and other
similar domestic programs. In 2009, the stimulus package included an extension in the time allowed to collect
unemployment insurance. In addition, the automatic stabilizers react to a weakening of aggregate demand
with expansionary fiscal policy and react to a strengthening of aggregate demand with contractionary fiscal
policy, just as the AD/AS analysis suggests.

A combination of automatic stabilizers and discretionary fiscal policy produced the very large budget deficit in
2020. The pandemic caused high levels of unemployment, meaning less tax-generating economic activity. The
high unemployment rate triggered the automatic stabilizers that reduce taxes and increase spending, due to
the increased amount of unemployment insurance paid out by the federal and state governments. Most
economists, even those who are concerned about a possible pattern of persistently large budget deficits, are
much less concerned or even quite supportive of larger budget deficits in the short run of a few years during
and immediately after a severe recession.

A glance back at economic history provides a second illustration of the power of automatic stabilizers.
742 30 · Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy

       Remember that the length of economic upswings between recessions has become longer in the U.S. economy
       in recent decades (as we discussed in Unemployment). The three longest economic booms of the twentieth
       century happened in the 1960s, the 1980s, and the 1991-2001 time period. One reason why the economy has
       tipped into recession less frequently in recent decades is that the size of government spending and taxes has
       increased in the second half of the twentieth century. Thus, the automatic stabilizing effects from spending
       and taxes are now larger than they were in the first half of the twentieth century. Around 1900, for example,
       federal spending was only about 2% of GDP. In 1929, just before the Great Depression hit, government
       spending was still just 4% of GDP. In those earlier times, the smaller size of government made automatic
       stabilizers far less powerful than in the last few decades, when government spending often hovers at 20% of
       GDP or more.

      The Standardized Employment Deficit or Surplus

       Each year, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) calculates the standardized employment
       budget--that is, what the budget deficit or surplus would be if the economy were producing at potential GDP,
       where people who look for work were finding jobs in a reasonable period of time and businesses were making
       normal profits, with the result that both workers and businesses would be earning more and paying more
       taxes. In effect, the standardized employment deficit eliminates the impact of the automatic stabilizers. Figure
       30.13 compares the actual budget deficits of recent decades with the CBO's standardized deficit.

       FIGURE 30.13 Comparison of Actual Budget Deficits with the Standardized Employment Deficit When the economy
       is in recession, the standardized employment budget deficit is less than the actual budget deficit because the
       economy is below potential GDP, and the automatic stabilizers are reducing taxes and increasing spending. When
       the economy is performing extremely well, the standardized employment deficit (or surplus) is higher than the
       actual budget deficit (or surplus) because the economy is producing about potential GDP, so the automatic
       stabilizers are increasing taxes and reducing the need for government spending. (Sources: Actual and Cyclically
       Adjusted Budget Surpluses/Deficits, https://www.cbo.gov/data/budget-economic-data#8)
       Notice that in recession years, like the early 1990s, 2001, or 2009, the standardized employment deficit is
       smaller than the actual deficit. (These data are only available up until February 2020, so they do not include
       the effects of the pandemic.) During recessions, the automatic stabilizers tend to increase the budget deficit, so
       if the economy was instead at full employment, the deficit would be reduced. However, in the late 1990s the
       standardized employment budget surplus was lower than the actual budget surplus. The gap between the
       standardized budget deficit or surplus and the actual budget deficit or surplus shows the impact of the
       automatic stabilizers. More generally, the standardized budget figures allow you to see what the budget deficit

would look like with the economy held constant--at its potential GDP level of output.

Automatic stabilizers occur quickly. Lower wages means that a lower amount of taxes is withheld from
paychecks right away. Higher unemployment or poverty means that government spending in those areas rises
as quickly as people apply for benefits. However, while the automatic stabilizers offset part of the shifts in
aggregate demand, they do not offset all or even most of it. Historically, automatic stabilizers on the tax and
spending side offset about 10% of any initial movement in the level of output. This offset may not seem
enormous, but it is still useful. Automatic stabilizers, like shock absorbers in a car, can be useful if they reduce
the impact of the worst bumps, even if they do not eliminate the bumps altogether.

Child Tax Credit

One new form of government spending meant to support working families is an expanded Child Tax Credit
(CTC). Under changes which took effect in 2021, qualifying families will receive the credit as a monthly
payment directly into their bank accounts. The credit is also an expanded amount: from $2,000 per child to
$3,600 per child under the age of 6 (less for children older than that). Introduced by President Joe Biden's
American Rescue Plan, it is hoped that the newly expanded CTC will help reduce child poverty and support
families. Because the CTC works like a grant that is automatically extended to households, the CTC is
considered a new kind of fiscal policy that is related to a universal basic income policy which some have
argued for in the past. By sending money out monthly instead of a lump sum as part of a person's tax refund,
the intention is to help families better manage monthly bills for things like clothes and food.

30.6 Practical Problems with Discretionary Fiscal Policy

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Understand how fiscal policy and monetary policy are interconnected
  · Explain the three lag times that often occur when solving economic problems
  · Identify the legal and political challenges of responding to an economic problem

In the early 1960s, many leading economists believed that the problem of the business cycle, and the swings
between cyclical unemployment and inflation, were a thing of the past. On the cover of its December 31, 1965,
issue, Time magazine, then the premier news magazine in the United States, ran a picture of John Maynard
Keynes, and the story inside identified Keynesian theories as "the prime influence on the world's economies."
The article reported that policymakers have "used Keynesian principles not only to avoid the violent [business]
cycles of prewar days but to produce phenomenal economic growth and to achieve remarkably stable prices."

This happy consensus, however, did not last. The U.S. economy suffered one recession from December 1969 to
November 1970, a deeper recession from November 1973 to March 1975, and then double-dip recessions
from January to June 1980 and from July 1981 to November 1982. At various times, inflation and
unemployment both soared. Clearly, the problems of macroeconomic policy had not been completely solved.
As economists began to consider what had gone wrong, they identified a number of issues that make
discretionary fiscal policy more difficult than it had seemed in the rosy optimism of the mid-1960s.

Fiscal Policy and Interest Rates

Because fiscal policy affects the quantity that the government borrows in financial capital markets, it not only
affects aggregate demand--it can also affect interest rates. In Figure 30.14, the original equilibrium (E0) in the
financial capital market occurs at a quantity of $800 billion and an interest rate of 6%. However, an increase in
government budget deficits shifts the demand for financial capital from D0 to D1. The new equilibrium (E1)
occurs at a quantity of $900 billion and an interest rate of 7%.

A consensus estimate based on a number of studies is that an increase in budget deficits (or a fall in budget
surplus) by 1% of GDP will cause an increase of 0.5-1.0% in the long-term interest rate.
744 30 · Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy

       FIGURE 30.14 Fiscal Policy and Interest Rates When a government borrows money in the financial capital market, it
       causes a shift in the demand for financial capital from D0 to D1. As the equilibrium moves from E0 to E1, the
       equilibrium interest rate rises from 6% to 7% in this example. In this way, an expansionary fiscal policy intended to
       shift aggregate demand to the right can also lead to a higher interest rate, which has the effect of shifting aggregate
       demand back to the left.
       A problem arises here. An expansionary fiscal policy, with tax cuts or spending increases, is intended to
       increase aggregate demand. If an expansionary fiscal policy also causes higher interest rates, then firms and
       households are discouraged from borrowing and spending (as occurs with tight monetary policy), thus
       reducing aggregate demand. Even if the direct effect of expansionary fiscal policy on increasing demand is not
       totally offset by lower aggregate demand from higher interest rates, fiscal policy can end up less powerful than
       was originally expected. We refer to this as crowding out, where government borrowing and spending results
       in higher interest rates, which reduces business investment and household consumption.
       The broader lesson is that the government must coordinate fiscal and monetary policy. If expansionary fiscal
       policy is to work well, then the central bank can also reduce or keep short-term interest rates low. Conversely,
       monetary policy can also help to ensure that contractionary fiscal policy does not lead to a recession.

      Long and Variable Time Lags

       The government can change monetary policy several times each year, but it takes much longer to enact fiscal
       policy. Imagine that the economy starts to slow down. It often takes some months before the economic
       statistics signal clearly that a downturn has started, and a few months more to confirm that it is truly a
       recession and not just a one- or two-month blip. Economists often call the time it takes to determine that a
       recession has occurred the recognition lag. After this lag, policymakers become aware of the problem and
       propose fiscal policy bills. The bills go into various congressional committees for hearings, negotiations, votes,
       and then, if passed, eventually for the president's signature. Many fiscal policy bills about spending or taxes
       propose changes that would start in the next budget year or would be phased in gradually over time.
       Economists often refer to the time it takes to pass a bill as the legislative lag. Finally, once the government
       passes the bill it takes some time to disperse the funds to the appropriate agencies to implement the programs.
       Economists call the time it takes to start the projects the implementation lag.
       Moreover, the exact level of fiscal policy that the government should implement is never completely clear.
       Should it increase the budget deficit by 0.5% of GDP? By 1% of GDP? By 2% of GDP? In an AD/AS diagram, it is
       straightforward to sketch an aggregate demand curve shifting to the potential GDP level of output. In the real
       world, we only know roughly, not precisely, the actual level of potential output, and exactly how a spending cut
       or tax increase will affect aggregate demand is always somewhat controversial. Also unknown is the state of the

         Access for free at openstax.org

economy at any point in time. During the early days of the Obama administration, for example, no one knew
the true extent of the economy's deficit. During the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the rapid collapse of the
banking system and automotive sector made it difficult to assess how quickly the economy was collapsing.

Thus, it can take many months or even more than a year to begin an expansionary fiscal policy after a
recession has started--and even then, uncertainty will remain over exactly how much to expand or contract
taxes and spending. When politicians attempt to use countercyclical fiscal policy to fight recession or inflation,
they run the risk of responding to the macroeconomic situation of two or three years ago, in a way that may be
exactly wrong for the economy at that time. George P. Schultz, a professor of economics, former Secretary of
the Treasury, and Director of the Office of Management and Budget, once wrote: "While the economist is
accustomed to the concept of lags, the politician likes instant results. The tension comes because, as I have
seen on many occasions, the economist's lag is the politician's nightmare."

Temporary and Permanent Fiscal Policy

A temporary tax cut or spending increase will explicitly last only for a year or two, and then revert to its
original level. A permanent tax cut or spending increase is expected to stay in place for the foreseeable future.
The effect of temporary and permanent fiscal policies on aggregate demand can be very different. Consider
how you would react if the government announced a tax cut that would last one year and then be repealed, in
comparison with how you would react if the government announced a permanent tax cut. Most people and
firms will react more strongly to a permanent policy change than a temporary one.

This fact creates an unavoidable difficulty for countercyclical fiscal policy. The appropriate policy may be to
have an expansionary fiscal policy with large budget deficits during a recession, and then a contractionary
fiscal policy with budget surpluses when the economy is growing well. However, if both policies are explicitly
temporary ones, they will have a less powerful effect than a permanent policy.

Structural Economic Change Takes Time

When an economy recovers from a recession, it does not usually revert to its exact earlier shape. Instead, the
economy's internal structure evolves and changes and this process can take time. For example, much of the
economic growth of the mid-2000s was in the construction sector (especially of housing) and finance.
However, when housing prices started falling in 2007 and the resulting financial crunch led into recession (as
we discussed in Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation), both sectors contracted. The manufacturing sector of
the U.S. economy has been losing jobs in recent years as well, under pressure from technological change and
foreign competition. Many of the people who lost work from these sectors in the 2008-2009 Great Recession
will never return to the same jobs in the same sectors of the economy. Instead, the economy will need to grow
in new and different directions, as the following Clear It Up feature shows. Fiscal policy can increase overall
demand, but the process of structural economic change--the expansion of a new set of industries and the
movement of workers to those industries--inevitably takes time.

         CLEAR IT UP

Why do jobs vanish?

People can lose jobs for a variety of reasons: because of a recession, but also because of longer-run changes in the
economy, such as new technology. Productivity improvements in auto manufacturing, for example, can reduce the
number of workers needed, and eliminate these jobs in the long run. The internet has created jobs but also caused
job loss, from travel agents to book store clerks. Many of these jobs may never come back. Short-run fiscal policy to
reduce unemployment can create jobs, but it cannot replace jobs that will never return.

The Limitations of Fiscal Policy

Fiscal policy can help an economy that is producing below its potential GDP to expand aggregate demand so
746 30 · Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy

       that it produces closer to potential GDP, thus lowering unemployment. However, fiscal policy cannot help an
       economy produce at an output level above potential GDP without causing inflation At this point,
       unemployment becomes so low that workers become scarce and wages rise rapidly.

      Political Realties and Discretionary Fiscal Policy

       A final problem for discretionary fiscal policy arises out of the difficulties of explaining to politicians how
       countercyclical fiscal policy that runs against the tide of the business cycle should work. Some politicians have
       a gut-level belief that when the economy and tax revenues slow down, it is time to hunker down, pinch
       pennies, and trim expenses. Countercyclical policy, however, says that when the economy has slowed, it is time
       for the government to stimulate the economy, raising spending, and cutting taxes. This offsets the drop in the
       economy in the other sectors. Conversely, when economic times are good and tax revenues are rolling in,
       politicians often feel that it is time for tax cuts and new spending. However, countercyclical policy says that
       this economic boom should be an appropriate time for keeping taxes high and restraining spending.

       Politicians tend to prefer expansionary fiscal policy over contractionary policy. There is rarely a shortage of
       proposals for tax cuts and spending increases, especially during recessions. However, politicians are less
       willing to hear the message that in good economic times, they should propose tax increases and spending
       limits. In the economic upswing of the late 1990s and early 2000s, for example, the U.S. GDP grew rapidly.
       Estimates from respected government economic forecasters like the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office
       and the Office of Management and Budget stated that the GDP was above potential GDP, and that
       unemployment rates were unsustainably low. However, no mainstream politician took the lead in saying that
       the booming economic times might be an appropriate time for spending cuts or tax increases.

      Discretionary Fiscal Policy: Summing Up

       Expansionary fiscal policy can help to end recessions and contractionary fiscal policy can help to reduce
       inflation. Given the uncertainties over interest rate effects, time lags, temporary and permanent policies, and
       unpredictable political behavior, many economists and knowledgeable policymakers had concluded by the
       mid-1990s that discretionary fiscal policy was a blunt instrument, more like a club than a scalpel. It might still
       make sense to use it in extreme economic situations, like an especially deep or long recession. For less
       extreme situations, it was often preferable to let fiscal policy work through the automatic stabilizers and focus
       on monetary policy to steer short-term countercyclical efforts.

     30.7 The Question of a Balanced Budget

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Understand the arguments for and against requiring the U.S. federal budget to be balanced
         · Consider the long-run and short-run effects of a federal budget deficit

       For many decades, going back to the 1930s, various legislators have put forward proposals to require that the
       U.S. government balance its budget every year. In 1995, a proposed constitutional amendment that would
       require a balanced budget passed the U.S. House of Representatives by a wide margin, and failed in the U.S.
       Senate by only a single vote. (For the balanced budget to have become an amendment to the Constitution
       would have required a two-thirds vote by Congress and passage by three-quarters of the state legislatures.)

       Most economists view the proposals for a perpetually balanced budget with bemusement. After all, in the short
       term, economists would expect the budget deficits and surpluses to fluctuate up and down with the economy
       and the automatic stabilizers. Economic recessions should automatically lead to larger budget deficits or

smaller budget surpluses, while economic booms lead to smaller deficits or larger surpluses. A requirement
that the budget be balanced each and every year would prevent these automatic stabilizers from working and
would worsen the severity of economic fluctuations.

Some supporters of the balanced budget amendment like to argue that, since households must balance their
own budgets, the government should too. However, this analogy between household and government behavior
is severely flawed. Most households do not balance their budgets every year. Some years households borrow to
buy houses or cars or to pay for medical expenses or college tuition. Other years they repay loans and save
funds in retirement accounts. After retirement, they withdraw and spend those savings. Also, the government
is not a household for many reasons, one of which is that the government has macroeconomic responsibilities.
The argument of Keynesian macroeconomic policy is that the government needs to lean against the wind,
spending when times are hard and saving when times are good, for the sake of the overall economy.

There is also no particular reason to expect a government budget to be balanced in the medium term of a few
years. For example, a government may decide that by running large budget deficits, it can make crucial long-
term investments in human capital and physical infrastructure that will build the country's long-term
productivity. These decisions may work out well or poorly, but they are not always irrational. Such policies of
ongoing government budget deficits may persist for decades. As the U.S. experience from the end of World War
II up to about 1980 shows, it is perfectly possible to run budget deficits almost every year for decades, but as
long as the percentage increases in debt are smaller than the percentage growth of GDP, the debt/GDP ratio will
decline at the same time.

Nothing in this argument is a claim that budget deficits are always a wise policy. In the short run, a
government that runs a very large budget deficit can shift aggregate demand to the right and trigger severe
inflation. Additionally, governments may borrow for foolish or impractical reasons. The Impacts of
Government Borrowing will discuss how large budget deficits, by reducing national saving, can in certain cases
reduce economic growth and even contribute to international financial crises. A requirement that the budget
be balanced in each calendar year, however, is a misguided overreaction to the fear that in some cases, budget
deficits can become too large.

The 2013 federal budget shutdown illustrated the many sides to fiscal policy and the federal budget. In 2013,
Republicans and Democrats could not agree on which spending policies to fund and how large the government debt
should be. Due to the severity of the 2008-2009 recession, the fiscal stimulus, and previous policies, the federal
budget deficit and debt was historically high. One way to try to cut federal spending and borrowing was to refuse to
raise the legal federal debt limit, or tie on conditions to appropriation bills to stop the Affordable Health Care Act.
This disagreement led to a two-week federal government shutdown and got close to the deadline where the federal
government would default on its Treasury bonds. Finally, however, a compromise emerged and the government
avoided default. This shows clearly how closely fiscal policies are tied to politics.

Key Concepts and Summary

30.1 Government Spending

Fiscal policy is the set of policies that relate to federal government spending, taxation, and borrowing. In
recent decades, the level of federal government spending and taxes, expressed as a share of GDP, has not
changed much, typically fluctuating between about 18% to 22% of GDP. However, the level of state spending
and taxes, as a share of GDP, has risen from about 12-13% to about 20% of GDP over the last four decades. The
four main areas of federal spending are national defense, Social Security, healthcare, and interest payments,
which together account for about 70% of all federal spending. When a government spends more than it collects
in taxes, it is said to have a budget deficit. When a government collects more in taxes than it spends, it is said to
have a budget surplus. If government spending and taxes are equal, it is said to have a balanced budget. The
sum of all past deficits and surpluses make up the government debt.

30.2 Taxation

The two main federal taxes are individual income taxes and payroll taxes that provide funds for Social Security
and Medicare; these taxes together account for more than 80% of federal revenues. Other federal taxes include

                                                                                                                                               30 · Self-Check Questions 749

the corporate income tax, excise taxes on alcohol, gasoline and tobacco, and the estate and gift tax. A
progressive tax is one, like the federal income tax, where those with higher incomes pay a higher share of taxes
out of their income than those with lower incomes. A proportional tax is one, like the payroll tax for Medicare,
where everyone pays the same share of taxes regardless of income level. A regressive tax is one, like the payroll
tax (above a certain threshold) that supports Social Security, where those with high income pay a lower share
of income in taxes than those with lower incomes.

30.3 Federal Deficits and the National Debt

For most of the twentieth century, the U.S. government took on debt during wartime and then paid down that
debt slowly in peacetime. However, it took on quite substantial debts in peacetime in the 1980s and early
1990s, before a brief period of budget surpluses from 1998 to 2001, followed by a return to annual budget
deficits since 2002, with very large deficits in the recession of 2008 and 2009. A budget deficit or budget
surplus is measured annually. Total government debt or national debt is the sum of budget deficits and budget
surpluses over time.

30.4 Using Fiscal Policy to Fight Recession, Unemployment, and Inflation

Expansionary fiscal policy increases the level of aggregate demand, either through increases in government
spending or through reductions in taxes. Expansionary fiscal policy is most appropriate when an economy is
in recession and producing below its potential GDP. Contractionary fiscal policy decreases the level of
aggregate demand, either through cuts in government spending or increases in taxes. Contractionary fiscal
policy is most appropriate when an economy is producing above its potential GDP.

30.5 Automatic Stabilizers

Fiscal policy is conducted both through discretionary fiscal policy, which occurs when the government enacts
taxation or spending changes in response to economic events, or through automatic stabilizers, which are
taxing and spending mechanisms that, by their design, shift in response to economic events without any
further legislation. The standardized employment budget is the calculation of what the budget deficit or budget
surplus would have been in a given year if the economy had been producing at its potential GDP in that year.
Many economists and politicians criticize the use of fiscal policy for a variety of reasons, including concerns
over time lags, the impact on interest rates, and the inherently political nature of fiscal policy. We cover the
critique of fiscal policy in the next module.

30.6 Practical Problems with Discretionary Fiscal Policy

Because fiscal policy affects the quantity of money that the government borrows in financial capital markets, it
not only affects aggregate demand--it can also affect interest rates. If an expansionary fiscal policy also causes
higher interest rates, then firms and households are discouraged from borrowing and spending, reducing
aggregate demand in a situation called crowding out. Given the uncertainties over interest rate effects, time
lags (implementation lag, legislative lag, and recognition lag), temporary and permanent policies, and
unpredictable political behavior, many economists and knowledgeable policymakers have concluded that
discretionary fiscal policy is a blunt instrument and better used only in extreme situations.

30.7 The Question of a Balanced Budget

Balanced budget amendments are a popular political idea, but the economic merits behind such proposals are
questionable. Most economists accept that fiscal policy needs to be flexible enough to accommodate
unforeseen expenditures, such as wars or recessions. While persistent, large budget deficits can indeed be a
problem, a balanced budget amendment prevents even small, temporary deficits that might, in some cases, be
necessary.

Introduction to the Impacts of Government Borrowing

         BRING IT HOME
Financing Higher Education

On November 8, 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed The Higher Education Act of 1965 into law. With a
stroke of the pen, he implemented what we know as the financial aid, work study, and student loan programs to help
Americans pay for a college education. In his remarks, the President said:

      Here the seeds were planted from which grew my firm conviction that for the individual, education is the
      path to achievement and fulfillment; for the Nation, it is a path to a society that is not only free but civilized;
      and for the world, it is the path to peace--for it is education that places reason over force.
This Act, he said, "is responsible for funding higher education for millions of Americans. It is the embodiment of the
United States' investment in `human capital'." Since Johnson signed the Act into law, the government has renewed it
several times.
754 31 · The Impacts of Government Borrowing

       The purpose of The Higher Education Act of 1965 was to build the country's human capital by creating educational
       opportunity for millions of Americans. The three criteria that the government uses to judge eligibility are income,
       full-time or part-time attendance, and the cost of the institution. According to education.org, in the 2011-2012
       school year, over 80% of all full-time college students received some form of federal financial aid; 43% received
       grants; and another 41% of students aged 15-23 received federal government student loans. The budget to support
       financial aid has increased not only because of more enrollment, but also because of increased tuition and fees for
       higher education. In 2022, the government generally took an approach of increasing student aid through programs
       such as Pell Grant expansion, while also taking steps to ease student loan debt.

       Governments have many competing demands for financial support. Any spending should be tempered by
       fiscal responsibility and by looking carefully at the spending's impact. When a government spends more than
       it collects in taxes, it runs a budget deficit. It then needs to borrow. When government borrowing becomes
       especially large and sustained, it can substantially reduce the financial capital available to private sector firms,
       as well as lead to trade imbalances and even financial crises.

       The Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy chapter introduced the concepts of deficits and debt, as well as how
       a government could use fiscal policy to address recession or inflation. This chapter begins by building on the
       national savings and investment identity, which we first introduced in The International Trade and Capital
       Flows chapter, to show how government borrowing affects firms' physical capital investment levels and trade
       balances. A prolonged period of budget deficits may lead to lower economic growth, in part because the funds
       that the government borrows to fund its budget deficits are typically no longer available for private investment.
       Moreover, a sustained pattern of large budget deficits can lead to disruptive economic patterns of high
       inflation, substantial inflows of financial capital from abroad, plummeting exchange rates, and heavy strains
       on a country's banking and financial system.

     31.1 How Government Borrowing Affects Investment and the Trade Balance

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain the national saving and investment identity in terms of demand and supply
         · Evaluate the role of budget surpluses and trade surpluses in national saving and investment identity

       When governments are borrowers in financial markets, there are three possible sources for the funds from a
       macroeconomic point of view: (1) households might save more; (2) private firms might borrow less; and (3) the
       additional funds for government borrowing might come from outside the country, from foreign financial
       investors. Let's begin with a review of why one of these three options must occur, and then explore how interest
       rates and exchange rates adjust to these connections.

      The National Saving and Investment Identity

       The national saving and investment identity, which we first introduced in The International Trade and Capital
       Flows chapter, provides a framework for showing the relationships between the sources of demand and supply
       in financial capital markets. The identity begins with a statement that must always hold true: the quantity of
       financial capital supplied in the market must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded.

       The U.S. economy has two main sources for financial capital: private savings from inside the U.S. economy and
       public savings.

       These include the inflow of foreign financial capital from abroad. The inflow of savings from abroad is, by
       definition, equal to the trade deficit, as we explained in The International Trade and Capital Flows chapter. We
       can write this inflow of foreign investment capital as imports (M) minus exports (X). There are also two main
       sources of demand for financial capital: private sector investment (I) and government borrowing. Government

borrowing in any given year is equal to the budget deficit, which we can write as the difference between
government spending (G) and net taxes (T). Let's call this equation 1.

Governments often spend more than they receive in taxes and, therefore, public savings (T - G) is negative.
This causes a need to borrow money in the amount of (G - T) instead of adding to the nation's savings. If this is
the case, we can view governments as demanders of financial capital instead of suppliers. In algebraic terms,
we can rewrite the national savings and investment identity like this:

Let's call this equation 2. We must accompany a change in any part of the national saving and investment
identity by offsetting changes in at least one other part of the equation because we assume that the equality of
quantity supplied and quantity demanded always holds. If the government budget deficit changes, then either
private saving or investment or the trade balance--or some combination of the three--must change as well.
Figure 31.2 shows the possible effects.

FIGURE 31.2 Effects of Change in Budget Surplus or Deficit on Investment, Savings, and The Trade Balance Chart
(a) shows the potential results when the budget deficit rises (or budget surplus falls). Chart (b) shows the potential
results when the budget deficit falls (or budget surplus rises).

What about Budget Surpluses and Trade Surpluses?

The national saving and investment identity must always hold true because, by definition, the quantity
supplied and quantity demanded in the financial capital market must always be equal. However, the formula
will look somewhat different if the government budget is in deficit rather than surplus or if the balance of trade
is in surplus rather than deficit. For example, in 1999 and 2000, the U.S. government had budget surpluses,
although the economy was still experiencing trade deficits. When the government was running budget
surpluses, it was acting as a saver rather than a borrower, and supplying rather than demanding financial
capital. As a result, we would write the national saving and investment identity during this time as:

Let's call this equation 3. Notice that this expression is mathematically the same as equation 2 except the
savings and investment sides of the identity have simply flipped sides.
During the 1960s, the U.S. government was often running a budget deficit, but the economy was typically
running trade surpluses. Since a trade surplus means that an economy is experiencing a net outflow of
756 31 · The Impacts of Government Borrowing

       financial capital, we would write the national saving and investment identity as:

       Instead of the balance of trade representing part of the supply of financial capital, which occurs with a trade
       deficit, a trade surplus represents an outflow of financial capital leaving the domestic economy and invested
       elsewhere in the world.

       We assume that the point to these equations is that the national saving and investment identity always hold.
       When you write these relationships, it is important to engage your brain and think about what is on the supply
       and demand side of the financial capital market before you start your calculations.
       As you can see in Figure 31.3, the Office of Management and Budget shows that the United States has
       consistently run budget deficits since 1977, with the exception of 1999 and 2000. What is alarming is the
       dramatic increase in budget deficits that has occurred since 2008, which in part reflects declining tax
       revenues and increased safety net expenditures due to the Great Recession. While deficits were controlled as
       the economy began to recover in the mid-2010s, the budget deficit increased again in 2020 during the
       pandemic, and forecasters expect deficits to remain high for the foreseeable future. (Recall that T is net taxes.
       When the government must transfer funds back to individuals for safety net expenditures like Social Security
       and unemployment benefits, budget deficits rise.) These deficits have implications for the future health of the
       U.S. economy.

A rising budget deficit may result in a fall in domestic investment, a rise in private savings, or a rise in the
trade deficit. The following modules discuss each of these possible effects in more detail.

31.2 Fiscal Policy and the Trade Balance

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Discuss twin deficits as they related to budget and trade deficit
  · Explain the relationship between budget deficits and exchange rates
  · Explain the relationship between budget deficits and inflation
  · Identify causes of recessions
Government budget balances can affect the trade balance. As The Keynesian Perspective chapter discusses, a
net inflow of foreign financial investment always accompanies a trade deficit, while a net outflow of financial
investment always accompanies a trade surplus. One way to understand the connection from budget deficits to
trade deficits is that when government creates a budget deficit with some combination of tax cuts or spending
increases, it will increase aggregate demand in the economy, and some of that increase in aggregate demand
will result in a higher level of imports. A higher level of imports, with exports remaining fixed, will cause a
larger trade deficit. That means foreigners' holdings of dollars increase as Americans purchase more imported
goods. Foreigners use those dollars to invest in the United States, which leads to an inflow of foreign
investment. One possible source of funding our budget deficit is foreigners buying Treasury securities that the
U.S. government sells, thus a trade deficit often accompanies a budget deficit.

Twin Deficits?

In the mid-1980s, it was common to hear economists and even newspaper articles refer to the twin deficits, as
the budget deficit and trade deficit both grew substantially. Figure 31.4 shows the pattern. The federal budget
deficit went from 2.6% of GDP in 1981 to 5.1% of GDP in 1985--a drop of 2.5% of GDP. Over that time, the trade
deficit moved from 0.5% in 1981 to 2.9% in 1985--a drop of 2.4% of GDP. In the mid-1980s an inflow of foreign
investment capital matched, the considerable increase in government borrowing, so the government budget
deficit and the trade deficit moved together.

FIGURE 31.4 U.S. Budget Deficits and Trade Deficits In the 1980s, the budget deficit and the trade deficit declined
at the same time. However, since then, the deficits have stopped being twins. The trade deficit grew smaller in the
early 1990s as the budget deficit increased, and then the trade deficit grew larger in the late 1990s as the budget
758 31 · The Impacts of Government Borrowing

       deficit turned into a surplus. In the first half of the 2000s, both budget and trade deficits increased. However, in
       2009, the trade deficit declined as the budget deficit increased. Through the 2010s, the trade deficit remained
       relatively stable as the budget deficit declined. While the budget deficit increased in 2020, there has been hardly
       any change in the trade deficit.
       Of course, no one should expect the budget deficit and trade deficit to move in lockstep, because the other
       parts of the national saving and investment identity--investment and private savings--will often change as
       well. In the late 1990s, for example, the government budget balance turned from deficit to surplus, but the
       trade deficit remained large and growing. During this time, the inflow of foreign financial investment was
       supporting a surge of physical capital investment by U.S. firms. In the first half of the 2000s, the budget and
       trade deficits again increased together, but in 2009, the budget deficit increased while the trade deficit
       declined. Through the 2010s, as there were bigger changes in the budget deficit, the trade deficit remained
       stable. The budget deficit and the trade deficits are related to each other, but they are more like cousins than
       twins.

      Budget Deficits and Exchange Rates

       Exchange rates can also help to explain why budget deficits are linked to trade deficits. Figure 31.5 shows a
       situation using the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar, measured in euros. At the original equilibrium (E0), where
       the demand for U.S. dollars (D0) intersects with the supply of U.S. dollars (S0) on the foreign exchange market,
       the exchange rate is 0.9 euros per U.S. dollar and the equilibrium quantity traded in the market is $100 billion
       per day. Then the U.S. budget deficit rises and foreign financial investment provides the source of funds for
       that budget deficit.
       International financial investors, as a group, will demand more U.S. dollars on foreign exchange markets to
       purchase the U.S. government bonds, and they will supply fewer of the U.S. dollars that they already hold in
       these markets. Demand for U.S. dollars on the foreign exchange market shifts from D0 to D1 and the supply of
       U.S. dollars falls from S0 to S1. At the new equilibrium (E1), the exchange rate has appreciated to 1.05 euros per
       dollar while, in this example, the quantity of dollars traded remains the same.

       FIGURE 31.5 Budget Deficits and Exchange Rates Imagine that the U.S. government increases its borrowing and
       the funds come from European financial investors. To purchase U.S. government bonds, those European investors
       will need to demand more U.S. dollars on foreign exchange markets, causing the demand for U.S. dollars to shift to
       the right from D0 to D1. European financial investors as a group will also be less likely to supply U.S. dollars to the
       foreign exchange markets, causing the supply of U.S. dollars to shift from S0 to S1. The equilibrium exchange rate
       strengthens from 0.9 euro/ dollar at E0 to 1.05 euros/dollar at E1.
       A stronger exchange rate, of course, makes it more difficult for exporters to sell their goods abroad while
       making imports cheaper, so a trade deficit (or a reduced trade surplus) results. Thus, a budget deficit can easily
       result in an inflow of foreign financial capital, a stronger exchange rate, and a trade deficit.

You can also imagine interest rates are driving the exchange rate appreciation. As we explained earlier in
Figure 31.8, a budget deficit increases demand in markets for domestic financial capital, raising the domestic
interest rate. A higher interest rate will attract an inflow of foreign financial capital, and appreciate the
exchange rate in response to the increase in demand for U.S. dollars by foreign investors and a decrease in
supply of U. S. dollars. Because of higher interest rates in the United States, Americans find U.S. bonds more
attractive than foreign bonds. When Americans are buying fewer foreign bonds, they are supplying fewer U.S.
dollars. U.S. dollar appreciation leads to a larger trade deficit (or reduced surplus). The connections between
inflows of foreign investment capital, interest rates, and exchange rates are all just different ways of drawing
the same economic connections: a larger budget deficit can result in a larger trade deficit, although do not
expect the connection to be one-to-one.

From Budget Deficits to International Economic Crisis

We lay out step-by-step the economic story of how an outflow of international financial capital can cause a
deep recession in the Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows chapter. When international financial
investors decide to withdraw their funds from a country like Turkey, they increase the supply of the Turkish
lira and reduce the demand for lira, depreciating the lira exchange rate. When firms and the government in a
country like Turkey borrow money in international financial markets, they typically do so in stages. First,
banks in Turkey borrow in a widely used currency like U.S. dollars or euros, then convert those U.S. dollars to
lira, and then lend the money to borrowers in Turkey. If the lira's exchange rate value depreciates, then
Turkey's banks will find it impossible to repay the international loans that are in U.S. dollars or euros.

The combination of less foreign investment capital and banks that are bankrupt can sharply reduce aggregate
demand, which causes a deep recession. Many countries around the world have experienced this kind of
recession: along with Turkey in 2002, Mexico followed this general pattern in 1995, Thailand and countries
across East Asia in 1997-1998, Russia in 1998, and Argentina in 2002. In many of these countries, large
government budget deficits played a role in setting the stage for the financial crisis. A moderate increase in a
budget deficit that leads to a moderate increase in a trade deficit and a moderate appreciation of the exchange
rate is not necessarily a cause for concern. However, beyond some point that is hard to define in advance, a
series of large budget deficits can become a cause for concern among international investors.

One reason for concern is that extremely large budget deficits mean that aggregate demand may shift so far to
the right as to cause high inflation. The example of Turkey is a situation where very large budget deficits
brought inflation rates well into double digits. In addition, very large budget deficits at some point begin to
raise a fear that the government would not repay the borrowing. In the last 100 years, the government of
Turkey has been unable to pay its debts and defaulted on its loans four times. Over the past 175 years, Brazil's
government has been unable to pay its debts and defaulted on its loans seven times; Venezuela, nine times;
and Argentina, five times. The risk of high inflation or a default on repaying international loans will worry
international investors, since both factors imply that the rate of return on their investments in that country
may end up lower than expected. If international investors start withdrawing the funds from a country rapidly,
the scenario of less investment, a depreciated exchange rate, widespread bank failure, and deep recession can
occur. The following Clear It Up feature explains other impacts of large deficits.

         CLEAR IT UP

What are the risks of chronic large deficits in the United States?

If a government runs large budget deficits for a sustained period of time, what can go wrong? According to a recent
Brookings Institution report, a key risk of a large budget deficit is that government debt may grow too high
compared to the country's GDP growth. As debt grows, the national savings rate will decline, leaving less available in
financial capital for private investment. The impact of chronically large budget deficits is as follows:

  · As the population ages, there will be an increasing demand for government services that may cause higher
760 31 · The Impacts of Government Borrowing

             government deficits. Government borrowing and its interest payments will pull resources away from domestic
             investment in human capital and physical capital that is essential to economic growth.
         · Interest rates may start to rise so that the cost of financing government debt will rise as well, creating pressure
             on the government to reduce its budget deficits through spending cuts and tax increases. These steps will be
             politically painful, and they will also have a contractionary effect on aggregate demand in the economy.
         · Rising percentage of debt to GDP will create uncertainty in the financial and global markets that might cause a
             country to resort to inflationary tactics to reduce the real value of the debt outstanding. This will decrease real
             wealth and damage confidence in the country's ability to manage its spending. After all, if the government has
             borrowed at a fixed interest rate of, say, 5%, and it lets inflation rise above that 5%, then it will effectively be
             able to repay its debt at a negative real interest rate.

       The conventional reasoning suggests that the relationship between sustained deficits that lead to high levels of
       government debt and long-term growth is negative. How significant this relationship is, how big an issue it is
       compared to other macroeconomic issues, and the direction of causality, is less clear.

       What remains important to acknowledge is that the relationship between debt and growth is negative and that for
       some countries, the relationship may be stronger than in others. It is also important to acknowledge the direction of
       causality: does high debt cause slow growth, slow growth cause high debt, or are both high debt and slow growth
       the result of third factors? In our analysis, we have argued simply that high debt causes slow growth. There may be
       more to this debate than we have space to discuss here.

      Using Fiscal Policy to Address Trade Imbalances

       If a nation is experiencing the inflow of foreign investment capital associated with a trade deficit because
       foreign investors are making long-term direct investments in firms, there may be no substantial reason for
       concern. After all, many low-income nations around the world would welcome direct investment by
       multinational firms that ties them more closely into the global networks of production and distribution of
       goods and services. In this case, the inflows of foreign investment capital and the trade deficit are attracted by
       the opportunities for a good rate of return on private sector investment in an economy.

       However, governments should beware of a sustained pattern of high budget deficits and high trade deficits. The
       danger arises in particular when the inflow of foreign investment capital is not funding long-term physical
       capital investment by firms, but instead is short-term portfolio investment in government bonds. When
       inflows of foreign financial investment reach high levels, foreign financial investors will be on the alert for any
       reason to fear that the country's exchange rate may decline or the government may be unable to repay what it
       has borrowed on time. Just as a few falling rocks can trigger an avalanche; a relatively small piece of bad news
       about an economy can trigger an enormous outflow of short-term financial capital.

       Reducing a nation's budget deficit will not always be a successful method of reducing its trade deficit, because
       other elements of the national saving and investment identity, like private saving or investment, may change
       instead. In those cases when the budget deficit is the main cause of the trade deficit, governments should take
       steps to reduce their budget deficits, lest they make their economy vulnerable to a rapid outflow of
       international financial capital that could bring a deep recession.

       A change in government budgets may impact private saving. Imagine that people watch government budgets
       and adjust their savings accordingly. For example, whenever the government runs a budget deficit, people

might reason: "Well, a higher budget deficit means that I'm just going to owe more taxes in the future to pay off
all that government borrowing, so I'll start saving now." If the government runs budget surpluses, people might
reason: "With these budget surpluses (or lower budget deficits), interest rates are falling, so that saving is less
attractive. Moreover, with a budget surplus the country will be able to afford a tax cut sometime in the future. I
won't bother saving as much now."
The theory that rational private households might shift their saving to offset government saving or borrowing
is known as Ricardian equivalence because the idea has intellectual roots in the writings of the early
nineteenth-century economist David Ricardo (1772-1823). If Ricardian equivalence holds completely true,
then in the national saving and investment identity, any change in budget deficits or budget surpluses would
be completely offset by a corresponding change in private saving. As a result, changes in government
borrowing would have no effect at all on either physical capital investment or trade balances.
In practice, the private sector only sometimes and partially adjusts its savings behavior to offset government
budget deficits and surpluses. Figure 31.6 shows the patterns of U.S. government budget deficits and surpluses
and the rate of private saving--which includes saving by both households and firms--since 1980. The
connection between the two is not at all obvious. In the mid-1980s, for example, government budget deficits
were quite large, but there is no corresponding surge of private saving. However, when budget deficits turn to
surpluses in the late 1990s, there is a simultaneous decline in private saving. When budget deficits got very
large in 2008 and 2009, there was another a rise in saving. When the deficit increased again in 2020, saving
jumped up as well. A variety of statistical studies based on the U.S. experience suggests that when government
borrowing increases by $1, private saving rises by about 30 cents. A World Bank study from the late 1990s,
looking at government budgets and private saving behavior in countries around the world, found a similar
result.

FIGURE 31.6 U.S. Budget Deficits and Private Savings The theory of Ricardian equivalence suggests that additional
private saving will offset any increase in government borrowing, while reduced private saving will offset any
decrease in government borrowing. Sometimes this theory holds true, and sometimes it does not. (Source: Bureau
of Economic Analysis and Federal Reserve Economic Data)
Private saving does increase to some extent when governments run large budget deficits, and private saving
falls when governments reduce deficits or run large budget surpluses. However, the offsetting effects of private
saving compared to government borrowing are much less than one-to-one. In addition, this effect can vary a
great deal from country to country, from time to time, and over the short and the long run.
If the funding for a larger budget deficit comes from international financial investors, then a trade deficit may
accompany a budget deficit. In some countries, this pattern of twin deficits has set the stage for international
financial investors first to send their funds to a country and cause an appreciation of its exchange rate and
762 31 · The Impacts of Government Borrowing

       then to pull their funds out and cause a depreciation of the exchange rate and a financial crisis as well. It
       depends on whether funding comes from international financial investors.

     31.4 Fiscal Policy, Investment, and Economic Growth

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain crowding out and its effect on physical capital investment
         · Explain the relationship between budget deficits and interest rates
         · Identify why economic growth is tied to investments in physical capital, human capital, and technology

       The underpinnings of economic growth are investments in physical capital, human capital, and technology, all
       set in an economic environment where firms and individuals can react to the incentives provided by well-
       functioning markets and flexible prices. Government borrowing can reduce the financial capital available for
       private firms to invest in physical capital. However, government spending can also encourage certain elements
       of long-term growth, such as spending on roads or water systems, on education, or on research and
       development that creates new technology.

      Crowding Out Physical Capital Investment

       A larger budget deficit will increase demand for financial capital. If private saving and the trade balance
       remain the same, then less financial capital will be available for private investment in physical capital. When
       government borrowing soaks up available financial capital and leaves less for private investment in physical
       capital, economists call the result crowding out.

       To understand the potential impact of crowding out, consider the U.S. economy's situation before the
       exceptional circumstances of the recession that started in late 2007. In 2005, for example, the budget deficit
       was roughly 3% of GDP. Private investment by firms in the U.S. economy has hovered in the range of 14% to
       18% of GDP in recent decades. However, in any given year, roughly half of U.S. investment in physical capital
       just replaces machinery and equipment that has worn out or become technologically obsolete. Only about half
       represents an increase in the total quantity of physical capital in the economy. Investment in new physical
       capital in any year is about 7% to 9% of GDP. In this situation, even U.S. budget deficits in the range of 3% of
       GDP can potentially crowd out a substantial share of new investment spending. Conversely, a smaller budget
       deficit (or an increased budget surplus) increases the pool of financial capital available for private investment.

       Figure 31.7 shows the patterns of U.S. budget deficits and private investment since 1980. If greater
       government deficits lead to less private investment in physical capital, and reduced government deficits or
       budget surpluses lead to more investment in physical capital, these two lines should move up and down
       simultaneously. This pattern occurred in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The U.S. federal budget went from a
       deficit of 2.2% of GDP in 1995 to a budget surplus of 2.4% of GDP in 2000--a swing of 4.6% of GDP. From 1995
       to 2000, private investment in physical capital rose from 15% to 18% of GDP--a rise of 3% of GDP. Then, when
       the U.S. government again started running budget deficits in the early 2000s, less financial capital became
       available for private investment, and the rate of private investment fell back to about 15% of GDP by 2003.
       However, in more recent years, in the 2010s after the economy recovered from the Great Recession, private
       investment as a share of GDP increased even as deficits slightly worsened, especially around 2016. And while
       the deficit increased substantially in 2020, private investment as a share of GDP did not.

FIGURE 31.7 U.S. Budget Deficits/Surpluses and Private Investment The connection between private savings and
flows of international capital plays a role in budget deficits and surpluses. Consequently, government borrowing and
private investment sometimes rise and fall together. For example, the 1990s show a pattern in which reduced
government borrowing helped to reduce crowding out so that more funds were available for private investment.
This argument does not claim that a government's budget deficits will exactly shadow its national rate of
private investment; after all, we must account for private saving and inflows of foreign financial investment. In
the mid-1980s, for example, government budget deficits increased substantially without a corresponding drop
off in private investment. In 2009, nonresidential private fixed investment dropped by $300 billion from its
previous level of $1,941 billion in 2008, primarily because, during a recession, firms lack both the funds and
the incentive to invest. Investment growth between 2009 and 2014 averaged approximately 5.9% to $2,210.5
billion--only slightly above its 2008 level, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. During that same
period, interest rates dropped from 3.94% to less than a quarter percent as the Federal Reserve took dramatic
action to prevent a depression by increasing the money supply through lowering short-term interest rates. The
"crowding out" of private investment due to government borrowing to finance expenditures appears to have
been suspended after the Great Recession.

The Interest Rate Connection

Assume that government borrowing of substantial amounts will have an effect on the quantity of private
investment. How will this affect interest rates in financial markets? In Figure 31.8, the original equilibrium (E0)
where the demand curve (D0) for financial capital intersects with the supply curve (S0) occurs at an interest
rate of 5% and an equilibrium quantity equal to 20% of GDP. However, as the government budget deficit
increases, the demand curve for financial capital shifts from D0 to D1. The new equilibrium (E1) occurs at an
interest rate of 6% and an equilibrium quantity of 21% of GDP.

FIGURE 31.8 Budget Deficits and Interest Rates In the financial market, an increase in government borrowing can

shift the demand curve for financial capital to the right from D0 to D1. As the equilibrium interest rate shifts from E0
to E1, the interest rate rises from 5% to 6% in this example. The higher interest rate is one economic mechanism by
which government borrowing can crowd out private investment.

A survey of economic studies on the connection between government borrowing and interest rates in the U.S.
economy suggests that an increase of 1% in the budget deficit will lead to a rise in interest rates of between 0.5
and 1.0%, other factors held equal. In turn, a higher interest rate tends to discourage firms from making
physical capital investments. One reason government budget deficits crowd out private investment, therefore,
is the increase in interest rates. There are, however, economic studies that show a limited connection between
the two (at least in the United States), but as the budget deficit grows, the dangers of rising interest rates
become more real.

At this point, you may wonder about the Federal Reserve. After all, can the Federal Reserve not use
expansionary monetary policy to reduce interest rates, or in this case, to prevent interest rates from rising?
This useful question emphasizes the importance of considering how fiscal and monetary policies work in
relation to each other. Imagine a central bank faced with a government that is running large budget deficits,
causing a rise in interest rates and crowding out private investment. If the budget deficits are increasing
aggregate demand when the economy is already producing near potential GDP, threatening an inflationary
increase in price levels, the central bank may react with a contractionary monetary policy. In this situation, the
higher interest rates from the government borrowing would be made even higher by contractionary monetary
policy, and the government borrowing might crowd out a great deal of private investment.

Alternatively, if the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is producing
substantially less than potential GDP, an inflationary increase in the price level is not much of a danger and the
central bank might react with expansionary monetary policy. In this situation, higher interest rates from
government borrowing would be largely offset by lower interest rates from expansionary monetary policy, and
there would be little crowding out of private investment.

However, even a central bank cannot erase the overall message of the national savings and investment identity.
If government borrowing rises, then private investment must fall, or private saving must rise, or the trade
deficit must rise. By reacting with contractionary or expansionary monetary policy, the central bank can only
help to determine which of these outcomes is likely.

Public Investment in Physical Capital

Government can invest in physical capital directly: roads and bridges; water supply and sewers; seaports and
airports; schools and hospitals; plants that generate electricity, like hydroelectric dams or windmills;
telecommunications facilities; and military weapons. In 2021, the United States spent about $146 billion on
transportation, including highways, mass transit, and airports. Table 31.1 shows the federal government's
total outlay for 2021 for major public physical capital investment in the United States. We have omitted
physical capital related to the military or to residences where people live from this table, because the focus
here is on public investments that have a direct effect on raising output in the private sector.

Public physical capital investment of this sort can increase the economy's output and productivity. An
economy with reliable roads and electricity will be able to produce more. However, it is hard to quantify how
much government investment in physical capital will benefit the economy, because government responds to
political as well as economic incentives. When a firm makes an investment in physical capital, it is subject to
the discipline of the market: If it does not receive a positive return on investment, the firm may lose money or
even go out of business.

In some cases, lawmakers make investments in physical capital as a way of spending money in key politicians'
districts. The result may be unnecessary roads or office buildings. Even if a project is useful and necessary, it
might be done in a way that is excessively costly, because local contractors who make campaign contributions
to politicians appreciate the extra business. Alternatively, governments sometimes do not make the
investments they should because a decision to spend on infrastructure does not need to just make economic
sense. It must be politically popular as well. Managing public investment cost-effectively can be difficult.

If a government decides to finance an investment in public physical capital with higher taxes or lower
government spending in other areas, it need not worry that it is directly crowding out private investment.
Indirectly however, higher household taxes could cut down on the level of private savings available and have a
similar effect. If a government decides to finance an investment in public physical capital by borrowing, it may
end up increasing the quantity of public physical capital at the cost of crowding out investment in private
physical capital, which could be more beneficial to the economy.

Public Investment in Human Capital

In most countries, the government plays a large role in society's investment in human capital through the
education system. A highly educated and skilled workforce contributes to a higher rate of economic growth.
For the low-income nations of the world, additional investment in human capital seems likely to increase
productivity and growth. For the United States, critics have raised tough questions about how much increases
in government spending on education will improve the actual level of education.

Among economists, discussions of education reform often begin with some uncomfortable facts. As Figure
31.9 shows, total federal spending in the U.S. for kindergarten through grade 12 (K-12) increased substantially
in nominal dollars through 2010, declined slightly in 2011 and 2012, and began rising again after that through
2020. However, as measured by standardized tests like the SAT, the level of student academic achievement has
barely budged in recent decades. On international tests, U.S. students lag behind students from many other
countries. (Of course, test scores are an imperfect measure of education for a variety of reasons. It would be
difficult, however, to argue that there are not real problems in the U.S. education system and that the tests are
just inaccurate.)
766 31 · The Impacts of Government Borrowing

       FIGURE 31.9 Total Spending for Elementary, Secondary, and Vocational Education (1998-2020) in the United
       States The graph shows that government spending on education was continually increasing up until 2008 where it
       leveled off until 2010, then declined slightly in 2011 and 2012. Since 2012, spending has steadily increased.
       (Source: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/G160291A027NBEA)
       The fact that increased financial resources have not brought greater measurable gains in student performance
       has led some education experts to question whether the problems may be due to structure, not just to the
       resources spent.
       Other government programs seek to increase human capital either before or after the K-12 education system.
       Programs for early childhood education, like the federal Head Start program, are directed at families where
       the parents may have limited educational and financial resources. Government also offers substantial support
       for universities and colleges. For example, in the United States about 60% of students take at least a few college
       or university classes beyond the high school level. In Germany and Japan, about half of all students take
       classes beyond the comparable high school level. In the countries of Latin America, only about one student in
       four takes classes beyond the high school level, and in the nations of sub-Saharan Africa, only about one
       student in 20.
       Not all spending on educational human capital needs to happen through the government: many college
       students in the United States pay a substantial share of the cost of their education. If low-income countries of
       the world are going to experience a widespread increase in their education levels for grade-school children,
       government spending seems likely to play a substantial role. For the U.S. economy, and for other high-income
       countries, the primary focus at this time is more on how to get a bigger return from existing spending on
       education and how to improve the performance of the average high school graduate, rather than dramatic
       increases in education spending.

      How Fiscal Policy Can Improve Technology

       Research and development (R&D) efforts are the lifeblood of new technology. According to the National Science
       Foundation, federal outlays for research, development, and physical plant improvements to various
       governmental agencies have remained at an average of 8.8% of GDP. About one-fifth of U.S. R&D spending goes
       to defense and space-oriented research. Although defense-oriented R&D spending may sometimes produce
       consumer-oriented spinoffs, R&D that is aimed at producing new weapons is less likely to benefit the civilian
       economy than direct civilian R&D spending.
       Fiscal policy can encourage R&D using either direct spending or tax policy. Government could spend more on
       the R&D that it carries out in government laboratories, as well as expanding federal R&D grants to universities
       and colleges, nonprofit organizations, and the private sector. By 2014, the federal share of R&D outlays totaled
       $135.5 billion, or about 4% of the federal government's total budget outlays, according to data from the

National Science Foundation. Fiscal policy can also support R&D through tax incentives, which allow firms to
reduce their tax bill as they increase spending on research and development.

Summary of Fiscal Policy, Investment, and Economic Growth

Investment in physical capital, human capital, and new technology is essential for long-term economic growth,
as Table 31.2 summarizes. In a market-oriented economy, private firms will undertake most of the investment
in physical capital, and fiscal policy should seek to avoid a long series of outsized budget deficits that might
crowd out such investment. We will see the effects of many growth-oriented policies very gradually over time,
as students are better educated, we make physical capital investments, and man invents and implements new
technologies.

Financing Higher Education

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, between 1980 and 2020, the average tuition and fees at a 4-year public
university increased from $738 to $9,349. This represents a more than 12-fold increase in this 40 year period. To
put this increase into perspective, median yearly household income in the U.S. has increased from about $20,000 to
$67,000 during the same time--about a 3.5-fold increase. Clearly, college is becoming increasingly expensive, even
as it continues to provide the same benefits that were mentioned at the beginning of this chapter by President
Lyndon B. Johnson.

Crucial to the mission of higher education is the Pell Grant program, which was initiated by President Johnson as
part of the Higher Education Act of 1965. But Pell Grant amounts have not adequately kept up with the rising costs
of college tuition and fees. As part of President Joe Biden's Build Back Better proposal, the maximum Pell Grant
award would increase to $7,045 between 2022-2025, representing an 8.5% increase, which is one of the largest
1-year increases in the last 20 years (the largest increase occurred between 2009 and 2010, during President
Barack Obama's term in office). The original proposal also aimed to allow for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals
program participants to benefit from the awards, through 2030.

Key Concepts and Summary

31.1 How Government Borrowing Affects Investment and the Trade Balance

A change in any part of the national saving and investment identity suggests that if the government budget
deficit changes, then either private savings, private investment in physical capital, or the trade balance--or
some combination of the three--must change as well.

31.2 Fiscal Policy and the Trade Balance

The government need not balance its budget every year. However, a sustained pattern of large budget deficits
over time risks causing several negative macroeconomic outcomes: a shift to the right in aggregate demand
that causes an inflationary increase in the price level; crowding out private investment in physical capital in a
way that slows down economic growth; and creating a dependence on inflows of international portfolio
investment which can sometimes turn into outflows of foreign financial investment that can be injurious to a
macroeconomy.

31.3 How Government Borrowing Affects Private Saving

The theory of Ricardian equivalence holds that changes in private saving will offset changes in government
borrowing or saving. Thus, greater private saving will offset higher budget deficits, while greater private
borrowing will offset larger budget surpluses. If the theory holds true, then changes in government borrowing
or saving would have no effect on private investment in physical capital or on the trade balance. However,
empirical evidence suggests that the theory holds true only partially.

31.4 Fiscal Policy, Investment, and Economic Growth

Economic growth comes from a combination of investment in physical capital, human capital, and technology.
Government borrowing can crowd out private sector investment in physical capital, but fiscal policy can also
increase investment in publicly owned physical capital, human capital (education), and research and
development. Possible methods for improving education and society's investment in human capital include
spending more money on teachers and other educational resources, and reorganizing the education system to
provide greater incentives for success. Methods for increasing research and development spending to generate
new technology include direct government spending on R&D and tax incentives for businesses to conduct
additional R&D.

      government will finance the difference by selling 10-year government bonds at 12% interest per year.
      Parliament must add the interest on outstanding bonds to government expenditure each year. Assume
      that Parliament places additional taxes to finance this increase in government expenditure so the gap

Introduction to Macroeconomic Policy around the World

         BRING IT HOME
Youth Unemployment

Chad Harding, a young man from Cape Town, South Africa, completed school having done well on his exams. He had
772 32 · Macroeconomic Policy Around the World

       high hopes for the future. Like many young South Africans, however, he had difficulty finding a job. "I was just stuck
       at home waiting, waiting for something to come up," he said in a BBC interview. In South Africa over 60% of young
       adults are unemployed. In fact, the problem is not limited to South Africa. Seventy-three million of the world's youth
       aged 15 to 24 are currently unemployed, according to the International Labour Organization.

       This chapter will look at macroeconomic policies around the world, specifically those related to reducing
       unemployment, promoting economic growth, and stable inflation and exchange rates.

       There are extraordinary differences in the composition and performance of economies across the world. What
       explains these differences? Are countries motivated by similar goals when it comes to macroeconomic policy?
       Can we apply the same macroeconomic framework that we developed in this text to understand the
       performance of these countries? Let's take each of these questions in turn.

       Explaining differences: Recall from Unemployment that we explained the difference in composition and
       performance of economies by appealing to an aggregate production function. We argued that differences in
       productivity explain the diversity of average incomes across the world, which in turn were affected by inputs
       such as capital deepening, human capital, and "technology." Every economy has its own distinctive economic
       characteristics, institutions, history, and political realities, which imply that access to these "ingredients" will
       vary by country and so will economic performance.

       For example, South Korea invested heavily in education and technology to increase agricultural productivity in
       the early 1950s. Some of this investment came from its historical relationship with the United States. As a
       result of these and many other institutions, its economy has managed to converge to the levels of income in
       leading economies like Japan and the United States.

       Similar goals and frameworks: Many economies that have performed well in terms of per capita income
       have--for better or worse--been motivated by a similar goal: to maintain the quality of life of their citizens.
       Quality of life is a broad term, but as you can imagine it includes but is not limited to such things as low level of
       unemployment, price stability (low levels of inflation), and the ability to trade. These seem to be universal
       macroeconomic goals as we discussed in The Macroeconomic Perspective. No country would argue against
       them. To study macroeconomic policy around the world, we begin by comparing standards of living. In
       keeping with these goals, we also look at indicators such as unemployment, inflation, and the balance of trade
       policies across countries. Remember that every country has had a diverse set of experiences; therefore
       although our goals may be similar, each country may well require macroeconomic policies tailored to its
       circumstances.

     32.1 The Diversity of Countries and Economies across the World

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Analyze GDP and GNI per capita as a measure of the diversity of international standards of living
         · Identify what classifies a country as low income, lower-middle income, upper-middle income, or high

             income
         · Explain how geography, demographics, industry structure, and economic institutions influence standards

             of living

       The national economies that comprise the global economy are remarkably diverse. Let us use one key
       indicator of the standard of living, GDP per capita, to quantify this diversity. You will quickly see that

quantifying this diversity is fraught with challenges and limitations. As we explained in The Macroeconomic
Perspective, we must consider using purchasing power parity or "international dollars" to convert average
incomes into comparable units. Purchasing power parity, as we formally defined in Exchange Rates and
International Capital Flows, takes into account that prices of the same good are different across countries.

The Macroeconomic Perspective explained how to measure GDP, the challenges of using GDP to compare
standards of living, and the difficulty of confusing economic size with distribution. In China's case, for
example, China ranks as the second largest global economy, second to only the United States, with Japan
ranking third. However, when we take China's GDP of $9.2 trillion and divide it by its population of 1.4 billion,
then the per capita GDP is only $6,900, which is significantly lower than that of Japan, at $38,500, and that of
the United States, at $52,800. Measurement issues aside, it's worth repeating that the goal, then, is to not only
increase GDP, but to strive toward increased GDP per capita to increase overall living standards for individuals.
As we have learned from Economic Growth, countries can achieve this at the national level by designing
policies that increase worker productivity, deepen capital, and advance technology.

The related measure gross national income (GNI) per capita also allows us to rank countries into high-, upper-
middle-, lower-middle-, or low-income groups. The World Bank updates the classifications each year. Low-
income countries are those with $1,085 per capita GNI per year; lower-middle-income countries have a per
capita GNI between $1,086 and $4,255; upper-middle-income countries have a per capita GDP between
$4,265 and $13,205; while high-income countries have over $13,206 per year per capita income. According to
the 2022 classifications, there are 27 low-income nations and 80 high-income nations. The other 110
measured nations occupy the two tiers of middle-income nations, and are comprised of the vast
majority--75%, of the world's population. Despite the population and quantitative majority, these nations only
produce one third of global GNI and have nearly two-thirds of the world's people living in poverty.

       FIGURE 32.2 Percent of Global GDP and Percent of Population The two pie charts show that low-income countries
       represent less than 1% of global income and make up 8.6% of global population. The combined middle-income

       An overview of the regional averages of GDP per person for developing countries, measured in comparable
       international dollars as well as population in 2018 (Figure 32.3), shows that the differences across these
       regions are stark. As Table 32.2 shows, nominal GDP per capita in 2020 for the 652 million people living in
       Latin America and the Caribbean region (excluding high income countries in that region) was $6,799, which
       far exceeds that of South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. In turn, people in the world's high-income nations, such
       as those who live in the European Union nations or North America, have a per capita GDP three to four times
       that of the people of Latin America. To put things in perspective, North America and the European Union (plus
       the United Kingdom) have slightly more than 10% of the world's population, but they produce and consume
       about 44% of the world's GDP.

       FIGURE 32.3 GDP Per Capita in U.S. Dollars There is a clear imbalance in the GDP across the world. North America,

Such comparisons between regions are admittedly rough. After all, per capita GDP cannot fully capture the
quality of life. Many other factors have a large impact on the standard of living, like health, education, human
rights, crime and personal safety, and environmental quality. These measures also reveal very wide
differences in the standard of living across the regions of the world. Much of this is correlated with per capita
income, but there are exceptions. For example, life expectancy at birth in many low-income regions
approximates those who are more affluent. The data also illustrate that nobody can claim to have perfect
standards of living. For instance, despite very high income levels, there is still undernourishment in Europe
and North America.

Economists know that there are many factors that contribute to your standard of living. People in high-income
countries may have very little time due to heavy workloads and may feel disconnected from their community.
Lower-income countries may be more community centered, but have little in the way of material wealth. It is
hard to measure these characteristics of standard of living. The Organization for Economic Co-Operation and
Development has developed the "OECD Better Life Index." Visit this website (http://openstax.org/l/
standofliving) to see how countries measure up to your expected standard of living.

The differences in economic statistics and other measures of well-being, substantial though they are, do not
fully capture the reasons for the enormous differences between countries. Aside from the neoclassical
determinants of growth, four additional determinants are significant in a wide range of statistical studies and
are worth mentioning: geography, demography, industrial structure, and institutions.

Geographic and Demographic Differences

Countries have geographic differences: some have extensive coastlines, some are landlocked. Some have large
rivers that have been a path of commerce for centuries, or mountains that have been a barrier to trade. Some
have deserts, some have rain forests. These differences create different positive and negative opportunities for
commerce, health, and the environment.
776 32 · Macroeconomic Policy Around the World

       Countries also have considerable differences in the age distribution of the population. Many high-income
       nations are approaching a situation by 2020 or so in which the elderly will form a much larger share of the
       population. Most low-income countries still have a higher proportion of youth and young adults, but by about
       2050, the elderly populations in these low-income countries are expected to boom as well. These demographic
       changes will have considerable impact on the standard of living of the young and the old.

       Differences in Industry Structure and Economic Institutions

       Countries have differences in industry structure. In the world's high-income economies, only about 2% of GDP
       comes from agriculture; the average for the rest of the world is 12%. Countries have strong differences in
       degree of urbanization.

       Countries also have strong differences in economic institutions: some nations have economies that are
       extremely market-oriented, while other nations have command economies. Some nations are open to
       international trade, while others use tariffs and import quotas to limit the impact of trade. Some nations are
       torn by long-standing armed conflicts; other nations are largely at peace. There are also differences in
       political, religious, and social institutions.

       No nation intentionally aims for a low standard of living, high rates of unemployment and inflation, or an
       unsustainable trade imbalance. However, nations will differ in their priorities and in the situations in which
       they find themselves, and so their policy choices can reasonably vary, too. The next modules will discuss how
       nations around the world, from high income to low income, approach the four macroeconomic goals of
       economic growth, low unemployment, low inflation, and a sustainable balance of trade.

     32.2 Improving Countries' Standards of Living

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Analyze the growth policies of low-income countries seeking to improve standards of living
         · Analyze the growth policies of middle-income countries, particularly the East Asian Tigers with their focus

             on technology and market-oriented incentives
         · Analyze the struggles facing economically-challenged countries wishing to enact growth policies
         · Evaluate the success of sending aid to low-income countries

       Jobs are created in economies that grow. What is the origin of economic growth? According to most economists
       who believe in the growth consensus, economic growth (as we discussed in Economic Growth) is built on a
       foundation of productivity improvements. In turn, productivity increases are the result of greater human and
       physical capital and technology, all interacting in a market-driven economy. In the pursuit of economic growth,
       however, some countries and regions start from different levels, as the differences in per capita GDP presented
       earlier in Table 32.2 illustrate.

      Growth Policies for the High-Income Countries

       For the high-income countries, the challenge of economic growth is to push continually for a more educated
       workforce that can create, invest in, and apply new technologies. In effect, the goal of their growth-oriented
       public policy is to shift their aggregate supply curves to the right (refer to The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate
       Supply Model). The main public policies targeted at achieving this goal are fiscal policies focused on
       investment, including investment in human capital, in technology, and in physical plant and equipment. These
       countries also recognize that economic growth works best in a stable and market-oriented economic climate.
       For this reason, they use monetary policy to keep inflation low and stable, and to minimize the risk of
       exchange rate fluctuations, while also encouraging domestic and international competition.

       However, early in the second decade of the 2000s, many high-income countries found themselves more
       focused on the short term than on the long term. The United States, Western Europe, and Japan all
       experienced a combination of financial crisis and deep recession, and the after-effects of the recession--like

high unemployment rates--seemed likely to linger for several years. Most of these governments took
aggressive, and in some cases controversial, steps to jump-start their economies by running very large budget
deficits as part of expansionary fiscal policy. These countries must adopt a course that combines lower
government spending and higher taxes.
Similarly, many central banks ran highly expansionary monetary policies, with both near-zero interest rates
and unconventional loans and investments. For example, in 2012, Shinzo Abe (see Figure 32.4), then newly-
elected Prime Minister of Japan, unveiled a plan to pull his country out of its two-decade-long slump in
economic growth. It included both fiscal stimulus and an increase in the money supply. The plan was
successful in some ways and unsuccessful in others. While real GDP growth in Japan has averaged around 1%
since 2012 (and was only 0.2% in 2014 and 0.7% in 2016) and while the inflation rate has struggled to stay
positive in recent years, the unemployment rate continued to decline through the 2010s. By early 2020, prior
to the pandemic, the unemployment rate stood at just 2.5%. Public debt has also reached a plateau in the last
5-7 years of about 230-240% of GDP, although this number did increase slightly in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Shinzo Abe stepped down as Prime Minister of Japan in 2020, and was assassinated in 2022.

economy, which has helped bring down unemployment, but inflation remains stubbornly low. (Credit: modification

As we discussed in other chapters, macroeconomics needs to have both a short-run and a long-run focus. The
challenge for many of the developed countries in the next few years will be to grapple with the consequences of
the pandemic. With high unemployment and no end of the virus containment in sight, it will be challenging for
these governments to refocus their efforts on new technology, education, and physical capital investment.

Growth Policies for the Middle-Income Economies

The world's great economic success stories in the last few decades began in the 1970s with that group of
nations sometimes known as the East Asian Tigers: South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and
Singapore. The list sometimes includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, although often under international law they
are treated as part of China, rather than as separate countries. The economic growth of the Tigers has been
phenomenal, typically averaging 5.5% real per capita growth for several decades. In the 1980s, other countries
began to show signs of convergence. China began growing rapidly, often at annual rates of 8% to 10% per year.
India began growing rapidly, first at rates of about 5% per year in the 1990s, but then higher still in the first
decade of the 2000s.
We know the underlying causes of these rapid growth rates:

  · China and the East Asian Tigers, in particular, have been among the highest savers in the world, often
      saving one-third or more of GDP as compared to the roughly one-fifth of GDP, which would be a more
      typical saving rate in Latin America and Africa. These countries harnessed higher savings for domestic
      investment to build physical capital.

  · These countries had policies that supported heavy investments in human capital, first building up
      primary-level education and then expanding secondary-level education. Many focused on encouraging
      math and science education, which is useful in engineering and business.
778 32 · Macroeconomic Policy Around the World

         · Governments made a concerted effort to seek out applicable technology, by sending students and
             government commissions abroad to look at the most efficient industrial operations elsewhere. They also
             created policies to support innovative companies that wished to build production facilities to take
             advantage of the abundant and inexpensive human capital.

         · China and India in particular also allowed far greater freedom for market forces, both within their own
             domestic economies and also in encouraging their firms to participate in world markets.

       This combination of technology, human capital, and physical capital, combined with the incentives of a
       market-oriented economic context, proved an extremely powerful stimulant to growth. Challenges that these
       middle-income countries faced are a legacy of government economic controls that for political reasons can be
       dismantled only slowly over time. In many of them, the government heavily regulates the banking and
       financial sector. Governments have also sometimes selected certain industries to receive low-interest loans or
       government subsidies. These economies have found that an increased dose of market-oriented incentives for
       firms and workers has been a critical ingredient in the recipe for faster growth. To learn more about
       measuring economic growth, read the following Clear It Up feature.

                CLEAR IT UP

      What is the rule of 72?

       It is worth pausing a moment to marvel at the East Asian Tigers' growth rates. If per capita GDP grows at, say, 6%
       per year, then you can apply the formula for compound growth rates--that is (1 + 0.06)30--meaning a nation's level
       of per capita GDP will rise by a multiple of almost six over 30 years. Another strategy is to apply the rule of 72. The
       rule of 72 is an approximation to figure out doubling time. We divide the rule number, 72, by the annual growth rate
       to obtain the approximate number of years it will take for income to double. If we have a 6% growth rate, it will take
       72/6, or 12 years, for incomes to double. Using this rule here suggests that a Tiger that grows at 6% will double its
       GDP every 12 years. In contrast, a technological leader, chugging along with per capita growth rates of about 2% per
       year, would double its income in 36 years.

      Growth Policies for Economically-Challenged Countries

       Many economically-challenged or low-income countries are geographically located in Sub-Saharan Africa.
       Other pockets of low income are in the former Soviet Bloc, and in parts of Central America and the Caribbean.
       There are macroeconomic policies and prescriptions that might alleviate the extreme poverty and low
       standard of living. However, many of these countries lack the economic and legal stability, along with market-
       oriented institutions, needed to provide a fertile climate for domestic economic growth and to attract foreign
       investment. Thus, macroeconomic policies for low income economies are vastly different from those of the
       high income economies. The World Bank has made it a priority to combat poverty and raise overall income
       levels through 2030. One of the key obstacles to achieving this is the political instability that seems to be a
       common feature of low-income countries.
       Figure 32.5 shows the ten lowest income countries as ranked by The World Bank in 2020. These countries
       share some common traits, the most significant of which is the recent failures of their governments to provide
       a legal framework for economic growth. Civil and ethnic wars have impacted Burundi. Command economies,
       corruption, as well as political factionalism and infighting are commonly adopted elements in these low-
       income countries. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (often referred to as "Congo") is a resource-wealthy
       country that has not been able to increase its subsistence standard of living due to the political environment.

FIGURE 32.5 The Ten Lowest Income Countries This bar chart that shows the ten lowest-income countries by per
capita income. They are, from lowest income to highest: Burundi, Somalia, Mozambique, Madagascar, Central
African Republic, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Niger, and Sudan. (Source:
http://databank.worldbank.org/data/views/reports/map.aspx#)
Low-income countries are at a disadvantage because any incomes that people receive are spent immediately
on necessities such as food. People in these countries live on less than $1,035 per year, which is less than $100
per month. Lack of saving means a lack of capital accumulation and a lack of loanable funds for investment in
physical and human capital. Recent research by two MIT economists, Abhijit Bannerjee and Esther Duflo, has
confirmed that the households in these economies are trapped in low incomes because they cannot muster
enough investment to push themselves out of poverty.
For example, the average citizen of Burundi, a low-income country, subsists on $239 per year (adjusted to
2020 dollars). According to Central Intelligence Agency data in its CIA Factbook, as of 2021, 85% of Burundi's
population is agrarian, with bananas as the main income producing crop. Only one in two children attends
school and, as Figure 32.6 shows, many are not in schools comparable to what occurs in developed countries.
Political instability has made it difficult for Burundi to make significant headway toward growth, as verified by
the electrification of only 11% of households and 40% of its national income coming from foreign aid.

       The World Factbook website (http://openstax.org/l/worldfactbook) is loaded with maps, flags, and other
       information about countries across the globe.

       Other low-income countries share similar stories. These countries have found it difficult to generate
       investments for themselves or to find foreign investors willing to put up the money for more than the basic
       needs. Foreign aid and external investment comprise significant portions of the income in these economies,
       but are not sufficient to allow for the capital accumulation necessary to invest in physical and human capital.
       However, is foreign aid always a contributor to economic growth?

       Development economics is a branch of economics that often focuses on answering that question and others
       like it. Development economists analyze the forces and outcomes of economics in developing nations. The field
       is typically focused on--and sometimes defined as--understanding and implementing policies and practices to
       improve economic and social wellbeing in low- and middle-income nations or regions. But it is an extremely
       wide and varied area of study, often blending politics, fiscal policy, education, innovation, health and medicine,
       international trade, natural resources, and military/geopolitical considerations.

       Many development economists have focused on understanding the best mix of approaches to foster equitable
       and sustainable growth. Like other economists, they may analyze practices or outcomes from the past and
       apply that knowledge to the present and future. And many prominent development economists challenge
       traditional ways of thinking. Dambisa Moyo, for example, provides evidence indicating that foreign aid is rarely
       a positive solution and often does more harm than good. In her book Dead Aid: Why Aid Is Not Working and
       How There Is Another Way for Africa (2009), she lays out the failure of past aid, indicating that it typically ends
       up in the pockets of corrupt officials and has the adverse effect of minimizing other types of investment. At the
       time, Moyo proposed a complete stoppage of foreign aid into Africa. Moyo sees far greater promise in increases
       in trade and direct private investment, as well as other financing options such as bonds.

                CLEAR IT UP

      Does foreign aid to low-income countries work?

       According to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), about $134 billion per year in
       foreign aid flows from the high-income countries of the world to the low-income ones. Relative to the size of their
       populations or economies, this is not a large amount for either donors or recipients. For low-income countries, aid
       averages about 1.3 percent of their GDP. However, even this relatively small amount has been highly controversial.

       Supporters of additional foreign aid point to the extraordinary human suffering in the world's low-and middle-
       income countries. They see opportunities all across Africa, Asia, and Latin America to set up health clinics and
       schools. They want to help with the task of building economic infrastructure: clean water, plumbing, electricity, and
       roads. Supporters of this aid include formal state-sponsored institutions like the United Kingdom's Department for
       International Development (DFID) or independent non-governmental organizations (NGOs) like CARE International
       that also receive donor government funds. For example, because of an outbreak of meningitis in Ethiopia in 2010,
       DFID channeled significant funds to the Ethiopian Ministry of Health to train rural health care workers and also for
       vaccines. These monies helped the Ministry offset shortfalls in their budget.

       Opponents of increased aid do not quarrel with the goal of reducing human suffering, but they suggest that foreign
       aid has often proved a poor tool for advancing that goal. For example, according to an article in the Attaché Journal
       of International Affairs, the Canadian foreign aid organization (CIDA) provided $100 million to Tanzania to grow
       wheat. The project did produce wheat, but nomadic pastoralists and other villagers who had lived on the land were
       driven off 100,000 acres of land to make way for the project. The damage in terms of human rights and lost
       livelihoods was significant. Villagers were beaten and killed because some refused to leave the land. At times, the

unintended collateral damage from foreign aid can be significant.

William Easterly, professor of economics at New York University, argues that countries often receive aid for political
reasons and the aid does more harm than good. If a country's government creates a reasonably stable and market-
oriented macroeconomic climate, then foreign investors will be likely to provide funds for many profitable activities.
For example, Facebook partnered with multiple organizations in a project called Internet.org to provide access in
remote and low-income areas of the world, and Google began its own initiative called Project Loon in 2011, although
it was phased out in 2021. Facebook's first forays into providing internet access via mobile phones began in stable,
market-oriented countries like India, Brazil, Indonesia, Turkey, and the Philippines and continues its work in Africa
by working with telecommunications corporations in China to develop an undersea cable network.

Policymakers are now wiser about foreign aid limitations than they were a few decades ago. In targeted and specific
cases, especially if foreign aid is channeled to long-term investment projects, foreign aid can have a modest role to
play in reducing the extreme levels of deprivation that hundreds of millions of people around the world experience.

32.3 Causes of Unemployment around the World

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Explain the nature and causes of unemployment
  · Analyze the natural rate of unemployment and the factors that affect it
  · Identify how undeveloped labor markets can result in the same hardships as unemployment

We can categorize the causes of unemployment in the world's high-income countries in two ways: either
cyclical unemployment caused by the economy when in a recession, or the natural rate of unemployment
caused by factors in labor markets, such as government regulations regarding hiring and starting businesses.

Unemployment from a Recession

For unemployment caused by a recession, the Keynesian economic model points out that both monetary and
fiscal policy tools are available. The monetary policy prescription for dealing with recession is straightforward:
run an expansionary monetary policy to increase the quantity of money and loans, drive down interest rates,
and increase aggregate demand. In a recession, there is usually relatively little danger of inflation taking off,
and so even a central bank, with fighting inflation as its top priority, can usually justify some reduction in
interest rates.

With regard to fiscal policy, the automatic stabilizers that we discussed in Government Budgets and Fiscal
Policy should be allowed to work, even if this means larger budget deficits in times of recession. There is less
agreement over whether, in addition to automatic stabilizers, governments in a recession should try to adopt
discretionary fiscal policy of additional tax cuts or spending increases. In the case of the Great Recession, the
case for this kind of extra-aggressive expansionary fiscal policy is stronger, but for a smaller recession, given
the time lags of implementing fiscal policy, countries should use discretionary fiscal policy with caution.

However, the aftermath of the Recession emphasizes that expansionary fiscal and monetary policies do not
turn off a recession like flipping a switch turns off a lamp. Even after a recession is officially over, and positive
growth has returned, it can take some months--or even a couple of years--before private-sector firms believe
the economic climate is healthy enough that they can expand their workforce.

      The Natural Rate of Unemployment

       Unemployment rates in European nations have typically been higher than in the United States. In 2020, before
       the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. unemployment rate was 3.5%, compared with 8.5% in France,
       10% in Italy, and 7.1% in Sweden. We can attribute the pattern of generally higher unemployment rates in
       Europe, which dates back to the 1970s, to the fact that European economies have a higher natural rate of
       unemployment because they have a greater number of rules and restrictions that discourage firms from hiring
       and unemployed workers from taking jobs.

       Addressing the natural rate of unemployment is straightforward in theory but difficult in practice. Government
       can play a useful role in providing unemployment and welfare payments, for example, by passing rules about
       where and when businesses can operate, and assuring that the workplace is safe. However, these well-
       intentioned laws can, in some cases, become so intrusive that businesses decide to place limits on their hiring.

       For example, a law that imposes large costs on a business that tries to fire or lay off workers will mean that
       businesses try to avoid hiring in the first place, as is the case in France. According to Business Week, "France
       has 2.4 times as many companies with 49 employees as with 50 ... according to the French labor code, once a
       company has at least 50 employees inside France, management must create three worker councils, introduce
       profit sharing, and submit restructuring plans to the councils if the company decides to fire workers for
       economic reasons." This labor law essentially limits employment (or raises the natural rate of unemployment).

      Undeveloped and Transitioning Labor Markets

       Low-income and middle-income countries face employment issues that go beyond unemployment as it is
       understood in the high-income economies. A substantial number of workers in these economies provide many
       of their own needs by farming, fishing, or hunting. They barter and trade with others and may take a
       succession of short-term or one-day jobs, sometimes receiving pay with food or shelter, sometimes with
       money. They are not "unemployed" in the sense that we use the term in the United States and Europe, but
       neither are they employed in a regular wage-paying job.

       The starting point of economic activity, as we discussed in Welcome to Economics!, is the division of labor, in
       which workers specialize in certain tasks and trade the fruits of their labor with others. Workers who are not
       connected to a labor market are often unable to specialize very much. Because these workers are not
       "officially" employed, they are often not eligible for social benefits like unemployment insurance or old-age
       payments--if such payments are even available in their country. Helping these workers to become more
       connected to the labor market and the economy is an important policy goal. Recent research by development
       economists suggests that one of the key factors in raising people in low-income countries out of the worst kind
       of poverty is whether they can make a connection to a somewhat regular wage-paying job.

       Economist Sir W. Arthur Lewis examined such transitions of labor and the impact on economic development.
       His core theoretical framework--the dual sector economy--proposes that, essentially, the marginal product of
       low-skilled workers is greater in the manufacturing sector than it is in the agricultural sector. That's because
       most agricultural societies are both mature and have fixed inputs (land, water, and related resources); the
       marginal product of additional farmers on that land is nearly zero, creating what Lewis termed "surplus
       workers." Early-stage manufacturing sectors, however, have great need for low-skilled workers, and can make
       better use (greater marginal product) of them. Their wages will remain low, but as stated above, the wages are
       more likely to be consistent and therefore move toward a large-scale transition of the labor force.

       We have seen this practically in many nations experiencing a shift in labor, particularly in China. In many
       regions, it is marked by a level of migration--people leaving rural areas for cities or manufacturing zones. At
       some point, nations achieve what economists call the Lewis turning point, in which the surplus agricultural
       labor is fully absorbed into the manufacturing sector. Typically, when this occurs, wages in both agricultural
       and manufacturing sectors begin to rise in a sustainable manner. Despite massive transformation in the
       Chinese economy over the past decades, economists dispute whether China has actually reached the Lewis

turning point.

Economic transition is not without its downsides. Many manufacturing-focused countries still rely heavily on
their agricultural sectors for their own sustenance and as a core part of international trade. As the agricultural
sector faces competition from manufacturing, and as people physically leave rural areas, farming economies
can suffer downturns and unpredictability. Finally, countries or individual farmers seeking to make up for
their missing labor may encourage migration and/or immigration that may cause political or financial conflict.

32.4 Causes of Inflation in Various Countries and Regions

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Identify the causes and effects of inflation in various economic markets
  · Explain the significance of a converging economy

Policymakers of the high-income economies appear to have learned some lessons about fighting inflation.
First, whatever happens with aggregate supply and aggregate demand in the short run, countries can use
monetary policy to prevent inflation from becoming entrenched in the economy in the medium and long term.
Second, there is no long-run gain to letting inflation become established. In fact, allowing inflation to become
lasting and persistent poses undesirable risks and tradeoffs. When inflation is high, businesses and
individuals need to spend time and effort worrying about protecting themselves against inflation, rather than
seeking better ways to serve customers. In short, the high-income economies appear to have both a political
consensus to hold inflation low and the economic tools to do so. Despite this, periods of growing inflation can
stagnate economic growth and lead to significant political consequences for leaders. In 2022, the U.S. inflation
rate reached 9.1%, an unexpected peak that the country hadn't seen since 1981. As is often the case, President
Joe Biden was held politically responsible, and negotiated with Congress to pass a massive economic and
climate bill titled the Inflation Reduction Act.

In a number of middle- and low-income economies around the world, inflation is far from a solved problem. In
the early 2000s, Turkey experienced inflation of more than 50% per year for several years and continues to
experience high inflation today. Belarus had inflation of about 100% per year from 2000 to 2001. From 2008 to
2010, Venezuela and Myanmar had inflation rates of 20% to 30% per year. Indonesia, Iran, Nigeria, the Russian
Federation, and Ukraine all had double-digit inflation for most of the years from 2000 to 2010. Zimbabwe had
hyperinflation, with inflation rates that went from more than 100% per year in the mid-2000s to a rate of
several million percent in 2008.

In these countries, the problem of very high inflation generally arises from huge budget deficits, which the
government finances by printing its domestic currency. This is a case of "too much money chasing too few
goods." In the case of Venezuela, beginning in 2016 the government covered its widening deficits by printing
ever higher currency notes, with inflation reaching 1,000,000% by 2018. The crisis continues today, with high
rates of inflation and high unemployment (over 40%). There is some discussion of dollarization, or a
conversion from Venezuelan bolivars to U.S. dollars as the main currency, as a solution to the hyperinflation.
Even in 2019, over 50% of transactions in Venezuela were reportedly using U.S. dollars, and banks issued debit
cards denominated in U.S. dollars in 2021.

A number of countries have managed to sustain solid levels of economic growth for sustained periods of time
with inflation levels that would sound high by recent U.S. standards, like 10% to 30% per year. In such
economies, the governments index most contracts, wage levels, and interest rates to inflation. Indexing wage
contracts and interest rates means that they will increase when inflation increases to retain purchasing power.
When wages do not rise as price levels rise, this leads to a decline in the real wage rate and a decrease in the
standard of living. Likewise, interest rates that are not indexed mean that money lenders will receive payment
in devalued currency and will also lose purchasing power on monies that they lent. It is clearly possible--and
perhaps sometimes necessary--for a converging economy (the economy of a country that demonstrates the
784 32 · Macroeconomic Policy Around the World

       ability to catch up to the technology leaders) to live with a degree of uncertainty over inflation that would be
       politically unacceptable in the high-income economies.

     32.5 Balance of Trade Concerns

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain the meaning of trade balance and its implications for the foreign exchange market
         · Analyze concerns over international trade in goods and services and international flows of capital
         · Identify and evaluate market-oriented economic reforms

       In the 1950s and 1960s, and even into the 1970s, low- and middle-income countries often viewed openness to
       global flows of goods, services, and financial capital in a negative light. These countries feared that foreign
       trade would mean both economic losses as high-income trading partners "exploited" their economy and they
       lost domestic political control to powerful business interests and multinational corporations.

       These negative feelings about international trade have evolved. After all, the great economic success stories of
       recent years like Japan, the East Asian Tiger economies, China, and India, all took advantage of opportunities
       to sell in global markets. European economies thrive with high levels of trade. In the North American Free
       Trade Agreement (NAFTA), 1 the United States, Canada, and Mexico pledged themselves to reduce trade
       barriers. Many countries have clearly learned that reducing barriers to trade is at least potentially beneficial to
       the economy. Many smaller world economies have learned an even tougher lesson: if they do not participate
       actively in world trade, they are unlikely to join the success stories among the converging economies. There
       are no examples in world history of small economies that remained apart from the global economy but still
       attained a high standard of living.

       Although almost every country now claims that its goal is to participate in global trade, the possible negative
       consequences have remained highly controversial. It is useful to divide these possible negative consequences
       into issues involving trade of goods and services and issues involving international capital flows. These issues
       are related, but not the same. An economy may have a high level of trade in goods and services relative to GDP,
       but if exports and imports are balanced, the net flow of foreign investment in and out of the economy will be
       zero. Conversely, an economy may have only a moderate level of trade relative to GDP, but find that it has a
       substantial current account trade imbalance. Thus, it is useful to consider the concerns over international
       trade of goods and services and international flows of financial capital separately.

      Concerns over International Trade in Goods and Services

       There is a long list of worries about foreign trade in goods and services: fear of job loss, environmental
       dangers, unfair labor practices, and many other concerns. We discuss these arguments at some length in the
       chapter on The International Trade and Capital Flows.

       Of all of the arguments for limitations on trade, perhaps the most controversial one among economists is the
       infant industry argument; that is, subsidizing or protecting new industries for a time until they become
       established. (Globalization and Protectionism explains this concept in more detail.) Countries have used such
       policies with some success at certain points in time, but in the world as a whole, support for key industries is
       far more often directed at long-established industries with substantial political power that are suffering losses
       and laying off workers, rather than potentially vibrant new industries that are not yet established. If
       government intends to favor certain industries, it needs to do so in a way that is temporary and that orients
       them toward a future of market competition, rather than a future of unending government subsidies and trade
       protection.

         1 As of July 1, 2020, NAFTA was officially replaced with the United States-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) free trade agreement. It is
         broadly similar to the original NAFTA.

Concerns over International Flows of Capital

Recall from The Macroeconomic Perspective that a trade deficit exists when a nation's imports exceed its
exports. In order for a trade deficit to take place, foreign countries must provide loans or investments, which
they are willing to do because they expect eventual repayment (that the deficit will become a surplus). A trade
surplus, you may remember, exists when a nation's exports exceed its imports. Thus, in order for a trade deficit
to switch to a trade surplus, a nation's exports must rise and its imports must fall. Sometimes this happens
when the currency decreases in value. For example, if the U.S. had a trade deficit and the dollar depreciated,
imports would become more expensive. This would, in turn, benefit the foreign countries that provided the
loans or investments.

The expected pattern of trade imbalances in the world economy has been that high-income economies will run
trade surpluses, which means they will experience a net outflow of capital to foreign destinations or export
more than they import, while low- and middle-income economies will run trade deficits, which means that
they will experience a net inflow of foreign capital.

This international investing pattern can benefit all sides. Investors in the high-income countries benefit
because they can receive high returns on their investments, and also because they can diversify their
investments so that they are at less risk of a downturn in their own domestic economy. The low-income
economies that receive an inflow of capital presumably have potential for rapid catch-up economic growth,
and they can use the international financial capital inflow to help spur their physical capital investment. In
addition, financial capital inflows often come with management abilities, technological expertise, and training.

However, for the last couple of decades, this cheerful scenario has faced two "dark clouds." The first cloud is
the very large trade or current account deficits in the U.S. economy. (See The International Trade and Capital
Flows.) Instead of offering net financial investment abroad, the U.S. economy is soaking up savings from all
over the world. These substantial U.S. trade deficits may not be sustainable according to Sebastian Edwards
writing for the National Bureau of Economic Research. While trade deficits on their own are not bad, the
question is whether governments will reduce them gradually or hastily. In the gradual scenario, U.S. exports
could grow more rapidly than imports over a period of years, aided by U.S. dollar depreciation. An unintended
consequence of the slow growth since the Great Recession has been a decline in the U.S. current account
deficit's from 6% pre-recession to 3% most recently.

The other option is that the government could reduce the U.S. trade deficit in a rush. Here is one scenario: if
foreign investors became less willing to hold U.S. dollar assets, the dollar exchange rate could weaken. As
speculators see this process happening, they might rush to unload their dollar assets, which would drive the
dollar down still further.

A lower U.S. dollar would stimulate aggregate demand by making exports cheaper and imports more
expensive. It would mean higher prices for imported inputs throughout the economy, shifting the short-term
aggregate supply curve to the left. The result could be a burst of inflation and, if the Federal Reserve were to
run a tight monetary policy to reduce the inflation, it could also lead to recession. People sometimes talk as if
the U.S. economy, with its great size, is invulnerable to this sort of pressure from international markets. While
it is difficult to rock, it is not impossible for the $17 trillion U.S. economy to face these international pressures.

The second "dark cloud" is how the smaller world economies should deal with the possibility of sudden foreign
financial capital inflows and outflows. Perhaps the most vivid recent example of the potentially destructive
forces of international capital movements occurred in the East Asian Tiger economies in 1997-1998. Thanks
to their excellent growth performance over the previous few decades, these economies had attracted
considerable interest from foreign investors. In the mid-1990s, however, foreign investment into these
countries surged even further. Much of this money funneled through banks that borrowed in U.S. dollars and
loaned in their national currencies. Bank lending surged at rates of 20% per year or more. This inflow of
foreign capital meant that investment in these economies exceeded the level of domestic savings, so that
786 32 · Macroeconomic Policy Around the World

       current account deficits in these countries jumped into the 5-10% GDP range.
       The surge in bank lending meant that many banks in these East Asian countries did not do an especially good
       job of screening out safe and unsafe borrowers. Many of the loans--as high as 10% to 15% of all loans in some
       of these countries--started to turn bad. Fearing losses, foreign investors started pulling out their money. As the
       foreign money left, the exchange rates of these countries crashed, often falling by 50% or more in a few
       months. The banks were stuck with a mismatch: even if the rest of their domestic loans were repaid, they could
       never pay back the U.S. dollars that they owed. The banking sector as a whole went bankrupt. The lack of credit
       and lending in the economy collapsed aggregate demand, bringing on a deep recession.
       If the flow and ebb of international capital markets can flip even the economies of the East Asian Tigers, with
       their stellar growth records, into a recession, then it is no wonder that other middle- and low-income countries
       around the world are concerned. Moreover, similar episodes of an inflow and then an outflow of foreign
       financial capital have rocked a number of economies around the world: for example, in the last few years,
       economies like Ireland, Iceland, and Greece have all experienced severe shocks when foreign lenders decided
       to stop extending funds. Especially in Greece, this caused the government to enact austerity measures which
       led to protests throughout the country (Figure 32.7).

       FIGURE 32.7 Protests in Greece The economic conditions in Greece have deteriorated from the Great Recession
       such that the government had to enact austerity measures, (strict rules) cutting wages and increasing taxes on its
       population. Massive protests are but one byproduct. (Credit: modification of work by Apostolos/Flickr Creative
       Commons)
       Many nations are taking steps to reduce the risk that their economy will be injured if foreign financial capital
       takes flight, including having their central banks hold large reserves of foreign exchange and stepping up their
       regulation of domestic banks to avoid a wave of imprudent lending. The most controversial steps in this area
       involve whether countries should try to take steps to control or reduce the flows of foreign capital. If a country
       could discourage some speculative short-term capital inflow, and instead only encourage investment capital
       that it committed for the medium and the long term, then it could be at least somewhat less susceptible to
       swings in the sentiments of global investors.
       If economies participate in the global trade of goods and services, they will also need to participate in
       international flows of financial payments and investments. These linkages can offer great benefits to an
       economy. However, any nation that is experiencing a substantial and sustained pattern of trade deficits, along
       with the corresponding net inflow of international financial capital, has some reason for concern. During the
       Asian Financial Crisis in the late 1990s, countries that grew dramatically in the years leading up to the crisis as
       international capital flowed in, saw their economies collapse when the capital very quickly flowed out.

Market-Oriented Economic Reforms

The standard of living has increased dramatically for billions of people around the world in the last half
century. Such increases have occurred not only in the technological leaders like the United States, Canada, the
nations of Europe, and Japan, but also in the East Asian Tigers and in many nations of Latin America and
Eastern Europe. The challenge for most of these countries is to maintain these growth rates. The economically-
challenged regions of the world have stagnated and become stuck in poverty traps. These countries need to
focus on the basics: health and education, or human capital development. As Figure 32.8 illustrates, modern
technology allows for the investment in education and human capital development in ways that would have not
been possible just a few short years ago.

FIGURE 32.8 Solar-powered Technology Modern technologies, such as solar-power and Wi-Fi, enable students to

Other than the issue of economic growth, the other three main goals of macroeconomic policy--that is, low
unemployment, low inflation, and a sustainable balance of trade--all involve situations in which, for some
reason, the economy fails to coordinate the forces of supply and demand. In the case of cyclical
unemployment, for example, the intersection of aggregate supply and aggregate demand occurs at a level of
output below potential GDP. In the case of the natural rate of unemployment, government regulations create a
situation where otherwise-willing employers become unwilling to hire otherwise-willing workers. Inflation is a
situation in which aggregate demand outstrips aggregate supply, at least for a time, so that too much buying
power is chasing too few goods. A trade imbalance is a situation where, because of a net inflow or outflow of
foreign capital, domestic savings are not aligned with domestic investment. Each of these situations can create
a range of easier or harder policy choices.

         BRING IT HOME
Youth Unemployment

Spain and South Africa had the same high youth unemployment in 2020, but the reasons for this unemployment are
different. Spain's current account balance is negative, which means it is borrowing heavily. To cure cyclical
unemployment during a recession, the Keynesian model suggests increases in government spending--fiscal
expansion or monetary expansion. Neither option is open to Spain. It currently can borrow at only high interest
rates, which will be a real problem in terms of debt service. In addition, the rest of the European Union (EU) has
dragged its feet when it comes to debt forgiveness. Monetary expansion is not possible because Spain uses the euro
and cannot devalue its currency unless it convinces all of the EU to do so. What can be done? The Economist,
788 32 · Macroeconomic Policy Around the World

       summarizing some ideas of economists and policymakers, suggests that Spain's only realistic (although painful)
       option is to reduce government-mandated wages, which would allow it to reduce government spending. As a result,
       the government would be able to lower tax rates on the working population. With a lower wage or lower tax
       environment, firms will hire more workers. This will lower unemployment and stimulate the economy. Spain can also
       encourage greater foreign investment and try to promote policies that encourage domestic savings.
       South Africa has more of a natural rate of unemployment problem. It is an interesting case because its youth
       unemployment is mostly because its young are not ready to work. Economists commonly refer to this as an
       employability problem. According to interviews of South African firms as reported in the Economist, the young are
       academically smart but lack practical skills for the workplace. Despite a big push to increase investment in human
       capital, the results have not yet borne fruit. Recently the government unveiled a plan to pay unemployed youth while
       they were "trained-up" or apprenticed in South African firms. The government has room to increase fiscal
       expenditure, encourage domestic savings, and continue to fund investment in education, vocational training, and
       apprentice programs. South Africa can also improve the climate for foreign investment from technology leaders,
       which would encourage economic growth.
       India has a smaller youth employment problem in terms of percentages. However, bear in mind that since this is a
       populous country, it turns out to be a significant problem in raw numbers. According to Kaushik Basu, writing for the
       BBC, "there are 45 national laws governing the hiring and firing decisions of firms and close to four times that
       amount at the state level". These laws make it difficult for companies to fire workers. To stay nimble and responsive
       to markets, Indian companies respond to these laws by hiring fewer workers. The Indian government can do much
       to solve this problem by adjusting its labor laws. Essentially, the government has to remove itself from firms' hiring
       and firing decisions, so that growing Indian firms can freely employ more workers. Indian workers, like those in
       South Africa, do not have workforce skills. Again, the government can increase its spending on education, vocational
       training, and workforce readiness programs.
       Finally, India has a significant current account deficit. This deficit is mainly a result of short- and long-term capital
       flows. To solve this deficit, India has experimented by lifting the limitation on domestic savers from investing
       abroad. This is a step in the right direction that may dampen the growth in the current account deficit. A final policy
       possibility is to improve domestic capital markets so many self-employed Indians can obtain access to capital to
       realize their business ideas. If more Indians can obtain access to capital to start businesses, employment might
       increase.

Key Concepts and Summary

32.1 The Diversity of Countries and Economies across the World

Macroeconomic policy goals for most countries strive toward low levels of unemployment and inflation, as well
as stable trade balances. Economists analyze countries based on their GDP per person and ranked as low-,
middle-, and high-income countries. Low-income are those earning less than $1,025 (less than 1%) of global
income. They currently have 18.5% of the world population. Middle-income countries are those with per
capital income of $1,025-$12,475 (31.1% of global income). They have 69.5% of world population. High-
income countries are those with per capita income greater than $12,475 (68.3% of global income). They have
12% of the world's population. Regional comparisons tend to be inaccurate because even countries within
those regions tend to differ from each other.

32.2 Improving Countries' Standards of Living

The fundamentals of growth are the same in every country: improvements in human capital, physical capital,
and technology interacting in a market-oriented economy. Countries that are high-income tend to focus on
developing and using new technology. Countries that are middle-income focus on increasing human capital
and becoming more connected to technology and global markets. They have charted unconventional paths by
relying more on state-led support rather than relying solely on markets. Low-income, economically-challenged
countries have many health and human development needs, but they are also challenged by the lack of
investment and foreign aid to develop infrastructure like roads. There are some bright spots when it comes to
financial development and mobile communications, which suggest that low-income countries can become
technology leaders in their own right, but it is too early to claim victory. These countries must do more to

We can address cyclical unemployment by expansionary fiscal and monetary policy. The natural rate of
unemployment can be harder to solve, because it involves thinking carefully about the tradeoffs involved in
laws that affect employment and hiring. Unemployment is understood differently in high-income countries
compared to low- and middle-income countries. People in these countries are not "unemployed" in the sense
that we use the term in the United States and Europe, but neither are they employed in a regular wage-paying
job. While some may have regular wage-paying jobs, others are part of a barter economy.

32.4 Causes of Inflation in Various Countries and Regions

Most high-income economies have learned that their central banks can control inflation in the medium and
the long term. In addition, they have learned that inflation has no long-term benefits but potentially
790 32 · Self-Check Questions

substantial long-term costs if it distracts businesses from focusing on real productivity gains. However,
smaller economies around the world may face more volatile inflation because their smaller economies can be
unsettled by international movements of capital and goods.

32.5 Balance of Trade Concerns

There are many legitimate concerns over possible negative consequences of free trade. Perhaps the single
strongest response to these concerns is that there are good ways to address them without restricting trade and
thus losing its benefits. There are two major issues involving trade imbalances. One is what will happen with
the large U.S. trade deficits, and whether they will come down gradually or with a rush. The other is whether
smaller countries around the world should take some steps to limit flows of international capital, in the hope
that they will not be quite so susceptible to economic whiplash from international financial capital flowing in
and out of their economies.

  · Absolute and Comparative Advantage
  · What Happens When a Country Has an Absolute Advantage in All Goods
  · Intra-industry Trade between Similar Economies
  · The Benefits of Reducing Barriers to International Trade

Introduction to International Trade

         BRING IT HOME

Just Whose iPhone Is It?

The iPhone is a global product. Apple does not manufacture the iPhone components, nor does it assemble them.
The assembly is done by Foxconn Corporation, a Taiwanese company, at its factories in China and India. But,
Samsung, the electronics firm and competitor to Apple, actually supplies many of the parts that make up an iPhone.
In earlier models, Samsung parts made up as much as 26% of the total costs of production. And in more recent
versions, Samsung manufactures the displays and cameras. In some ways, then, Samsung is both the biggest
794 33 · International Trade

       supplier and biggest competitor for Apple. Why do these two firms work together to produce the iPhone? To
       understand the economic logic behind international trade, you have to accept, as these firms do, that trade is about
       mutually beneficial exchange. Samsung is one of the world's largest electronics parts suppliers. Apple lets Samsung
       focus on making the best parts, which allows Apple to concentrate on its strength--designing elegant products that
       are easy to use. If each company (and by extension each country) focuses on what it does best, there will be gains
       for all through trade.

       We live in a global marketplace. The food on your table might include fresh fruit from Chile, cheese from
       France, and bottled water from Scotland. Your wireless phone might have been made in Taiwan or Korea. The
       clothes you wear might be designed in Italy and manufactured in China. The toys you give to a child might have
       come from India. The car you drive might come from Japan, Germany, or Korea. The gasoline in the tank might
       be refined from crude oil from Saudi Arabia, Mexico, or Nigeria. As a worker, if your job is involved with
       farming, machinery, airplanes, cars, scientific instruments, or many other technology-related industries, the
       odds are good that a hearty proportion of the sales of your employer--and hence the money that pays your
       salary--comes from export sales. We are all linked by international trade, and the volume of that trade has
       grown dramatically in the last few decades.

       The first wave of globalization started in the nineteenth century and lasted up to the beginning of World War I.
       Over that time, global exports as a share of global GDP rose from less than 1% of GDP in 1820 to 9% of GDP in
       1913. As the Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman of Princeton University wrote in 1995:

             It is a late-twentieth-century conceit that we invented the global economy just yesterday. In fact, world
             markets achieved an impressive degree of integration during the second half of the nineteenth
             century. Indeed, if one wants a specific date for the beginning of a truly global economy, one might
             well choose 1869, the year in which both the Suez Canal and the Union Pacific railroad were
             completed. By the eve of the First World War steamships and railroads had created markets for
             standardized commodities, like wheat and wool, that were fully global in their reach. Even the global
             flow of information was better than modern observers, focused on electronic technology, tend to
             realize: the first submarine telegraph cable was laid under the Atlantic in 1858, and by 1900 all of the
             world's major economic regions could effectively communicate instantaneously.

       This first wave of globalization crashed to a halt early in the twentieth century. World War I severed many
       economic connections. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, many nations misguidedly tried to fix their
       own economies by reducing foreign trade with others. World War II further hindered international trade.
       Global flows of goods and financial capital were rebuilt only slowly after World War II. It was not until the early
       1980s that global economic forces again became as important, relative to the size of the world economy, as
       they were before World War I.

     33.1 Absolute and Comparative Advantage

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Define absolute advantage, comparative advantage, and opportunity costs
         · Explain the gains of trade created when a country specializes

       The American statesman Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790) once wrote: "No nation was ever ruined by trade."
       Many economists would express their attitudes toward international trade in an even more positive manner.
       The evidence that international trade confers overall benefits on economies is pretty strong. Trade has
       accompanied economic growth in the United States and around the world. Many of the national economies
       that have shown the most rapid growth in the last several decades--for example, Japan, South Korea, China,
       and India--have done so by dramatically orienting their economies toward international trade. There is no
       modern example of a country that has shut itself off from world trade and yet prospered. To understand the

benefits of trade, or why we trade in the first place, we need to understand the concepts of comparative and
absolute advantage.

In 1817, David Ricardo, a businessman, economist, and member of the British Parliament, wrote a treatise
called On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation. In this treatise, Ricardo argued that specialization
and free trade benefit all trading partners, even those that may be relatively inefficient. To see what he meant,
we must be able to distinguish between absolute and comparative advantage.

A country has an absolute advantage over another country in producing a good if it can produce more of that
good. Absolute advantage can be the result of a country's having more resources, having more productive
resources, or its natural endowment. For example, extracting oil in Saudi Arabia is pretty much just a matter of
"drilling a hole." Producing oil in other countries can require considerable exploration and costly technologies
for drilling and extraction--if they have any oil at all. The United States has some of the richest farmland in the
world, making it easier to grow corn and wheat than in many other countries. Guatemala and Colombia have
climates especially suited for growing coffee. Chile and Zambia have some of the world's richest copper mines.
As some have argued, "geography is destiny." Chile will provide copper and Guatemala will produce coffee, and
they will trade. When each country has a product others need and it can produce it with fewer resources in one
country than in another, then it is easy to imagine all parties benefitting from trade. However, thinking about
trade just in terms of geography and absolute advantage is incomplete. Trade really occurs because of
comparative advantage.

Recall from the chapter Choice in a World of Scarcity that a country has a comparative advantage when it can
produce a good at a lower cost in terms of other goods. The question each country or company should be
asking when it trades is this: "What do we give up to produce this good?" It should be no surprise that the
concept of comparative advantage is based on this idea of opportunity cost from Choice in a World of Scarcity.
For example, if Zambia focuses its resources on producing copper, it cannot use its labor, land and financial
resources to produce other goods such as corn. As a result, Zambia gives up the opportunity to produce corn.
How do we quantify the cost in terms of other goods? Simplify the problem and assume that Zambia just needs
labor to produce copper and corn. The companies that produce either copper or corn tell you that it takes two
hours to mine a ton of copper and one hour to harvest a bushel of corn. This means the opportunity cost of
producing a ton of copper is two bushels of corn. The next section develops absolute and comparative
advantage in greater detail and relates them to trade.

A Numerical Example of Absolute and Comparative Advantage

Consider a hypothetical world with two countries, Saudi Arabia and the United States, and two products, oil
and corn. Further assume that consumers in both countries desire both these goods. These goods are
homogeneous, meaning that consumers/producers cannot differentiate between corn or oil from either
country. There is only one resource available in both countries, labor hours. Saudi Arabia can produce oil with
fewer resources, while the United States can produce corn with fewer resources. Table 33.1 illustrates the
advantages of the two countries, expressed in terms of how many hours it takes to produce one unit of each
good.

                              TABLE 33.1 How Many Hours It Takes to Produce Oil and Corn

In Table 33.1, Saudi Arabia has an absolute advantage in producing oil because it only takes an hour to
produce a barrel of oil compared to two hours in the United States. The United States has an absolute
advantage in producing corn.

To simplify, let's say that Saudi Arabia and the United States each have 100 worker hours (see Table 33.2).
Figure 33.2 illustrates what each country is capable of producing on its own using a production possibility
frontier (PPF) graph. Recall from Choice in a World of Scarcity that the production possibilities frontier shows
the maximum amount that each country can produce given its limited resources, in this case workers, and its
level of technology.

leaving 40 work hours that to allocate to produce 10 bushels of corn, using the data in Table 33.1. (b) If the United
States produces only oil, it can produce, at maximum, 50 barrels and zero corn (point A'), or at the other extreme, it
can produce a maximum of 100 bushels of corn and no oil (point B'). Other combinations of both oil and corn are

resources and technology.

Arguably Saudi and U.S. consumers desire both oil and corn to live. Let's say that before trade occurs, both
countries produce and consume at point C or C'. Thus, before trade, the Saudi Arabian economy will devote 60
worker hours to produce oil, as Table 33.3 shows. Given the information in Table 33.1, this choice implies that
it produces/consumes 60 barrels of oil. With the remaining 40 worker hours, since it needs four hours to
produce a bushel of corn, it can produce only 10 bushels. To be at point C', the U.S. economy devotes 40 worker
hours to produce 20 barrels of oil and it can allocate the remaining worker hours to produce 60 bushels of
corn.

           TABLE 33.3 Production before Trade

The slope of the production possibility frontier illustrates the opportunity cost of producing oil in terms of
corn. Using all its resources, the United States can produce 50 barrels of oil or 100 bushels of corn; therefore,
the opportunity cost of one barrel of oil is two bushels of corn--or the slope is 1/2. Thus, in the U.S. production
possibility frontier graph, every increase in oil production of one barrel implies a decrease of two bushels of
corn. Saudi Arabia can produce 100 barrels of oil or 25 bushels of corn. The opportunity cost of producing one
barrel of oil is the loss of 1/4 of a bushel of corn that Saudi workers could otherwise have produced. In terms of
corn, notice that Saudi Arabia gives up the least to produce a barrel of oil. Table 33.4 summarizes these
calculations.

TABLE 33.4 Opportunity Cost and Comparative Advantage

Again recall that we defined comparative advantage as the opportunity cost of producing goods. Since Saudi
Arabia gives up the least to produce a barrel of oil, ( < in Table 33.4) it has a comparative advantage in oil
production. The United States gives up the least to produce a bushel of corn, so it has a comparative advantage
in corn production.

In this example, there is symmetry between absolute and comparative advantage. Saudi Arabia needs fewer
worker hours to produce oil (absolute advantage, see Table 33.1), and also gives up the least in terms of other
goods to produce oil (comparative advantage, see Table 33.4). Such symmetry is not always the case, as we will
show after we have discussed gains from trade fully, but first, read the following Clear It Up feature to make
sure you understand why the PPF line in the graphs is straight.
798 33 · International Trade

         CLEAR IT UP

Can a production possibility frontier be straight?

When you first met the production possibility frontier (PPF) in the chapter on Choice in a World of Scarcity we drew it
with an outward-bending shape. This shape illustrated that as we transferred inputs from producing one good to
another--like from education to health services--there were increasing opportunity costs. In the examples in this
chapter, we draw the PPFs as straight lines, which means that opportunity costs are constant. When we transfer a
marginal unit of labor away from growing corn and toward producing oil, the decline in the quantity of corn and the
increase in the quantity of oil is always the same. In reality this is possible only if the contribution of additional
workers to output did not change as the scale of production changed. The linear production possibilities frontier is a
less realistic model, but a straight line simplifies calculations. It also illustrates economic themes like absolute and
comparative advantage just as clearly.

Gains from Trade

Consider the trading positions of the United States and Saudi Arabia after they have specialized and traded.
Before trade, Saudi Arabia produces/consumes 60 barrels of oil and 10 bushels of corn. The United States
produces/consumes 20 barrels of oil and 60 bushels of corn. Given their current production levels, if the
United States can trade an amount of corn fewer than 60 bushels and receive in exchange an amount of oil
greater than 20 barrels, it will gain from trade. With trade, the United States can consume more of both goods
than it did without specialization and trade. (Recall that the chapter Welcome to Economics! defined
specialization as it applies to workers and firms. Economists also use specialization to describe the occurrence
when a country shifts resources to focus on producing a good that offers comparative advantage.) Similarly, if
Saudi Arabia can trade an amount of oil less than 60 barrels and receive in exchange an amount of corn
greater than 10 bushels, it will have more of both goods than it did before specialization and trade. Table 33.5
illustrates the range of trades that would benefit both sides.

    The U.S. economy, after specialization, will     The Saudi Arabian economy, after specialization, will
                          benefit if it:                                          benefit if it:

Exports no more than 60 bushels of corn           Imports at least 10 bushels of corn

Imports at least 20 barrels of oil                Exports less than 60 barrels of oil

TABLE 33.5 The Range of Trades That Benefit Both the United States and Saudi Arabia

The underlying reason why trade benefits both sides is rooted in the concept of opportunity cost, as the
following Clear It Up feature explains. If Saudi Arabia wishes to expand domestic production of corn in a world
without international trade, then based on its opportunity costs it must give up four barrels of oil for every one
additional bushel of corn. If Saudi Arabia could find a way to give up less than four barrels of oil for an
additional bushel of corn (or equivalently, to receive more than one bushel of corn for four barrels of oil), it
would be better off.

         CLEAR IT UP

What are the opportunity costs and gains from trade?

The range of trades that will benefit each country is based on the country's opportunity cost of producing each good.
The United States can produce 100 bushels of corn or 50 barrels of oil. For the United States, the opportunity cost of

producing one barrel of oil is two bushels of corn. If we divide the numbers above by 50, we get the same ratio: one
barrel of oil is equivalent to two bushels of corn, or (100/50 = 2 and 50/50 = 1). In a trade with Saudi Arabia, if the
United States is going to give up 100 bushels of corn in exports, it must import at least 50 barrels of oil to be just as
well off. Clearly, to gain from trade it needs to be able to gain more than a half barrel of oil for its bushel of corn--or
why trade at all?

Recall that David Ricardo argued that if each country specializes in its comparative advantage, it will benefit
from trade, and total global output will increase. How can we show gains from trade as a result of comparative
advantage and specialization? Table 33.6 shows the output assuming that each country specializes in its
comparative advantage and produces no other good. This is 100% specialization. Specialization leads to an
increase in total world production. (Compare the total world production in Table 33.3 to that in Table 33.6.)

TABLE 33.6 How Specialization Expands Output

What if we did not have complete specialization, as in Table 33.6? Would there still be gains from trade?
Consider another example, such as when the United States and Saudi Arabia start at C and C', respectively, as
Figure 33.2 shows. Consider what occurs when trade is allowed and the United States exports 20 bushels of
corn to Saudi Arabia in exchange for 20 barrels of oil.

FIGURE 33.3 Production Possibilities Frontier in Saudi Arabia Trade allows a country to go beyond its domestic

production-possibility frontier

Starting at point C, which shows Saudi oil production of 60, reduce Saudi oil domestic oil consumption by 20,
since 20 is exported to the United States and exchanged for 20 units of corn. This enables Saudi to reach point
D, where oil consumption is now 40 barrels and corn consumption has increased to 30 (see Figure 33.3).
Notice that even without 100% specialization, if the "trading price," in this case 20 barrels of oil for 20 bushels
of corn, is greater than the country's opportunity cost, the Saudis will gain from trade. Since the post-trade
consumption point D is beyond its production possibility frontier, Saudi Arabia has gained from trade.

33.2 What Happens When a Country Has an Absolute Advantage in All Goods

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Show the relationship between production costs and comparative advantage
  · Identify situations of mutually beneficial trade
  · Identify trade benefits by considering opportunity costs

What happens to the possibilities for trade if one country has an absolute advantage in everything? This is
typical for high-income countries that often have well-educated workers, technologically advanced equipment,
and the most up-to-date production processes. These high-income countries can produce all products with
fewer resources than a low-income country. If the high-income country is more productive across the board,
will there still be gains from trade? Good students of Ricardo understand that trade is about mutually
beneficial exchange. Even when one country has an absolute advantage in all products, trade can still benefit
both sides. This is because gains from trade come from specializing in one's comparative advantage.

Production Possibilities and Comparative Advantage

Consider the example of trade between the United States and Mexico described in Table 33.7. In this example,
it takes four U.S. workers to produce 1,000 pairs of shoes, but it takes five Mexican workers to do so. It takes
one U.S. worker to produce 1,000 refrigerators, but it takes four Mexican workers to do so. The United States
has an absolute advantage in productivity with regard to both shoes and refrigerators; that is, it takes fewer
workers in the United States than in Mexico to produce both a given number of shoes and a given number of
refrigerators.

Country  Number of Workers needed to produce     Number of Workers needed to produce 1,000
                      1,000 units -- Shoes                        units -- Refrigerators

United   4 workers                            1 worker
States
                                              4 workers
Mexico 5 workers

TABLE 33.7 Resources Needed to Produce Shoes and Refrigerators

Absolute advantage simply compares the productivity of a worker between countries. It answers the question,
"How many inputs do I need to produce shoes in Mexico?" Comparative advantage asks this same question
slightly differently. Instead of comparing how many workers it takes to produce a good, it asks, "How much am
I giving up to produce this good in this country?" Another way of looking at this is that comparative advantage
identifies the good for which the producer's absolute advantage is relatively larger, or where the producer's

                            33.2 · What Happens When a Country Has an Absolute Advantage in All Goods 801

absolute productivity disadvantage is relatively smaller. The United States can produce 1,000 shoes with four-
fifths as many workers as Mexico (four versus five), but it can produce 1,000 refrigerators with only one-
quarter as many workers (one versus four). So, the comparative advantage of the United States, where its
absolute productivity advantage is relatively greatest, lies with refrigerators, and Mexico's comparative
advantage, where its absolute productivity disadvantage is least, is in the production of shoes.

Mutually Beneficial Trade with Comparative Advantage

When nations increase production in their area of comparative advantage and trade with each other, both
countries can benefit. Again, the production possibility frontier is a useful tool to visualize this benefit.

Consider a situation where the United States and Mexico each have 40 workers. For example, as Table 33.8
shows, if the United States divides its labor so that 40 workers are making shoes, then, since it takes four
workers in the United States to make 1,000 shoes, a total of 10,000 shoes will be produced. (If four workers can
make 1,000 shoes, then 40 workers will make 10,000 shoes). If the 40 workers in the United States are making
refrigerators, and each worker can produce 1,000 refrigerators, then a total of 40,000 refrigerators will be
produced.

Country Shoe Production -- using 40 workers  Refrigerator Production -- using 40 workers

United States 10,000 shoes                   or 40,000 refrigerators

Mexico  8,000 shoes                          or 10,000 refrigerators

TABLE 33.8 Production Possibilities before Trade with Complete Specialization

As always, the slope of the production possibility frontier for each country is the opportunity cost of one
refrigerator in terms of foregone shoe production-when labor is transferred from producing the latter to
producing the former (see Figure 33.4).

FIGURE 33.4 Production Possibility Frontiers (a) With 40 workers, the United States can produce either 10,000
shoes and zero refrigerators or 40,000 refrigerators and zero shoes. (b) With 40 workers, Mexico can produce a
maximum of 8,000 shoes and zero refrigerators, or 10,000 refrigerators and zero shoes. All other points on the
production possibility line are possible combinations of the two goods that can be produced given current
resources. Point A on both graphs is where the countries start producing and consuming before trade. Point B is
where they end up after trade.
802 33 · International Trade

Let's say that, in the situation before trade, each nation prefers to produce a combination of shoes and
refrigerators that is shown at point A. Table 33.9 shows the output of each good for each country and the total
output for the two countries.

                              Country Current Shoe Production Current Refrigerator Production

United States 5,000                                    20,000

Mexico                                   4,000         5,000

Total                                    9,000         25,000

TABLE 33.9 Total Production at Point A before Trade

Continuing with this scenario, suppose that each country transfers some amount of labor toward its area of
comparative advantage. For example, the United States transfers six workers away from shoes and toward
producing refrigerators. As a result, U.S. production of shoes decreases by 1,500 units (6/4 × 1,000), while its
production of refrigerators increases by 6,000 (that is, 6/1 × 1,000). Mexico also moves production toward its
area of comparative advantage, transferring 10 workers away from refrigerators and toward production of
shoes. As a result, production of refrigerators in Mexico falls by 2,500 (10/4 × 1,000), but production of shoes
increases by 2,000 pairs (10/5 × 1,000). Notice that when both countries shift production toward each of their
comparative advantages (what they are relatively better at), their combined production of both goods rises, as
shown in Table 33.10. The reduction of shoe production by 1,500 pairs in the United States is more than offset
by the gain of 2,000 pairs of shoes in Mexico, while the reduction of 2,500 refrigerators in Mexico is more than
offset by the additional 6,000 refrigerators produced in the United States.

                                 Country Shoe Production Refrigerator Production

                                 United States 3,500   26,000

                                 Mexico         6,000  2,500

                                 Total          9,500  28,500

                              Advantage Raises Total Output

This numerical example illustrates the remarkable insight of comparative advantage: even when one country
has an absolute advantage in all goods and another country has an absolute disadvantage in all goods, both
countries can still benefit from trade. Even though the United States has an absolute advantage in producing
both refrigerators and shoes, it makes economic sense for it to specialize in the good for which it has a
comparative advantage. The United States will export refrigerators and in return import shoes.

How Opportunity Cost Sets the Boundaries of Trade

This example shows that both parties can benefit from specializing in their comparative advantages and
trading. By using the opportunity costs in this example, it is possible to identify the range of possible trades
that would benefit each country.

Mexico started out, before specialization and trade, producing 4,000 pairs of shoes and 5,000 refrigerators (see
Figure 33.4 and Table 33.9). Then, in the numerical example given, Mexico shifted production toward its
comparative advantage and produced 6,000 pairs of shoes but only 2,500 refrigerators. Thus, if Mexico can

                                        33.2 · What Happens When a Country Has an Absolute Advantage in All Goods 803

export no more than 2,000 pairs of shoes (giving up 2,000 pairs of shoes) in exchange for imports of at least
2,500 refrigerators (a gain of 2,500 refrigerators), it will be able to consume more of both goods than before
trade. Mexico will be unambiguously better off. Conversely, the United States started off, before specialization
and trade, producing 5,000 pairs of shoes and 20,000 refrigerators. In the example, it then shifted production
toward its comparative advantage, producing only 3,500 shoes but 26,000 refrigerators. If the United States
can export no more than 6,000 refrigerators in exchange for imports of at least 1,500 pairs of shoes, it will be
able to consume more of both goods and will be unambiguously better off.

The range of trades that can benefit both nations is shown in Table 33.11. For example, a trade where the U.S.
exports 4,000 refrigerators to Mexico in exchange for 1,800 pairs of shoes would benefit both sides, in the
sense that both countries would be able to consume more of both goods than in a world without trade.

The U.S. economy, after specialization, will benefit  The Mexican economy, after specialization, will benefit
                                 if it:                                                   if it:

Imports at least 1,500 pairs of shoes                 Exports no more than 2,000 pairs of shoes

TABLE 33.11 The Range of Trades That Benefit Both the United States and Mexico

Trade allows each country to take advantage of lower opportunity costs in the other country. If Mexico wants to
produce more refrigerators without trade, it must face its domestic opportunity costs and reduce shoe
production. If Mexico, instead, produces more shoes and then trades for refrigerators made in the United
States, where the opportunity cost of producing refrigerators is lower, Mexico can in effect take advantage of
the lower opportunity cost of refrigerators in the United States. Conversely, when the United States specializes
in its comparative advantage of refrigerator production and trades for shoes produced in Mexico, international
trade allows the United States to take advantage of the lower opportunity cost of shoe production in Mexico.

The theory of comparative advantage explains why countries trade: they have different comparative
advantages. It shows that the gains from international trade result from pursuing comparative advantage and
producing at a lower opportunity cost. The following Work It Out feature shows how to calculate absolute and
comparative advantage and the way to apply them to a country's production.

                                                                                                          WORK IT OUT

 Calculating Absolute and Comparative Advantage

  In Canada a worker can produce 20 barrels of oil or 40 tons of lumber. In Venezuela, a worker can produce 60
  barrels of oil or 30 tons of lumber.

b. Which country has a comparative advantage in the production of oil?
804 33 · International Trade

          c. Which country has a comparative advantage in producing lumber?
          d. In this example, is absolute advantage the same as comparative advantage, or not?
          e. In what product should Canada specialize? In what product should Venezuela specialize?

         Step 1. Make a table like Table 33.12.

         Step 2. To calculate absolute advantage, look at the larger of the numbers for each product. One worker in
         Canada can produce more lumber (40 tons versus 30 tons), so Canada has the absolute advantage in lumber.
         One worker in Venezuela can produce 60 barrels of oil compared to a worker in Canada who can produce only 20.

         Step 3. To calculate comparative advantage, find the opportunity cost of producing one barrel of oil in both
         countries. The country with the lowest opportunity cost has the comparative advantage. With the same labor
         time, Canada can produce either 20 barrels of oil or 40 tons of lumber. So in effect, 20 barrels of oil is equivalent
         to 40 tons of lumber: 20 oil = 40 lumber. Divide both sides of the equation by 20 to calculate the opportunity cost
         of one barrel of oil in Canada. 20/20 oil = 40/20 lumber. 1 oil = 2 lumber. To produce one additional barrel of oil
         in Canada has an opportunity cost of 2 lumber. Calculate the same way for Venezuela: 60 oil = 30 lumber. Divide
         both sides of the equation by 60. One oil in Venezuela has an opportunity cost of 1/2 lumber. Because 1/2
         lumber < 2 lumber, Venezuela has the comparative advantage in producing oil.

         Step 4. Calculate the opportunity cost of one lumber by reversing the numbers, with lumber on the left side of the
         equation. In Canada, 40 lumber is equivalent in labor time to 20 barrels of oil: 40 lumber = 20 oil. Divide each
         side of the equation by 40. The opportunity cost of one lumber is 1/2 oil. In Venezuela, the equivalent labor time
         will produce 30 lumber or 60 oil: 30 lumber = 60 oil. Divide each side by 30. One lumber has an opportunity cost
         of two oil. Canada has the lower opportunity cost in producing lumber.

         Step 5. In this example, absolute advantage is the same as comparative advantage. Canada has the absolute and
         comparative advantage in lumber; Venezuela has the absolute and comparative advantage in oil.

         Step 6. Canada should specialize in the commodity for which it has a relative lower opportunity cost, which is
         lumber, and Venezuela should specialize in oil. Canada will be exporting lumber and importing oil, and Venezuela
         will be exporting oil and importing lumber.

      Comparative Advantage Goes Camping

       To build an intuitive understanding of how comparative advantage can benefit all parties, set aside examples
       that involve national economies for a moment and consider the situation of a group of friends who decide to go
       camping together. The six friends have a wide range of skills and experiences, but one person in particular,
       Jethro, has done lots of camping before and is also a great athlete. Jethro has an absolute advantage in all
       aspects of camping: he is faster at carrying a backpack, gathering firewood, paddling a canoe, setting up tents,
       making a meal, and washing up. So here is the question: Because Jethro has an absolute productivity
       advantage in everything, should he do all the work?

       Of course not! Even if Jethro is willing to work like a mule while everyone else sits around, he, like all mortals,
       only has 24 hours in a day. If everyone sits around and waits for Jethro to do everything, not only will Jethro be
       an unhappy camper, but there will not be much output for his group of six friends to consume. The theory of
       comparative advantage suggests that everyone will benefit if they figure out their areas of comparative
       advantage--that is, the area of camping where their productivity disadvantage is least, compared to Jethro. For
       example, it may be that Jethro is 80% faster at building fires and cooking meals than anyone else, but only 20%
       faster at gathering firewood and 10% faster at setting up tents. In that case, Jethro should focus on building
       fires and making meals, and others should attend to the other tasks, each according to where their productivity
       disadvantage is smallest. If the campers coordinate their efforts according to comparative advantage, they can
       all gain.

33.3 Intra-Industry Trade between Similar Economies

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Identify at least two advantages of intra-industry trading
  · Explain the relationship between economies of scale and intra-industry trade

Absolute and comparative advantages explain a great deal about global trading patterns. For example, they
help to explain the patterns that we noted at the start of this chapter, like why you may be eating fresh fruit
from Chile or Mexico, or why lower productivity regions like Africa and Latin America are able to sell a
substantial proportion of their exports to higher productivity regions like the European Union and North
America. Comparative advantage, however, at least at first glance, does not seem especially well-suited to
explain other common patterns of international trade.

The Prevalence of Intra-Industry Trade between Similar Economies

The theory of comparative advantage suggests that trade should happen between economies with large
differences in opportunity costs of production. Roughly half of all U.S. trade involves shipping goods between
the fairly similar high-income economies of Japan, Canada, and the United States. Furthermore, the trade has
an important geographic component--the biggest trading partners of the United States are Canada and Mexico
(see Table 33.13).

Country U.S. Exports Go to ... U.S. Imports Come from ...

China   8.6%      17.7%

Canada  17.6%     12.6%

Japan   4.3%      4.3%

Mexico  15.8%     13.6%

South Korea 3.8%  3.3%

TABLE 33.13 Top Trading Partners (November 2021) (Source:
https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/highlights/
toppartners.html)

Moreover, the theory of comparative advantage suggests that each economy should specialize to a degree in
certain products, and then exchange those products. A high proportion of trade, however, is intra-industry
trade--that is, trade of goods within the same industry from one country to another. For example, the United
States produces and exports autos and imports autos. Table 33.14 shows some of the largest categories of U.S.
exports and imports. In all of these categories, the United States is both a substantial exporter and a
substantial importer of goods from the same industry. In 2021, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, the
United States exported $131 billion worth of autos, and imported $317 billion worth of autos. About 60% of
U.S. trade and 60% of European trade is intra-industry trade.

TABLE 33.14 Some Intra-Industry U.S. Exports and Imports in 2021 (Source:
https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/data/index.html)

Why do similar high-income economies engage in intra-industry trade? What can be the economic benefit of
having workers of fairly similar skills making cars, computers, machinery and other products which are then
shipped across the oceans to and from the United States, the European Union, and Japan? There are two
reasons: (1) The division of labor leads to learning, innovation, and unique skills; and (2) economies of scale.

Gains from Specialization and Learning

Consider the category of machinery, where the U.S. economy has considerable intra-industry trade. Machinery
comes in many varieties, so the United States may be exporting machinery for manufacturing with wood, but
importing machinery for photographic processing. The underlying reason why a country like the United
States, Japan, or Germany produces one kind of machinery rather than another is usually not related to U.S.,
German, or Japanese firms and workers having generally higher or lower skills. It is just that, in working on
very specific and particular products, firms in certain countries develop unique and different skills.

Specialization in the world economy can be very finely split. In fact, recent years have seen a trend in
international trade, which economists call splitting up the value chain. The value chain describes how a good
is produced in stages. As indicated in the beginning of the chapter, producing the iPhone involves designing
and engineering the phone in the United States, supplying parts from Korea, assembling the parts in China,
and advertising and marketing in the United States. Thanks in large part to improvements in communication
technology, sharing information, and transportation, it has become easier to split up the value chain. Instead
of production in a single large factory, different firms operating in various places and even different countries
can divide the value chain. Because firms split up the value chain, international trade often does not involve
nations trading whole finished products like automobiles or refrigerators. Instead, it involves shipping more
specialized goods like, say, automobile dashboards or the shelving that fits inside refrigerators. Intra-industry
trade between similar countries produces economic gains because it allows workers and firms to learn and
innovate on particular products--and often to focus on very particular parts of the value chain.

of the iPhone.

Economies of Scale, Competition, Variety

A second broad reason that intra-industry trade between similar nations produces economic gains involves
economies of scale. The concept of economies of scale, as we introduced in Production, Costs and Industry
Structure, means that as the scale of output goes up, average costs of production decline--at least up to a point.

Figure 33.5 illustrates economies of scale for a plant producing toaster ovens. The horizontal axis of the figure
shows the quantity of production by a certain firm or at a certain manufacturing plant. The vertical axis
measures the average cost of production. Production plant S produces a small level of output at 30 units and
has an average cost of production of $30 per toaster oven. Plant M produces at a medium level of output at 50
units, and has an average cost of production of $20 per toaster oven. Plant L produces 150 units of output with
an average cost of production of only $10 per toaster oven. Although plant V can produce 200 units of output, it
still has the same unit cost as Plant L.
In this example, a small or medium plant, like S or M, will not be able to compete in the market with a large or a
very large plant like L or V, because the firm that operates L or V will be able to produce and sell its output at a
lower price. In this example, economies of scale operate up to point L, but beyond point L to V, the additional
scale of production does not continue to reduce average costs of production.

Production plant M has an average cost of production of $20 per toaster oven. Production plant L has an average
cost of production of only $10 per toaster oven. Production plant V still has an average cost of production of $10 per
toaster oven. Thus, production plant M can produce toaster ovens more cheaply than plant S because of economies
of scale, and plants L or V can produce more cheaply than S or M because of economies of scale. However, the
economies of scale end at an output level of 150. Plant V, despite being larger, cannot produce more cheaply on
average than plant L.
The concept of economies of scale becomes especially relevant to international trade when it enables one or
two large producers to supply the entire country. For example, a single large automobile factory could probably
supply all the cars consumers purchase in a smaller economy like the United Kingdom or Belgium in a given
year. However, if a country has only one or two large factories producing cars, and no international trade, then
consumers in that country would have relatively little choice between kinds of cars (other than the color of the
paint and other nonessential options). Little or no competition will exist between different car manufacturers.
International trade provides a way to combine the lower average production costs that come from economies
of scale and still have competition and variety for consumers. Large automobile factories in different countries
can make and sell their products around the world. If General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler were the only players
in the U.S. automobile market, the level of competition and consumer choice would be considerably lower than
when U.S. carmakers must face competition from Toyota, Honda, Suzuki, Fiat, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Volkswagen,
Kia, Hyundai, BMW, Subaru, and others. Greater competition brings with it innovation and responsiveness to
what consumers want. America's car producers make far better cars now than they did several decades ago,
and much of the reason is competitive pressure, especially from East Asian and European carmakers.

Dynamic Comparative Advantage

The sources of gains from intra-industry trade between similar economies--namely, the learning that comes
from a high degree of specialization and splitting up the value chain and from economies of scale--do not
808 33 · International Trade

       contradict the earlier theory of comparative advantage. Instead, they help to broaden the concept.

       In intra-industry trade, climate or geography do not determine the level of worker productivity. Even the
       general level of education or skill does not determine it. Instead, how firms engage in specific learning about
       specialized products, including taking advantage of economies of scale determine the level of worker
       productivity. In this vision, comparative advantage can be dynamic--that is, it can evolve and change over time
       as one develops new skills and as manufacturers split the value chain in new ways. This line of thinking also
       suggests that countries are not destined to have the same comparative advantage forever, but must instead be
       flexible in response to ongoing changes in comparative advantage.

     33.4 The Benefits of Reducing Barriers to International Trade

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain tariffs as barriers to trade
         · Identify at least two benefits of reducing barriers to international trade

       Tariffs are taxes that governments place on imported goods for a variety of reasons. Some of these reasons
       include protecting sensitive industries, for humanitarian reasons, and protecting against dumping.
       Traditionally, tariffs were used simply as a political tool to protect certain vested economic, social, and cultural
       interests. The World Trade Organization (WTO) is committed to lowering barriers to trade. The world's nations
       meet through the WTO to negotiate how they can reduce barriers to trade, such as tariffs. WTO negotiations
       happen in "rounds," where all countries negotiate one agreement to encourage trade, take a year or two off,
       and then start negotiating a new agreement. The current round of negotiations is called the Doha Round
       because it was officially launched in Doha, the capital city of Qatar, in November 2001. In 2010, the WTO noted
       that the Doha Round's emphasis on market access and reforms of agricultural subsidies could add $121-$202
       billion to the world economy.

       In the context of a global economy that currently produces more than $80 trillion of goods and services each
       year, this amount is not large: it is an increase of less than 1%. But before dismissing the gains from trade too
       quickly, it is worth remembering two points.

         · First, a gain of a few hundred billion dollars is enough money to deserve attention! Moreover, remember
             that this increase is not a one-time event; it would persist each year into the future.

         · Second, the estimate of gains may be on the low side because some of the gains from trade are not
             measured especially well in economic statistics. For example, it is difficult to measure the potential
             advantages to consumers of having a variety of products available and a greater degree of competition
             among producers. Perhaps the most important unmeasured factor is that trade between countries,
             especially when firms are splitting up the value chain of production, often involves a transfer of knowledge
             that can involve skills in production, technology, management, finance, and law.

       Low-income countries benefit more from trade than high-income countries do. In some ways, the giant U.S.
       economy has less need for international trade, because it can already take advantage of internal trade within
       its economy. However, many smaller national economies around the world, in regions like Latin America,
       Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, have much more limited possibilities for trade inside their countries or their
       immediate regions. Without international trade, they may have little ability to benefit from comparative
       advantage, slicing up the value chain, or economies of scale. Moreover, smaller economies often have fewer
       competitive firms making goods within their economy, and thus firms have less pressure from other firms to
       provide the goods and prices that consumers want.

       The economic gains from expanding international trade are measured in hundreds of billions of dollars, and
       the gains from international trade as a whole probably reach well into the trillions of dollars. The potential for
       gains from trade may be especially high among the smaller and lower-income countries of the world.

Visit this website (http://openstax.org/l/tradebenefits) for a list of some benefits of trade.

From Interpersonal to International Trade

Most people find it easy to believe that they, personally, would not be better off if they tried to grow and process
all of their own food, to make all of their own clothes, to build their own cars and houses from scratch, and so
on. Instead, we all benefit from living in economies where people and firms can specialize and trade with each
other.

The benefits of trade do not stop at national boundaries, either. Earlier we explained that the division of labor
could increase output for three reasons: (1) workers with different characteristics can specialize in the types of
production where they have a comparative advantage; (2) firms and workers who specialize in a certain
product become more productive with learning and practice; and (3) economies of scale. These three reasons
apply from the individual and community level right up to the international level. If it makes sense to you that
interpersonal, intercommunity, and interstate trade offer economic gains, it should make sense that
international trade offers gains, too.

International trade currently involves about $20 trillion worth of goods and services moving around the globe.
Any economic force of that size, even if it confers overall benefits, is certain to cause disruption and
controversy. This chapter has only made the case that trade brings economic benefits. Other chapters discuss,
in detail, the public policy arguments over whether to restrict international trade.

Just Whose iPhone Is It?

Apple Corporation uses a global platform to produce the iPhone. Now that you understand the concept of
comparative advantage, you can see why the engineering and design of the iPhone is done in the United States. The
United States has built up a comparative advantage over the years in designing and marketing products, and
sacrifices fewer resources to design high-tech devices relative to other countries. China has a comparative
advantage in assembling the phone due to its large skilled labor force. Korea has a comparative advantage in
producing components. Korea focuses its production by increasing its scale, learning better ways to produce
screens and computer chips, and uses innovation to lower average costs of production. Apple, in turn, benefits
because it can purchase these quality products at lower prices. Put the global assembly line together and you have
the device with which we are all so familiar.

Key Concepts and Summary

33.1 Absolute and Comparative Advantage

A country has an absolute advantage in those products in which it has a productivity edge over other countries;
it can produce more of a product. A country has a comparative advantage when it can produce a good at a
lower cost in terms of other goods. Countries that specialize based on comparative advantage gain from trade.

33.2 What Happens When a Country Has an Absolute Advantage in All Goods

Even when a country has high levels of productivity in all goods, it can still benefit from trade. Gains from
trade come about as a result of comparative advantage. By specializing in a good that it gives up the least to
produce, a country can produce more and offer that additional output for sale. If other countries specialize in
the area of their comparative advantage as well and trade, the highly productive country is able to benefit from
a lower opportunity cost of production in other countries.

33.3 Intra-Industry Trade between Similar Economies

A large share of global trade happens between high-income economies that are quite similar in having well-
educated workers and advanced technology. These countries practice intra-industry trade, in which they
import and export the same products at the same time, like cars, machinery, and computers. In the case of
intra-industry trade between economies with similar income levels, the gains from trade come from
specialized learning in very particular tasks and from economies of scale. Splitting up the value chain means
that several stages of producing a good take place in different countries around the world.

33.4 The Benefits of Reducing Barriers to International Trade

Tariffs are placed on imported goods as a way of protecting sensitive industries, for humanitarian reasons, and
for protection against dumping. Traditionally, tariffs were used as a political tool to protect certain vested
economic, social, and cultural interests. The WTO has been, and continues to be, a way for nations to meet and
negotiate in order to reduce barriers to trade. The gains of international trade are very large, especially for
smaller countries, but are beneficial to all.

Introduction to Globalization and Protectionism

         BRING IT HOME

What's the Downside of Protection?

Governments are motivated to limit and alter market outcomes for political or social ends. While governments can
limit the rise in prices of some products, they cannot control how much people want to buy or how much firms are
willing to sell. The laws of demand and supply still hold. Trade policy is an example where regulations can redirect
economic forces, but it cannot stop them from manifesting themselves elsewhere.

Flat-panel displays, the displays for laptop computers, tablets, and flat screen televisions, are an example of such
an enduring principle. In the early 1990s, the vast majority of flat-panel displays used in U.S.-manufactured laptops
were imported, primarily from Japan. The small but politically powerful U.S. flat-panel-display industry filed a
816 34 · Globalization and Protectionism

       dumping complaint with the Commerce Department. They argued that Japanese firms were selling displays at "less
       than fair value," which made it difficult for U.S. firms to compete. This argument for trade protection is referred to as
       anti-dumping. Other arguments for protection in this complaint included national security. After a preliminary
       determination by the Commerce Department that the Japanese firms were dumping, the U.S. International Trade
       Commission imposed a 63% dumping margin (or tax) on the import of flat-panel displays. Was this a successful
       exercise of U.S. trade policy? See what you think after reading the chapter.

       The world has become more connected on multiple levels, especially economically. In 1970, imports and
       exports made up 11% of U.S. GDP, while now they make up 32%. However, the United States, due to its size, is
       less internationally connected than most countries. For example, according to the World Bank, 97% of
       Botswana's economic activity is connected to trade. This chapter explores trade policy--the laws and strategies
       a country uses to regulate international trade. This topic is not without controversy.

       As the world has become more globally connected, firms and workers in high-income countries like the United
       States, Japan, or the nations of the European Union, perceive a competitive threat from firms in medium-
       income countries like Mexico, China, or South Africa, that have lower costs of living and therefore pay lower
       wages. Firms and workers in low-income countries fear that they will suffer if they must compete against more
       productive workers and advanced technology in high-income countries.

       On a different tack, some environmentalists worry that multinational firms may evade environmental
       protection laws by moving their production to countries with loose or nonexistent pollution standards, trading
       a clean environment for jobs. Some politicians worry that their country may become overly dependent on key
       imported products, like oil, which in a time of war could threaten national security. All of these fears influence
       governments to reach the same basic policy conclusion: to protect national interests, whether businesses, jobs,
       or security, imports of foreign products should be restricted. This chapter analyzes such arguments. First,
       however, it is essential to learn a few key concepts and understand how the demand and supply model applies
       to international trade.

     34.1 Protectionism: An Indirect Subsidy from Consumers to Producers

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain protectionism and its three main forms
         · Analyze protectionism through concepts of demand and supply, noting its effects on equilibrium
         · Calculate the effects of trade barriers

       When a government legislates policies to reduce or block international trade it is engaging in protectionism.
       Protectionist policies often seek to shield domestic producers and domestic workers from foreign competition.
       Protectionism takes three main forms: tariffs, import quotas, and nontariff barriers.

       Recall from International Trade that tariffs are taxes that governments impose on imported goods and
       services. This makes imports more expensive for consumers, discouraging imports. For example, in 2018,
       President Trump increased tariffs on Chinese-manufactured goods by 2-25%, including TVs, monitors,
       desktop PCs, smartwatches, and many other consumer goods. The intention behind the policy was to shelter
       U.S. manufacturers from competition, helping companies that operate domestically. China responded with
       tariffs on American goods, launching a trade war. President Biden retained these tariffs and considered
       additional ones, but as of August 2022, the administration was considering changes designed to reduce
       inflation.

       Another way to control trade is through import quotas, which are numerical limitations on the quantity of
       products that a country can import. For instance, during the early 1980s, the Reagan Administration imposed
       a quota on the import of Japanese automobiles. In the 1970s, many developed countries, including the United
       States, found themselves with declining textile industries. Textile production does not require highly skilled

                                                                                       34.1 · Protectionism: An Indirect Subsidy from Consumers to Producers 817

workers, so producers were able to set up lower-cost factories in developing countries. In order to "manage"
this loss of jobs and income, the developed countries established an international Multifiber Agreement that
essentially divided the market for textile exports between importers and the remaining domestic producers.
The agreement, which ran from 1974 to 2004, specified the exact quota of textile imports that each developed
country would accept from each low-income country. A similar story exists for sugar imports into the United
States, which are still governed by quotas.

Nontariff barriers are all the other ways that a nation can draw up rules, regulations, inspections, and
paperwork to make it more costly or difficult to import products. A rule requiring certain safety standards can
limit imports just as effectively as high tariffs or low import quotas, for instance. There are also nontariff
barriers in the form of "rules-of-origin" regulations; these rules describe the "Made in Country X" label as the
one in which the last substantial change in the product took place. A manufacturer wishing to evade import
restrictions may try to change the production process so that the last big change in the product happens in
their own country. For example, certain textiles are made in the United States, shipped to other countries,
combined with textiles made in those other countries to make apparel--and then re-exported back to the
United States for a final assembly, to escape paying tariffs or to obtain a "Made in the USA" label.

Despite import quotas, tariffs, and nontariff barriers, the share of apparel sold in the United States that is
imported rose from about half in 1999 to about three-quarters today. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics (BLS), estimated the number of U.S. jobs in textiles and apparel fell 44% from 2007 to 2014, and will
fall by another 25% by 2024. Even more U.S. textile industry jobs would have been lost without tariffs.
However, domestic jobs that are saved by import quotas come at a cost. Because textile and apparel
protectionism adds to the costs of imports, consumers end up paying billions of dollars more for clothing each
year.

When the United States eliminates trade barriers in one area, consumers spend the money they save on that
product elsewhere in the economy. Thus, while eliminating trade barriers in one sector of the economy will
likely result in some job loss in that sector, consumers will spend the resulting savings in other sectors of the
economy and hence increase the number of jobs in those other sectors. Of course, workers in some of the
poorest countries of the world who would otherwise have jobs producing textiles, would gain considerably if
the United States reduced its barriers to trade in textiles. That said, there are good reasons to be wary about
reducing barriers to trade. The 2012 and 2013 Bangladeshi fires in textile factories, which resulted in a
horrific loss of life, present complications that our simplified analysis in the chapter will not capture.

Realizing the compromises between nations that come about due to trade policy, many countries came
together in 1947 to form the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). (We'll cover the GATT in more
detail later in the chapter.) This agreement has since been superseded by the World Trade Organization
(WTO), whose membership includes about 150 nations and most of the world's economies. It is the primary
international mechanism through which nations negotiate their trade rules--including rules about tariffs,
quotas, and nontariff barriers. The next section examines the results of such protectionism and develops a
simple model to show the impact of trade policy.

Demand and Supply Analysis of Protectionism

To the non-economist, restricting imports may appear to be nothing more than taking sales from foreign
producers and giving them to domestic producers. Other factors are at work, however, because firms do not
operate in a vacuum. Instead, firms sell their products either to consumers or to other firms (if they are
business suppliers), who are also affected by the trade barriers. A demand and supply analysis of
protectionism shows that it is not just a matter of domestic gains and foreign losses, but a policy that imposes
substantial domestic costs as well.

Consider two countries, Brazil and the United States, who produce sugar. Each country has a domestic supply
and demand for sugar, as Table 34.1 details and Figure 34.2 illustrates. In Brazil, without trade, the
818 34 · Globalization and Protectionism

       equilibrium price of sugar is 12 cents per pound and the equilibrium output is 30 tons. When there is no trade
       in the United States, the equilibrium price of sugar is 24 cents per pound and the equilibrium quantity is 80
       tons. We label these equilibrium points as point E in each part of the figure.

FIGURE 34.2 The Sugar Trade between Brazil and the United States Before trade, the equilibrium price of sugar in
Brazil is 12 cents a pound and it is 24 cents per pound in the United States. When trade is allowed, businesses will
buy cheap sugar in Brazil and sell it in the United States. This will result in higher prices in Brazil and lower prices in
the United States. Ignoring transaction costs, prices should converge to 16 cents per pound, with Brazil exporting 15
tons of sugar and the United States importing 15 tons of sugar. If trade is only partly open between the countries, it
will lead to an outcome between the free-trade and no-trade possibilities.

If international trade between Brazil and the United States now becomes possible, profit-seeking firms will
spot an opportunity: buy sugar cheaply in Brazil, and sell it at a higher price in the United States. As sugar is
shipped from Brazil to the United States, the quantity of sugar produced in Brazil will be greater than Brazilian
consumption (with the extra production exported), and the amount produced in the United States will be less
than the amount of U.S. consumption (with the extra consumption imported). Exports to the United States will
reduce the sugar supply in Brazil, raising its price. Imports into the United States will increase the sugar
supply, lowering its price. When the sugar price is the same in both countries, there is no incentive to trade
further. As Figure 34.2 shows, the equilibrium with trade occurs at a price of 16 cents per pound. At that price,
the sugar farmers of Brazil supply a quantity of 40 tons, while the consumers of Brazil buy only 25 tons.
The extra 15 tons of sugar production, shown by the horizontal gap between the demand curve and the supply
curve in Brazil, is exported to the United States. In the United States, at a price of 16 cents, the farmers produce
a quantity of 72 tons and consumers demand a quantity of 87 tons. The excess demand of 15 tons by American
consumers, shown by the horizontal gap between demand and domestic supply at the price of 16 cents, is
supplied by imported sugar. Free trade typically results in income distribution effects, but the key is to
recognize the overall gains from trade, as Figure 34.3 shows. Building on the concepts that we outlined in
Demand and Supply and Demand, Supply, and Efficiency in terms of consumer and producer surplus, Figure
34.3 (a) shows that producers in Brazil gain by selling more sugar at a higher price, while Figure 34.3 (b) shows
consumers in the United States benefit from the lower price and greater availability of sugar. Consumers in
Brazil are worse off (compare their no-trade consumer surplus with the free-trade consumer surplus) and U.S.
producers of sugar are worse off. There are gains from trade--an increase in social surplus in each country.
That is, both the United States and Brazil are better off than they would be without trade. The following Clear It
Up feature explains how trade policy can influence low-income countries.

FIGURE 34.3 Free Trade of Sugar Free trade results in gains from trade. Total surplus increases in both countries,
as the two blue-shaded areas show. However, there are clear income distribution effects. Producers gain in the
exporting country, while consumers lose; and in the importing country, consumers gain and producers lose.

      Why are there low-income countries?

       Why are the poor countries of the world poor? There are a number of reasons, but one of them will surprise you: the
       trade policies of the high-income countries. Following is a stark review of social priorities which the international aid
       organization, Oxfam International has widely publicized.

       High-income countries of the world--primarily the United States, countries of the European Union, and
       Japan--subsidize their domestic farmers collectively by about $200 billion per year. Why does this matter?

       It matters because the support of farmers in high-income countries is devastating to the livelihoods of farmers in
       low-income countries. Even when their climate and land are well-suited to products like cotton, rice, sugar, or milk,
       farmers in low-income countries find it difficult to compete. Farm subsidies in the high-income countries cause
       farmers in those countries to increase the amount they produce. This increase in supply drives down world prices of
       farm products below the costs of production. As Michael Gerson of the Washington Post describes it: "[T]he effects
       in the cotton-growing regions of West Africa are dramatic . . . keep[ing] millions of Africans on the edge of
       malnutrition. In some of the poorest countries on Earth, cotton farmers are some of the poorest people, earning
       about a dollar a day. . . . Who benefits from the current system of subsidies? About 20,000 American cotton
       producers, with an average annual income of more than $125,000."

       As if subsidies were not enough, often, the high-income countries block agricultural exports from low-income
       countries. In some cases, the situation gets even worse when the governments of high-income countries, having
       bought and paid for an excess supply of farm products, give away those products in poor countries and drive local
       farmers out of business altogether.

       For example, shipments of excess milk from the European Union to Jamaica have caused great hardship for
       Jamaican dairy farmers. Shipments of excess rice from the United States to Haiti drove thousands of low-income
       rice farmers in Haiti out of business. The opportunity costs of protectionism are not paid just by domestic
       consumers, but also by foreign producers--and for many agricultural products, those foreign producers are the
       world's poor.

       Now, let's look at what happens with protectionism. U.S. sugar farmers are likely to argue that, if only they
       could be protected from sugar imported from Brazil, the United States would have higher domestic sugar
       production, more jobs in the sugar industry, and American sugar farmers would receive a higher price. If the
       United States government sets a high-enough tariff on imported sugar, or sets an import quota at zero, the
       result will be that the quantity of sugar traded between countries could be reduced to zero, and the prices in
       each country will return to the levels before trade was allowed.

       Blocking only some trade is also possible. Suppose that the United States passed a sugar import quota of seven
       tons. The United States will import no more than seven tons of sugar, which means that Brazil can export no
       more than seven tons of sugar to the United States. As a result, the price of sugar in the United States will be 20
       cents, which is the price where the quantity demanded is seven tons greater than the domestic quantity
       supplied. Conversely, if Brazil can export only seven tons of sugar, then the price of sugar in Brazil will be 14
       cents per pound, which is the price where the domestic quantity supplied in Brazil is seven tons greater than
       domestic demand.

       In general, when a country sets a low or medium tariff or import quota, the equilibrium price and quantity will
       be somewhere between those that prevail with no trade and those with completely free trade. The following
       Work It Out explores the impact of these trade barriers.

Effects of Trade Barriers

Let's look carefully at the effects of tariffs or quotas. If the U.S. government imposes a tariff or quota sufficient to
eliminate trade with Brazil, two things occur: U.S. consumers pay a higher price and therefore buy a smaller
quantity of sugar. U.S. producers obtain a higher price and they sell a larger quantity of sugar. We can measure
the effects of a tariff on producers and consumers in the United States using two concepts that we developed in
Demand, Supply, and Efficiency: consumer surplus and producer surplus.

FIGURE 34.4 U.S. Sugar Supply and Demand When there is free trade, the equilibrium is at point A. When there
is no trade, the equilibrium is at point E.
Step 1. Look at Figure 34.4, which shows a hypothetical version of the demand and supply of sugar in the United
States.
Step 2. Note that when there is free trade the sugar market is in equilibrium at point A where Domestic Quantity
Demanded (Qd) = Quantity Supplied (Domestic Qs + Imports from Brazil) at a price of PTrade.
Step 3. Note, also, that imports are equal to the distance between points C and A.
Step 4. Recall that consumer surplus is the value that consumers get beyond what they paid for when they buy a
product. Graphically, it is the area under a demand curve but above the price. In this case, the consumer surplus
in the United States is the area of the triangle formed by the points PTrade, A, and B.
Step 5. Recall, also, that producer surplus is another name for profit--it is the income producers get above the
cost of production, which is shown by the supply curve here. In this case, the producer surplus with trade is the
area of the triangle formed by the points Ptrade, C, and D.
Step 6. Suppose that the barriers to trade are imposed, imports are excluded, and the price rises to PNoTrade.
Look what happens to producer surplus and consumer surplus. At the higher price, the domestic quantity
supplied increases from Qs to Q at point E. Because producers are selling more quantity at a higher price, the
producer surplus increases to the area of the triangle PNoTrade, E, and D.
Step 7. Compare the areas of the two triangles and you will see the increase in the producer surplus.
Step 8. Examine the consumer surplus. Consumers are now paying a higher price to get a lower quantity (Q
instead of Qd). Their consumer surplus shrinks to the area of the triangle PNoTrade, E, and B.
Step 9. Determine the net effect. The producer surplus increases by the area Ptrade, C, E, PNoTrade. The loss of
consumer surplus, however, is larger. It is the area Ptrade, A, E, PNoTrade. In other words, consumers lose more
822 34 · Globalization and Protectionism

         than producers gain as a result of the trade barriers and the United States has a lower social surplus.

      Who Benefits and Who Pays?

       Using the demand and supply model, consider the impact of protectionism on producers and consumers in
       each of the two countries. For protected producers like U.S. sugar farmers, restricting imports is clearly
       positive. Without a need to face imported products, these producers are able to sell more, at a higher price. For
       consumers in the country with the protected good, in this case U.S. sugar consumers, restricting imports is
       clearly negative. They end up buying a lower quantity of the good and paying a higher price for what they do
       buy, compared to the equilibrium price and quantity with trade. The following Clear It Up feature considers
       why a country might outsource jobs even for a domestic product.

                CLEAR IT UP

      Why are Life Savers, an American product, not made in America?

       In 1912, Clarence Crane invented Life Savers, the hard candy with the hole in the middle, in Cleveland, Ohio.
       Starting in the late 1960s and for 35 years afterward, a plant in Holland, Michigan produced 46 billion Life Savers a
       year, in 200 million rolls. However, in 2002, the Kraft Company announced that it would close the Michigan plant
       and move Life Saver production across the border to Montreal, Canada.

       One reason is that Canadian workers are paid slightly less, especially in healthcare and insurance costs that are not
       linked to employment there. Another main reason is that the United States government keeps the sugar price high
       for the benefit of sugar farmers, with a combination of a government price floor program and strict quotas on
       imported sugar. In recent years, the price of U.S. sugar has been about double the price of sugar produced by the
       rest of the world. Life Saver production uses over 100 tons of sugar each day, because the candies are 95% sugar.

       A number of other candy companies have also reduced U.S. production and expanded foreign production. Sugar-
       using industries have eliminated over 100,000 jobs over the last 20 years, more than seven times the total
       employment in sugar production. While the candy industry is especially affected by the cost of sugar, the costs are
       spread more broadly. U.S. consumers pay roughly $1 billion per year in higher food prices because of elevated sugar
       costs. Meanwhile, sugar producers in low-income countries are driven out of business. Because of the sugar
       subsidies to domestic producers and the quotas on imports, they cannot sell their output profitably, or at all, in the
       United States market.

       The fact that protectionism pushes up prices for consumers in the country enacting such protectionism is not
       always acknowledged openly, but it is not disputed. After all, if protectionism did not benefit domestic
       producers, there would not be much point in enacting such policies in the first place. Protectionism is simply a
       method of requiring consumers to subsidize producers. The subsidy is indirect, since consumers pay for it
       through higher prices, rather than a direct government subsidy paid with money collected from taxpayers.
       However, protectionism works like a subsidy, nonetheless. The American satirist Ambrose Bierce defined
       "tariff" this way in his 1911 book, The Devil's Dictionary: "Tariff, n. A scale of taxes on imports, designed to
       protect the domestic producer against the greed of his consumer."

       The effect of protectionism on producers and consumers in the foreign country is complex. When a
       government uses an import quota to impose partial protectionism, Brazilian sugar producers receive a lower
       price for the sugar they sell in Brazil--but a higher price for the sugar they are allowed to export to the United
       States. Notice that some of the burden of protectionism, paid by domestic consumers, ends up in the hands of
       foreign producers in this case. Brazilian sugar consumers seem to benefit from U.S. protectionism, because it
       reduces the price of sugar that they pay (compared to the free-trade situation). On the other hand, at least
       some of these Brazilian sugar consumers also work as sugar farmers, so protectionism reduces their incomes

and jobs. Moreover, if trade between the countries vanishes, Brazilian consumers would miss out on better
prices for imported goods--which do not appear in our single-market example of sugar protectionism.

The effects of protectionism on foreign countries notwithstanding, protectionism requires domestic
consumers of a product (consumers may include either households or other firms) to pay higher prices to
benefit domestic producers of that product. In addition, when a country enacts protectionism, it loses the
economic gains it would have been able to achieve through a combination of comparative advantage,
specialized learning, and economies of scale, concepts that we discuss in International Trade.

34.2 International Trade and Its Effects on Jobs, Wages, and Working
Conditions

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

  · Discuss how international trade influences the job market
  · Analyze the opportunity cost of protectionism
  · Explain how international trade impacts wages, labor standards, and working conditions

In theory at least, imports might injure workers in several different ways: fewer jobs, lower wages, or poor
working conditions. Let's consider these in turn.

Fewer Jobs?

In the early 1990s, the United States was negotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)1
with Mexico, an agreement that reduced tariffs, import quotas, and nontariff barriers to trade between the
United States, Mexico, and Canada. H. Ross Perot, a 1992 candidate for U.S. president, claimed, in prominent
campaign arguments, that if the United States expanded trade with Mexico, there would be a "giant sucking
sound" as U.S. employers relocated to Mexico to take advantage of lower wages. After all, average wages in
Mexico were, at that time, about one-eighth of those in the United States. NAFTA passed Congress, President
Bill Clinton signed it into law, and it took effect in 1995. For the next six years, the United States economy had
some of the most rapid job growth and low unemployment in its history. Those who feared that open trade with
Mexico would lead to a dramatic decrease in jobs were proven wrong.

This result was no surprise to economists. After all, the trend toward globalization has been going on for
decades, not just since NAFTA. If trade reduced the number of available jobs, then the United States should
have been seeing a steady loss of jobs for decades. While the United States economy does experience rises and
falls in unemployment rates, the number of jobs is not falling over extended periods of time. The number of
U.S. jobs rose from 71 million in 1970 to 150 million in 2021.

Protectionism certainly saves jobs in the specific industry being protected but, for two reasons, it costs jobs in
other unprotected industries. First, if consumers are paying higher prices to the protected industry, they
inevitably have less money to spend on goods from other industries, and so jobs are lost in those other
industries. Second, if a firm sells the protected product to other firms, so that other firms must now pay a
higher price for a key input, then those firms will lose sales to foreign producers who do not need to pay the
higher price. Lost sales translate into lost jobs. The hidden opportunity cost of using protectionism to save jobs
in one industry is jobs sacrificed in other industries. This is why the United States International Trade
Commission, in its study of barriers to trade, predicts that reducing trade barriers would not lead to an overall
loss of jobs. Protectionism reshuffles jobs from industries without import protections to industries that are
protected from imports, but it does not create more jobs.

Moreover, the costs of saving jobs through protectionism can be very high. A number of different studies have
attempted to estimate the cost to consumers in higher prices per job saved through protectionism. Table 34.2
shows a sample of results, compiled by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Saving a job through

broadly similar to the original NAFTA.
824 34 · Globalization and Protectionism

protectionism typically costs much more than the actual worker's salary. For example, a study published in
2002 compiled evidence that using protectionism to save an average job in the textile and apparel industry
would cost $199,000 per job saved. In other words, those workers could have been paid $100,000 per year to
be unemployed and the cost would only be half of what it is to keep them working in the textile and apparel
industry. This result is not unique to textiles and apparel.

TABLE 34.2 Cost to U.S. Consumers of Saving a Job through Protectionism
(Source: Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas)

Why does it cost so much to save jobs through protectionism? The basic reason is that not all of the extra
money that consumers pay because of tariffs or quotas goes to save jobs. For example, if the government
imposes tariffs on steel imports so that steel buyers pay a higher price, U.S. steel companies earn greater
profits, buy more equipment, pay bigger bonuses to managers, give pay raises to existing employees--and also
avoid firing some additional workers. Only part of the higher price of protected steel goes toward saving jobs.
Also, when an industry is protected, the economy as a whole loses the benefits of playing to its comparative
advantage--in other words, producing what it is best at. Therefore, part of the higher price that consumers pay
for protected goods is lost economic efficiency, which we can measure as another deadweight loss, like what
we discussed in Labor and Financial Markets.

There's a bumper sticker that speaks to the threat some U.S. workers feel from imported products: "Buy
American--Save U.S. Jobs." If an economist were driving the car, the sticker might declare: "Block
Imports--Save Jobs for Some Americans, Lose Jobs for Other Americans, and Also Pay High Prices."

Trade and Wages

Even if trade does not reduce the number of jobs, it could affect wages. Here, it is important to separate issues
about the average level of wages from issues about whether the wages of certain workers may be helped or hurt
by trade.

Because trade raises the amount that an economy can produce by letting firms and workers play to their
comparative advantage, trade will also cause the average level of wages in an economy to rise. Workers who

can produce more will be more desirable to employers, which will shift the demand for their labor out to the
right, and increase wages in the labor market. By contrast, barriers to trade will reduce the average level of
wages in an economy.

However, even if trade increases the overall wage level, it will still benefit some workers and hurt others.
Workers in industries that are confronted by competition from imported products may find that demand for
their labor decreases and shifts back to the left, so that their wages decline with a rise in international trade.
Conversely, workers in industries that benefit from selling in global markets may find that demand for their
labor shifts out to the right, so that trade raises their wages.

One concern is that while globalization may be benefiting high-skilled, high-wage workers in the United States,
it may also impose costs on low-skilled, low-wage workers. After all, high-skilled U.S. workers presumably
benefit from increased sales of sophisticated products like computers, machinery, and pharmaceuticals in
which the United States has a comparative advantage. Meanwhile, low-skilled U.S. workers must now compete
against extremely low-wage workers worldwide for making simpler products like toys and clothing. As a result,
the wages of low-skilled U.S. workers are likely to fall. There are, however, a number of reasons to believe that
while globalization has helped some U.S. industries and hurt others, it has not focused its negative impact on
the wages of low-skilled Americans. First, about half of U.S. trade is intra-industry trade. That means the U.S.
trades similar goods with other high-wage economies like Canada, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom.
For instance, in 2014 the U.S. exported over 2 million cars, from all the major automakers, and also imported
several million cars from other countries.

Most U.S. workers in these industries have above-average skills and wages--and many of them do quite well in
the world of globalization. Some evidence suggested that intra-industry trade between similar countries had a
small impact on domestic workers but later evidence indicates that it all depends on how flexible the labor
market is. In other words, the key is how flexible workers are in finding jobs in different industries. The effect
of trade on low-wage workers depends considerably on the structure of labor markets and indirect effects felt
in other parts of the economy. For example, in the United States and the United Kingdom, because labor
market frictions are low, the impact of trade on low income workers is small.

Second, many low-skilled U.S. workers hold service jobs that imports from low-wage countries cannot replace.
For example, we cannot import lawn care services or moving and hauling services or hotel maids from
countries long distances away like China or Bangladesh. Competition from imported products is not the
primary determinant of their wages.

Finally, while the focus of the discussion here is on wages, it is worth pointing out that low-wage U.S. workers
suffer due to protectionism in all the industries--even those in which they do not work. For example, food and
clothing are protected industries. These low-wage workers therefore pay higher prices for these basic
necessities and as such their dollar stretches over fewer goods.

The benefits and costs of increased trade in terms of its effect on wages are not distributed evenly across the
economy. However, the growth of international trade has helped to raise the productivity of U.S. workers as a
whole--and thus helped to raise the average level of wages.

Labor Standards and Working Conditions

Workers in many low-income countries around the world labor under conditions that would be illegal for a
worker in the United States. Workers in countries like China, Thailand, Brazil, South Africa, and Poland are
often paid less than the United States minimum wage. For example, in the United States, the national
826 34 · Globalization and Protectionism

       minimum wage is $7.25 per hour. A typical wage in many low-income countries might be more like $7.25 per
       day, or often much less. Moreover, working conditions in low-income countries may be extremely unpleasant,
       or even unsafe. In the worst cases, production may involve the child labor or even workers who are mistreated,
       abused, or entrapped in their jobs. These concerns over foreign labor standards do not affect most of U.S.
       trade, which is intra-industry and carried out with other high-income countries that have labor standards
       similar to the United States, but it is, nonetheless, morally and economically important.

       In thinking about labor standards in other countries, it is important to draw some distinctions between what is
       truly unacceptable and what is painful to think about. Most people, economists included, have little difficulty
       with the idea that production by six-year-olds confined in factories, by people who are abused or mistreated, or
       by slave labor is morally unacceptable. They would support aggressive efforts to eliminate such
       practices--including shutting out imported products made with such labor. Many cases, however, are less
       clear-cut. An opinion article in the New York Times several years ago described the case of Ahmed Zia, a
       14-year-old boy from Pakistan. He earned $2 per day working in a carpet factory. He dropped out of school in
       second grade. Should the United States and other countries refuse to purchase rugs made by Ahmed and his
       co-workers? If the carpet factories were to close, the likely alternative job for Ahmed is farm work, and as
       Ahmed says of his carpet-weaving job: "This makes much more money and is more comfortable."

       Other workers may have even less attractive alternative jobs, perhaps scavenging garbage or prostitution. The
       real problem for Ahmed and many others in low-income countries is not that globalization has made their
       lives worse, but rather that they have so few good life alternatives. The United States went through similar
       situations during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

       In closing, there is some irony when the United States government or U.S. citizens take issue with labor
       standards in low-income countries, because the United States is not a world leader in government laws to
       protect employees. According to a recent study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
       Development (OECD), the U.S. is the only one of 41 countries that does not provide mandated paid leave for
       new parents, and among the 40 countries that do mandate paid leave, the minimum duration is about two
       months. Many European workers receive six weeks or more of paid vacation per year. In the United States,
       vacations are often one to three weeks per year. If European countries accused the United States of using
       unfair labor standards to make U.S. products cheaply, and announced that they would shut out all U.S. imports
       until the United States adopted paid parental leave, added more national holidays, and doubled vacation time,
       Americans would be outraged. Yet when U.S. protectionists start talking about restricting imports from poor
       countries because of low wage levels and poor working conditions, they are making a very similar argument.
       This is not to say that labor conditions in low-income countries are not an important issue. They are. However,
       linking labor conditions in low-income countries to trade deflects the emphasis from the real question to ask:
       "What are acceptable and enforceable minimum labor standards and protections to have the world over?"

     34.3 Arguments in Support of Restricting Imports

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Explain and analyze various arguments that are in support of restricting imports, including the infant
             industry argument, the anti-dumping argument, the environmental protection argument, the unsafe
             consumer products argument, and the national interest argument

         · Explain dumping and race to the bottom
         · Evaluate the significance of countries' perceptions on the benefits of growing trade

       As we previously noted, protectionism requires domestic consumers of a product to pay higher prices to
       benefit domestic producers of that product. Countries that institute protectionist policies lose the economic
       gains achieved through a combination of comparative advantage, specialized learning, and economies of scale.
       With these overall costs in mind, let us now consider, one by one, a number of arguments that support
       restricting imports.

The Infant Industry Argument

Imagine Bhutan wants to start its own computer industry, but it has no computer firms that can produce at a
low enough price and high enough quality to compete in world markets. However, Bhutanese politicians,
business leaders, and workers hope that if the local industry had a chance to get established, before it needed
to face international competition, then a domestic company or group of companies could develop the skills,
management, technology, and economies of scale that it needs to become a successful profit-earning domestic
industry. Thus, the infant industry argument for protectionism is to block imports for a limited time, to give
the infant industry time to mature, before it starts competing on equal terms in the global economy. (Revisit
Macroeconomic Policy Around the World for more information on the infant industry argument.)

The infant industry argument is theoretically possible, even sensible: give an industry a short-term indirect
subsidy through protection, and then reap the long-term economic benefits of having a vibrant, healthy
industry. Implementation, however, is tricky. In many countries, infant industries have gone from babyhood to
senility and obsolescence without ever having reached the profitable maturity stage. Meanwhile, the
protectionism that was supposed to be short-term often took a very long time to be repealed.

As one example, Brazil treated its computer industry as an infant industry from the late 1970s until about
1990. In an attempt to establish its computer industry in the global economy, Brazil largely barred imports of
computer products for several decades. This policy guaranteed increased sales for Brazilian computers.
However, by the mid-1980s, due to lack of international competition, Brazil had a backward and out-of-date
industry, typically lagging behind world standards for price and performance by three to five years--a long
time in this fast-moving industry. After more than a decade, during which Brazilian consumers and industries
that would have benefited from up-to-date computers paid the costs and Brazil's computer industry never
competed effectively on world markets, Brazil phased out its infant industry policy for the computer industry.

Protectionism for infant industries always imposes costs on domestic users of the product, and typically has
provided little benefit in the form of stronger, competitive industries. However, several countries in East Asia
offer an exception. Japan, Korea, Thailand, and other countries in this region have sometimes provided a
package of indirect and direct subsidies targeted at certain industries, including protection from foreign
competition and government loans at interest rates below the market equilibrium. In Japan and Korea, for
example, subsidies helped get their domestic steel and auto industries up and running.

Why did the infant industry policy of protectionism and other subsidies work fairly well in East Asia? An early
1990 World Bank study offered three guidelines to countries thinking about infant industry protection:

1. Do not hand out protectionism and other subsidies to all industries, but focus on a few industries where
      your country has a realistic chance to be a world-class producer.

2. Be very hesitant about using protectionism in areas like computers, where many other industries rely on
      having the best products available, because it is not useful to help one industry by imposing high costs on
      many other industries.

3. Have clear guidelines for when the infant industry policy will end.

In Korea in the 1970s and 1980s, a common practice was to link protectionism and subsidies to export sales in
global markets. If export sales rose, then the infant industry had succeeded and the government could phase
out protectionism. If export sales did not rise, then the infant industry policy had failed and the government
could phase out protectionism. Either way, the protectionism would be temporary.

Following these rules is easier said than done. Politics often intrudes, both in choosing which industries will
receive the benefits of treatment as "infants" and when to phase out import restrictions and other subsidies.
Also, if the country's government wishes to impose costs on its citizens so that it can provide subsidies to a few
key industries, it has many tools for doing such as direct government payments, loans, targeted tax reductions,
and government support of research and development of new technologies. In other words, protectionism is
not the only or even the best way to support key industries.

      The Anti-Dumping Argument

       Dumping refers to selling goods below their cost of production. Anti-dumping laws block imports that are
       sold below the cost of production by imposing tariffs that increase the price of these imports to reflect their
       cost of production. Since dumping is not allowed under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, nations that
       believe they are on the receiving end of dumped goods can file a complaint with the WTO. According to the
       WTO, between 1995 and 2020, it oversaw 137 anti-dumping disputes. Note that dumping cases are
       countercyclical. During recessions, case filings increase. During economic booms, case filings go down.
       Individual countries have also frequently started their own anti-dumping investigations. The U.S. government
       has dozens of anti-dumping orders in place from past investigations. In 2022, for example, some U.S. imports
       that were under anti-dumping orders included olives from Spain, steel from South Korea, coated paper from
       Indonesia, light commercial vehicles from Germany and Italy, fish fillets from Vietnam, and cellulose pulp
       from Canada.

       Why Might Dumping Occur?

       Why would foreign firms export a product at less than its cost of production--which presumably means taking
       a loss? This question has two possible answers, one innocent and one more sinister.

       The innocent explanation is that demand and supply set market prices, not the cost of production. Perhaps
       demand for a product shifts back to the left or supply shifts out to the right, which drives the market price to
       low levels--even below the cost of production. When a local store has a going-out-of-business sale, for example,
       it may sell goods at below the cost of production. If international companies find that there is excess supply of
       steel or computer chips or machine tools that is driving the market price down below their cost of
       production--this may be the market in action.

       The sinister explanation is that dumping is part of a long-term strategy. Foreign firms sell goods at prices
       below the cost of production for a short period of time, and when they have driven out the domestic U.S.
       competition, they then raise prices. Economists sometimes call this scenario predatory pricing, which we
       discuss in the Monopoly chapter.

       Should Anti-Dumping Cases Be Limited?

       Anti-dumping cases pose two questions. How much sense do they make in economic theory? How much sense
       do they make as practical policy?

       In terms of economic theory, the case for anti-dumping laws is weak. In a market governed by demand and
       supply, the government does not guarantee that firms will be able to make a profit. After all, low prices are
       difficult for producers, but benefit consumers. Moreover, although there are plenty of cases in which foreign
       producers have driven out domestic firms, there are zero documented cases in which the foreign producers
       then jacked up prices. Instead, foreign producers typically continue competing hard against each other and
       providing low prices to consumers. In short, it is difficult to find evidence of predatory pricing by foreign firms
       exporting to the United States.

       Even if one could make a case that the government should sometimes enact anti-dumping rules in the short
       term, and then allow free trade to resume shortly thereafter, there is a growing concern that anti-dumping
       investigations often involve more politics than careful analysis. The U.S. Commerce Department is charged
       with calculating the appropriate "cost of production," which can be as much an art as a science.

       For example, if a company built a new factory two years ago, should it count part of the factory's cost in this

year's cost of production? When a company is in a country where the government controls prices, like China
for example, how can one measure the true cost of production? When a domestic industry complains loudly
enough, government regulators seem very likely to find that unfair dumping has occurred. A common pattern
has arisen where a domestic industry files an anti-dumping complaint, the governments meet and negotiate a
reduction in imports, and then the domestic producers drop the anti-dumping suit. In such cases, anti-
dumping cases often appear to be little more than a cover story for imposing tariffs or import quotas.

In the 1980s, the United States, Canada, the European Union, Australia, and New Zealand implemented almost
all the anti-dumping cases. By the 2000s, countries like Argentina, Brazil, South Korea, South Africa, Mexico,
and India were filing the majority of the anti-dumping cases before the WTO. As the number of anti-dumping
cases has increased, and as countries such as the United States and the European Union feel targeted by the
anti-dumping actions of others, the WTO may well propose some additional guidelines to limit the reach of
anti-dumping laws.

The Environmental Protection Argument

The potential for global trade to affect the environment has become controversial. A president of the Sierra
Club, an environmental lobbying organization, once wrote: "The consequences of globalization for the
environment are not good. ... Globalization, if we are lucky, will raise average incomes enough to pay for
cleaning up some of the mess that we have made. But before we get there, globalization could also destroy
enough of the planet's basic biological and physical systems that prospects for life itself will be radically
compromised."

If free trade meant the destruction of life itself, then even economists would convert to protectionism! While
globalization--and economic activity of all kinds--can pose environmental dangers, it seems quite possible
that, with the appropriate safeguards in place, we can minimize the environmental impacts of trade. In some
cases, trade may even bring environmental benefits.

In general, high-income countries such as the United States, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the
nations of the European Union have relatively strict environmental standards. In contrast, middle- and low-
income countries like Brazil, Nigeria, India, and China have lower environmental standards. The general view
of the governments of such countries is that environmental protection is a luxury: as soon as their people have
enough to eat, decent healthcare, and longer life expectancies, then they will spend more money on items such
as sewage treatment plants, scrubbers to reduce air pollution from factory smokestacks, and national parks to
protect wildlife.

This gap in environmental standards between high-income and low-income countries raises two worrisome
possibilities in a world of increasing global trade: the "race to the bottom" scenario and the question of how
quickly environmental standards will improve in low-income countries.

The Race to the Bottom Scenario

The race to the bottom scenario of global environmental degradation runs like this. Profit-seeking
multinational companies shift their production from countries with strong environmental standards to
countries with weak standards, thus reducing their costs and increasing their profits. Faced with such
behavior, countries reduce their environmental standards to attract multinational firms, which, after all,
provide jobs and economic clout. As a result, global production becomes concentrated in countries where
firms can pollute the most and environmental laws everywhere "race to the bottom."

Although the race-to-the-bottom scenario sounds plausible, it does not appear to describe reality. In fact, the
financial incentive for firms to shift production to poor countries to take advantage of their weaker
environmental rules does not seem especially powerful. When firms decide where to locate a new factory, they
look at many different factors: the costs of labor and financial capital; whether the location is close to a reliable
suppliers of the inputs that they need; whether the location is close to customers; the quality of transportation,
830 34 · Globalization and Protectionism

       communications, and electrical power networks; the level of taxes; and the competence and honesty of the
       local government. The cost of environmental regulations is a factor, too, but typically environmental costs are
       no more than 1 to 2% of the costs that a large industrial plant faces. The other factors that determine location
       are much more important to these companies than trying to skimp on environmental protection costs.

       When an international company does choose to build a plant in a low-income country with lax environmental
       laws, it typically builds a plant similar to those that it operates in high-income countries with stricter
       environmental standards. Part of the reason for this decision is that designing an industrial plant is a complex
       and costly task, and so if a plant works well in a high-income country, companies prefer to use the same design
       everywhere. Also, companies realize that if they create an environmental disaster in a low-income country, it is
       likely to cost them a substantial amount of money in paying for damages, lost trust, and reduced sales--by
       building up-to-date plants everywhere they minimize such risks. As a result of these factors, foreign-owned
       plants in low-income countries often have a better record of compliance with environmental laws than do
       locally-owned plants.

       Pressuring Low-Income Countries for Higher Environmental Standards

       In some cases, the issue is not so much whether globalization will pressure low-income countries to reduce
       their environmental standards, but instead whether the threat of blocking international trade can pressure
       these countries into adopting stronger standards. For example, restrictions on ivory imports in high-income
       countries, along with stronger government efforts to catch elephant poachers, have been credited with helping
       to reduce the illegal poaching of elephants in certain African countries.

       However, it would be highly undemocratic for the well-fed citizens of high-income countries to attempt to
       dictate to the ill-fed citizens of low-income countries what domestic policies and priorities they must adopt, or
       how they should balance environmental goals against other priorities for their citizens. Furthermore, if high-
       income countries want stronger environmental standards in low-income countries, they have many options
       other than the threat of protectionism. For example, high-income countries could pay for anti-pollution
       equipment in low-income countries, or could help to pay for national parks. High-income countries could help
       pay for and carry out the scientific and economic studies that would help environmentalists in low-income
       countries to make a more persuasive case for the economic benefits of protecting the environment.

       After all, environmental protection is vital to two industries of key importance in many low-income
       countries--agriculture and tourism. Environmental advocates can set up standards for labeling products, like
       "this tuna caught in a net that kept dolphins safe" or "this product made only with wood not taken from
       rainforests," so that consumer pressure can reinforce environmentalist values. The United Nations also
       reinforces these values, by sponsoring treaties to address issues such as climate change and global warming,
       the preservation of biodiversity, the spread of deserts, and the environmental health of the seabed. Countries
       that share a national border or are within a region often sign environmental agreements about air and water
       rights, too. The WTO is also becoming more aware of environmental issues and more careful about ensuring
       that increases in trade do not inflict environmental damage.

       Finally, note that these concerns about the race to the bottom or pressuring low-income countries for more
       strict environmental standards do not apply very well to the roughly half of all U.S. trade that occurs with other
       high-income countries. Many European countries have stricter environmental standards in certain industries
       than the United States.

      The Unsafe Consumer Products Argument

       One argument for shutting out certain imported products is that they are unsafe for consumers. Consumer
       rights groups have sometimes warned that the World Trade Organization would require nations to reduce their
       health and safety standards for imported products. However, the WTO explains its current agreement on the
       subject in this way: "It allows countries to set their own standards." It also says "regulations must be based on
       science. . . . And they should not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate between countries where identical or

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                    34.3 · Arguments in Support of Restricting Imports 831

similar conditions prevail." Thus, for example, under WTO rules it is perfectly legitimate for the United States
to pass laws requiring that all food products or cars sold in the United States meet certain safety standards
approved by the United States government, whether or not other countries choose to pass similar standards.
However, such standards must have some scientific basis. It is improper to impose one set of health and safety
standards for domestically produced goods but a different set of standards for imports, or one set of standards
for imports from Europe and a different set of standards for imports from Latin America.

In 2007, Mattel recalled nearly two million toys imported from China due to concerns about high levels of lead
in the paint, as well as some loose parts. It is unclear if other toys were subject to similar standards. In 2013,
Japan blocked imports of U.S. wheat because of concerns that genetically modified (GMO) wheat might be
included in the shipments. The science on the impact of GMOs on health is still developing.

The National Interest Argument

Some argue that a nation should not depend too heavily on other countries for supplies of certain key products,
such as oil, or for special materials or technologies that might have national security applications. On closer
consideration, this argument for protectionism proves rather weak.

As an example, in the United States, oil provides about 36% of all the energy and 21% of the oil used in the
United States economy is imported. Several times in the last few decades, when disruptions in the Middle East
have shifted the supply curve of oil back to the left and sharply raised the price, the effects have been felt
across the United States economy. This is not, however, a very convincing argument for restricting oil imports.
If the United States needs to be protected from a possible cutoff of foreign oil, then a more reasonable strategy
would be to import 100% of the petroleum supply now, and save U.S. domestic oil resources for when or if the
foreign supply is cut off. It might also be useful to import extra oil and put it into a stockpile for use in an
emergency, as the United States government did by starting a Strategic Petroleum Reserve in 1977. Moreover,
it may be necessary to discourage people from using oil, and to start a high-powered program to seek out
alternatives to oil. A straightforward way to do this would be to raise taxes on oil. Additionally, it makes no
sense to argue that because oil is highly important to the United States economy, then the United States should
shut out oil imports and use up its domestic supplies more quickly. U.S. domestic oil production is increasing.
Shale oil is adding to domestic supply using fracking extraction techniques.

Whether or not to limit certain kinds of imports of key technologies or materials that might be important to
national security and weapons systems is a slightly different issue. If weapons' builders are not confident that
they can continue to obtain a key product in wartime, they might decide to avoid designing weapons that use
this key product, or they can go ahead and design the weapons and stockpile enough of the key high-tech
components or materials to last through an armed conflict. There is a U.S. Defense National Stockpile Center
that has built up reserves of many materials, from aluminum oxides, antimony, and bauxite to tungsten,
vegetable tannin extracts, and zinc (although many of these stockpiles have been reduced and sold in recent
years). Think every country is pro-trade? How about the U.S.? The following Clear It Up might surprise you.

How does the United States really feel about expanding trade?

How do people around the world feel about expanding trade between nations? In summer 2007, the Pew
Foundation surveyed 45,000 people in 47 countries. One of the questions asked about opinions on growing trade
ties between countries. Table 34.3 shows the percentages who answered either "very good" or "somewhat good"
for some of countries surveyed.

For those who think of the United States as the world's leading supporter of expanding trade, the survey results may
be perplexing. When adding up the shares of those who say that growing trade ties between countries is "very good"
or "somewhat good," Americans had the least favorable attitude toward increasing globalization, while the Chinese
832 34 · Globalization and Protectionism

and South Africans ranked highest. In fact, among the 47 countries surveyed, the United States ranked by far the
lowest on this measure, followed by Egypt, Italy, and Argentina.

One final reason why economists often treat the national interest argument skeptically is that lobbyists and
politicians can tout almost any product as vital to national security. In 1954, the United States became worried
that it was importing half of the wool required for military uniforms, so it declared wool and mohair to be
"strategic materials" and began to give subsidies to wool and mohair farmers. Although the government
removed wool from the official list of "strategic" materials in 1960, the subsidies for mohair continued for
almost 40 years until the government repealed them in 1993, and then reinstated them in 2002. All too often,
the national interest argument has become an excuse for handing out the indirect subsidy of protectionism to
certain industries or companies. After all, politicians, not nonpartisan analysts make decisions about what
constitutes a key strategic material.

The World Trade Organization

The World Trade Organization (WTO) was officially born in 1995, but its history is much longer. In the years
after the Great Depression and World War II, there was a worldwide push to build institutions that would tie the
nations of the world together. The United Nations officially came into existence in 1945. The World Bank,
which assists the poorest people in the world, and the International Monetary Fund, which addresses issues
raised by international financial transactions, were both created in 1946. The third planned organization was
to be an International Trade Organization, which would manage international trade. The United Nations was
unable to agree to this. Instead, 27 nations signed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in
Geneva, Switzerland on October 30, 1947 to provide a forum in which nations could come together to negotiate
reductions in tariffs and other barriers to trade. In 1995, the GATT transformed into the WTO.

The GATT process was to negotiate an agreement to reduce barriers to trade, sign that agreement, pause for a
while, and then start negotiating the next agreement. Table 34.4 shows rounds of talks in the GATT, and now
the WTO. Notice that the early rounds of GATT talks took a relatively short time, included a small number of
countries, and focused almost entirely on reducing tariffs. Since the mid-1960s, however, rounds of trade talks
have taken years, included a large number of countries, and have included an ever-broadening range of issues.

TABLE 34.4 The Negotiating Rounds of GATT and the World Trade Organization

The sluggish pace of GATT negotiations led to an old joke that GATT really stood for Gentleman's Agreement to
Talk and Talk. The slow pace of international trade talks, however, is understandable, even sensible. Having
dozens of nations agree to any treaty is a lengthy process. GATT often set up separate trading rules for certain
industries, like agriculture, and separate trading rules for certain countries, like the low-income countries.
There were rules, exceptions to rules, opportunities to opt out of rules, and precise wording to be fought over in
every case. Like the GATT before it, the WTO is not a world government, with power to impose its decisions on
others. The total staff of the WTO Secretariat in 2021 is 625 people and its annual budget (as of 2020) is $197
million, which makes it smaller in size than many large universities.

Regional Trading Agreements

There are different types of economic integration across the globe, ranging from free trade agreements, in
which participants allow each other's imports without tariffs or quotas, to common markets, in which
participants have a common external trade policy as well as free trade within the group, to full economic
unions, in which, in addition to a common market, monetary and fiscal policies are coordinated. Many nations
belong both to the World Trade Organization and to regional trading agreements.

The best known of these regional trading agreements is the European Union. In the years after World War II,
leaders of several European nations reasoned that if they could tie their economies together more closely, they
might be more likely to avoid another devastating war. Their efforts began with a free trade association,
evolved into a common market, and then transformed into what is now a full economic union, known as the
European Union. The EU, as it is often called, has a number of goals. For example, in the early 2000s it
introduced a common currency for Europe, the euro, and phased out most of the former national forms of
money like the German mark and the French franc, though a few have retained their own currency. Another
key element of the union is to eliminate barriers to the mobility of goods, labor, and capital across Europe. In
2016, Britain voted to leave the European Union--a move that was completed in January 2020.

For the United States, perhaps the best-known regional trading agreement is the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA). 2 The United States also participates in some less-prominent regional trading
agreements, like the Caribbean Basin Initiative, which offers reduced tariffs for imports from these countries,
and a free trade agreement with Israel.

The world has seen a flood of regional trading agreements in recent years. About 100 such agreements are now
in place. Table 34.5 lists a few of the more prominent ones. Some are just agreements to continue talking.
Others set specific goals for reducing tariffs, import quotas, and nontariff barriers. One economist described
the current trade treaties as a "spaghetti bowl," which is what a map with lines connecting all the countries
with trade treaties looks like.

There is concern among economists who favor free trade that some of these regional agreements may promise
free trade, but actually act as a way for the countries within the regional agreement to try to limit trade from
anywhere else. In some cases, the regional trade agreements may even conflict with the broader agreements of
the World Trade Organization.

Trade Policy at the National Level

Yet another dimension of trade policy, along with international and regional trade agreements, happens at the
national level. The United States, for example, imposes import quotas on sugar, because of a fear that such
imports would drive down the price of sugar and thus injure domestic sugar producers. One of the jobs of the
United States Department of Commerce is to determine if there is import dumping from other countries. The
United States International Trade Commission--a government agency--determines whether the dumping has
substantially injured domestic industries, and if so, the president can impose tariffs that are intended to offset
the unfairly low price.

In the arena of trade policy, the battle often seems to be between national laws that increase protectionism and
international agreements that try to reduce protectionism, like the WTO. Why would a country pass laws or
negotiate agreements to shut out certain foreign products, like sugar or textiles, while simultaneously
negotiating to reduce trade barriers in general? One plausible answer is that international trade agreements
offer a method for countries to restrain their own special interests. A member of Congress can say to an
industry lobbying for tariffs or quotas on imports: "Sure would like to help you, but that pesky WTO agreement
just won't let me."

     LINK IT UP

If consumers are the biggest losers from trade, why do they not fight back? The quick answer is because it is
easier to organize a small group of people around a narrow interest (producers) versus a large group that has
diffuse interests (consumers). This is a question about trade policy theory. Visit this website

836 34 · Globalization and Protectionism

      Long-Term Trends in Barriers to Trade

       In newspaper headlines, trade policy appears mostly as disputes and acrimony. Countries are almost
       constantly threatening to challenge other nations' "unfair" trading practices. Cases are brought to the dispute
       settlement procedures of the WTO, the European Union, NAFTA, and other regional trading agreements.
       Politicians in national legislatures, goaded on by lobbyists, often threaten to pass bills that will "establish a fair
       playing field" or "prevent unfair trade"--although most such bills seek to accomplish these high-sounding
       goals by placing more restrictions on trade. Protesters in the streets may object to specific trade rules or to the
       entire practice of international trade.

       Through all the controversy, the general trend in the last 60 years is clearly toward lower barriers to trade. The
       average level of tariffs on imported products charged by industrialized countries was 40% in 1946. By 1990,
       after decades of GATT negotiations, it was down to less than 5%. One of the reasons that GATT negotiations
       shifted from focusing on tariff reduction in the early rounds to a broader agenda was that tariffs had been
       reduced so dramatically there was not much more to do in that area. U.S. tariffs have followed this general
       pattern: After rising sharply during the Great Depression, tariffs dropped off to less than 2% by the end of the
       century. Although measures of import quotas and nontariff barriers are less exact than those for tariffs, they
       generally appear to be at lower levels than they had been previously, too.

       Thus, the last half-century has seen both a dramatic reduction in government-created barriers to trade, such
       as tariffs, import quotas, and nontariff barriers, and also a number of technological developments that have
       made international trade easier, like advances in transportation, communication, and information
       management. The result has been the powerful surge of international trade.

       These trends were altered by two important events in 2016: the UK vote to leave the EU and the election of
       President Trump in the United States, whose administration pursued a policy of raising trade barriers. In
       2018, tariffs on a broad range of imports from China were raised by around 25%. As of 2022, the UK has been
       out of the EU for two years, and it remains unclear if President Biden's administration will adjust or remove
       President Trump's trade barriers.

     34.5 The Tradeoffs of Trade Policy

       LEARNING OBJECTIVES
       By the end of this section, you will be able to:

         · Asses the complexity of international trade
         · Discuss why a market-oriented economy is so affected by international trade
         · Explain disruptive market change

       Economists readily acknowledge that international trade is not all sunshine, roses, and happy endings. Over
       time, the average person gains from international trade, both as a worker who has greater productivity and
       higher wages because of the benefits of specialization and comparative advantage, and as a consumer who can
       benefit from shopping all over the world for a greater variety of quality products at attractive prices. The
       "average person," however, is hypothetical, not real--representing a mix of those who have done very well,
       those who have done all right, and those who have done poorly. It is a legitimate concern of public policy to
       focus not just on the average or on the success stories, but also on those who have not been so fortunate.
       Workers in other countries, the environment, and prospects for new industries and materials that might be of
       key importance to the national economy are also all legitimate issues.

       The common belief among economists is that it is better to embrace the gains from trade, and then deal with
       the costs and tradeoffs with other policy tools, than it is to cut off trade to avoid the costs and tradeoffs.

       To gain a better intuitive understanding for this argument, consider a hypothetical American company called
       Technotron. Technotron invents a new scientific technology that allows the firm to increase the output and
       quality of its goods with a smaller number of workers at a lower cost. As a result of this technology, other U.S.

         Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                                          34.5 · The Tradeoffs of Trade Policy 837

firms in this industry will lose money and will also have to lay off workers--and some of the competing firms
will even go bankrupt. Should the United States government protect the existing firms and their employees by
making it illegal for Technotron to use its new technology? Most people who live in market-oriented economies
would oppose trying to block better products that lower the cost of services. Certainly, there is a case for
society providing temporary support and assistance for those who find themselves without work. Many would
argue for government support of programs that encourage retraining and acquiring additional skills.
Government might also support research and development efforts, so that other firms may find ways of
outdoing Technotron. Blocking the new technology altogether, however, seems like a mistake. After all, few
people would advocate giving up electricity because it caused so much disruption to the kerosene and candle
business. Few would suggest holding back on improvements in medical technology because they might cause
companies selling leeches and snake oil to lose money. In short, most people view disruptions due to
technological change as a necessary cost that is worth bearing.

Now, imagine that Technotron's new "technology" is as simple as this: the company imports what it sells from
another country. In other words, think of foreign trade as a type of innovative technology. The objective
situation is now exactly the same as before. Because of Technotron's new technology--which in this case is
importing goods from another county--other firms in this industry will lose money and lay off workers. Just as
it would have been inappropriate and ultimately foolish to respond to the disruptions of new scientific
technology by trying to shut it down, it would be inappropriate and ultimately foolish to respond to the
disruptions of international trade by trying to restrict trade.

Some workers and firms will suffer because of international trade. In a living, breathing market-oriented
economy, some workers and firms will always be experiencing disruptions, for a wide variety of reasons.
Corporate management can be better or worse. Workers for a certain firm can be more or less productive.
Tough domestic competitors can create just as much disruption as tough foreign competitors. Sometimes a
new product is a hit with consumers; sometimes it is a flop. Sometimes a company is blessed by a run of good
luck or stricken with a run of bad luck. For some firms, international trade will offer great opportunities for
expanding productivity and jobs; for other firms, trade will impose stress and pain. The disruption caused by
international trade is not fundamentally different from all the other disruptions caused by the other workings
of a market economy.

In other words, the economic analysis of free trade does not rely on a belief that foreign trade is not disruptive
or does not pose tradeoffs; indeed, the story of Technotron begins with a particular disruptive market
change--a new technology--that causes real tradeoffs. In thinking about the disruptions of foreign trade, or any
of the other possible costs and tradeoffs of foreign trade discussed in this chapter, the best public policy
solutions typically do not involve protectionism, but instead involve finding ways for public policy to address
the particular issues resulting from these disruptions, costs, and tradeoffs, while still allowing the benefits of
international trade to occur.

What's the Downside of Protection?

The domestic flat-panel display industry employed many workers before the ITC imposed the dumping margin tax.
Flat-panel displays make up a significant portion of the cost of producing laptop computers--as much as 50%.
Therefore, the antidumping tax would substantially increase the cost, and thus the price, of U.S.-manufactured
laptops. As a result of the ITC's decision, Apple moved its domestic manufacturing plant for Macintosh computers to
Ireland (where it had an existing plant). Toshiba shut down its U.S. manufacturing plant for laptops. And IBM
cancelled plans to open a laptop manufacturing plant in North Carolina, instead deciding to expand production at its
plant in Japan. In this case, rather than having the desired effect of protecting U.S. interests and giving domestic
manufacturing an advantage over items manufactured elsewhere, it had the unintended effect of driving the
838 34 · Globalization and Protectionism

       manufacturing completely out of the country. Many people lost their jobs and most flat-panel display production
       now occurs in countries other than the United States.

Key Concepts and Summary

34.1 Protectionism: An Indirect Subsidy from Consumers to Producers

There are three tools for restricting the flow of trade: tariffs, import quotas, and nontariff barriers. When a
country places limitations on imports from abroad, regardless of whether it uses tariffs, quotas, or nontariff
barriers, it is said to be practicing protectionism. Protectionism will raise the price of the protected good in the
domestic market, which causes domestic consumers to pay more, but domestic producers to earn more.

34.2 International Trade and Its Effects on Jobs, Wages, and Working Conditions

As international trade increases, it contributes to a shift in jobs away from industries where that economy does
not have a comparative advantage and toward industries where it does have a comparative advantage. The
degree to which trade affects labor markets has much to do with the structure of the labor market in that
country and the adjustment process in other industries. Global trade should raise the average level of wages by
increasing productivity. However, this increase in average wages may include both gains to workers in certain
jobs and industries and losses to others.

In thinking about labor practices in low-income countries, it is useful to draw a line between what is
unpleasant to think about and what is morally objectionable. For example, low wages and long working hours
in poor countries are unpleasant to think about, but for people in low-income parts of the world, it may well be
the best option open to them. Practices like child labor and forced labor are morally objectionable and many
countries refuse to import products made using these practices.

34.3 Arguments in Support of Restricting Imports

There are a number of arguments that support restricting imports. These arguments are based around
840 34 · Self-Check Questions

industry and competition, environmental concerns, and issues of safety and security.

The infant industry argument for protectionism is that small domestic industries need to be temporarily
nurtured and protected from foreign competition for a time so that they can grow into strong competitors. In
some cases, notably in East Asia, this approach has worked. Often, however, the infant industries never grow
up. On the other hand, arguments against dumping (which is setting prices below the cost of production to
drive competitors out of the market), often simply seem to be a convenient excuse for imposing protectionism.

Low-income countries typically have lower environmental standards than high-income countries because they
are more worried about immediate basics such as food, education, and healthcare. However, except for a small
number of extreme cases, shutting off trade seems unlikely to be an effective method of pursuing a cleaner
environment.

Finally, there are arguments involving safety and security. Under the rules of the World Trade Organization,
countries are allowed to set whatever standards for product safety they wish, but the standards must be the
same for domestic products as for imported products and there must be a scientific basis for the standard. The
national interest argument for protectionism holds that it is unwise to import certain key products because if
the nation becomes dependent on key imported supplies, it could be vulnerable to a cutoff. However, it is often
wiser to stockpile resources and to use foreign supplies when available, rather than preemptively restricting
foreign supplies so as not to become dependent on them.

34.4 How Governments Enact Trade Policy: Globally, Regionally, and Nationally

Governments determine trade policy at many different levels: administrative agencies within government,
laws passed by the legislature, regional negotiations between a small group of nations (sometimes just two),
and global negotiations through the World Trade Organization. During the second half of the twentieth century,
trade barriers have, in general, declined quite substantially in the United States economy and in the global
economy. One reason why countries sign international trade agreements to commit themselves to free trade is
to give themselves protection against their own special interests. When an industry lobbies for protection from
foreign producers, politicians can point out that, because of the trade treaty, their hands are tied.

34.5 The Tradeoffs of Trade Policy

International trade certainly has income distribution effects. This is hardly surprising. All domestic or
international competitive market forces are disruptive. They cause companies and industries to rise and fall.
Government has a role to play in cushioning workers against the disruptions of the market. However, just as it
would be unwise in the long term to clamp down on new technology and other causes of disruption in domestic
markets, it would be unwise to clamp down on foreign trade. In both cases, the disruption brings with it
economic benefits.

APPENDIX A

The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics

(This appendix should be consulted after first reading Welcome to Economics!) Economics is not math. There
is no important concept in this course that cannot be explained without mathematics. That said, math is a tool
that can be used to illustrate economic concepts. Remember the saying a picture is worth a thousand words?
Instead of a picture, think of a graph. It is the same thing. Economists use models as the primary tool to derive
insights about economic issues and problems. Math is one way of working with (or manipulating) economic
models.

There are other ways of representing models, such as text or narrative. But why would you use your fist to bang
a nail, if you had a hammer? Math has certain advantages over text. It disciplines your thinking by making you
specify exactly what you mean. You can get away with fuzzy thinking in your head, but you cannot when you
reduce a model to algebraic equations. At the same time, math also has disadvantages. Mathematical models
are necessarily based on simplifying assumptions, so they are not likely to be perfectly realistic. Mathematical
models also lack the nuances which can be found in narrative models. The point is that math is one tool, but it
is not the only tool or even always the best tool economists can use. So what math will you need for this book?
The answer is: little more than high school algebra and graphs. You will need to know:

  · What a function is
  · How to interpret the equation of a line (i.e., slope and intercept)
  · How to manipulate a line (i.e., changing the slope or the intercept)
  · How to compute and interpret a growth rate (i.e., percentage change)
  · How to read and manipulate a graph

In this text, we will use the easiest math possible, and we will introduce it in this appendix. So if you find some
math in the book that you cannot follow, come back to this appendix to review. Like most things, math has
diminishing returns. A little math ability goes a long way; the more advanced math you bring in, the less
additional knowledge that will get you. That said, if you are going to major in economics, you should consider
learning a little calculus. It will be worth your while in terms of helping you learn advanced economics more
quickly.

Algebraic Models

Often economic models (or parts of models) are expressed in terms of mathematical functions. What is a
function? A function describes a relationship. Sometimes the relationship is a definition. For example (using
words), your professor is Adam Smith. This could be expressed as Professor = Adam Smith. Or Friends = Bob +
Shawn + Margaret.

Often in economics, functions describe cause and effect. The variable on the left-hand side is what is being
explained ("the effect"). On the right-hand side is what is doing the explaining ("the causes"). For example,
suppose your GPA was determined as follows:

This equation states that your GPA depends on three things: your combined SAT score, your class attendance,
and the number of hours you spend studying. It also says that study time is twice as important (0.50) as either
combined_SAT score (0.25) or class_attendance (0.25). If this relationship is true, how could you raise your
GPA? By not skipping class and studying more. Note that you cannot do anything about your SAT score, since if
you are in college, you have (presumably) already taken the SATs.
846 A · The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics

Of course, economic models express relationships using economic variables, like Budget =
money_spent_on_econ_books + money_spent_on_music, assuming that the only things you buy are
economics books and music.
Most of the relationships we use in this course are expressed as linear equations of the form:

Expressing Equations Graphically
Graphs are useful for two purposes. The first is to express equations visually, and the second is to display
statistics or data. This section will discuss expressing equations visually.
To a mathematician or an economist, a variable is the name given to a quantity that may assume a range of
values. In the equation of a line presented above, x and y are the variables, with x on the horizontal axis and y
on the vertical axis, and b and m representing factors that determine the shape of the line. To see how this
equation works, consider a numerical example:

In this equation for a specific line, the b term has been set equal to 9 and the m term has been set equal to 3.
Table A1 shows the values of x and y for this given equation. Figure A1 shows this equation, and these values,
in a graph. To construct the table, just plug in a series of different values for x, and then calculate what value of
y results. In the figure, these points are plotted and a line is drawn through them.

FIGURE A1 Slope and the Algebra of Straight Lines This line graph has x on the horizontal axis and y on the vertical
axis. The y-intercept--that is, the point where the line intersects the y-axis--is 9. The slope of the line is 3; that is,
there is a rise of 3 on the vertical axis for every increase of 1 on the horizontal axis. The slope is the same all along a
straight line.
This example illustrates how the b and m terms in an equation for a straight line determine the shape of the
line. The b term is called the y-intercept. The reason for this name is that, if x = 0, then the b term will reveal
where the line intercepts, or crosses, the y-axis. In this example, the line hits the vertical axis at 9. The m term
in the equation for the line is the slope. Remember that slope is defined as rise over run; more specifically, the
slope of a line from one point to another is the change in the vertical axis divided by the change in the
horizontal axis. In this example, each time the x term increases by one (the run), the y term rises by three.
Thus, the slope of this line is three. Specifying a y-intercept and a slope--that is, specifying b and m in the
equation for a line--will identify a specific line. Although it is rare for real-world data points to arrange
themselves as an exact straight line, it often turns out that a straight line can offer a reasonable approximation
of actual data.
Interpreting the Slope
The concept of slope is very useful in economics, because it measures the relationship between two variables.
A positive slope means that two variables are positively related; that is, when x increases, so does y, or when x
decreases, y decreases also. Graphically, a positive slope means that as a line on the line graph moves from left
to right, the line rises. The length-weight relationship, shown in Figure A3 later in this Appendix, has a positive
slope. We will learn in other chapters that price and quantity supplied have a positive relationship; that is,
firms will supply more when the price is higher.
A negative slope means that two variables are negatively related; that is, when x increases, y decreases, or
when x decreases, y increases. Graphically, a negative slope means that, as the line on the line graph moves
from left to right, the line falls. The altitude-air density relationship, shown in Figure A4 later in this appendix,
has a negative slope. We will learn that price and quantity demanded have a negative relationship; that is,
consumers will purchase less when the price is higher.
A slope of zero means that there is no relationship between x and y. Graphically, the line is flat; that is, zero rise
over the run. Figure A5 of the unemployment rate, shown later in this appendix, illustrates a common pattern
of many line graphs: some segments where the slope is positive, other segments where the slope is negative,
and still other segments where the slope is close to zero.
The slope of a straight line between two points can be calculated in numerical terms. To calculate slope, begin
by designating one point as the "starting point" and the other point as the "end point" and then calculating the
rise over run between these two points. As an example, consider the slope of the air density graph between the
848 A · The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics

points representing an altitude of 4,000 meters and an altitude of 6,000 meters:
Rise: Change in variable on vertical axis (end point minus original point)

Run: Change in variable on horizontal axis (end point minus original point)

Thus, the slope of a straight line between these two points would be that from the altitude of 4,000 meters up to
6,000 meters, the density of the air decreases by approximately 0.1 kilograms/cubic meter for each of the next
1,000 meters.
Suppose the slope of a line were to increase. Graphically, that means it would get steeper. Suppose the slope of
a line were to decrease. Then it would get flatter. These conditions are true whether or not the slope was
positive or negative to begin with. A higher positive slope means a steeper upward tilt to the line, while a
smaller positive slope means a flatter upward tilt to the line. A negative slope that is larger in absolute value
(that is, more negative) means a steeper downward tilt to the line. A slope of zero is a horizontal flat line. A
vertical line has an infinite slope.
Suppose a line has a larger intercept. Graphically, that means it would shift out (or up) from the old origin,
parallel to the old line. If a line has a smaller intercept, it would shift in (or down), parallel to the old line.
Solving Models with Algebra
Economists often use models to answer a specific question, like: What will the unemployment rate be if the
economy grows at 3% per year? Answering specific questions requires solving the "system" of equations that
represent the model.
Suppose the demand for personal pizzas is given by the following equation:

where Qd is the amount of personal pizzas consumers want to buy (i.e., quantity demanded), and P is the price
of pizzas. Suppose the supply of personal pizzas is:

where Qs is the amount of pizza producers will supply (i.e., quantity supplied).
Finally, suppose that the personal pizza market operates where supply equals demand, or

We now have a system of three equations and three unknowns (Qd, Qs, and P), which we can solve with algebra:
Since Qd = Qs, we can set the demand and supply equation equal to each other:

Subtracting 2 from both sides and adding 2P to both sides yields:

Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                       A · The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics 849

In other words, the price of each personal pizza will be $2. How much will consumers buy?
Taking the price of $2, and plugging it into the demand equation, we get:

So if the price is $2 each, consumers will purchase 12. How much will producers supply? Taking the price of
$2, and plugging it into the supply equation, we get:

So if the price is $2 each, producers will supply 12 personal pizzas. This means we did our math correctly,
since Qd = Qs.
Solving Models with Graphs
If algebra is not your forte, you can get the same answer by using graphs. Take the equations for Qd and Qs and
graph them on the same set of axes as shown in Figure A2. Since P is on the vertical axis, it is easiest if you
solve each equation for P. The demand curve is then P = 8 - 0.5Qd and the supply curve is P = -0.4 + 0.2Qs.
Note that the vertical intercepts are 8 and -0.4, and the slopes are -0.5 for demand and 0.2 for supply. If you
draw the graphs carefully, you will see that where they cross (Qs = Qd), the price is $2 and the quantity is 12,
just like the algebra predicted.

 FIGURE A2 Supply and Demand Graph The equations for Qd and Qs are displayed graphically by the sloped lines.
We will use graphs more frequently in this book than algebra, but now you know the math behind the graphs.

Growth Rates

Growth rates are frequently encountered in real world economics. A growth rate is simply the percentage
change in some quantity. It could be your income. It could be a business's sales. It could be a nation's GDP. The
formula for computing a growth rate is straightforward:

Suppose your job pays $10 per hour. Your boss, however, is so impressed with your work that he gives you a $2
per hour raise. The percentage change (or growth rate) in your pay is $2/$10 = 0.20 or 20%.
To compute the growth rate for data over an extended period of time, for example, the average annual growth
in GDP over a decade or more, the denominator is commonly defined a little differently. In the previous
example, we defined the quantity as the initial quantity--or the quantity when we started. This is fine for a one-
time calculation, but when we compute the growth over and over, it makes more sense to define the quantity as
the average quantity over the period in question, which is defined as the quantity halfway between the initial
quantity and the next quantity. This is harder to explain in words than to show with an example. Suppose a
nation's GDP was $1 trillion in 2005 and $1.03 trillion in 2006. The growth rate between 2005 and 2006 would
be the change in GDP ($1.03 trillion - $1.00 trillion) divided by the average GDP between 2005 and 2006 ($1.03
trillion + $1.00 trillion)/2. In other words:

Note that if we used the first method, the calculation would be ($1.03 trillion - $1.00 trillion) / $1.00 trillion =
3% growth, which is approximately the same as the second, more complicated method. If you need a rough
approximation, use the first method. If you need accuracy, use the second method.
A few things to remember: A positive growth rate means the quantity is growing. A smaller growth rate means
the quantity is growing more slowly. A larger growth rate means the quantity is growing more quickly. A
negative growth rate means the quantity is decreasing.
The same change over times yields a smaller growth rate. If you got a $2 raise each year, in the first year the
growth rate would be $2/$10 = 20%, as shown above. But in the second year, the growth rate would be $2/$12 =
0.167 or 16.7% growth. In the third year, the same $2 raise would correspond to a $2/$14 = 14.2%. The moral
of the story is this: To keep the growth rate the same, the change must increase each period.

Displaying Data Graphically and Interpreting the Graph

Graphs are also used to display data or evidence. Graphs are a method of presenting numerical patterns. They
condense detailed numerical information into a visual form in which relationships and numerical patterns can
be seen more easily. For example, which countries have larger or smaller populations? A careful reader could
examine a long list of numbers representing the populations of many countries, but with over 200 nations in
the world, searching through such a list would take concentration and time. Putting these same numbers on a
graph can quickly reveal population patterns. Economists use graphs both for a compact and readable
presentation of groups of numbers and for building an intuitive grasp of relationships and connections.
Three types of graphs are used in this book: line graphs, pie graphs, and bar graphs. Each is discussed below.
We also provide warnings about how graphs can be manipulated to alter viewers' perceptions of the
relationships in the data.
Line Graphs
The graphs we have discussed so far are called line graphs, because they show a relationship between two
variables: one measured on the horizontal axis and the other measured on the vertical axis.
Sometimes it is useful to show more than one set of data on the same axes. The data in Table A2 is displayed in
Figure A3 which shows the relationship between two variables: length and median weight for American baby
boys and girls during the first three years of life. (The median means that half of all babies weigh more than

this and half weigh less.) The line graph measures length in inches on the horizontal axis and weight in pounds
on the vertical axis. For example, point A on the figure shows that a boy who is 28 inches long will have a
median weight of about 19 pounds. One line on the graph shows the length-weight relationship for boys and
the other line shows the relationship for girls. This kind of graph is widely used by healthcare providers to
check whether a child's physical development is roughly on track.

FIGURE A3 The Length-Weight Relationship for American Boys and Girls The line graph shows the relationship
between height and weight for boys and girls from birth to 3 years. Point A, for example, shows that a boy of 28
inches in height (measured on the horizontal axis) is typically 19 pounds in weight (measured on the vertical axis).
These data apply only to children in the first three years of life.

852 A · The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics

Not all relationships in economics are linear. Sometimes they are curves. Figure A4 presents another example
of a line graph, representing the data from Table A3. In this case, the line graph shows how thin the air
becomes when you climb a mountain. The horizontal axis of the figure shows altitude, measured in meters
above sea level. The vertical axis measures the density of the air at each altitude. Air density is measured by
the weight of the air in a cubic meter of space (that is, a box measuring one meter in height, width, and depth).
As the graph shows, air pressure is heaviest at ground level and becomes lighter as you climb. Figure A4 shows
that a cubic meter of air at an altitude of 500 meters weighs approximately one kilogram (about 2.2 pounds).
However, as the altitude increases, air density decreases. A cubic meter of air at the top of Mount Everest, at
about 8,828 meters, would weigh only 0.023 kilograms. The thin air at high altitudes explains why many
mountain climbers need to use oxygen tanks as they reach the top of a mountain.

FIGURE A4 Altitude-Air Density Relationship This line graph shows the relationship between altitude, measured in
meters above sea level, and air density, measured in kilograms of air per cubic meter. As altitude rises, air density
declines. The point at the top of Mount Everest has an altitude of approximately 8,828 meters above sea level (the
horizontal axis) and air density of 0.023 kilograms per cubic meter (the vertical axis).

                                 Altitude (meters) Air Density (kg/cubic meters)

TABLE A3 Altitude to Air Density Relationship

The length-weight relationship and the altitude-air density relationships in these two figures represent
averages. If you were to collect actual data on air pressure at different altitudes, the same altitude in different
geographic locations will have slightly different air density, depending on factors like how far you are from the
equator, local weather conditions, and the humidity in the air. Similarly, in measuring the height and weight of
children for the previous line graph, children of a particular height would have a range of different weights,
some above average and some below. In the real world, this sort of variation in data is common. The task of a
researcher is to organize that data in a way that helps to understand typical patterns. The study of statistics,
especially when combined with computer statistics and spreadsheet programs, is a great help in organizing
this kind of data, plotting line graphs, and looking for typical underlying relationships. For most economics
and social science majors, a statistics course will be required at some point.

One common line graph is called a time series, in which the horizontal axis shows time and the vertical axis
displays another variable. Thus, a time series graph shows how a variable changes over time. Figure A5 shows
the unemployment rate in the United States since 1975, where unemployment is defined as the percentage of
adults who want jobs and are looking for a job, but cannot find one. The points for the unemployment rate in
each year are plotted on the graph, and a line then connects the points, showing how the unemployment rate
has moved up and down since 1975. The line graph makes it easy to see, for example, that the highest
unemployment rate during this time period was slightly less than 10% in the early 1980s and 2010, while the
unemployment rate declined from the early 1990s to the end of the 1990s, before rising and then falling back
in the early 2000s, and then rising sharply during the recession from 2008-2009.
854 A · The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics

FIGURE A5 U.S. Unemployment Rate, 1975-2014 This graph provides a quick visual summary of unemployment
data. With a graph like this, it is easy to spot the times of high unemployment and of low unemployment.

Pie Graphs

A pie graph (sometimes called a pie chart) is used to show how an overall total is divided into parts. A circle
represents a group as a whole. The slices of this circular "pie" show the relative sizes of subgroups.

Figure A6 shows how the U.S. population was divided among children, working age adults, and the elderly in
1970, 2000, and what is projected for 2030. The information is first conveyed with numbers in Table A4, and
then in three pie charts. The first column of Table A4 shows the total U.S. population for each of the three
years. Columns 2-4 categorize the total in terms of age groups--from birth to 18 years, from 19 to 64 years, and
65 years and above. In columns 2-4, the first number shows the actual number of people in each age category,
while the number in parentheses shows the percentage of the total population comprised by that age group.

Year Total Population 19 and Under 20-64 years             Over 65

1970 205.0 million               77.2 (37.6%) 107.7 (52.5%) 20.1 (9.8%)

2000 275.4 million               78.4 (28.5%) 162.2 (58.9%) 34.8 (12.6%)

FIGURE A6 Pie Graphs of the U.S. Age Distribution (numbers in millions) The three pie graphs illustrate the division
of total population into three age groups for the three different years.
In a pie graph, each slice of the pie represents a share of the total, or a percentage. For example, 50% would be
half of the pie and 20% would be one-fifth of the pie. The three pie graphs in Figure A6 show that the share of
the U.S. population 65 and over is growing. The pie graphs allow you to get a feel for the relative size of the
different age groups from 1970 to 2000 to 2030, without requiring you to slog through the specific numbers
and percentages in the table. Some common examples of how pie graphs are used include dividing the
population into groups by age, income level, ethnicity, religion, occupation; dividing different firms into
categories by size, industry, number of employees; and dividing up government spending or taxes into its main
categories.
Bar Graphs
A bar graph uses the height of different bars to compare quantities. Table A5 lists the 12 most populous
countries in the world. Figure A7 provides this same data in a bar graph. The height of the bars corresponds to
the population of each country. Although you may know that China and India are the most populous countries
in the world, seeing how the bars on the graph tower over the other countries helps illustrate the magnitude of
the difference between the sizes of national populations.

Bar graphs can be subdivided in a way that reveals information similar to that we can get from pie charts.
Figure A8 offers three bar graphs based on the information from Figure A6 about the U.S. age distribution in
1970, 2000, and 2030. Figure A8 (a) shows three bars for each year, representing the total number of persons
in each age bracket for each year. Figure A8 (b) shows just one bar for each year, but the different age groups
are now shaded inside the bar. In Figure A8 (c), still based on the same data, the vertical axis measures
percentages rather than the number of persons. In this case, all three bar graphs are the same height,
representing 100% of the population, with each bar divided according to the percentage of population in each
age group. It is sometimes easier for a reader to run their eyes across several bar graphs, comparing the

shaded areas, rather than trying to compare several pie graphs.

FIGURE A8 U.S. Population with Bar Graphs Population data can be represented in different ways. (a) Shows three
bars for each year, representing the total number of persons in each age bracket for each year. (b) Shows just one
bar for each year, but the different age groups are now shaded inside the bar. (c) Sets the vertical axis as a measure
of percentages rather than the number of persons. All three bar graphs are the same height and each bar is divided
according to the percentage of population in each age group.
Figure A7 and Figure A8 show how the bars can represent countries or years, and how the vertical axis can
represent a numerical or a percentage value. Bar graphs can also compare size, quantity, rates, distances, and
other quantitative categories.
Comparing Line Graphs with Pie Charts and Bar Graphs
Now that you are familiar with pie graphs, bar graphs, and line graphs, how do you know which graph to use for
your data? Pie graphs are often better than line graphs at showing how an overall group is divided. However, if
a pie graph has too many slices, it can become difficult to interpret.
Bar graphs are especially useful when comparing quantities. For example, if you are studying the populations
of different countries, as in Figure A7, bar graphs can show the relationships between the population sizes of
multiple countries. Not only can it show these relationships, but it can also show breakdowns of different
groups within the population.
858 A · The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics

A line graph is often the most effective format for illustrating a relationship between two variables that are both
changing. For example, time series graphs can show patterns as time changes, like the unemployment rate
over time. Line graphs are widely used in economics to present continuous data about prices, wages, quantities
bought and sold, the size of the economy.
How Graphs Can Be Misleading
Graphs not only reveal patterns; they can also alter how patterns are perceived. To see some of the ways this
can be done, consider the line graphs of Figure A9, Figure A10, and Figure A11. These graphs all illustrate the
unemployment rate--but from different perspectives.

FIGURE A10 Presenting Unemployment Rates in Different Ways, All of Them Accurate Simply changing the width

860 A · The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics

FIGURE A11 Presenting Unemployment Rates in Different Ways, All of Them Accurate Simply changing the width
and height of the area in which data is displayed can alter the perception of the data.
Suppose you wanted a graph which gives the impression that the rise in unemployment in 2009 was not all
that large, or all that extraordinary by historical standards. You might choose to present your data as in Figure
A9 (a). Figure A9 (a) includes much of the same data presented earlier in Figure A5, but stretches the
horizontal axis out longer relative to the vertical axis. By spreading the graph wide and flat, the visual
appearance is that the rise in unemployment is not so large, and is similar to some past rises in
unemployment. Now imagine you wanted to emphasize how unemployment spiked substantially higher in
2009. In this case, using the same data, you can stretch the vertical axis out relative to the horizontal axis, as in
Figure A9 (b), which makes all rises and falls in unemployment appear larger.
A similar effect can be accomplished without changing the length of the axes, but by changing the scale on the
vertical axis. In Figure A10 (c), the scale on the vertical axis runs from 0% to 30%, while in Figure A10 (d), the
vertical axis runs from 3% to 10%. Compared to Figure A5, where the vertical scale runs from 0% to 12%,
Figure A10 (c) makes the fluctuation in unemployment look smaller, while Figure A10 (d) makes it look larger.
Another way to alter the perception of the graph is to reduce the amount of variation by changing the number
of points plotted on the graph. Figure A10 (e) shows the unemployment rate according to five-year averages. By
averaging out some of the year-to-year changes, the line appears smoother and with fewer highs and lows. In
reality, the unemployment rate is reported monthly, and Figure A11 (f) shows the monthly figures since 1960,
which fluctuate more than the five-year average. Figure A11 (f) is also a vivid illustration of how graphs can

                                                                                                       A · The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics 861

compress lots of data. The graph includes monthly data since 1960, which over almost 50 years, works out to
nearly 600 data points. Reading that list of 600 data points in numerical form would be hypnotic. You can,
however, get a good intuitive sense of these 600 data points very quickly from the graph.

A final trick in manipulating the perception of graphical information is that, by choosing the starting and
ending points carefully, you can influence the perception of whether the variable is rising or falling. The
original data show a general pattern with unemployment low in the 1960s, but spiking up in the mid-1970s,
early 1980s, early 1990s, early 2000s, and late 2000s. Figure A11 (g), however, shows a graph that goes back
only to 1975, which gives an impression that unemployment was more-or-less gradually falling over time until
the 2009 recession pushed it back up to its "original" level--which is a plausible interpretation if one starts at
the high point around 1975.

These kinds of tricks--or shall we just call them "presentation choices"-- are not limited to line graphs. In a pie
chart with many small slices and one large slice, someone must decide what categories should be used to
produce these slices in the first place, thus making some slices appear bigger than others. If you are making a
bar graph, you can make the vertical axis either taller or shorter, which will tend to make variations in the
height of the bars appear more or less.

Being able to read graphs is an essential skill, both in economics and in life. A graph is just one perspective or
point of view, shaped by choices such as those discussed in this section. Do not always believe the first quick
impression from a graph. View with caution.

Key Concepts and Summary

Math is a tool for understanding economics and economic relationships can be expressed mathematically
using algebra or graphs. The algebraic equation for a line is y = b + mx, where x is the variable on the
horizontal axis and y is the variable on the vertical axis, the b term is the y-intercept and the m term is the
slope. The slope of a line is the same at any point on the line and it indicates the relationship (positive,
negative, or zero) between two economic variables.

Economic models can be solved algebraically or graphically. Graphs allow you to illustrate data visually. They
can illustrate patterns, comparisons, trends, and apportionment by condensing the numerical data and
providing an intuitive sense of relationships in the data. A line graph shows the relationship between two
variables: one is shown on the horizontal axis and one on the vertical axis. A pie graph shows how something is
allotted, such as a sum of money or a group of people. The size of each slice of the pie is drawn to represent the
corresponding percentage of the whole. A bar graph uses the height of bars to show a relationship, where each
bar represents a certain entity, like a country or a group of people. The bars on a bar graph can also be divided
into segments to show subgroups.

Any graph is a single visual perspective on a subject. The impression it leaves will be based on many choices,
such as what data or time frame is included, how data or groups are divided up, the relative size of vertical and
horizontal axes, whether the scale used on a vertical starts at zero. Thus, any graph should be regarded
somewhat skeptically, remembering that the underlying relationship can be open to different interpretations.

            B · Indifference Curves 863

APPENDIX B

Indifference Curves

Economists use a vocabulary of maximizing utility to describe people's preferences. In Consumer Choices, the
level of utility that a person receives is described in numerical terms. This appendix presents an alternative
approach to describing personal preferences, called indifference curves, which avoids any need for using
numbers to measure utility. By setting aside the assumption of putting a numerical valuation on utility--an
assumption that many students and economists find uncomfortably unrealistic--the indifference curve
framework helps to clarify the logic of the underlying model.

What Is an Indifference Curve?

People cannot really put a numerical value on their level of satisfaction. However, they can, and do, identify
what choices would give them more, or less, or the same amount of satisfaction. An indifference curve shows
combinations of goods that provide an equal level of utility or satisfaction. For example, Figure B1 presents
three indifference curves that represent Lilly's preferences for the tradeoffs that she faces in her two main
relaxation activities: eating doughnuts and reading paperback books. Each indifference curve (Ul, Um, and Uh)
represents one level of utility. First we will explore the meaning of one particular indifference curve and then
we will look at the indifference curves as a group.

FIGURE B1 Lilly's Indifference Curves Lilly would receive equal utility from all points on a given indifference curve.
Any points on the highest indifference curve Uh, like F, provide greater utility than any points like A, B, C, and D on
the middle indifference curve Um. Similarly, any points on the middle indifference curve Um provide greater utility
than any points on the lowest indifference curve Ul.

The Shape of an Indifference Curve
864 B · Indifference Curves

The indifference curve Um has four points labeled on it: A, B, C, and D. Since an indifference curve represents
a set of choices that have the same level of utility, Lilly must receive an equal amount of utility, judged
according to her personal preferences, from two books and 120 doughnuts (point A), from three books and 84
doughnuts (point B) from 11 books and 40 doughnuts (point C) or from 12 books and 35 doughnuts (point D).
She would also receive the same utility from any of the unlabeled intermediate points along this indifference
curve.

Indifference curves have a roughly similar shape in two ways: 1) they are downward sloping from left to right;
2) they are convex with respect to the origin. In other words, they are steeper on the left and flatter on the right.
The downward slope of the indifference curve means that Lilly must trade off less of one good to get more of
the other, while holding utility constant. For example, points A and B sit on the same indifference curve Um,
which means that they provide Lilly with the same level of utility. Thus, the marginal utility that Lilly would
gain from, say, increasing her consumption of books from two to three must be equal to the marginal utility
that she would lose if her consumption of doughnuts was cut from 120 to 84--so that her overall utility remains
unchanged between points A and B. Indeed, the slope along an indifference curve as the marginal rate of
substitution, which is the rate at which a person is willing to trade one good for another so that utility will
remain the same.

Indifference curves like Um are steeper on the left and flatter on the right. The reason behind this shape
involves diminishing marginal utility--the notion that as a person consumes more of a good, the marginal
utility from each additional unit becomes lower. Compare two different choices between points that all provide
Lilly an equal amount of utility along the indifference curve Um: the choice between A and B, and between C
and D. In both choices, Lilly consumes one more book, but between A and B her consumption of doughnuts
falls by 36 (from 120 to 84) and between C and D it falls by only five (from 40 to 35). The reason for this
difference is that points A and C are different starting points, and thus have different implications for marginal
utility. At point A, Lilly has few books and many doughnuts. Thus, her marginal utility from an extra book will
be relatively high while the marginal utility of additional doughnuts is relatively low--so on the margin, it will
take a relatively large number of doughnuts to offset the utility from the marginal book. At point C, however,
Lilly has many books and few doughnuts. From this starting point, her marginal utility gained from extra
books will be relatively low, while the marginal utility lost from additional doughnuts would be relatively
high--so on the margin, it will take a relatively smaller number of doughnuts to offset the change of one
marginal book. In short, the slope of the indifference curve changes because the marginal rate of
substitution--that is, the quantity of one good that would be traded for the other good to keep utility
constant--also changes, as a result of diminishing marginal utility of both goods.

The Field of Indifference Curves

Each indifference curve represents the choices that provide a single level of utility. Every level of utility will
have its own indifference curve. Thus, Lilly's preferences will include an infinite number of indifference curves
lying nestled together on the diagram--even though only three of the indifference curves, representing three
levels of utility, appear on Figure B1. In other words, an infinite number of indifference curves are not drawn
on this diagram--but you should remember that they exist.

Higher indifference curves represent a greater level of utility than lower ones. In Figure B1, indifference curve
Ul can be thought of as a "low" level of utility, while Um is a "medium" level of utility and Uh is a "high" level of
utility. All of the choices on indifference curve Uh are preferred to all of the choices on indifference curve Um,
which in turn are preferred to all of the choices on Ul.

To understand why higher indifference curves are preferred to lower ones, compare point B on indifference
curve Um to point F on indifference curve Uh. Point F has greater consumption of both books (five to three)
and doughnuts (100 to 84), so point F is clearly preferable to point B. Given the definition of an indifference
curve--that all the points on the curve have the same level of utility--if point F on indifference curve Uh is
preferred to point B on indifference curve Um, then it must be true that all points on indifference curve Uh

have a higher level of utility than all points on Um. More generally, for any point on a lower indifference curve,
like Ul, you can identify a point on a higher indifference curve like Um or Uh that has a higher consumption of
both goods. Since one point on the higher indifference curve is preferred to one point on the lower curve, and
since all the points on a given indifference curve have the same level of utility, it must be true that all points on
higher indifference curves have greater utility than all points on lower indifference curves.
These arguments about the shapes of indifference curves and about higher or lower levels of utility do not
require any numerical estimates of utility, either by the individual or by anyone else. They are only based on
the assumptions that when people have less of one good they need more of another good to make up for it, if
they are keeping the same level of utility, and that as people have more of a good, the marginal utility they
receive from additional units of that good will diminish. Given these gentle assumptions, a field of indifference
curves can be mapped out to describe the preferences of any individual.
The Individuality of Indifference Curves
Each person determines their own preferences and utility. Thus, while indifference curves have the same
general shape--they slope down, and the slope is steeper on the left and flatter on the right--the specific shape
of indifference curves can be different for every person. Figure B1, for example, applies only to Lilly's
preferences. Indifference curves for other people would probably travel through different points.

Utility-Maximizing with Indifference Curves

People seek the highest level of utility, which means that they wish to be on the highest possible indifference
curve. However, people are limited by their budget constraints, which show what tradeoffs are actually
possible.
Maximizing Utility at the Highest Indifference Curve
Return to the situation of Lilly's choice between paperback books and doughnuts. Say that books cost $6,
doughnuts are 50 cents each, and that Lilly has $60 to spend. This information provides the basis for the
budget line shown in Figure B2. Along with the budget line are shown the three indifference curves from
Figure B1. What is Lilly's utility-maximizing choice? Several possibilities are identified in the diagram.

FIGURE B2 Indifference Curves and a Budget Constraint Lilly's preferences are shown by the indifference curves.
Lilly's budget constraint, given the prices of books and doughnuts and her income, is shown by the straight line.
866 B · Indifference Curves

Lilly's optimal choice will be point B, where the budget line is tangent to the indifference curve Um. Lilly would have
more utility at a point like F on the higher indifference curve Uh, but the budget line does not touch the higher
indifference curve Uh at any point, so she cannot afford this choice. A choice like G is affordable to Lilly, but it lies on
indifference curve Ul and thus provides less utility than choice B, which is on indifference curve Um.
The choice of F with five books and 100 doughnuts is highly desirable, since it is on the highest indifference
curve Uh of those shown in the diagram. However, it is not affordable given Lilly's budget constraint. The
choice of H with three books and 70 doughnuts on indifference curve Ul is a wasteful choice, since it is inside
Lilly's budget set, and as a utility-maximizer, Lilly will always prefer a choice on the budget constraint itself.
Choices B and G are both on the opportunity set. However, choice G of six books and 48 doughnuts is on lower
indifference curve Ul than choice B of three books and 84 doughnuts, which is on the indifference curve Um. If
Lilly were to start at choice G, and then thought about whether the marginal utility she was deriving from
doughnuts and books, she would decide that some additional doughnuts and fewer books would make her
happier--which would cause her to move toward her preferred choice B. Given the combination of Lilly's
personal preferences, as identified by her indifference curves, and Lilly's opportunity set, which is determined
by prices and income, B will be her utility-maximizing choice.
The highest achievable indifference curve touches the opportunity set at a single point of tangency. Since an
infinite number of indifference curves exist, even if only a few of them are drawn on any given diagram, there
will always exist one indifference curve that touches the budget line at a single point of tangency. All higher
indifference curves, like Uh, will be completely above the budget line and, although the choices on that
indifference curve would provide higher utility, they are not affordable given the budget set. All lower
indifference curves, like Ul, will cross the budget line in two separate places. When one indifference curve
crosses the budget line in two places, however, there will be another, higher, attainable indifference curve
sitting above it that touches the budget line at only one point of tangency.

Changes in Income

A rise in income causes the budget constraint to shift to the right. In graphical terms, the new budget
constraint will now be tangent to a higher indifference curve, representing a higher level of utility. A reduction
in income will cause the budget constraint to shift to the left, which will cause it to be tangent to a lower
indifference curve, representing a reduced level of utility. If income rises by, for example, 50%, exactly how
much will a person alter consumption of books and doughnuts? Will consumption of both goods rise by 50%,
or will the quantity of one good rise substantially, while the quantity of the other good rises only a little, or even
declines?
Since personal preferences and the shape of indifference curves are different for each individual, the response
to changes in income will be different, too. For example, consider the preferences of Manuel and Natasha in
Figure B3 (a) and Figure B3 (b). They each start with an identical income of $40, which they spend on yogurts
that cost $1 and rental movies that cost $4. Thus, they face identical budget constraints. However, based on
Manuel's preferences, as revealed by his indifference curves, his utility-maximizing choice on the original
budget set occurs where his opportunity set is tangent to the highest possible indifference curve at W, with
three movies and 28 yogurts, while Natasha's utility-maximizing choice on the original budget set at Y will be
seven movies and 12 yogurts.

                                                                                                                                                   B · Indifference Curves 867

FIGURE B3 Manuel and Natasha's Indifference Curves Manuel and Natasha originally face the same budget
constraints; that is, same prices and same income. However, the indifference curves that illustrate their preferences
are not the same. (a) Manuel's original choice at W involves more yogurt and more movies, and he reacts to the
higher income by mainly increasing consumption of movies at X. (b) Conversely, Natasha's original choice (Y)
involves relatively more movies, but she reacts to the higher income by choosing relatively more yogurts. Even when
budget constraints are the same, personal preferences lead to different original choices and to different reactions in
response to a change in income.
Now, say that income rises to $60 for both Manuel and Natasha, so their budget constraints shift to the right. As
shown in Figure B3 (a), Manuel's new utility maximizing choice at X will be seven movies and 32 yogurts--that
is, Manuel will choose to spend most of the extra income on movies. Natasha's new utility maximizing choice at
Z will be eight movies and 28 yogurts--that is, she will choose to spend most of the extra income on yogurt. In
this way, the indifference curve approach allows for a range of possible responses. However, if both goods are
normal goods, then the typical response to a higher level of income will be to purchase more of them--although
exactly how much more is a matter of personal preference. If one of the goods is an inferior good, the response
to a higher level of income will be to purchase less of it.

Responses to Price Changes: Substitution and Income Effects

A higher price for a good will cause the budget constraint to shift to the left, so that it is tangent to a lower
indifference curve representing a reduced level of utility. Conversely, a lower price for a good will cause the
opportunity set to shift to the right, so that it is tangent to a higher indifference curve representing an
increased level of utility. Exactly how much a change in price will lead to the quantity demanded of each good
will depend on personal preferences.
Anyone who faces a change in price will experience two interlinked motivations: a substitution effect and an
income effect. The substitution effect is that when a good becomes more expensive, people seek out
substitutes. If oranges become more expensive, fruit-lovers scale back on oranges and eat more apples,
grapefruit, or raisins. Conversely, when a good becomes cheaper, people substitute toward consuming more. If
oranges get cheaper, people fire up their juicing machines and ease off on other fruits and foods. The income
effect refers to how a change in the price of a good alters the effective buying power of one's income. If the price
of a good that you have been buying falls, then in effect your buying power has risen--you are able to purchase
more goods. Conversely, if the price of a good that you have been buying rises, then the buying power of a given
868 B · Indifference Curves

amount of income is diminished. (One common source of confusion is that the "income effect" does not refer
to a change in actual income. Instead, it refers to the situation in which the price of a good changes, and thus
the quantities of goods that can be purchased with a fixed amount of income change. It might be more accurate
to call the "income effect" a "buying power effect," but the "income effect" terminology has been used for
decades, and it is not going to change during this economics course.) Whenever a price changes, consumers
feel the pull of both substitution and income effects at the same time.
Using indifference curves, you can illustrate the substitution and income effects on a graph. In Figure B4,
Ogden faces a choice between two goods: haircuts or personal pizzas. Haircuts cost $20, personal pizzas cost
$6, and he has $120 to spend.

FIGURE B4 Substitution and Income Effects The original choice is A, the point of tangency between the original
budget constraint and indifference curve. The new choice is B, the point of tangency between the new budget
constraint and the lower indifference curve. Point C is the tangency between the dashed line, where the slope shows
the new higher price of haircuts, and the original indifference curve. The substitution effect is the shift from A to C,
which means getting fewer haircuts and more pizza. The income effect is the shift from C to B; that is, the reduction
in buying power that causes a shift from the higher indifference curve to the lower indifference curve, with relative
prices remaining unchanged. The income effect results in less consumed of both goods. Both substitution and
income effects cause fewer haircuts to be consumed. For pizza, in this case, the substitution effect and income
effect cancel out, leading to the same amount of pizza consumed.
The price of haircuts rises to $30. Ogden starts at choice A on the higher opportunity set and the higher
indifference curve. After the price of haircuts increases, he chooses B on the lower opportunity set and the
lower indifference curve. Point B with two haircuts and 10 personal pizzas is immediately below point A with
three haircuts and 10 personal pizzas, showing that Ogden reacted to a higher price of haircuts by cutting back
only on haircuts, while leaving his consumption of pizza unchanged.
The dashed line in the diagram, and point C, are used to separate the substitution effect and the income effect.
To understand their function, start by thinking about the substitution effect with this question: How would
Ogden change his consumption if the relative prices of the two goods changed, but this change in relative
prices did not affect his utility? The slope of the budget constraint is determined by the relative price of the two
goods; thus, the slope of the original budget line is determined by the original relative prices, while the slope of
the new budget line is determined by the new relative prices. With this thought in mind, the dashed line is a
graphical tool inserted in a specific way: It is inserted so that it is parallel with the new budget constraint, so it
reflects the new relative prices, but it is tangent to the original indifference curve, so it reflects the original
level of utility or buying power.
Thus, the movement from the original choice (A) to point C is a substitution effect; it shows the choice that

Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                                                   B · Indifference Curves 869

Ogden would make if relative prices shifted (as shown by the different slope between the original budget set
and the dashed line) but if buying power did not shift (as shown by being tangent to the original indifference
curve). The substitution effect will encourage people to shift away from the good which has become relatively
more expensive--in Ogden's case, the haircuts on the vertical axis--and toward the good which has become
relatively less expensive--in this case, the pizza on the vertical axis. The two arrows labeled with "s" for
"substitution effect," one on each axis, show the direction of this movement.

The income effect is the movement from point C to B, which shows how Ogden reacts to a reduction in his
buying power from the higher indifference curve to the lower indifference curve, but holding constant the
relative prices (because the dashed line has the same slope as the new budget constraint). In this case, where
the price of one good increases, buying power is reduced, so the income effect means that consumption of both
goods should fall (if they are both normal goods, which it is reasonable to assume unless there is reason to
believe otherwise). The two arrows labeled with "i" for "income effect," one on each axis, show the direction of
this income effect movement.

Now, put the substitution and income effects together. When the price of pizza increased, Ogden consumed
less of it, for two reasons shown in the exhibit: the substitution effect of the higher price led him to consume
less and the income effect of the higher price also led him to consume less. However, when the price of pizza
increased, Ogden consumed the same quantity of haircuts. The substitution effect of a higher price for pizza
meant that haircuts became relatively less expensive (compared to pizza), and this factor, taken alone, would
have encouraged Ogden to consume more haircuts. However, the income effect of a higher price for pizza
meant that he wished to consume less of both goods, and this factor, taken alone, would have encouraged
Ogden to consume fewer haircuts. As shown in Figure B4, in this particular example the substitution effect and
income effect on Ogden's consumption of haircuts are offsetting--so he ends up consuming the same quantity
of haircuts after the price increase for pizza as before.

The size of these income and substitution effects will differ from person to person, depending on individual
preferences. For example, if Ogden's substitution effect away from pizza and toward haircuts is especially
strong, and outweighs the income effect, then a higher price for pizza might lead to increased consumption of
haircuts. This case would be drawn on the graph so that the point of tangency between the new budget
constraint and the relevant indifference curve occurred below point B and to the right. Conversely, if the
substitution effect away from pizza and toward haircuts is not as strong, and the income effect on is relatively
stronger, then Ogden will be more likely to react to the higher price of pizza by consuming less of both goods.
In this case, his optimal choice after the price change will be above and to the left of choice B on the new
budget constraint.

Although the substitution and income effects are often discussed as a sequence of events, it should be
remembered that they are twin components of a single cause--a change in price. Although you can analyze
them separately, the two effects are always proceeding hand in hand, happening at the same time.

Indifference Curves with Labor-Leisure and Intertemporal Choices

The concept of an indifference curve applies to tradeoffs in any household choice, including the labor-leisure
choice or the intertemporal choice between present and future consumption. In the labor-leisure choice, each
indifference curve shows the combinations of leisure and income that provide a certain level of utility. In an
intertemporal choice, each indifference curve shows the combinations of present and future consumption that
provide a certain level of utility. The general shapes of the indifference curves--downward sloping, steeper on
the left and flatter on the right--also remain the same.

A Labor-Leisure Example

Petunia is working at a job that pays $12 per hour but she gets a raise to $20 per hour. After family
responsibilities and sleep, she has 80 hours per week available for work or leisure. As shown in Figure B5, the
highest level of utility for Petunia, on her original budget constraint, is at choice A, where it is tangent to the
870 B · Indifference Curves

lower indifference curve (Ul). Point A has 30 hours of leisure and thus 50 hours per week of work, with income
of $600 per week (that is, 50 hours of work at $12 per hour). Petunia then gets a raise to $20 per hour, which
shifts her budget constraint to the right. Her new utility-maximizing choice occurs where the new budget
constraint is tangent to the higher indifference curve Uh. At B, Petunia has 40 hours of leisure per week and
works 40 hours, with income of $800 per week (that is, 40 hours of work at $20 per hour).

FIGURE B5 Effects of a Change in Petunia's Wage Petunia starts at choice A, the tangency between her original
budget constraint and the lower indifference curve Ul. The wage increase shifts her budget constraint to the right, so
that she can now choose B on indifference curve Uh. The substitution effect is the movement from A to C. In this
case, the substitution effect would lead Petunia to choose less leisure, which is relatively more expensive, and more
income, which is relatively cheaper to earn. The income effect is the movement from C to B. The income effect in
this example leads to greater consumption of both goods. Overall, in this example, income rises because of both
substitution and income effects. However, leisure declines because of the substitution effect but increases because
of the income effect--leading, in Petunia's case, to an overall increase in the quantity of leisure consumed.
Substitution and income effects provide a vocabulary for discussing how Petunia reacts to a higher hourly
wage. The dashed line serves as the tool for separating the two effects on the graph.
The substitution effect tells how Petunia would have changed her hours of work if her wage had risen, so that
income was relatively cheaper to earn and leisure was relatively more expensive, but if she had remained at
the same level of utility. The slope of the budget constraint in a labor-leisure diagram is determined by the
wage rate. Thus, the dashed line is carefully inserted with the slope of the new opportunity set, reflecting the
labor-leisure tradeoff of the new wage rate, but tangent to the original indifference curve, showing the same
level of utility or "buying power." The shift from original choice A to point C, which is the point of tangency
between the original indifference curve and the dashed line, shows that because of the higher wage, Petunia
will want to consume less leisure and more income. The "s" arrows on the horizontal and vertical axes of
Figure B5 show the substitution effect on leisure and on income.
The income effect is that the higher wage, by shifting the labor-leisure budget constraint to the right, makes it
possible for Petunia to reach a higher level of utility. The income effect is the movement from point C to point
B; that is, it shows how Petunia's behavior would change in response to a higher level of utility or "buying
power," with the wage rate remaining the same (as shown by the dashed line being parallel to the new budget
constraint). The income effect, encouraging Petunia to consume both more leisure and more income, is drawn
with arrows on the horizontal and vertical axis of Figure B5.
Putting these effects together, Petunia responds to the higher wage by moving from choice A to choice B. This
movement involves choosing more income, both because the substitution effect of higher wages has made

                                                                                                                                                   B · Indifference Curves 871

income relatively cheaper or easier to earn, and because the income effect of higher wages has made it
possible to have more income and more leisure. Her movement from A to B also involves choosing more
leisure because, according to Petunia's preferences, the income effect that encourages choosing more leisure
is stronger than the substitution effect that encourages choosing less leisure.

Figure B5 represents only Petunia's preferences. Other people might make other choices. For example, a
person whose substitution and income effects on leisure exactly counterbalanced each other might react to a
higher wage with a choice like D, exactly above the original choice A, which means taking all of the benefit of
the higher wages in the form of income while working the same number of hours. Yet another person, whose
substitution effect on leisure outweighed the income effect, might react to a higher wage by making a choice
like F, where the response to higher wages is to work more hours and earn much more income. To represent
these different preferences, you could easily draw the indifference curve Uh to be tangent to the new budget
constraint at D or F, rather than at B.

An Intertemporal Choice Example

Quentin has saved up $10,000. He is thinking about spending some or all of it on a vacation in the present, and
then will save the rest for another big vacation five years from now. Over those five years, he expects to earn a
total 80% rate of return. Figure B6 shows Quentin's budget constraint and his indifference curves between
present consumption and future consumption. The highest level of utility that Quentin can achieve at his
original intertemporal budget constraint occurs at point A, where he is consuming $6,000, saving $4,000 for
the future, and expecting with the accumulated interest to have $7,200 for future consumption (that is, $4,000
in current financial savings plus the 80% rate of return).

However, Quentin has just realized that his expected rate of return was unrealistically high. A more realistic
expectation is that over five years he can earn a total return of 30%. In effect, his intertemporal budget
constraint has pivoted to the left, so that his original utility-maximizing choice is no longer available. Will
Quentin react to the lower rate of return by saving more, or less, or the same amount? Again, the language of
substitution and income effects provides a framework for thinking about the motivations behind various
choices. The dashed line, which is a graphical tool to separate the substitution and income effect, is carefully
inserted with the same slope as the new opportunity set, so that it reflects the changed rate of return, but it is
tangent to the original indifference curve, so that it shows no change in utility or "buying power."

The substitution effect tells how Quentin would have altered his consumption because the lower rate of return
makes future consumption relatively more expensive and present consumption relatively cheaper. The
movement from the original choice A to point C shows how Quentin substitutes toward more present
consumption and less future consumption in response to the lower interest rate, with no change in utility. The
substitution arrows on the horizontal and vertical axes of Figure B6 show the direction of the substitution
effect motivation. The substitution effect suggests that, because of the lower interest rate, Quentin should
consume more in the present and less in the future.

Quentin also has an income effect motivation. The lower rate of return shifts the budget constraint to the left,
which means that Quentin's utility or "buying power" is reduced. The income effect (assuming normal goods)
encourages less of both present and future consumption. The impact of the income effect on reducing present
and future consumption in this example is shown with "i" arrows on the horizontal and vertical axis of Figure
B6.
872 B · Indifference Curves

FIGURE B6 Indifference Curve and an Intertemporal Budget Constraint The original choice is A, at the tangency
between the original budget constraint and the original indifference curve Uh. The dashed line is drawn parallel to
the new budget set, so that its slope reflects the lower rate of return, but is tangent to the original indifference
curve. The movement from A to C is the substitution effect: in this case, future consumption has become relatively
more expensive, and present consumption has become relatively cheaper. The income effect is the shift from C to B;
that is, the reduction in utility or "buying power" that causes a move to a lower indifference curve Ul, but with the
relative price the same. It means less present and less future consumption. In the move from A to B, the
substitution effect on present consumption is greater than the income effect, so the overall result is more present
consumption. Notice that the lower indifference curve could have been drawn tangent to the lower budget
constraint point D or point F, depending on personal preferences.
Taking both effects together, the substitution effect is encouraging Quentin toward more present and less
future consumption, because present consumption is relatively cheaper, while the income effect is
encouraging him to less present and less future consumption, because the lower interest rate is pushing him
to a lower level of utility. For Quentin's personal preferences, the substitution effect is stronger so that, overall,
he reacts to the lower rate of return with more present consumption and less savings at choice B. However,
other people might have different preferences. They might react to a lower rate of return by choosing the same
level of present consumption and savings at choice D, or by choosing less present consumption and more
savings at a point like F. For these other sets of preferences, the income effect of a lower rate of return on
present consumption would be relatively stronger, while the substitution effect would be relatively weaker.

Sketching Substitution and Income Effects

Indifference curves provide an analytical tool for looking at all the choices that provide a single level of utility.
They eliminate any need for placing numerical values on utility and help to illuminate the process of making
utility-maximizing decisions. They also provide the basis for a more detailed investigation of the
complementary motivations that arise in response to a change in a price, wage or rate of return--namely, the
substitution and income effects.
If you are finding it a little tricky to sketch diagrams that show substitution and income effects so that the
points of tangency all come out correctly, it may be useful to follow this procedure.
Step 1. Begin with a budget constraint showing the choice between two goods, which this example will call
"candy" and "movies." Choose a point A which will be the optimal choice, where the indifference curve will be
tangent--but it is often easier not to draw in the indifference curve just yet. See Figure B7.

Step 2. Now the price of movies changes: let's say that it rises. That shifts the budget set inward. You know that
the higher price will push the decision-maker down to a lower level of utility, represented by a lower
indifference curve. But at this stage, draw only the new budget set. See Figure B8.

                                                                      FIGURE B8
Step 3. The key tool in distinguishing between substitution and income effects is to insert a dashed line,
parallel to the new budget line. This line is a graphical tool that allows you to distinguish between the two
changes: (1) the effect on consumption of the two goods of the shift in prices--with the level of utility remaining
unchanged--which is the substitution effect; and (2) the effect on consumption of the two goods of shifting
from one indifference curve to the other--with relative prices staying unchanged--which is the income effect.
The dashed line is inserted in this step. The trick is to have the dashed line travel close to the original choice A,
but not directly through point A. See Figure B9.

                                                                      FIGURE B9
Step 4. Now, draw the original indifference curve, so that it is tangent to both point A on the original budget
line and to a point C on the dashed line. Many students find it easiest to first select the tangency point C where
the original indifference curve touches the dashed line, and then to draw the original indifference curve
through A and C. The substitution effect is illustrated by the movement along the original indifference curve as
prices change but the level of utility holds constant, from A to C. As expected, the substitution effect leads to
less consumed of the good that is relatively more expensive, as shown by the "s" (substitution) arrow on the
vertical axis, and more consumed of the good that is relatively less expensive, as shown by the "s" arrow on the
horizontal axis. See Figure B10.

                                                                     FIGURE B10
Step 5. With the substitution effect in place, now choose utility-maximizing point B on the new opportunity set.
When you choose point B, think about whether you wish the substitution or the income effect to have a larger
impact on the good (in this case, candy) on the horizontal axis. If you choose point B to be directly in a vertical
line with point A (as is illustrated here), then the income effect will be exactly offsetting the substitution effect
on the horizontal axis. If you insert point B so that it lies a little to right of the original point A, then the

substitution effect will exceed the income effect. If you insert point B so that it lies a little to the left of point A,
then the income effect will exceed the substitution effect. The income effect is the movement from C to B,
showing how choices shifted as a result of the decline in buying power and the movement between two levels
of utility, with relative prices remaining the same. With normal goods, the negative income effect means less
consumed of each good, as shown by the direction of the "i" (income effect) arrows on the vertical and
horizontal axes. See Figure B11.

                                                                     FIGURE B11
In sketching substitution and income effect diagrams, you may wish to practice some of the following
variations: (1) Price falls instead of a rising; (2) The price change affects the good on either the vertical or the
horizontal axis; (3) Sketch these diagrams so that the substitution effect exceeds the income effect; the income
effect exceeds the substitution effect; and the two effects are equal.
One final note: The helpful dashed line can be drawn tangent to the new indifference curve, and parallel to the
original budget line, rather than tangent to the original indifference curve and parallel to the new budget line.
Some students find this approach more intuitively clear. The answers you get about the direction and relative
sizes of the substitution and income effects, however, should be the same.

Key Concepts and Summary

An indifference curve is drawn on a budget constraint diagram that shows the tradeoffs between two goods. All
points along a single indifference curve provide the same level of utility. Higher indifference curves represent
higher levels of utility. Indifference curves slope downward because, if utility is to remain the same at all points
along the curve, a reduction in the quantity of the good on the vertical axis must be counterbalanced by an
increase in the quantity of the good on the horizontal axis (or vice versa). Indifference curves are steeper on
the far left and flatter on the far right, because of diminishing marginal utility.
The utility-maximizing choice along a budget constraint will be the point of tangency where the budget
constraint touches an indifference curve at a single point. A change in the price of any good has two effects: a
substitution effect and an income effect. The substitution effect motivation encourages a utility-maximizer to
buy less of what is relatively more expensive and more of what is relatively cheaper. The income effect
motivation encourages a utility-maximizer to buy more of both goods if utility rises or less of both goods if
utility falls (if they are both normal goods).
In a labor-leisure choice, every wage change has a substitution and an income effect. The substitution effect of
a wage increase is to choose more income, since it is cheaper to earn, and less leisure, since its opportunity
876 B · Indifference Curves

cost has increased. The income effect of a wage increase is to choose more of leisure and income, since they
are both normal goods. The substitution and income effects of a wage decrease would reverse these directions.
In an intertemporal consumption choice, every interest rate change has a substitution and an income effect.
The substitution effect of an interest rate increase is to choose more future consumption, since it is now
cheaper to earn future consumption and less present consumption (more savings), since the opportunity cost
of present consumption in terms of what is being given up in the future has increased. The income effect of an
interest rate increase is to choose more of both present and future consumption, since they are both normal
goods. The substitution and income effects of an interest rate decrease would reverse these directions.

APPENDIX C

Present Discounted Value

As explained in Financial Markets, the prices of stocks and bonds depend on future events. The price of a bond
depends on the future payments that the bond is expected to make, including both payments of interest and
the repayment of the face value of the bond. The price of a stock depends on the expected future profits earned
by the firm. The concept of a present discounted value (PDV), which is defined as the amount you should be
willing to pay in the present for a stream of expected future payments, can be used to calculate appropriate
prices for stocks and bonds. To place a present discounted value on a future payment, think about what
amount of money you would need to have in the present to equal a certain amount in the future. This
calculation will require an interest rate. For example, if the interest rate is 10%, then a payment of $110 a year
from now will have a present discounted value of $100--that is, you could take $100 in the present and have
$110 in the future. We will first shows how to apply the idea of present discounted value to a stock and then we
will show how to apply it to a bond.

Applying Present Discounted Value to a Stock

Consider the case of Babble, Inc., a company that offers speaking lessons. For the sake of simplicity, say that
the founder of Babble is 63 years old and plans to retire in two years, at which point the company will be
disbanded. The company is selling 200 shares of stock and profits are expected to be $15 million right away, in
the present, $20 million one year from now, and $25 million two years from now. All profits will be paid out as
dividends to shareholders as they occur. Given this information, what will an investor pay for a share of stock
in this company?

A financial investor, thinking about what future payments are worth in the present, will need to choose an
interest rate. This interest rate will reflect the rate of return on other available financial investment
opportunities, which is the opportunity cost of investing financial capital, and also a risk premium (that is,
using a higher interest rate than the rates available elsewhere if this investment appears especially risky). In
this example, say that the financial investor decides that appropriate interest rate to value these future
payments is 15%.

Table C1 shows how to calculate the present discounted value of the future profits. For each time period, when
a benefit is going to be received, apply the formula:

Payments from Firm  Present Value

$15 million in present $15 million
$20 million in one year $20 million/(1 + 0.15)1 = $17.4 million
$25 million in two years $25 million/(1 + 0.15)2 = $18.9 million

Total               $51.3 million

TABLE C1 Calculating Present Discounted Value of a Stock

Next, add up all the present values for the different time periods to get a final answer. The present value
878 C · Present Discounted Value

calculations ask what the amount in the future is worth in the present, given the 15% interest rate. Notice that
a different PDV calculation needs to be done separately for amounts received at different times. Then, divide
the PDV of total profits by the number of shares, 200 in this case: 51.3 million/200 = 0.2565 million. The price
per share should be about $256,500 per share.

Of course, in the real world expected profits are a best guess, not a hard piece of data. Deciding which interest
rate to apply for discounting to the present can be tricky. One needs to take into account both potential capital
gains from the future sale of the stock and also dividends that might be paid. Differences of opinion on these
issues are exactly why some financial investors want to buy a stock that other people want to sell: they are
more optimistic about its future prospects. Conceptually, however, it all comes down to what you are willing to
pay in the present for a stream of benefits to be received in the future.

Applying Present Discounted Value to a Bond

A similar calculation works in the case of bonds. Financial Markets explains that if the interest rate falls after a
bond is issued, so that the investor has locked in a higher rate, then that bond will sell for more than its face
value. Conversely, if the interest rate rises after a bond is issued, then the investor is locked into a lower rate,
and the bond will sell for less than its face value. The present value calculation sharpens this intuition.

Think about a simple two-year bond. It was issued for $3,000 at an interest rate of 8%. Thus, after the first year,
the bond pays interest of 240 (which is 3,000 × 8%). At the end of the second year, the bond pays $240 in
interest, plus the $3,000 in principle. Calculate how much this bond is worth in the present if the discount rate
is 8%. Then, recalculate if interest rates rise and the applicable discount rate is 11%. To carry out these
calculations, look at the stream of payments being received from the bond in the future and figure out what
they are worth in present discounted value terms. The calculations applying the present value formula are
shown in Table C2.

TABLE C2 Computing the Present Discounted Value of a Bond

The first calculation shows that the present value of a $3,000 bond, issued at 8%, is just $3,000. After all, that is
how much money the borrower is receiving. The calculation confirms that the present value is the same for the
lender. The bond is moving money around in time, from those willing to save in the present to those who want
to borrow in the present, but the present value of what is received by the borrower is identical to the present
value of what will be repaid to the lender.

The second calculation shows what happens if the interest rate rises from 8% to 11%. The actual dollar
payments in the first column, as determined by the 8% interest rate, do not change. However, the present value
of those payments, now discounted at a higher interest rate, is lower. Even though the future dollar payments
that the bond is receiving have not changed, a person who tries to sell the bond will find that the investment's
value has fallen.

Again, real-world calculations are often more complex, in part because, not only the interest rate prevailing in

the market, but also the riskiness of whether the borrower will repay the loan, will change. In any case, the
price of a bond is always the present value of a stream of future expected payments.

Other Applications

Present discounted value is a widely used analytical tool outside the world of finance. Every time a business
thinks about making a physical capital investment, it must compare a set of present costs of making that
investment to the present discounted value of future benefits. When government thinks about a proposal to,
for example, add safety features to a highway, it must compare costs incurred in the present to benefits
received in the future. Some academic disputes over environmental policies, like how much to reduce carbon
dioxide emissions because of the risk that they will lead to a warming of global temperatures several decades
in the future, turn on how one compares present costs of pollution control with long-run future benefits.
Someone who wins the lottery and is scheduled to receive a string of payments over 30 years might be
interested in knowing what the present discounted value is of those payments. Whenever a string of costs and
benefits stretches from the present into different times in the future, present discounted value becomes an
indispensable tool of analysis.

APPENDIX D

The Expenditure-Output Model

(This appendix should be consulted after first reading The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model and
The Keynesian Perspective.) The fundamental ideas of Keynesian economics were developed before the AD/AS
model was popularized. From the 1930s until the 1970s, Keynesian economics was usually explained with a
different model, known as the expenditure-output approach. This approach is strongly rooted in the
fundamental assumptions of Keynesian economics: it focuses on the total amount of spending in the economy,
with no explicit mention of aggregate supply or of the price level (although as you will see, it is possible to draw
some inferences about aggregate supply and price levels based on the diagram).

The Axes of the Expenditure-Output Diagram

The expenditure-output model, sometimes also called the Keynesian cross diagram, determines the
equilibrium level of real GDP by the point where the total or aggregate expenditures in the economy are equal
to the amount of output produced. The axes of the Keynesian cross diagram presented in Figure D1 show real
GDP on the horizontal axis as a measure of output and aggregate expenditures on the vertical axis as a
measure of spending.

FIGURE D1 The Expenditure-Output Diagram The aggregate expenditure-output model shows aggregate
expenditures on the vertical axis and real GDP on the horizontal axis. A vertical line shows potential GDP where full
employment occurs. The 45-degree line shows all points where aggregate expenditures and output are equal. The
aggregate expenditure schedule shows how total spending or aggregate expenditure increases as output or real
GDP rises. The intersection of the aggregate expenditure schedule and the 45-degree line will be the equilibrium.
Equilibrium occurs at E0, where aggregate expenditure AE0 is equal to the output level Y0.

Remember that GDP can be thought of in several equivalent ways: it measures both the value of spending on
final goods and also the value of the production of final goods. All sales of the final goods and services that
make up GDP will eventually end up as income for workers, for managers, and for investors and owners of
firms. The sum of all the income received for contributing resources to GDP is called national income (Y). At
some points in the discussion that follows, it will be useful to refer to real GDP as "national income." Both axes
are measured in real (inflation-adjusted) terms.
882 D · The Expenditure-Output Model

The Potential GDP Line and the 45-degree Line

The Keynesian cross diagram contains two lines that serve as conceptual guideposts to orient the discussion.
The first is a vertical line showing the level of potential GDP. Potential GDP means the same thing here that it
means in the AD/AS diagrams: it refers to the quantity of output that the economy can produce with full
employment of its labor and physical capital.

The second conceptual line on the Keynesian cross diagram is the 45-degree line, which starts at the origin
and reaches up and to the right. A line that stretches up at a 45-degree angle represents the set of points (1, 1),
(2, 2), (3, 3) and so on, where the measurement on the vertical axis is equal to the measurement on the
horizontal axis. In this diagram, the 45-degree line shows the set of points where the level of aggregate
expenditure in the economy, measured on the vertical axis, is equal to the level of output or national income in
the economy, measured by GDP on the horizontal axis.

When the macroeconomy is in equilibrium, it must be true that the aggregate expenditures in the economy are
equal to the real GDP--because by definition, GDP is the measure of what is spent on final sales of goods and
services in the economy. Thus, the equilibrium calculated with a Keynesian cross diagram will always end up
where aggregate expenditure and output are equal--which will only occur along the 45-degree line.

The Aggregate Expenditure Schedule

The final ingredient of the Keynesian cross or expenditure-output diagram is the aggregate expenditure
schedule, which will show the total expenditures in the economy for each level of real GDP. The intersection of
the aggregate expenditure line with the 45-degree line--at point E0 in Figure D1--will show the equilibrium for
the economy, because it is the point where aggregate expenditure is equal to output or real GDP. After
developing an understanding of what the aggregate expenditures schedule means, we will return to this
equilibrium and how to interpret it.

Building the Aggregate Expenditure Schedule

Aggregate expenditure is the key to the expenditure-income model. The aggregate expenditure schedule
shows, either in the form of a table or a graph, how aggregate expenditures in the economy rise as real GDP or
national income rises. Thus, in thinking about the components of the aggregate expenditure
line--consumption, investment, government spending, exports and imports--the key question is how
expenditures in each category will adjust as national income rises.

Consumption as a Function of National Income

How do consumption expenditures increase as national income rises? People can do two things with their
income: consume it or save it (for the moment, let's ignore the need to pay taxes with some of it). Each person
who receives an additional dollar faces this choice. The marginal propensity to consume (MPC), is the share of
the additional dollar of income a person decides to devote to consumption expenditures. The marginal
propensity to save (MPS) is the share of the additional dollar a person decides to save. It must always hold true
that:

For example, if the marginal propensity to consume out of the marginal amount of income earned is 0.9, then
the marginal propensity to save is 0.1.

With this relationship in mind, consider the relationship among income, consumption, and savings shown in
Figure D2. (Note that we use "Aggregate Expenditure" on the vertical axis in this and the following figures,
because all consumption expenditures are parts of aggregate expenditures.)

An assumption commonly made in this model is that even if income were zero, people would have to consume
something. In this example, consumption would be $600 even if income were zero. Then, the MPC is 0.8 and
the MPS is 0.2. Thus, when income increases by $1,000, consumption rises by $800 and savings rises by $200.

At an income of $4,000, total consumption will be the $600 that would be consumed even without any income,
plus $4,000 multiplied by the marginal propensity to consume of 0.8, or $ 3,200, for a total of $ 3,800. The total
amount of consumption and saving must always add up to the total amount of income. (Exactly how a situation
of zero income and negative savings would work in practice is not important, because even low-income
societies are not literally at zero income, so the point is hypothetical.) This relationship between income and
consumption, illustrated in Figure D2 and Table D1, is called the consumption function.

FIGURE D2 The Consumption Function In the expenditure-output model, how does consumption increase with the
level of national income? Output on the horizontal axis is conceptually the same as national income, since the value
of all final output that is produced and sold must be income to someone, somewhere in the economy. At a national
income level of zero, $600 is consumed. Then, each time income rises by $1,000, consumption rises by $800,
because in this example, the marginal propensity to consume is 0.8.

The pattern of consumption shown in Table D1 is plotted in Figure D2. To calculate consumption, multiply the
income level by 0.8, for the marginal propensity to consume, and add $600, for the amount that would be
consumed even if income was zero. Consumption plus savings must be equal to income.

However, a number of factors other than income can also cause the entire consumption function to shift. These
factors were summarized in the earlier discussion of consumption, and listed in Table D1. When the
consumption function moves, it can shift in two ways: either the entire consumption function can move up or
down in a parallel manner, or the slope of the consumption function can shift so that it becomes steeper or
flatter. For example, if a tax cut leads consumers to spend more, but does not affect their marginal propensity
to consume, it would cause an upward shift to a new consumption function that is parallel to the original one.
However, a change in household preferences for saving that reduced the marginal propensity to save would
cause the slope of the consumption function to become steeper: that is, if the savings rate is lower, then every
increase in income leads to a larger rise in consumption.

Investment as a Function of National Income

Investment decisions are forward-looking, based on expected rates of return. Precisely because investment
decisions depend primarily on perceptions about future economic conditions, they do not depend primarily on
the level of GDP in the current year. Thus, on a Keynesian cross diagram, the investment function can be drawn
as a horizontal line, at a fixed level of expenditure. Figure D3 shows an investment function where the level of
investment is, for the sake of concreteness, set at the specific level of 500. Just as a consumption function
shows the relationship between consumption levels and real GDP (or national income), the investment
function shows the relationship between investment levels and real GDP.

FIGURE D3 The Investment Function The investment function is drawn as a flat line because investment is based
on interest rates and expectations about the future, and so it does not change with the level of current national
income. In this example, investment expenditures are at a level of 500. However, changes in factors like
technological opportunities, expectations about near-term economic growth, and interest rates would all cause the
investment function to shift up or down.
The appearance of the investment function as a horizontal line does not mean that the level of investment
never moves. It means only that in the context of this two-dimensional diagram, the level of investment on the
vertical aggregate expenditure axis does not vary according to the current level of real GDP on the horizontal

axis. However, all the other factors that vary investment--new technological opportunities, expectations about
near-term economic growth, interest rates, the price of key inputs, and tax incentives for investment--can
cause the horizontal investment function to shift up or down.
Government Spending and Taxes as a Function of National Income
In the Keynesian cross diagram, government spending appears as a horizontal line, as in Figure D4, where
government spending is set at a level of 1,300. As in the case of investment spending, this horizontal line does
not mean that government spending is unchanging. It means only that government spending changes when
Congress decides on a change in the budget, rather than shifting in a predictable way with the current size of
the real GDP shown on the horizontal axis.

FIGURE D4 The Government Spending Function The level of government spending is determined by political
factors, not by the level of real GDP in a given year. Thus, government spending is drawn as a horizontal line. In this
example, government spending is at a level of 1,300. Congressional decisions to increase government spending will
cause this horizontal line to shift up, while decisions to reduce spending would cause it to shift down.
The situation of taxes is different because taxes often rise or fall with the volume of economic activity. For
example, income taxes are based on the level of income earned and sales taxes are based on the amount of
sales made, and both income and sales tend to be higher when the economy is growing and lower when the
economy is in a recession. For the purposes of constructing the basic Keynesian cross diagram, it is helpful to
view taxes as a proportionate share of GDP. In the United States, for example, taking federal, state, and local
taxes together, government typically collects about 30-35 % of income as taxes.
Table D2 revises the earlier table on the consumption function so that it takes taxes into account. The first
column shows national income. The second column calculates taxes, which in this example are set at a rate of
30%, or 0.3. The third column shows after-tax income; that is, total income minus taxes. The fourth column
then calculates consumption in the same manner as before: multiply after-tax income by 0.8, representing the
marginal propensity to consume, and then add $600, for the amount that would be consumed even if income
was zero. When taxes are included, the marginal propensity to consume is reduced by the amount of the tax
rate, so each additional dollar of income results in a smaller increase in consumption than before taxes. For
this reason, the consumption function, with taxes included, is flatter than the consumption function without
taxes, as Figure D5 shows.
886 D · The Expenditure-Output Model

FIGURE D5 The Consumption Function Before and After Taxes The upper line repeats the consumption function
from Figure D2. The lower line shows the consumption function if taxes must first be paid on income, and then
consumption is based on after-tax income.

TABLE D2 The Consumption Function Before and After Taxes

Exports and Imports as a Function of National Income

The export function, which shows how exports change with the level of a country's own real GDP, is drawn as a
horizontal line, as in the example in Figure D6 (a) where exports are drawn at a level of $840. Again, as in the
case of investment spending and government spending, drawing the export function as horizontal does not
imply that exports never change. It just means that they do not change because of what is on the horizontal
axis--that is, a country's own level of domestic production--and instead are shaped by the level of aggregate
demand in other countries. More demand for exports from other countries would cause the export function to
shift up; less demand for exports from other countries would cause it to shift down.

FIGURE D6 The Export and Import Functions (a) The export function is drawn as a horizontal line because exports
are determined by the buying power of other countries and thus do not change with the size of the domestic
economy. In this example, exports are set at 840. However, exports can shift up or down, depending on buying
patterns in other countries. (b) The import function is drawn in negative territory because expenditures on imported
products are a subtraction from expenditures in the domestic economy. In this example, the marginal propensity to
import is 0.1, so imports are calculated by multiplying the level of income by -0.1.
Imports are drawn in the Keynesian cross diagram as a downward-sloping line, with the downward slope
determined by the marginal propensity to import (MPI), out of national income. In Figure D6 (b), the marginal
propensity to import is 0.1. Thus, if real GDP is $5,000, imports are $500; if national income is $6,000, imports
are $600, and so on. The import function is drawn as downward sloping and negative, because it represents a
subtraction from the aggregate expenditures in the domestic economy. A change in the marginal propensity to
import, perhaps as a result of changes in preferences, would alter the slope of the import function.

                                                                                                          WORK IT OUT
 Using an Algebraic Approach to the Expenditure-Output Model

  In the expenditure-output or Keynesian cross model, the equilibrium occurs where the aggregate expenditure
  line (AE line) crosses the 45-degree line. Given algebraic equations for two lines, the point where they cross can
  be readily calculated. Imagine an economy with the following characteristics.
  Y = Real GDP or national income
  T = Taxes = 0.3Y
  C = Consumption = 140 + 0.9(Y - T)
  I = Investment = 400
  G = Government spending = 800
  X = Exports = 600
  M = Imports = 0.15Y
  Step 1. Determine the aggregate expenditure function. In this case, it is:
888 D · The Expenditure-Output Model

  Step 2. The equation for the 45-degree line is the set of points where GDP or national income on the horizontal
  axis is equal to aggregate expenditure on the vertical axis. Thus, the equation for the 45-degree line is: AE = Y.
  Step 3. The next step is to solve these two equations for Y (or AE, since they will be equal to each other).
  Substitute Y for AE:
  Step 4. Insert the term 0.3Y for the tax rate T. This produces an equation with only one variable, Y.
  Step 5. Work through the algebra and solve for Y.

  This algebraic framework is flexible and useful in predicting how economic events and policy actions will affect
  real GDP.
  Step 6. Say, for example, that because of changes in the relative prices of domestic and foreign goods, the
  marginal propensity to import falls to 0.1. Calculate the equilibrium output when the marginal propensity to
  import is changed to 0.1.

  Step 7. Because of a surge of business confidence, investment rises to 500. Calculate the equilibrium output.

  For issues of policy, the key questions would be how to adjust government spending levels or tax rates so that
  the equilibrium level of output is the full employment level. In this case, let the economic parameters be:
  Y = National income
  T = Taxes = 0.3Y
  C = Consumption = 200 + 0.9(Y - T)
  I = Investment = 600
  G = Government spending = 1,000
  X = Exports = 600
  Y = Imports = 0.1(Y - T)

                                                                       D · The Expenditure-Output Model 889

Step 8. Calculate the equilibrium for this economy (remember Y = AE).

Step 9. Assume that the full employment level of output is 6,000. What level of government spending would be
necessary to reach that level? To answer this question, plug in 6,000 as equal to Y, but leave G as a variable, and
solve for G. Thus:

Step 10. Solve this problem arithmetically. The answer is: G = 1,240. In other words, increasing government
spending by 240, from its original level of 1,000, to 1,240, would raise output to the full employment level of
GDP.

Indeed, the question of how much to increase government spending so that equilibrium output will rise from
5,454 to 6,000 can be answered without working through the algebra, just by using the multiplier formula. The
multiplier equation in this case is:

  Thus, to raise output by 546 would require an increase in government spending of 546/2.27=240, which is the
  same as the answer derived from the algebraic calculation.

  This algebraic framework is highly flexible. For example, taxes can be treated as a total set by political
  considerations (like government spending) and not dependent on national income. Imports might be based on
  before-tax income, not after-tax income. For certain purposes, it may be helpful to analyze the economy without
  exports and imports. A more complicated approach could divide up consumption, investment, government,
  exports and imports into smaller categories, or to build in some variability in the rates of taxes, savings, and
  imports. A wise economist will shape the model to fit the specific question under investigation.

Building the Combined Aggregate Expenditure Function

All the components of aggregate demand--consumption, investment, government spending, and the trade
balance--are now in place to build the Keynesian cross diagram. Figure D7 builds up an aggregate expenditure
function, based on the numerical illustrations of C, I, G, X, and M that have been used throughout this text. The
first three columns in Table D3 are lifted from the earlier Table D2, which showed how to bring taxes into the
consumption function. The first column is real GDP or national income, which is what appears on the
horizontal axis of the income-expenditure diagram. The second column calculates after-tax income, based on
the assumption, in this case, that 30% of real GDP is collected in taxes. The third column is based on an MPC of
0.8, so that as after-tax income rises by $700 from one row to the next, consumption rises by $560 (700 × 0.8)
from one row to the next. Investment, government spending, and exports do not change with the level of
current national income. In the previous discussion, investment was $500, government spending was $1,300,
and exports were $840, for a total of $2,640. This total is shown in the fourth column. Imports are 0.1 of real
GDP in this example, and the level of imports is calculated in the fifth column. The final column, aggregate
expenditures, sums up C + I + G + X - M. This aggregate expenditure line is illustrated in Figure D7.

FIGURE D7 A Keynesian Cross Diagram Each combination of national income and aggregate expenditure (after-tax

aggregate expenditure is equal to national income; this occurs where the aggregate expenditure schedule crosses

TABLE D3 National Income-Aggregate Expenditure Equilibrium

The aggregate expenditure function is formed by stacking on top of each other the consumption function (after
taxes), the investment function, the government spending function, the export function, and the import
function. The point at which the aggregate expenditure function intersects the vertical axis will be determined
by the levels of investment, government, and export expenditures--which do not vary with national income.
The upward slope of the aggregate expenditure function will be determined by the marginal propensity to
save, the tax rate, and the marginal propensity to import. A higher marginal propensity to save, a higher tax
rate, and a higher marginal propensity to import will all make the slope of the aggregate expenditure function
flatter--because out of any extra income, more is going to savings or taxes or imports and less to spending on
domestic goods and services.

The equilibrium occurs where national income is equal to aggregate expenditure, which is shown on the graph
as the point where the aggregate expenditure schedule crosses the 45-degree line. In this example, the
equilibrium occurs at 6,000. This equilibrium can also be read off the table under the figure; it is the level of
national income where aggregate expenditure is equal to national income.

Equilibrium in the Keynesian Cross Model

With the aggregate expenditure line in place, the next step is to relate it to the two other elements of the
Keynesian cross diagram. Thus, the first subsection interprets the intersection of the aggregate expenditure
function and the 45-degree line, while the next subsection relates this point of intersection to the potential
GDP line.
Where Equilibrium Occurs
The point where the aggregate expenditure line that is constructed from C + I + G + X - M crosses the
45-degree line will be the equilibrium for the economy. It is the only point on the aggregate expenditure line
where the total amount being spent on aggregate demand equals the total level of production. In Figure D7,
this point of equilibrium (E0) happens at 6,000, which can also be read off Table D3.
The meaning of "equilibrium" remains the same; that is, equilibrium is a point of balance where no incentive
exists to shift away from that outcome. To understand why the point of intersection between the aggregate
expenditure function and the 45-degree line is a macroeconomic equilibrium, consider what would happen if
an economy found itself to the right of the equilibrium point E, say point H in Figure D8, where output is higher
than the equilibrium. At point H, the level of aggregate expenditure is below the 45-degree line, so that the
level of aggregate expenditure in the economy is less than the level of output. As a result, at point H, output is
piling up unsold--not a sustainable state of affairs.

FIGURE D8 Equilibrium in the Keynesian Cross Diagram If output was above the equilibrium level, at H, then the
real output is greater than the aggregate expenditure in the economy. This pattern cannot hold, because it would
mean that goods are produced but piling up unsold. If output was below the equilibrium level at L, then aggregate
expenditure would be greater than output. This pattern cannot hold either, because it would mean that spending
exceeds the number of goods being produced. Only point E can be at equilibrium, where output, or national income
and aggregate expenditure, are equal. The equilibrium (E) must lie on the 45-degree line, which is the set of points
where national income and aggregate expenditure are equal.
Conversely, consider the situation where the level of output is at point L--where real output is lower than the
equilibrium. In that case, the level of aggregate demand in the economy is above the 45-degree line, indicating
that the level of aggregate expenditure in the economy is greater than the level of output. When the level of
aggregate demand has emptied the store shelves, it cannot be sustained, either. Firms will respond by
892 D · The Expenditure-Output Model

increasing their level of production. Thus, the equilibrium must be the point where the amount produced and
the amount spent are in balance, at the intersection of the aggregate expenditure function and the 45-degree
line.

                                                                                                          WORK IT OUT

 Finding Equilibrium

  Table D4 gives some information on an economy. The Keynesian model assumes that there is some level of
  consumption even without income. That amount is $236 - $216 = $20. $20 will be consumed when national
  income equals zero. Assume that taxes are 0.2 of real GDP. Let the marginal propensity to save of after-tax
  income be 0.1. The level of investment is $70, the level of government spending is $80, and the level of exports
  is $50. Imports are 0.2 of after-tax income. Given these values, you need to complete Table D4 and then answer
  these questions:

    · What is the consumption function?
    · What is the equilibrium?
    · Why is a national income of $300 not at equilibrium?
    · How do expenditures and output compare at this point?

       National  Taxes           After-tax  Consumption  I + G +  Imports    Aggregate

Step 1. Calculate the amount of taxes for each level of national income(reminder: GDP = national income) for
each level of national income using the following as an example:

Step 2. Calculate after-tax income by subtracting the tax amount from national income for each level of national
income using the following as an example:

Step 3. Calculate consumption. The marginal propensity to save is given as 0.1. This means that the marginal
propensity to consume is 0.9, since MPS + MPC = 1. Therefore, multiply 0.9 by the after-tax income amount using
the following as an example:

Access for free at openstax.org
                                                               D · The Expenditure-Output Model 893

Step 4. Consider why the table shows consumption of $236 in the first row. As mentioned earlier, the Keynesian
model assumes that there is some level of consumption even without income. That amount is $236 - $216 =
$20.
Step 5. There is now enough information to write the consumption function. The consumption function is found
by figuring out the level of consumption that will happen when income is zero. Remember that:

Let C represent the consumption function, Y represent national income, and T represent taxes.

Step 6. Use the consumption function to find consumption at each level of national income.
Step 7. Add investment (I), government spending (G), and exports (X). Remember that these do not change as
national income changes:
Step 8. Find imports, which are 0.2 of after-tax income at each level of national income. For example:

Step 9. Find aggregate expenditure by adding C + I + G + X - I for each level of national income. Your completed
table should look like Table D5.

TABLE D5

Step 10. Answer the question: What is equilibrium? Equilibrium occurs where AE = Y. Table D5 shows that
equilibrium occurs where national income equals aggregate expenditure at $500.

Step 11. Find equilibrium mathematically, knowing that national income is equal to aggregate expenditure.
894 D · The Expenditure-Output Model

  Since T is 0.2 of national income, substitute T with 0.2 Y so that:

  Solve for Y.

  Step 12. Answer this question: Why is a national income of $300 not an equilibrium? At national income of $300,
  aggregate expenditures are $388.
  Step 13. Answer this question: How do expenditures and output compare at this point? Aggregate expenditures
  cannot exceed output (GDP) in the long run, since there would not be enough goods to be bought.
Recessionary and Inflationary Gaps
In the Keynesian cross diagram, if the aggregate expenditure line intersects the 45-degree line at the level of
potential GDP, then the economy is in sound shape. There is no recession, and unemployment is low. But there
is no guarantee that the equilibrium will occur at the potential GDP level of output. The equilibrium might be
higher or lower.
For example, Figure D9 (a) illustrates a situation where the aggregate expenditure line intersects the 45-degree
line at point E0, which is a real GDP of $6,000, and which is below the potential GDP of $7,000. In this situation,
the level of aggregate expenditure is too low for GDP to reach its full employment level, and unemployment will
occur. The distance between an output level like E0 that is below potential GDP and the level of potential GDP is
called a recessionary gap. Because the equilibrium level of real GDP is so low, firms will not wish to hire the full
employment number of workers, and unemployment will be high.

FIGURE D9 Addressing Recessionary and Inflationary Gaps (a) If the equilibrium occurs at an output below
potential GDP, then a recessionary gap exists. The policy solution to a recessionary gap is to shift the aggregate
expenditure schedule up from AE0 to AE1, using policies like tax cuts or government spending increases. Then the
new equilibrium E1 occurs at potential GDP. (b) If the equilibrium occurs at an output above potential GDP, then an
inflationary gap exists. The policy solution to an inflationary gap is to shift the aggregate expenditure schedule down
from AE0 to AE1, using policies like tax increases or spending cuts. Then, the new equilibrium E1 occurs at potential
GDP.
What might cause a recessionary gap? Anything that shifts the aggregate expenditure line down is a potential
cause of recession, including a decline in consumption, a rise in savings, a fall in investment, a drop in
government spending or a rise in taxes, or a fall in exports or a rise in imports. Moreover, an economy that is at
equilibrium with a recessionary gap may just stay there and suffer high unemployment for a long time;
remember, the meaning of equilibrium is that there is no particular adjustment of prices or quantities in the
economy to chase the recession away.
The appropriate response to a recessionary gap is for the government to reduce taxes or increase spending so
that the aggregate expenditure function shifts up from AE0 to AE1. When this shift occurs, the new equilibrium
E1 now occurs at potential GDP as shown in Figure D9 (a).
Conversely, Figure D9 (b) shows a situation where the aggregate expenditure schedule (AE0) intersects the
45-degree line above potential GDP. The gap between the level of real GDP at the equilibrium E0 and potential
GDP is called an inflationary gap. The inflationary gap also requires a bit of interpreting. After all, a naïve
reading of the Keynesian cross diagram might suggest that if the aggregate expenditure function is just pushed
up high enough, real GDP can be as large as desired--even doubling or tripling the potential GDP level of the
economy. This implication is clearly wrong. An economy faces some supply-side limits on how much it can
produce at a given time with its existing quantities of workers, physical and human capital, technology, and
market institutions.
The inflationary gap should be interpreted, not as a literal prediction of how large real GDP will be, but as a
statement of how much extra aggregate expenditure is in the economy beyond what is needed to reach
potential GDP. An inflationary gap suggests that because the economy cannot produce enough goods and
services to absorb this level of aggregate expenditures, the spending will instead cause an inflationary increase
in the price level. In this way, even though changes in the price level do not appear explicitly in the Keynesian
cross equation, the notion of inflation is implicit in the concept of the inflationary gap.
The appropriate Keynesian response to an inflationary gap is shown in Figure D9 (b). The original intersection
896 D · The Expenditure-Output Model

of aggregate expenditure line AE0 and the 45-degree line occurs at $8,000, which is above the level of potential
GDP at $7,000. If AE0 shifts down to AE1, so that the new equilibrium is at E1, then the economy will be at
potential GDP without pressures for inflationary price increases. The government can achieve a downward
shift in aggregate expenditure by increasing taxes on consumers or firms, or by reducing government
expenditures.

The Multiplier Effect

The Keynesian policy prescription has one final twist. Assume that for a certain economy, the intersection of
the aggregate expenditure function and the 45-degree line is at a GDP of 700, while the level of potential GDP
for this economy is $800. By how much does government spending need to be increased so that the economy
reaches the full employment GDP? The obvious answer might seem to be $800 - $700 = $100; so raise
government spending by $100. But that answer is incorrect. A change of, for example, $100 in government
expenditures will have an effect of more than $100 on the equilibrium level of real GDP. The reason is that a
change in aggregate expenditures circles through the economy: households buy from firms, firms pay workers
and suppliers, workers and suppliers buy goods from other firms, those firms pay their workers and suppliers,
and so on. In this way, the original change in aggregate expenditures is actually spent more than once. This is
called the multiplier effect: An initial increase in spending, cycles repeatedly through the economy and has a
larger impact than the initial dollar amount spent.
How Does the Multiplier Work?
To understand how the multiplier effect works, return to the example in which the current equilibrium in the
Keynesian cross diagram is a real GDP of $700, or $100 short of the $800 needed to be at full employment,
potential GDP. If the government spends $100 to close this gap, someone in the economy receives that
spending and can treat it as income. Assume that those who receive this income pay 30% in taxes, save 10% of
after-tax income, spend 10% of total income on imports, and then spend the rest on domestically produced
goods and services.
As shown in the calculations in Figure D10 and Table D6, out of the original $100 in government spending, $53
is left to spend on domestically produced goods and services. That $53 which was spent, becomes income to
someone, somewhere in the economy. Those who receive that income also pay 30% in taxes, save 10% of after-
tax income, and spend 10% of total income on imports, as shown in Figure D10, so that an additional $28.09
(that is, 0.53 × $53) is spent in the third round. The people who receive that income then pay taxes, save, and
buy imports, and the amount spent in the fourth round is $14.89 (that is, 0.53 × $28.09).

FIGURE D10 The Multiplier Effect An original increase of government spending of $100 causes a rise in aggregate
expenditure of $100. But that $100 is income to others in the economy, and after they save, pay taxes, and buy
imports, they spend $53 of that $100 in a second round. In turn, that $53 is income to others. Thus, the original
government spending of $100 is multiplied by these cycles of spending, but the impact of each successive cycle

gets smaller and smaller. Given the numbers in this example, the original government spending increase of $100
raises aggregate expenditure by $213; therefore, the multiplier in this example is $213/$100 = 2.13.

Original increase in aggregate expenditure from government spending                        100

Which is $28.09 of income to people through the economy: Pay 30% in taxes. Save 10% of     19.663 - 1.96633
after-tax income. Spend 10% of income on imports. Fourth-round increase of...              - 2.809 = 14.89

TABLE D6 Calculating the Multiplier Effect

Thus, over the first four rounds of aggregate expenditures, the impact of the original increase in government
spending of $100 creates a rise in aggregate expenditures of $100 + $53 + $28.09 + $14.89 = $195.98. Figure
D10 shows these total aggregate expenditures after these first four rounds, and then the figure shows the total
aggregate expenditures after 30 rounds. The additional boost to aggregate expenditures is shrinking in each
round of consumption. After about 10 rounds, the additional increments are very small indeed--nearly
invisible to the naked eye. After 30 rounds, the additional increments in each round are so small that they have
no practical consequence. After 30 rounds, the cumulative value of the initial boost in aggregate expenditure is
approximately $213. Thus, the government spending increase of $100 eventually, after many cycles, produced
an increase of $213 in aggregate expenditure and real GDP. In this example, the multiplier is $213/$100 = 2.13.

Calculating the Multiplier

Fortunately for everyone who is not carrying around a computer with a spreadsheet program to project the
impact of an original increase in expenditures over 20, 50, or 100 rounds of spending, there is a formula for
calculating the multiplier.

The data from Figure D10 and Table D6 is:

  · Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS) = 30%
  · Tax rate = 10%
  · Marginal Propensity to Import (MPI) = 10%

The MPC is equal to 1 - MPS, or 0.7. Therefore, the spending multiplier is:

A change in spending of $100 multiplied by the spending multiplier of 2.13 is equal to a change in GDP of
$213. Not coincidentally, this result is exactly what was calculated in Figure D10 after many rounds of
expenditures cycling through the economy.

The size of the multiplier is determined by what proportion of the marginal dollar of income goes into taxes,
saving, and imports. These three factors are known as "leakages," because they determine how much demand
"leaks out" in each round of the multiplier effect. If the leakages are relatively small, then each successive
round of the multiplier effect will have larger amounts of demand, and the multiplier will be high. Conversely,
898 D · The Expenditure-Output Model

if the leakages are relatively large, then any initial change in demand will diminish more quickly in the second,
third, and later rounds, and the multiplier will be small. Changes in the size of the leakages--a change in the
marginal propensity to save, the tax rate, or the marginal propensity to import--will change the size of the
multiplier.
Calculating Keynesian Policy Interventions
Returning to the original question: How much should government spending be increased to produce a total
increase in real GDP of $100? If the goal is to increase aggregate demand by $100, and the multiplier is 2.13,
then the increase in government spending to achieve that goal would be $100/2.13 = $47. Government
spending of approximately $47, when combined with a multiplier of 2.13 (which is, remember, based on the
specific assumptions about tax, saving, and import rates), produces an overall increase in real GDP of $100,
restoring the economy to potential GDP of $800, as Figure D11 shows.

FIGURE D11 The Multiplier Effect in an Expenditure-Output Model The power of the multiplier effect is that an
increase in expenditure has a larger increase on the equilibrium output. The increase in expenditure is the vertical
increase from AE0 to AE1. However, the increase in equilibrium output, shown on the horizontal axis, is clearly larger.
The multiplier effect is also visible on the Keynesian cross diagram. Figure D11 shows the example we have
been discussing: a recessionary gap with an equilibrium of $700, potential GDP of $800, the slope of the
aggregate expenditure function (AE0) determined by the assumptions that taxes are 30% of income, savings
are 0.1 of after-tax income, and imports are 0.1 of before-tax income. At AE1, the aggregate expenditure
function is moved up to reach potential GDP.
Now, compare the vertical shift upward in the aggregate expenditure function, which is $47, with the
horizontal shift outward in real GDP, which is $100 (as these numbers were calculated earlier). The rise in real
GDP is more than double the rise in the aggregate expenditure function. (Similarly, if you look back at Figure
D9, you will see that the vertical movements in the aggregate expenditure functions are smaller than the
change in equilibrium output that is produced on the horizontal axis. Again, this is the multiplier effect at
work.) In this way, the power of the multiplier is apparent in the income-expenditure graph, as well as in the
arithmetic calculation.
The multiplier does not just affect government spending, but applies to any change in the economy. Say that
business confidence declines and investment falls off, or that the economy of a leading trading partner slows
down so that export sales decline. These changes will reduce aggregate expenditures, and then will have an
even larger effect on real GDP because of the multiplier effect. Read the following Clear It Up feature to learn
how the multiplier effect can be applied to analyze the economic impact of professional sports.

         CLEAR IT UP

How can the multiplier be used to analyze the economic impact of professional sports?

Attracting professional sports teams and building sports stadiums to create jobs and stimulate business growth is
an economic development strategy adopted by many communities throughout the United States. In his recent
article, "Public Financing of Private Sports Stadiums," James Joyner of Outside the Beltway looked at public
financing for NFL teams. Joyner's findings confirm the earlier work of John Siegfried of Vanderbilt University and
Andrew Zimbalist of Smith College.

Siegfried and Zimbalist used the multiplier to analyze this issue. They considered the amount of taxes paid and
dollars spent locally to see if there was a positive multiplier effect. Since most professional athletes and owners of
sports teams are rich enough to owe a lot of taxes, let's say that 40% of any marginal income they earn is paid in
taxes. Because athletes are often high earners with short careers, let's assume that they save one-third of their
after-tax income.

However, many professional athletes do not live year-round in the city in which they play, so let's say that one-half
of the money that they do spend is spent outside the local area. One can think of spending outside a local economy,
in this example, as the equivalent of imported goods for the national economy.

Now, consider the impact of money spent at local entertainment venues other than professional sports. While the
owners of these other businesses may be comfortably middle-income, few of them are in the economic
stratosphere of professional athletes. Because their incomes are lower, so are their taxes; say that they pay only
35% of their marginal income in taxes. They do not have the same ability, or need, to save as much as professional
athletes, so let's assume their MPC is just 0.8. Finally, because more of them live locally, they will spend a higher
proportion of their income on local goods--say, 65%.

If these general assumptions hold true, then money spent on professional sports will have less local economic
impact than money spent on other forms of entertainment. For professional athletes, out of a dollar earned, 40
cents goes to taxes, leaving 60 cents. Of that 60 cents, one-third is saved, leaving 40 cents, and half is spent outside
the area, leaving 20 cents. Only 20 cents of each dollar is cycled into the local economy in the first round. For
locally-owned entertainment, out of a dollar earned, 35 cents goes to taxes, leaving 65 cents. Of the rest, 20% is
saved, leaving 52 cents, and of that amount, 65% is spent in the local area, so that 33.8 cents of each dollar of
income is recycled into the local economy.

Siegfried and Zimbalist make the plausible argument that, within their household budgets, people have a fixed
amount to spend on entertainment. If this assumption holds true, then money spent attending professional sports
events is money that was not spent on other entertainment options in a given metropolitan area. Since the multiplier
is lower for professional sports than for other local entertainment options, the arrival of professional sports to a city
would reallocate entertainment spending in a way that causes the local economy to shrink, rather than to grow.
Thus, their findings seem to confirm what Joyner reports and what newspapers across the country are reporting. A
quick Internet search for "economic impact of sports" will yield numerous reports questioning this economic
development strategy.

Multiplier Tradeoffs: Stability versus the Power of Macroeconomic Policy

Is an economy healthier with a high multiplier or a low one? With a high multiplier, any change in aggregate
demand will tend to be substantially magnified, and so the economy will be more unstable. With a low
multiplier, by contrast, changes in aggregate demand will not be multiplied much, so the economy will tend to
be more stable.

However, with a low multiplier, government policy changes in taxes or spending will tend to have less impact
on the equilibrium level of real output. With a higher multiplier, government policies to raise or reduce
900 D · The Expenditure-Output Model

aggregate expenditures will have a larger effect. Thus, a low multiplier means a more stable economy, but also
weaker government macroeconomic policy, while a high multiplier means a more volatile economy, but also
an economy in which government macroeconomic policy is more powerful.

Key Concepts and Summary

The expenditure-output model or Keynesian cross diagram shows how the level of aggregate expenditure (on
the vertical axis) varies with the level of economic output (shown on the horizontal axis). Since the value of all
macroeconomic output also represents income to someone somewhere else in the economy, the horizontal
axis can also be interpreted as national income. The equilibrium in the diagram will occur where the aggregate
expenditure line crosses the 45-degree line, which represents the set of points where aggregate expenditure in
the economy is equal to output (or national income). Equilibrium in a Keynesian cross diagram can happen at
potential GDP, or below or above that level.
The consumption function shows the upward-sloping relationship between national income and consumption.
The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is the amount consumed out of an additional dollar of income. A
higher marginal propensity to consume means a steeper consumption function; a lower marginal propensity
to consume means a flatter consumption function. The marginal propensity to save (MPS) is the amount saved
out of an additional dollar of income. It is necessarily true that MPC + MPS = 1. The investment function is
drawn as a flat line, showing that investment in the current year does not change with regard to the current
level of national income. However, the investment function will move up and down based on the expected rate
of return in the future. Government spending is drawn as a horizontal line in the Keynesian cross diagram,
because its level is determined by political considerations, not by the current level of income in the economy.
Taxes in the basic Keynesian cross diagram are taken into account by adjusting the consumption function. The
export function is drawn as a horizontal line in the Keynesian cross diagram, because exports do not change as
a result of changes in domestic income, but they move as a result of changes in foreign income, as well as
changes in exchange rates. The import function is drawn as a downward-sloping line, because imports rise
with national income, but imports are a subtraction from aggregate demand. Thus, a higher level of imports
means a lower level of expenditure on domestic goods.
In a Keynesian cross diagram, the equilibrium may be at a level below potential GDP, which is called a
recessionary gap, or at a level above potential GDP, which is called an inflationary gap.
The multiplier effect describes how an initial change in aggregate demand generated several times as much as
cumulative GDP. The size of the spending multiplier is determined by three leakages: spending on savings,
taxes, and imports. The formula for the multiplier is:

An economy with a lower multiplier is more stable--it is less affected either by economic events or by
government policy than an economy with a higher multiplier.

902 D · The Expenditure-Output Model

Find the equilibrium for this economy. If potential GDP is 3,500, then what change in government spending is
needed to achieve this level? Do this problem two ways. First, plug 3,500 into the equations and solve for G.
Second, calculate the multiplier and figure it out that way.
First, set up the calculation.

Then insert Y for AE and 0.25Y for T.

If full employment is 3,500, then one approach is to plug in 3,500 for Y throughout the equation, but to leave G
as a separate variable.

A G value of 331.25 is an increase of 131.25 from its original level of 200.

Alternatively, the multiplier is that, out of every dollar spent, 0.25 goes to taxes, leaving 0.75, and out of after-
tax income, 0.15 goes to savings and 0.1 to imports. Because (0.75)(0.15) = 0.1125 and (0.75)(0.1) = 0.075, this
means that out of every dollar spent: 1 -0.25 -0.1125 -0.075 = 0.5625.

Thus, using the formula, the multiplier is:

To increase equilibrium GDP by 300, it will take a boost of 300/2.2837, which again works out to 131.25.

Exercise D4
Table D7 represents the data behind a Keynesian cross diagram. Assume that the tax rate is 0.4 of national

The alternative way of determining equilibrium is to solve for Y, where Y = national income, using: Y = AE = C +
I + G + X - M

Solving for Y, we see that the equilibrium level of output is Y = $10,000.

Exercise D5
Explain how the multiplier works. Use an MPC of 80% in an example.

The multiplier refers to how many times a dollar will turnover in the economy. It is based on the Marginal
Propensity to Consume (MPC) which tells how much of every dollar received will be spent. If the MPC is 80%
then this means that out of every one dollar received by a consumer, $0.80 will be spent. This $0.80 is received
by another person. In turn, 80% of the $0.80 received, or $0.64, will be spent, and so on. The impact of the
multiplier is diluted when the effect of taxes and expenditure on imports is considered. To derive the
multiplier, take the 1/1 - F; where F is equal to percent of savings, taxes, and expenditures on imports.

How Open Market Operations Affect Balance Sheets in a Limited

As we noted in our discussion of open market operations, in a limited reserves environment the FOMC can
affect banks' balance sheets and the money supply. The following figures shows this process in detail.

Figure E1 (a) shows that Happy Bank starts with $460 million in assets, divided among reserves, bonds and
loans, and $400 million in liabilities in the form of deposits, with a net worth of $60 million. When the central
bank purchases $20 million in bonds from Happy Bank, the bond holdings of Happy Bank fall by $20 million
and the bank's reserves rise by $20 million, as Figure E1 (b) shows. However, Happy Bank only wants to hold
$40 million in reserves (the quantity of reserves with which it started in Figure 15.5) (a), so the bank decides to
loan out the extra $20 million in reserves and its loans rise by $20 million, as Figure E1 (c) shows.

ANSWER KEY

Chapter 1

 1. Scarcity means human wants for goods and services exceed the available supply. Supply is limited
     because resources are limited. Demand, however, is virtually unlimited. Whatever the supply, it seems
     human nature to want more.

 2. 100 people / 10 people per ham = a maximum of 10 hams per month if all residents produce ham. Since
     consumption is limited by production, the maximum number of hams residents could consume per
     month is 10.

 3. She is very productive at her consulting job, but not very productive growing vegetables. Time spent
     consulting would produce far more income than it what she could save growing her vegetables using the
     same amount of time. So on purely economic grounds, it makes more sense for her to maximize her
     income by applying her labor to what she does best (i.e. specialization of labor).

 4. The engineer is better at computer science than at painting. Thus, his time is better spent working for pay
     at his job and paying a painter to paint his house. Of course, this assumes he does not paint his house for
     fun!

 5. There are many physical systems that would work, for example, the study of planets (micro) in the solar
     system (macro), or solar systems (micro) in the galaxy (macro).

 6. Draw a box outside the original circular flow to represent the foreign country. Draw an arrow from the
     foreign country to firms, to represents imports. Draw an arrow in the reverse direction representing
     payments for imports. Draw an arrow from firms to the foreign country to represent exports. Draw an
     arrow in the reverse direction to represent payments for imports.

 7. There are many such problems. Consider the AIDS epidemic. Why are so few AIDS patients in Africa and
     Southeast Asia treated with the same drugs that are effective in the United States and Europe? It is
     because neither those patients nor the countries in which they live have the resources to purchase the
     same drugs.

 8. Public enterprise means the factors of production (resources and businesses) are owned and operated by
     the government.

 9. The United States is a large country economically speaking, so it has less need to trade internationally
     than the other countries mentioned. (This is the same reason that France and Italy have lower ratios than
     Belgium or Sweden.) One additional reason is that each of the other countries is a member of the European
     Union, where trade between members occurs without barriers to trade, like tariffs and quotas.

Chapter 2

 1. The opportunity cost of bus tickets is the number of burgers that must be given up to obtain one more bus
     ticket. Originally, when the price of bus tickets was 50 cents per trip, this opportunity cost was 0.50/2 = .25
     burgers. The reason for this is that at the original prices, one burger ($2) costs the same as four bus tickets
     ($0.50), so the opportunity cost of a burger is four bus tickets, and the opportunity cost of a bus ticket is .25
     burgers (the inverse of the opportunity cost of a burger). With the new, higher price of bus tickets, the
     opportunity cost rises to $1/$2 or 0.50 burgers. You can see this graphically since the slope of the new
     budget constraint is steeper than the original one. If Alphonso spends all of his budget on burgers, the
     higher price of bus tickets has no impact so the vertical intercept of the budget constraint is the same. If he
     spends his entire budget on bus tickets, he can now afford only half as many, so the horizontal intercept is
     half as much. In short, the budget constraint rotates clockwise around the vertical intercept, steepening as
     it goes and the opportunity cost of bus tickets increases.

 2. Because of the improvement in technology, the vertical intercept of the PPF would be at a higher level of
     healthcare. In other words, the PPF would rotate clockwise around the horizontal intercept. This would
     make the PPF steeper, corresponding to an increase in the opportunity cost of education, since resources
     devoted to education would now mean forgoing a greater quantity of healthcare.

 3. No. Allocative efficiency requires productive efficiency, because it pertains to choices along the production
     possibilities frontier.

 4. Both the budget constraint and the PPF show the constraint that each operates under. Both show a tradeoff
     between having more of one good but less of the other. Both show the opportunity cost graphically as the
     slope of the constraint (budget or PPF).

 5. When individuals compare cost per unit in the grocery store, or characteristics of one product versus
     another, they are behaving approximately like the model describes.

 6. Since an op-ed makes a case for what should be, it is considered normative.
 7. Assuming that the study is not taking an explicit position about whether soft drink consumption is good or

     bad, but just reporting the science, it would be considered positive.

Chapter 3

 1. Since $1.60 per gallon is above the equilibrium price, the quantity demanded would be lower at 550
     gallons and the quantity supplied would be higher at 640 gallons. (These results are due to the laws of
     demand and supply, respectively.) The outcome of lower Qd and higher Qs would be a surplus in the
     gasoline market of 640 - 550 = 90 gallons.

 2. To make it easier to analyze complex problems. Ceteris paribus allows you to look at the effect of one factor
     at a time on what it is you are trying to analyze. When you have analyzed all the factors individually, you
     add the results together to get the final answer.

 3. a. An improvement in technology that reduces the cost of production will cause an increase in supply.
           Alternatively, you can think of this as a reduction in price necessary for firms to supply any quantity.
           Either way, this can be shown as a rightward (or downward) shift in the supply curve.

      b. An improvement in product quality is treated as an increase in tastes or preferences, meaning
           consumers demand more paint at any price level, so demand increases or shifts to the right. If this
           seems counterintuitive, note that demand in the future for the longer-lasting paint will fall, since
           consumers are essentially shifting demand from the future to the present.

      c. An increase in need causes an increase in demand or a rightward shift in the demand curve.
      d. Factory damage means that firms are unable to supply as much in the present. Technically, this is an

           increase in the cost of production. Either way you look at it, the supply curve shifts to the left.
 4. a. More fuel-efficient cars means there is less need for gasoline. This causes a leftward shift in the

           demand for gasoline and thus oil. Since the demand curve is shifting down the supply curve, the
           equilibrium price and quantity both fall.
      b. Cold weather increases the need for heating oil. This causes a rightward shift in the demand for
           heating oil and thus oil. Since the demand curve is shifting up the supply curve, the equilibrium price
           and quantity both rise.
      c. A discovery of new oil will make oil more abundant. This can be shown as a rightward shift in the

           supply curve, which will cause a decrease in the equilibrium price along with an increase in the
           equilibrium quantity. (The supply curve shifts down the demand curve so price and quantity follow
           the law of demand. If price goes down, then the quantity goes up.)
      d. When an economy slows down, it produces less output and demands less input, including energy,
           which is used in the production of virtually everything. A decrease in demand for energy will be
           reflected as a decrease in the demand for oil, or a leftward shift in demand for oil. Since the demand
           curve is shifting down the supply curve, both the equilibrium price and quantity of oil will fall.
      e. Disruption of oil pumping will reduce the supply of oil. This leftward shift in the supply curve will
           show a movement up the demand curve, resulting in an increase in the equilibrium price of oil and a
           decrease in the equilibrium quantity.
       f. Increased insulation will decrease the demand for heating. This leftward shift in the demand for oil
           causes a movement down the supply curve, resulting in a decrease in the equilibrium price and
           quantity of oil.
      g. Solar energy is a substitute for oil-based energy. So if solar energy becomes cheaper, the demand for
           oil will decrease as consumers switch from oil to solar. The decrease in demand for oil will be shown
           as a leftward shift in the demand curve. As the demand curve shifts down the supply curve, both
           equilibrium price and quantity for oil will fall.
      h. A new, popular kind of plastic will increase the demand for oil. The increase in demand will be shown
           as a rightward shift in demand, raising the equilibrium price and quantity of oil.

 5. Step 1. Draw the graph with the initial supply and demand curves. Label the initial equilibrium price and
     quantity.
     Step 2. Did the economic event affect supply or demand? Jet fuel is a cost of producing air travel, so an
     increase in jet fuel price affects supply.
     Step 3. An increase in the price of jet fuel caused an increase in the cost of air travel. We show this as an
     upward or leftward shift in supply.
     Step 4. A leftward shift in supply causes a movement up the demand curve, increasing the equilibrium
     price of air travel and decreasing the equilibrium quantity.

 6. Step 1. Draw the graph with the initial supply and demand curves. Label the initial equilibrium price and
     quantity.
     Step 2. Did the economic event affect supply or demand? A tariff is treated like a cost of production, so this
     affects supply.
     Step 3. A tariff reduction is equivalent to a decrease in the cost of production, which we can show as a
     rightward (or downward) shift in supply.
     Step 4. A rightward shift in supply causes a movement down the demand curve, lowering the equilibrium
     price and raising the equilibrium quantity.

 7. A price ceiling (which is below the equilibrium price) will cause the quantity demanded to rise and the
     quantity supplied to fall. This is why a price ceiling creates a shortage.

 8. A price ceiling is just a legal restriction. Equilibrium is an economic condition. People may or may not
     obey the price ceiling, so the actual price may be at or above the price ceiling, but the price ceiling does not
     change the equilibrium price.

 9. A price ceiling is a legal maximum price, but a price floor is a legal minimum price and, consequently, it
     would leave room for the price to rise to its equilibrium level. In other words, a price floor below
     equilibrium will not be binding and will have no effect.

10. Assuming that people obey the price ceiling, the market price will be below equilibrium, which means that
      Qd will be more than Qs. Buyers can only buy what is offered for sale, so the number of transactions will
      fall to Qs. This is easy to see graphically. By analogous reasoning, with a price floor the market price will be
      above the equilibrium price, so Qd will be less than Qs. Since the limit on transactions here is demand, the
      number of transactions will fall to Qd. Note that because both price floors and price ceilings reduce the
      number of transactions, social surplus is less.
912

11. Because the losses to consumers are greater than the benefits to producers, so the net effect is negative.
      Since the lost consumer surplus is greater than the additional producer surplus, social surplus falls.

Chapter 4

 1. Changes in the wage rate (the price of labor) cause a movement along the demand curve. A change in
     anything else that affects demand for labor (e.g., changes in output, changes in the production process that
     use more or less labor, government regulation) causes a shift in the demand curve.

 2. Changes in the wage rate (the price of labor) cause a movement along the supply curve. A change in
     anything else that affects supply of labor (e.g., changes in how desirable the job is perceived to be,
     government policy to promote training in the field) causes a shift in the supply curve.

 3. Since a living wage is a suggested minimum wage, it acts like a price floor (assuming, of course, that it is
     followed). If the living wage is binding, it will cause an excess supply of labor at that wage rate.

 4. Changes in the interest rate (i.e., the price of financial capital) cause a movement along the demand curve.
     A change in anything else (non-price variable) that affects demand for financial capital (e.g., changes in
     confidence about the future, changes in needs for borrowing) would shift the demand curve.

 5. Changes in the interest rate (i.e., the price of financial capital) cause a movement along the supply curve. A
     change in anything else that affects the supply of financial capital (a non-price variable) such as income or
     future needs would shift the supply curve.

 6. If market interest rates stay in their normal range, an interest rate limit of 35% would not be binding. If the
     equilibrium interest rate rose above 35%, the interest rate would be capped at that rate, and the quantity of
     loans would be lower than the equilibrium quantity, causing a shortage of loans.

 7. b and c will lead to a fall in interest rates. At a lower demand, lenders will not be able to charge as much,
     and with more available lenders, competition for borrowers will drive rates down.

 8. a and c will increase the quantity of loans. More people who want to borrow will result in more loans being
     given, as will more people who want to lend.

9. A price floor prevents a price from falling below a certain level, but has no effect on prices above that level. It
    will have its biggest effect in creating excess supply (as measured by the entire area inside the dotted lines on
    the graph, from D to S) if it is substantially above the equilibrium price. This is illustrated in the following
    figure.

    It will have a lesser effect if it is slightly above the equilibrium price. This is illustrated in the next figure.

                                                                                                                                                                                       913

    It will have no effect if it is set either slightly or substantially below the equilibrium price, since an equilibrium
    price above a price floor will not be affected by that price floor. The following figure illustrates these situations.

10. A price ceiling prevents a price from rising above a certain level, but has no effect on prices below that level. It
      will have its biggest effect in creating excess demand if it is substantially below the equilibrium price. The
      following figure illustrates these situations.
914

      When the price ceiling is set substantially or slightly above the equilibrium price, it will have no effect on
      creating excess demand. The following figure illustrates these situations.

11. Neither. A shift in demand or supply means that at every price, either a greater or a lower quantity is
      demanded or supplied. A price floor does not shift a demand curve or a supply curve. However, if the price
      floor is set above the equilibrium, it will cause the quantity supplied on the supply curve to be greater than
      the quantity demanded on the demand curve, leading to excess supply.

12. Neither. A shift in demand or supply means that at every price, either a greater or a lower quantity is
      demanded or supplied. A price ceiling does not shift a demand curve or a supply curve. However, if the
      price ceiling is set below the equilibrium, it will cause the quantity demanded on the demand curve to be
      greater than the quantity supplied on the supply curve, leading to excess demand.

 1. From point B to point C, price rises from $70 to $80, and Qd decreases from 2,800 to 2,600. So:

                                                                                                                                                                                      915

    The demand curve is inelastic in this area; that is, its elasticity value is less than one.
    Answer from Point D to point E:

    The demand curve is inelastic in this area; that is, its elasticity value is less than one.
    Answer from Point G to point H:

    The demand curve is elastic in this interval.
2. From point J to point K, price rises from $8 to $9, and quantity rises from 50 to 70. So:

    The supply curve is elastic in this area; that is, its elasticity value is greater than one.
916

     From point L to point M, the price rises from $10 to $11, while the Qs rises from 80 to 88:

     The supply curve has unitary elasticity in this area.
     From point N to point P, the price rises from $12 to $13, and Qs rises from 95 to 100:

     The supply curve is inelastic in this region of the supply curve.
 3. The demand curve with constant unitary elasticity is concave because the absolute value of declines in

     price are not identical. The left side of the curve starts with high prices, and then price falls by smaller
     amounts as it goes down toward the right side. This results in a slope of demand that is steeper on the left
     but flatter on the right, creating a curved, concave shape.
 4. The constant unitary elasticity is a straight line because the curve slopes upward and both price and
     quantity are increasing proportionally.
 5. Carmakers can pass this cost along to consumers if the demand for these cars is inelastic. If the demand
     for these cars is elastic, then the manufacturer must pay for the equipment.
 6. If the elasticity is 1.4 at current prices, you would advise the company to lower its price on the product,
     since a decrease in price will be offset by the increase in the amount of the drug sold. If the elasticity were
     0.6, then you would advise the company to increase its price. Increases in price will offset the decrease in
     number of units sold, but increase your total revenue. If elasticity is 1, the total revenue is already
     maximized, and you would advise that the company maintain its current price level.
 7. The percentage change in quantity supplied as a result of a given percentage change in the price of
     gasoline.

     In this example, bread is an inferior good because its consumption falls as income rises.
 9. The formula for cross-price elasticity is % change in Qd for apples / % change in P of oranges. Multiplying

     both sides by % change in P of oranges yields:
     % change in Qd for apples = cross-price elasticity X% change in P of oranges
     = 0.4 × (-3%) = -1.2%, or a 1.2 % decrease in demand for apples.

Chapter 6

 1. The rows of the table in the problem do not represent the actual choices available on the budget set; that is,
     the combinations of round trips and phone minutes that Jeremy can afford with his budget. One of the
     choices listed in the problem, the six round trips, is not even available on the budget set. If Jeremy has only
     $10 to spend and a round trip costs $2 and phone calls cost $0.05 per minute, he could spend his entire
     budget on five round trips but no phone calls or 200 minutes of phone calls, but no round trips or any
     combination of the two in between. It is easy to see all of his budget options with a little algebra. The
     equation for a budget line is:

     where P and Q are price and quantity of round trips (RT) and phone calls (PC) (per minute). In Jeremy's case
     the equation for the budget line is:

If we choose zero through five round trips (column 1), the table below shows how many phone minutes can
be afforded with the budget (column 3). The total utility figures are given in the table below.

Round Trips Total Utility for Trips Phone Minutes Total Utility for Minutes Total Utility

0  0    200  1100  1100

1  80   160  1040  1120

2  150  120  900   1050

3  210  80   680   890

4  260  40   380   640

5  300  0    0     300

    Adding up total utility for round trips and phone minutes at different points on the budget line gives total
    utility at each point on the budget line. The highest possible utility is at the combination of one trip and
    160 minutes of phone time, with a total utility of 1120.
2. The first step is to use the total utility figures, shown in the table below, to calculate marginal utility,
    remembering that marginal utility is equal to the change in total utility divided by the change in trips or
    minutes.

     3             210           70                          80            680         140/40 = 3.5
     4             260           60                          40            380         220/40 = 5.5
     5             300           50                           0              0         300/40 = 7.5

     Note that we cannot directly compare marginal utilities, since the units are trips versus phone minutes.
     We need a common denominator for comparison, which is price. Dividing MU by the price, yields columns
     4 and 8 in the table below.

    Start at the bottom of the table where the combination of round trips and phone minutes is (5, 0). This
    starting point is arbitrary, but the numbers in this example work best starting from the bottom. Suppose
    we consider moving to the next point up. At (4, 40), the marginal utility per dollar spent on a round trip is
    25. The marginal utility per dollar spent on phone minutes is 190.
    Since 25 < 190, we are getting much more utility per dollar spent on phone minutes, so let's choose more
    of those. At (3, 80), MU/PRT is 30 < 150 (the MU/PM), but notice that the difference is narrowing. We keep
    trading round trips for phone minutes until we get to (1, 160), which is the best we can do. The MU/P
    comparison is as close as it is going to get (40 vs. 70). Often in the real world, it is not possible to get MU/P
    exactly equal for both products, so you get as close as you can.
3. This is the opposite of the example explained in the text. A decrease in price has a substitution effect and
    an income effect. The substitution effect says that because the product is cheaper relative to other things
    the consumer purchases, the consumer will tend to buy more of the product (and less of the other things).

    The income effect says that after the price decline, the consumer could purchase the same goods as before,
    and still have money left over to purchase more. For both reasons, a decrease in price causes an increase
    in quantity demanded.
4. This is a negative income effect. Because your parents' check failed to arrive, your monthly income is less
    than normal and your budget constraint shifts in toward the origin. If you only buy normal goods, the
    decrease in your income means you will buy less of every product.

4. a. Total revenues in this example will be a quantity of five units multiplied by the price of $25/unit,
          which equals $125. Total costs when producing five units are $130. Thus, at this level of quantity and
          output the firm experiences losses (or negative profits) of $5.

     b. If price is less than average cost, the firm is not making a profit. At an output of five units, the average
          cost is $26/unit. Thus, at a glance you can see the firm is making losses. At a second glance, you can
          see that it must be losing $1 for each unit produced (that is, average cost of $26/unit minus the price of
          $25/unit). With five units produced, this observation implies total losses of $5.

     c. When producing five units, marginal costs are $30/unit. Price is $25/unit. Thus, the marginal unit is
          not adding to profits, but is actually subtracting from profits, which suggests that the firm should
          reduce its quantity produced.

5. The marginal product of the third painter is 75 square feet.

6. The new table should look like this:
920

                                 Labor Cost  Machine Cost Total Cost

     Cost of technology 1 10 × $40 = $400 2 × $50 = $100 $500

     Cost of technology 2 7 × $40 = $280 4 × $50 = $200 $480

     Cost of technology 3 3 × $40 = $120 7 × $50 = $350 $470

    The firm should choose production technology 3 since it has the lowest total cost. This makes sense since,
    with cheaper machine hours, one would expect a shift in the direction of more machines and less labor.
7.

                                 Labor Cost  Machine Cost Total Cost

     Cost of technology 1 10 × $40 = $400 2 × $55 = $110 $510

     Cost of technology 2 7 × $40 = $280 4 × $55 = $220 $500

     Cost of technology 3 3 × $40 = $120 7 × $55 = $385 $505

     The firm should choose production technology 2 since it has the lowest total cost. Because the cost of
     machines increased (relative to the previous question), you would expect a shift toward less capital and
     more labor.
 8. This is the situation that existed in the United States in the 1970s. Since there is only demand enough for
     2.5 firms to reach the bottom of the average cost curve, you would expect one firm will not be around in the
     long run, and at least one firm will be struggling.

Chapter 8

 1. No, you would not raise the price. Your product is exactly the same as the product of the many other firms
     in the market. If your price is greater than that of your competitors, then your customers would switch to
     them and stop buying from you. You would lose all your sales.

 2. Possibly. Independent truckers are by definition small and numerous. All that is required to get into the
     business is a truck (not an inexpensive asset, though) and a commercial driver's license. To exit, one need
     only sell the truck. All trucks are essentially the same, providing transportation from point A to point B.
     (We're assuming we not talking about specialized trucks.) Independent truckers must take the going rate
     for their service, so independent trucking does seem to have most of the characteristics of perfect
     competition.

 3. Holding total cost constant, profits at every output level would increase.
 4. When the market price increases, marginal revenue increases. The firm would then increase production

     up to the point where the new price equals marginal cost, at a quantity of 90.
 5. If marginal costs exceeds marginal revenue, then the firm will reduce its profits for every additional unit of

     output it produces. Profit would be greatest if it reduces output to where MR = MC.
 6. The firm will be willing to supply fewer units at every price level. In other words, the firm's individual

     supply curve decreases and shifts to the left.
 7. With a technological improvement that brings about a reduction in costs of production, an adjustment

     process will take place in the market. The technological improvement will result in an increase in supply
     curves, by individual firms and at the market level. The existing firms will experience higher profits for a
     while, which will attract other firms into the market. This entry process will stop whenever the market
     supply increases enough (both by existing and new firms) so profits are driven back to zero.
 8. When wages increase, costs of production increase. Some firms would now be making economic losses

                                                                                                                                                                                       921

     and would shut down. The supply curve then starts shifting to the left, pushing the market price up. This
     process ends when all firms remaining in the market earn zero economic profits. The result is a
     contraction in the output produced in the market.
 9. Perfect competition is considered to be "perfect" because both allocative and productive efficiency are met
     at the same time in a long-run equilibrium. If a market structure results in long-run equilibrium that does
     not minimize average total costs and/or does not charge a price equal to marginal cost, then either
     allocative or productive (or both) efficiencies are not met, and therefore the market cannot be labeled
     "perfect."
10. Think of the market price as representing the gain to society from a purchase, since it represents what
      someone is willing to pay. Think of the marginal cost as representing the cost to society from making the
      last unit of a good. If P > MC, then the benefits from producing more of a good exceed the costs, and society
      would gain from producing more of the good. If P < MC, then the social costs of producing the marginal
      good exceed the social benefits, and society should produce less of the good. Only if P = MC, the rule
      applied by a profit-maximizing perfectly competitive firm, will society's costs and benefits be in balance.
      This choice will be the option that brings the greatest overall benefit to society.

      d. This is probably not a barrier to entry, since there are a number of different ways of getting pure water.
      e. This is a barrier to entry, but it is not government-enforced.

 3. Because of economies of scale, each firm would produce at a higher average cost than before. (They would
     each have to build their own power lines.) As a result, they would each have to raise prices to cover their
     higher costs. The policy would fail.

 4. Shorter patent protection would make innovation less lucrative, so the amount of research and
     development would likely decline.

 5. If price falls below AVC, the firm will not be able to earn enough revenues even to cover its variable costs. In
     such a case, it will suffer a smaller loss if it shuts down and produces no output. By contrast, if it stayed in
     operation and produced the level of output where MR = MC, it would lose all of its fixed costs plus some
     variable costs. If it shuts down, it only loses its fixed costs.

 6. This scenario is called "perfect price discrimination." The result would be that the monopolist would
     produce more output, the same amount in fact as would be produced by a perfectly competitive industry.
     However, there would be no consumer surplus since each buyer is paying exactly what they think the
     product is worth. Therefore, the monopolist would be earning the maximum possible profits.

Chapter 10

 1. An increase in demand will manifest itself as a rightward shift in the demand curve, and a rightward shift
     in marginal revenue. The shift in marginal revenue will cause a movement up the marginal cost curve to
     the new intersection between MR and MC at a higher level of output. The new price can be read by drawing
     a line up from the new output level to the new demand curve, and then over to the vertical axis. The new
     price should be higher. The increase in quantity will cause a movement along the average cost curve to a
922

     possibly higher level of average cost. The price, though, will increase more, causing an increase in total
     profits.
 2. As long as the original firm is earning positive economic profits, other firms will respond in ways that take
     away the original firm's profits. This will manifest itself as a decrease in demand for the original firm's
     product, a decrease in the firm's profit-maximizing price and a decrease in the firm's profit-maximizing
     level of output, essentially unwinding the process described in the answer to question 1. In the long-run
     equilibrium, all firms in monopolistically competitive markets will earn zero economic profits.
 3. a. If the firms form a cartel, they will act like a monopoly, choosing the quantity of output where MR =

           MC. Drawing a line from the monopoly quantity up to the demand curve shows the monopoly price.
           Assuming that fixed costs are zero, and with an understanding of cost and profit, we can infer that
           when the marginal cost curve is horizontal, average cost is the same as marginal cost. Thus, the cartel
           will earn positive economic profits equal to the area of the rectangle, with a base equal to the
           monopoly quantity and a height equal to the difference between price (on the demand above the
           monopoly quantity) and average cost, as shown in the following figure.

      b. The firms will expand output and cut price as long as there are profits remaining. The long-run
           equilibrium will occur at the point where average cost equals demand. As a result, the oligopoly will
           earn zero economic profits due to "cutthroat competition," as shown in the next figure.

      c. Pc > Pcc. Qc < Qcc. Profit for the cartel is positive and large. Profit for cutthroat competition is zero.
 4. Firm B reasons that if it cheats and Firm A does not notice, it will double its money. Since Firm A's profits

     will decline substantially, however, it is likely that Firm A will notice and if so, Firm A will cheat also, with
     the result that Firm B will lose 90% of what it gained by cheating. Firm A will reason that Firm B is unlikely
     to risk cheating. If neither firm cheats, Firm A earns $1000. If Firm A cheats, assuming Firm B does not
     cheat, A can boost its profits only a little, since Firm B is so small. If both firms cheat, then Firm A loses at

     least 50% of what it could have earned. The possibility of a small gain ($50) is probably not enough to
     induce Firm A to cheat, so in this case it is likely that both firms will collude.

Chapter 11

 1. Yes, it is true. The HHI example is easy enough: since the market shares of all firms are included in the HHI
     calculation, a merger between two of the firms will change the HHI. For the four-firm concentration ratio, it
     is quite possible that a merger between, say, the fifth and sixth largest firms in the market could create a
     new firm that is then ranked in the top four in the market. In this case, a merger of two firms, neither in the
     top four, would still change the four-firm concentration ratio.

 2. No, it is not true. The HHI includes the market shares of all firms in its calculation, but the squaring of the
     market shares has the effect of making the impact of the largest firms relatively bigger than in the 4-firm
     or 8-firm ratio.

 3. The bus companies wanted the broader market definition (i.e., the second definition). If the narrow
     definition had been used, the combined bus companies would have had a near-monopoly on the market
     for intercity bus service. But they had only a sliver of the market for intercity transportation when
     everything else was included. The merger was allowed.

 4. The common expectation is that the definition of markets will become broader because of greater
     competition from faraway places. However, this broadening doesn't necessarily mean that antitrust
     authorities can relax. There is also a fear that companies with a local or national monopoly may use the
     new opportunities to extend their reach across national borders, and that it will be difficult for national
     authorities to respond.

 5. Because outright collusion to raise profits is illegal and because existing regulations include gray areas
     which firms may be able to exploit.

 6. Yes, all curves have normal shapes.

 7. Yes it is a natural monopoly because average costs decline over the range that satisfies the market
     demand. For example, at the point where the demand curve and the average cost curve meet, there are
     economies of scale.

 8. Improvements in technology that allowed phone calls to be made via microwave transmission,
     communications satellites, and other wireless technologies.

 9. More consumer choice. Cheaper phone calls, especially long distance. Better-quality phone service in
     many cases. Cheaper, faster, and better-quality data transmission. Spin-off technologies like free Internet-
     based calling and video calling.

10. More choice can sometimes make for difficult decisions--not knowing if you got the best plan for your
      situation, for example. Some phone service providers are less reliable than AT&T used to be.

 4. The original equilibrium (before the external social cost of pollution is taken into account) is where the
     private supply curve crosses the demand curve. This original equilibrium is at a price of $15 and a
     quantity of 440. After taking into account the additional external cost of pollution, the production becomes
     more costly, and the supply curve shifts up. The new equilibrium will be at a price of $30 and a quantity of
     410.

 8. First, if each firm is required to reduce its garbage output by one-fourth, then Elm will reduce five tons at a
     cost of $5,500; Maple will reduce 10 tons at a cost of $13,500; Oak will reduce three tons at a cost of
     $22,500; and Cherry will reduce four tons at a cost of $18,000. Total cost of this approach: $59,500. If the
     system of marketable permits is put in place, and those permits shrink the weight of allowable garbage by
     one-quarter, then pollution must still be reduced by the same overall amount. However, now the reduction
     in pollution will take place where it is least expensive.

     First 5 tons                Cherry     $3,000

            Reductions in Garbage Who does the reducing? At what cost?

            Eighth 5 tons                 Elm                              $6,500

            Ninth and tenth 5 tons Elm and Cherry                          $7,000 each

    Thus, the overall pattern of reductions here will be that Elm reduces garbage by 20 tons and has 15 tons of
    permits to sell. Maple reduces by five tons and needs to buy five tons of permits. Oak does not reduce
    garbage at all, and needs to buy 15 tons of permits. Cherry reduces garbage by 25 tons, which leaves it with
    five tons of permits to sell. The total cost of these reductions would be $56,300, a definite reduction in
    costs from the $59,500 cost of the command-and-control option.

            divided by the change in quantity.

       b. The "optimal" level of pollution is where the marginal benefits of reducing it are equal to the marginal
            cost. This is at four million gallons.

       c. Marginal analysis tells us if the marginal costs of cleanup are greater than the marginal benefit,
            society could use those resources more efficiently elsewhere in the economy.

11. a. See the next table for the answers, which were calculated using the traditional calculation of marginal
            cost equal to change in total cost divided by change in quantity.

              Land Restored (in acres) Total Cost [marginal cost] Total Benefit [marginal benefit]

              0                  $0                                 $0

              100                $20 [0.2]                          $140 [1.4]

       b. The optimal amount of restored land is 300 acres. Beyond this quantity the marginal costs are greater
            than the marginal benefits.

                       Protect                                      Not Protect

     Country  Protect  Both A and B have a cost of 10 and a         A has a cost of 10 and a benefit of 8 (net =
         A             benefit of 16; each country has net = 6      -2); B has a cost of 0 and a benefit of 8 (
              Not                                                   net = 8)
              Protect  A has a cost of 0 and a benefit of 8 (net =
                       8); B has a cost of 10 and a benefit of 8    Both A and B have a zero cost and a zero
                       (net = -2)                                   benefit; each country has net = 0

     Country B will reason this way: If A protects the environment, then we will have benefits of 6 if we act to
     protect the environment, but 8 if we do not, so we will not protect it. If A is not protecting the environment,
     we will have losses of 2 if we protect, but have zero if we do not protect, so again, we will not protect it.
     Country A will reason in a similar manner. The result is that both countries choose to not protect, even
     though they will achieve the largest social benefits--a combined benefit of 12 for the two countries--if they
     both choose to protect. Environmental treaties can be viewed as a way for countries to try to extricate
     themselves from this situation.

13. a.

       b. Of the choices provided, P, R, and S demonstrate productive efficiency. These are the choices on the
            production possibility frontier.

       c. Allocative efficiency is determined by the preferences--in this case by the preferences of society as
            expressed through government and other social institutions. Because you do not have information
            about these preferences, you really cannot say much about allocative efficiency.

       d. In the choice between T and R, R should clearly be preferred, because it has both more corn and more
            trees. This answer illustrates why productive efficiency is beneficial. Compared with choices inside
            the PPF, it means more of one or both goods.

       e. In the choice between T and S, it is not possible to say which choice is better. True, S is on the PPF and
            T is not--but that only addresses the issue of productive efficiency. If a society has a strong preference
            for economic output and places a lower value on trees, then allocative efficiency may lead to a choice
            of T over S. Of course, the reverse could also be true, leading to a choice of S. Without information on
            society's preferences to judge allocative efficiency, this question cannot be answered.

       f. Compared with command-and-control policies, market-oriented policies allow either more output
            with the same environmental protection or more environmental protection with the same level of
            output--or more of both environmental protection and output. Thus, a choice like Q inside the PPF is
            more likely to represent a command-and-control policy demand than a choice like S on the frontier of
            the PPF.

Chapter 13

 1. No. A market demand curve reflects only the private benefits of those who are consuming the product.
     Positive externalities are benefits that spill over to third parties, so they create social benefits, and are not
     captured by a market (or private benefit) demand curve.

 2. Clearly Samsung is benefiting from the investment, so the 20% increase in profits is a private benefit. If
     Samsung is unable to capture all of the benefit, perhaps because other companies quickly copy and
     produce close substitutes, then Samsung's investment will produce social benefits.

 3. a. $102 million.
      b. If the interest rate is 9%, the cost of financial capital, and the firm can capture the 5% return to society,
           the firm would invest as if its effective rate of return is 4%, so it will invest $183 million.

 4. When the Junkbuyers Company purchases something for resale, presumably both the buyer and the seller
     benefit--otherwise, they would not need to make the transaction. However, the company also reduces the
     amount of garbage produced, which saves money for households and/or for the city that disposes of
     garbage. So the social benefits are larger than the private benefits.

 5. Government programs that either pay for neighborhood clean-up directly or that provide reduced tax
     payments for those who clean up or fix up their own property could be enacted. It is also easy to imagine
     how a city might allow its businesses to form a group that would pay for and manage neighborhood
     cleanup.

 6. Government programs that either pay for education directly or that provide loans or reduced tax payments
     for education could create positive spillovers. A city might allow its businesses to form a group that would
     coordinate business efforts with schools and local colleges and universities--allowing students to obtain
     real-world experience in their chosen fields and providing businesses with enthusiastic, trained workers.

 7. a. Once citizens are protected from crime, it is difficult to exclude someone from this protection, so it is
           nonexcludable.

      b. Some satellite radio services, such as SiriusXM, are sold by subscription fee, so it is excludable.
      c. Once a road is built it is difficult to exclude people, although toll roads can exclude non-payers.
      d. Primary education can be provided by private companies and so it is excludable.
      e. Companies sell cell phone service and exclude those who do not pay.

 8. a. Two people cannot enjoy the same slice of pizza at the same time, so private goods, such as a slice of
           pizza, are rivalrous.

      b. Two people cannot use one laptop at the same time, so they are rivalrous in consumption.
      c. Public radio can be heard by anyone with a radio, so many people can listen at the same time--the

           good is nonrivalrous.
      d. It is difficult for two people to simultaneously eat an ice cream cone, so it is rivalrous in consumption.

Chapter 14

 1. a. For a firm operating in a perfectly competitive output market, the value of the marginal product is the
           marginal product of labor multiplied by the firm's output price.

      b. In a perfectly competitive labor market where the going market wage is $12, a profit-maximizing firm
           will hire workers up to the point where the market wage equals the marginal revenue product. In this
           case, the market wage equals the marginal revenue product when the labor is 5 because at that level,
           the marginal revenue product is $12.

 2. a. For firms with some market power in their output market, like a monopoly, the value of additional
           output sold is the firm's marginal revenue, not the price. This is because they face a downward sloping
           demand curve for output, which means that in order to sell additional output, the firm must lower its
           price. The marginal revenue product equals the marginal product of labor multiplied by the marginal
           revenue.

      b. A profit-maximizing firm will hire workers up to the point where the market wage equals the marginal
           revenue product. If the going market wage is $20, in this scenario, the profit-maximizing level of
           employment is 4 because at that point, the marginal revenue product is $20.

 3. a. With no union, the equilibrium wage rate would be $18 per hour and there would be 8,000 bus drivers.
      b. If the union has enough negotiating power to raise the wage to $4 per hour higher than under the
           original equilibrium, the new wage would be $22 per hour. At this wage, 4,000 workers would be
           demanded while 10,000 would be supplied, leading to an excess supply of 6,000 workers.

 4. Unions have sometimes opposed new technology out of a fear of losing jobs, but in other cases unions have
     helped to facilitate the introduction of new technology because unionized workers felt that the union was
     looking after their interests or that their higher skills meant that their jobs were essentially protected. And
     the new technologies meant increased productivity.

 5. In a few other countries (such as France and Spain), the percentage of workers belonging to a union is
     similar to that in the United States. Union membership rates, however, are generally lower in the United
     States. When the share of workers whose wages are determined by union negotiations is considered, the

                                                                          929

     United States ranks by far the lowest (because in countries like France and Spain, union negotiations often
     determine pay even for nonunion employees).
 6. No. While some unions may cause firms to go bankrupt, other unions help firms to become more
     competitive. No overall pattern exists.
 7. From a social point of view, the benefits of unions and the costs seem to counterbalance. There is no
     evidence that in countries with a higher percentage of unionized workers, the economies grow more or
     less slowly.
 8. a. The marginal cost of labor is the cost to the firm of hiring one more worker. To find the marginal cost

           of labor, one must divide the change in wage by the change in labor.
      b. Because the monopsonist is the sole employer in the labor market, it can offer any wage that it wishes.

           However, the marginal cost of labor will be greater than the wage for any number of workers more
           than one because hiring more than one worker requires paying a higher wage rate for both the new
           worker and all previous hires. A monopsony will hire workers up to the point where its demand for
           labor equals the marginal cost of additional labor.

 9. a. Firms have a profit incentive to sell to everyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, or gender.
      b. A business that needs to hire workers to expand may also find that if it draws only from its accustomed
           pool of workers--say, White men--it lacks the workers it needs to expand production. Such a business
           would have an incentive to hire more women and minorities.
      c. A discriminatory business that is underpaying its workers may find those workers leaving for jobs
           with another employer who offers better pay. This market pressure could cause the discriminatory
           business to behave better.

10. No. The earnings gap does not prove discrimination because it does not compare the wages of men and
      women in the same job who have the same amounts of education, experience, and productivity.

11. If a large share of immigrants have relatively low skills, then reducing the number of immigrants would
      shift the supply curve of low-skill labor back to the left, which would tend to raise the equilibrium wage for
      low-skill labor.

     "Opportunity set after program" extends from (0, $16,300) to (1,500, $10,000). "Opportunity set before

     program" slopes downward from (0, $9,000) to (1,500, $0).

     0      $0      $10,000                                     $10,000

 4. The earned income tax credit works like this: a family receives a tax break that increases according to how
     much they work. Families that work more get more. In that sense it loosens the poverty trap by
     encouraging work. As families earn above the poverty level, the earned income tax credit is gradually
     reduced. For those near-poor families, the earned income tax credit is a partial disincentive to work.

 5. TANF attempts to loosen the poverty trap by providing incentives to work in other ways. Specifically, it
     requires that people work (or complete their education) as a condition of receiving TANF benefits, and it
     places a time limit on benefits.

6. A useful first step is to rank the households by income, from lowest to highest. Then, since there are 10
    households total, the bottom quintile will be the bottom two households, the second quintile will be the
    third and fourth households, and so on up to the top quintile. The quintiles and percentage of total income
    for the data provided are shown in the following table. Comparing this distribution to the U.S. income
    distribution for 2005, the top quintile in the example has a smaller share of total income than in the U.S.
    distribution and the bottom quintile has a larger share. This pattern usually means that the income
    distribution in the example is more equal than the U.S. distribution.

Income                 Quintile                  % of Total Income

$10,000   Total first quintile income: $22,000   6.0%
$12,000

$16,000   Total second quintile income: $34,000 9.2%

$370,000 Total Income

7. Just from glancing at the quintile information, it is fairly obvious that income inequality increased in the
    United Kingdom over this time: The top quintile is getting a lot more, and the lowest quintile is getting a bit
    less. Converting this information into a Lorenz curve, however, is a little trickier, because the Lorenz curve
    graphs the cumulative distribution, not the amount received by individual quintiles. Thus, as explained in
    the text, you have to add up the individual quintile data to convert the data to this form. The following table
    shows the actual calculations for the share of income in 1979 versus 1991. The figure following the table
    shows the perfect equality line and the Lorenz curves for 1979 and 1991. As shown, the income
    distribution in 1979 was closer to the perfect equality line than the income distribution in 1991--that is,
    the United Kingdom income distribution became more unequal over time.

          Share of income received 1979 1991

8. In the market for low-wage labor, information technology shifts the demand for low-wage labor to the left. One
    reason is that technology can often substitute for low-wage labor in certain kinds of telephone or bookkeeping
    jobs. In addition, information technology makes it easier for companies to manage connections with low-wage
    workers in other countries, thus reducing the demand for low-wage workers in the United States. In the market
    for high-wage labor, information technology shifts the demand for high-wage labor to the right. By using the
    new information and communications technologies, high-wage labor can become more productive and can
    oversee more tasks than before. The following figure illustrates these two labor markets. The combination of
    lower wages for low-wage labor and higher wages for high-wage labor means greater inequality.

9. In the market for low-wage labor, a skills program will shift supply to the left, which will tend to drive up wages
    for the remaining low-skill workers. In the market for high-wage labor, a skills program will shift supply to the
    right (because after the training program there are now more high-skilled workers at every wage), which will
    tend to drive down wages for high-skill workers. The combination of these two programs will result in a lesser
    degree of inequality. The following figure illustrates these two labor markets. In the market for high-wage labor,
    a skills program will shift supply to the right, which will tend to drive down wages for high-skill workers.

10. A very strong push for economic equality might include extremely high taxes on high-wage earners to pay
      for extremely large government social payments for people with much lower incomes. Such a policy could
      limit incentives for the high-wage workers, lock the poor into a poverty trap, and thus reduce output. The
      PPF in this case will have the standard appearance: it will be downward sloping.

11. For the second hypothesis, a well-funded social safety net might make people feel that even if their
      company goes bankrupt or they need to change jobs or industries, they will have some degree of
      protection. As a result, people may be more willing to allow markets to work without interference, and not
      to lobby as hard for rules that would prevent layoffs, set price controls, or block foreign trade. In this case,
      safety net programs that increase equality could also allow the market to work more freely in a way that
      could increase output. In this case, at least some portion of the PPF between equality and economic output
      would slope up.

12. Pure redistribution is more likely to cause a sharp tradeoff between economic output and equality than
      policies aimed at the ladder of opportunity. A production possibility frontier showing a strict tradeoff
      between economic output and equality will be downward sloping. A PPF showing that it is possible to
      increase equality, at least to some extent, while either increasing output or at least not diminishing it
      would have a PPF that first rises, perhaps has a flat area, and then falls.

13. Many view the redistribution of income to achieve greater equality as taking away from the rich to pay the
      poor, or as a "zero sum" game. By taking taxes from one group of people and redistributing them to
      another, the tax system is robbing some of the American Dream.

      d. Imperfect information is relatively high. What do those flowers really look like?

 2. Asymmetric information often exists in the labor market because employers cannot observe many key
     employee attributes until after the person is hired. Employees, however, know whether they are energetic
     or detailed-oriented. Employers, therefore, often seek schools to pre-screen candidates. Employers may
     not even interview a candidate unless he has a degree and often a degree from a particular school.
     Employers may also view awards, a high grade point average, and other accolades as a signal of hard work,
     perseverance, and ability. Finally, employers seek references for insights into key attributes such as
     energy level, work ethic, and so on.

 3. It is almost impossible to distinguish whether a health outcome such as life expectancy was the result of
     personal preferences that might affect health and longevity, such as diet, exercise, certain risky behavior,
     and consumption of certain items like tobacco, or the result of expenditures on health care (for example,
     annual check-ups).

Chapter 17

 1. a. The management of small companies might rather do an IPO right away, but until they get the
           company up and running, most people would not pay very much for the stock because of the risks
           involved.

      b. A small company may be earning few or zero profits, and its owners want to reinvest their earnings in
           the future growth of the company. If this company issues bonds or borrows money, it is obligated to
           make interest payments, which can eat up the company's cash. If the company issues stock, it is not
           obligated to make payments to anyone (although it may choose to pay dividends).

      c. Venture capitalists are private investors who can keep close tabs on the management and strategy of
           the company--and thus reduce the problems of imperfect information about whether the firm is being
           well run. Venture capitalists often own a substantial portion of the firm and have much better
           information than a typical shareholder would.

 2. From a firm's point of view, a bond is very similar to a bank loan. Both are ways of borrowing money. Both
     require paying interest. The major difference is who must be persuaded to lend money: a bank loan
     requires persuading the bank, while issuing bonds requires persuading a number of separate
     bondholders. Since a bank often knows a great deal about a firm (especially if the firm has its accounts
     with that bank), bank loans are more common where imperfect information would otherwise be a
     problem.

 3. a. Remember, equity is the market value of the house minus what is still owed to the bank. Thus: the
           value of the house is $200,000, Fred owes $180,000 to the bank, and his equity is $20,000.

      b. The value of Freda's house is $250,000. It does not matter what price she bought it for. She owes zero
           to the bank, so her equity is the whole $250,000.

      c. The value of Frank's house is $160,000. He owes $60,000 to the bank (the original $80,000 minus the
           $20,000 he has paid off the loan). His equity is $100,000.

 4. Over a sustained period of time, stocks have an average return higher than bonds, and bonds have an
     average return higher than a savings account. This is because in any given year the value of a savings
     account changes very little. In contrast, stock values can grow or decline by a very large amount (for
     example, the S&P 500 increased 26% in 2009 after declining 37% in 2008. The value of a bond, which
     depends largely on interest rate fluctuations, varies far less than a stock, but more than a savings account.

 5. When people believe that a high-risk investment must have a low return, they are getting confused
     between what risk and return mean. Yes, a high-risk investment might have a low return, but it might also
     have a high return. Risk refers to the fact that a wide range of outcomes is possible. However, a high-risk
     investment must, on average, expect a relatively high return or else no one would be willing to take the
     risk. Thus, it is quite possible--even likely--for an investment to have high risk and high return. Indeed,
     the reason that an investment has a high expected return is that it also has a high risk.

 6. Principal + (principal × rate × time)
     $5,000 + ($5,000 × 0.06 × 3) = $5,900

 7. Principal + (principal × rate × time); Interest = Principal × rate × time; $500 = $10,000 × rate × 5 years;
     $500 = $50,000 × rate; $500/$50,000 = rate; Rate = 1%

 8. Principal(1 + interest rate)time = $1,000(1+0.02)5 =$1,104.08

     decreases.
 2. The cost in time of voting, transportation costs to and from the polling place, and any additional time and

     effort spent becoming informed about the candidates.
 3. The costs of organization and the small benefit to the individual.
 4. Domestic cotton producers would lobby heavily to protect themselves from the competition, whereas the

     consumers have little incentive to organize.
 5. True. This is exactly what occurs in a voting cycle. That is, the majority can prefer policy A to policy B,

     policy B to policy C, but also prefer policy C to policy A. Then, the majority will never reach a conclusive
     outcome.
 6. The problem is an example of a voting cycle. The group will vote for mountain biking over canoeing by
     2-1. It will vote for canoeing over the beach by 2-1. If mountain biking is preferred to canoeing and
     canoeing is preferred to the beach, it might seem that it must be true that mountain biking is the favorite.
     But in a vote of the beach versus mountain biking, the beach wins by a 2-1 vote. When a voting cycle
     occurs, choosing a single favorite that is always preferred by a majority becomes impossible.
 7. The four Coca-Cola candidates compete with each other for Coca-Cola voters, whereas everyone who
     prefers Pepsi had only one candidate to vote for. Thus the will of the majority is not satisfied.

Chapter 19

 1. GDP is C + I + G + (X - M). GDP = $2,000 billion + $50 billion + $1,000 billion + ($20 billion - $40 billion) =
     $3,030

 2. a. Hospital stays are part of GDP.
      b. Changes in life expectancy are not market transactions and not part of GDP.
      c. Child care that is paid for is part of GDP.
      d. If Grandma gets paid and reports this as income, it is part of GDP, otherwise not.
      e. A used car is not produced this year, so it is not part of GDP.
       f. A new car is part of GDP.
      g. Variety does not count in GDP, where the cheese could all be cheddar.
      h. The iron is not counted because it is an intermediate good.

 3. From 1980 to 1990, real GDP grew by (8,225.0 - 5,926.5) / (5,926.5) = 39%. Over the same period, prices
     increased by (72.7 - 48.3) / (48.3/100) = 51%. So about 57% of the growth 51 / (51 + 39) was inflation, and
     the remainder: 39 / (51 + 39) = 43% was growth in real GDP.

 4. Two other major recessions are visible in the figure as slight dips: those of 1973-1975, and 1981-1982.
     Two other recessions appear in the figure as a flattening of the path of real GDP. These were in 1990-1991
     and 2001.

 5. 11 recessions in approximately 70 years averages about one recession every six years.
 6. The table lists the "Months of Contraction" for each recession. Averaging these figures for the post-WWII

     recessions gives an average duration of 11 months, or slightly less than a year.
 7. The table lists the "Months of Expansion." Averaging these figures for the post-WWII expansions gives an

     average expansion of 60.5 months, or more than five years.
 8. Yes. The answer to both questions depends on whether GDP is growing faster or slower than population. If

     population grows faster than GDP, GDP increases, while GDP per capita decreases. If GDP falls, but
     population falls faster, then GDP decreases, while GDP per capita increases.
 9. Start with Central African Republic's GDP measured in francs. Divide it by the exchange rate to convert to
     U.S. dollars, and then divide by population to obtain the per capita figure. That is, 1,107,689 million francs
     / 284.681 francs per dollar / 4.862 million people = $800.28 GDP per capita.
10. a. A dirtier environment would reduce the broad standard of living, but not be counted in GDP, so a rise

            in GDP would overstate the standard of living.
       b. A lower crime rate would raise the broad standard of living, but not be counted directly in GDP, and so
936

            a rise in GDP would understate the standard of living.
       c. A greater variety of goods would raise the broad standard of living, but not be counted directly in GDP,

            and so a rise in GDP would understate the rise in the standard of living.
       d. A decline in infant mortality would raise the broad standard of living, but not be counted directly in

            GDP, and so a rise in GDP would understate the rise in the standard of living.

Chapter 20

 1. The Industrial Revolution refers to the widespread use of power-driven machinery and the economic and
     social changes that resulted in the first half of the 1800s. Ingenious machines--the steam engine, the
     power loom, and the steam locomotive--performed tasks that would have taken vast numbers of workers
     to do. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain, and soon spread to the United States, Germany,
     and other countries.

 2. Property rights are the rights of individuals and firms to own property and use it as they see fit.
     Contractual rights are based on property rights and they allow individuals to enter into agreements with
     others regarding the use of their property providing recourse through the legal system in the event of
     noncompliance. Economic growth occurs when the standard of living increases in an economy, which
     occurs when output is increasing and incomes are rising. For this to happen, societies must create a legal
     environment that gives individuals the ability to use their property to their fullest and highest use,
     including the right to trade or sell that property. Without a legal system that enforces contracts, people
     would not be likely to enter into contracts for current or future services because of the risk of non-
     payment. This would make it difficult to transact business and would slow economic growth.

 3. Yes. Since productivity is output per unit of input, we can measure productivity using GDP (output) per
     worker (input).

 4. In 20 years the United States will have an income of 10,000 × (1 + 0.01)20 = $12,201.90, and South Korea
     will have an income of 10,000 × (1 + 0.04)20 = $21,911.23. South Korea has grown by a multiple of 2.1 and
     the United States by a multiple of 1.2.

 5. Capital deepening and technology are important. What seems to be more important is how they are
     combined.

 6. Government can contribute to economic growth by investing in human capital through the education
     system, building a strong physical infrastructure for transportation and commerce, increasing investment
     by lowering capital gains taxes, creating special economic zones that allow for reduced tariffs, and
     investing in research and development.

 7. Public education, low investment taxes, funding for infrastructure projects, special economic zones
 8. A good way to think about this is how a runner who has fallen behind in a race feels psychologically and

     physically as he catches up. Playing catch-up can be more taxing than maintaining one's position at the
     head of the pack.
 9. a. No. Capital deepening refers to an increase in the amount of capital per person in an economy. A

           decrease in investment by firms will actually cause the opposite of capital deepening (since the
           population will grow over time).
      b. There is no direct connection between an increase in international trade and capital deepening. One
           could imagine particular scenarios where trade could lead to capital deepening (for example, if
           international capital inflows--which are the counterpart to increasing the trade deficit--lead to an
           increase in physical capital investment), but in general, no.
      c. Yes. Capital deepening refers to an increase in either physical capital or human capital per person.
           Continuing education or any time of lifelong learning adds to human capital and thus creates capital
           deepening.

10. The advantages of backwardness include faster growth rates because of the process of convergence, as
      well as the ability to adopt new technologies that were developed first in the "leader" countries. While

                                                                                                                                                                                       937

      being "backward" is not inherently a good thing, Gerschenkron stressed that there are certain advantages
      which aid countries trying to "catch up."
11. Capital deepening, by definition, should lead to diminished returns because you're investing more and
      more but using the same methods of production, leading to the marginal productivity declining. This is
      shown on a production function as a movement along the curve. Improvements in technology should not
      lead to diminished returns because you are finding new and more efficient ways of using the same
      amount of capital. This can be illustrated as a shift upward of the production function curve.
12. In high-income economies, diminishing returns to investments in physical and human capital may not
      apply because many high-income economies have developed economic and political institutions that
      provide a healthy economic climate for an ongoing stream of technological innovations. Continuous
      technological innovation can counterbalance diminishing returns to investments in human and physical
      capital. These two factors have the added effect of making additional technological advances even easier
      for these countries.
      As a result, productivity growth from new advances in technology will not increase at a diminishing rate
      or otherwise slow down because the new methods of production will be adopted relatively quickly and
      easily, at very low marginal cost.

Chapter 21

 1. The population is divided into those "in the labor force" and those "not in the labor force." Thus, the
     number of adults not in the labor force is 237.8 - 153.9 = 83.9 million. Since the labor force is divided into
     employed persons and unemployed persons, the number of unemployed persons is 153.9 - 139.1 = 14.8
     million. Thus, the adult population has the following proportions:
        · 139.1/237.8 = 58.5% employed persons
        · 14.8/237.8 = 6.2% unemployed persons
        · 83.9/237.8 = 35.3% persons out of the labor force

 2. The unemployment rate is defined as the number of unemployed persons as a percentage of the labor
     force or 14.8/153.9 = 9.6%. This is higher than the February 2015 unemployment rate, computed earlier,
     of 5.5%.

 3. Over the long term, the U.S. unemployment rate has remained basically the same level.
 4. a. Non-White people

      b. The young
      c. High school graduates

 5. Because of the influx of women into the labor market, the supply of labor shifts to the right. Since wages
     are sticky downward, the increased supply of labor causes an increase in people looking for jobs (Qs), but
     no change in the number of jobs available (Qe). As a result, unemployment increases by the amount of the
     increase in the labor supply. This can be seen in the following figure.
     Over time, as labor demand grows, the unemployment will decline and eventually wages will begin to
     increase again. But this increase in labor demand goes beyond the scope of this problem.
938

 6. The increase in labor supply was a social demographic trend--it was not caused by the economy falling
     into a recession. Therefore, the influx of women into the work force increased the natural rate of
     unemployment.

 7. New entrants to the labor force, whether from college or otherwise, are counted as frictionally unemployed
     until they find a job.

Chapter 22

 1. To compute the amount spent on each fruit in each year, you multiply the quantity of each fruit by the
     price.
        · 10 apples × 50 cents each = $5.00 spent on apples in 2001.
        · 12 bananas × 20 cents each = $2.40 spent on bananas in 2001.
        · 2 bunches of grapes at 65 cents each = $1.30 spent on grapes in 2001.
        · 1 pint of raspberries at $2 each = $2.00 spent on raspberries in 2001.
     Adding up the amounts gives you the total cost of the fruit basket. The total cost of the fruit basket in 2001
     was $5.00 + $2.40 + $1.30 + $2.00 = $10.70. The total costs for all the years are shown in the following
     table.
                                                          2001 2002 2003 2004
                                                         $10.70 $13.80 $15.35 $16.31

 2. If 2003 is the base year, then the index number has a value of 100 in 2003. To transform the cost of a fruit
     basket each year, we divide each year's value by $15.35, the value of the base year, and then multiply the
     result by 100. The price index is shown in the following table.
                                                            2001 2002 2003 2004
                                                            69.71 89.90 100.00 106.3

     Note that the base year has a value of 100; years before the base year have values less than 100; and years
     after have values more than 100.
 3. The inflation rate is calculated as the percentage change in the price index from year to year. For example,
     the inflation rate between 2001 and 2002 is (89.90 - 69.71) / 69.71 = 0.2137 = 28.96%. The inflation rates
     for all the years are shown in the last row of the following table, which includes the two previous answers.

4. Begin by calculating the total cost of buying the basket in each time period, as shown in the following table.

        Items Quantity (Time 1) Price (Time 1) Total Cost (Time 2) Price (Time 2) Total Cost

       Gifts       12        $50     $600            $60             $720

       Pizza       24        $15     $360            $16             $384

       Blouses 6             $60     $360            $50             $300

       Trips       2         $400    $800            $420            $840

       Total Cost                    $2,120                          $2,244

    The rise in cost of living is calculated as the percentage increase:
    (2244 - 2120) / 2120 = 0.0585 = 5.85%.
5. Since the CPI measures the prices of the goods and services purchased by the typical urban consumer, it
    measures the prices of things that people buy with their paycheck. For that reason, the CPI would be the
    best price index to use for this purpose.
6. The PPI is subject to those biases for essentially the same reasons as the CPI is. The GDP deflator picks up
    prices of what is actually purchased that year, so there are no biases. That is the advantage of using the
    GDP deflator over the CPI.
7. The calculator requires you to input three numbers:

      · The first year, in this case the year of your birth
      · The amount of money you would want to translate in terms of its purchasing power
      · The last year--now or the most recent year the calculator will accept

    My birth year is 1955. The amount is $1. The year 2012 is currently the latest year the calculator will
    accept. The simple purchasing power calculator shows that $1 of purchases in 1955 would cost $8.57 in
    2012. The website also explains how the true answer is more complicated than that shown by the simple
    purchasing power calculator.
8. The state government would benefit because it would repay the loan in less valuable dollars than it
    borrowed. Plus, tax revenues for the state government would increase because of the inflation.
940

 9. Higher inflation reduces real interest rates on fixed rate mortgages. Because ARMs can be adjusted, higher
     inflation leads to higher interest rates on ARMs.

10. Because the mortgage has an adjustable rate, the rate should fall by 3%, the same as inflation, to keep the
      real interest rate the same.

 1. The stock and bond values will not show up in the current account. However, the dividends from the stocks
     and the interest from the bonds show up as an import to income in the current account.

 2. It becomes more negative as imports, which are a negative to the current account, are growing faster than
     exports, which are a positive.

 3. a. Money flows out of the Mexican economy.
      b. Money flows into the Mexican economy.
      c. Money flows out of the Mexican economy.

 4. GDP is a dollar value of all production of goods and services. Exports are produced domestically but
     shipped abroad. The percent ratio of exports to GDP gives us an idea of how important exports are to the
     national economy out of all goods and services produced. For example, exports represent only 14% of U.S.
     GDP, but 50% of Germany's GDP

 5. Divide $542 billion by $1,800 billion.
 6. Divide -$400 billion by $16,800 billion.
 7. The trade balance is the difference between exports and imports. The current account balance includes

     this number (whether it is a trade balance or a trade surplus), but also includes international flows of
     money from global investments.
 8. a. An export sale to Germany involves a financial flow from Germany to the U.S. economy.
      b. The issue here is not U.S. investments in Brazil, but the return paid on those investments, which

           involves a financial flow from the Brazilian economy to the U.S. economy.
      c. Foreign aid from the United States to Egypt is a financial flow from the United States to Egypt.
      d. Importing oil from the Russian Federation means a flow of financial payments from the U.S. economy

           to the Russian Federation.
      e. Japanese investors buying U.S. real estate is a financial flow from Japan to the U.S. economy.

 9. The top portion tracks the flow of exports and imports and the payments for those. The bottom portion is
     looking at international financial investments and the outflow and inflow of monies from those
     investments. These investments can include investments in stocks and bonds or real estate abroad, as well
     as international borrowing and lending.

10. If more monies are flowing out of the country (for example, to pay for imports) it will make the current
      account more negative or less positive, and if more monies are flowing into the country, it will make the
      current account less negative or more positive.

11. Write out the national savings and investment identity for the situation of the economy implied by this
      question:

                                     

                                   

     If domestic savings increases and nothing else changes, then the trade deficit will fall. In effect, the
     economy would be relying more on domestic capital and less on foreign capital. If the government starts
     borrowing instead of saving, then the trade deficit must rise. In effect, the government is no longer
     providing savings and so, if nothing else is to change, more investment funds must arrive from abroad. If
     the rate of domestic investment surges, then, ceteris paribus, the trade deficit must also rise, to provide
     the extra capital. The ceteris paribus--or "other things being equal"--assumption is important here. In all

      of these situations, there is no reason to expect in the real world that the original change will affect only, or
      primarily, the trade deficit. The identity only says that something will adjust--it does not specify what.
12. The government is saving rather than borrowing. The supply of savings, whether private or public, is on
      the left side of the identity.
13. A trade deficit is determined by a country's level of private and public savings and the amount of domestic
      investment.
14. The trade deficit must increase. To put it another way, this increase in investment must be financed by an
      inflow of financial capital from abroad.
15. Incomes fall during a recession, and consumers buy fewer good, including imports.
16. A booming economy will increase the demand for goods in general, so import sales will increase. If our
      trading partners' economies are doing well, they will buy more of our products and so U.S. exports will
      increase.
17. a. Increased federal spending on Medicare may not increase productivity, so a budget deficit is not

            justified.
       b. Increased spending on education will increase productivity and foster greater economic growth, so a

            budget deficit is justified.
       c. Increased spending on the space program may not increase productivity, so a budget deficit is not

            justified.
       d. Increased spending on airports and air traffic control will increase productivity and foster greater

            economic growth, so a budget deficit is justified.

18. Foreign investors worried about repayment so they began to pull money out of these countries. The money
      can be pulled out of stock and bond markets, real estate, and banks.

19. A rapidly growing trade surplus could result from a number of factors, so you would not want to be too
      quick to assume a specific cause. However, if the choice is between whether the economy is in recession or
      growing rapidly, the answer would have to be recession. In a recession, demand for all goods, including
      imports, has declined; however, demand for exports from other countries has not necessarily altered
      much, so the result is a larger trade surplus.

20. Germany has a higher level of trade than the United States. The United States has a large domestic
      economy so it has a large volume of internal trade.

21. a. A large economy tends to have lower levels of international trade, because it can do more of its trade
            internally, but this has little impact on its trade imbalance.

       b. An imbalance between domestic physical investment and domestic saving (including government and
            private saving) will always lead to a trade imbalance, but has little to do with the level of trade.

       c. Many large trading partners nearby geographically increases the level of trade, but has little impact
            one way or the other on a trade imbalance.

       d. The answer here is not obvious. An especially large budget deficit means a large demand for financial
            capital which, according to the national saving and investment identity, makes it somewhat more
            likely that there will be a need for an inflow of foreign capital, which means a trade deficit.

       e. A strong tradition of discouraging trade certainly reduces the level of trade. However, it does not
            necessarily say much about the balance of trade, since this is determined by both imports and
            exports, and by national levels of physical investment and savings.

Chapter 24

 1. In order to supply goods, suppliers must employ workers, whose incomes increase as a result of their
     labor. They use this additional income to demand goods of an equivalent value to those they supply.

 2. When consumers demand more goods than are available on the market, prices are driven higher and the
     additional opportunities for profit induce more suppliers to enter the market, producing an equivalent
     amount to that which is demanded.
942

 3. Higher input prices make output less profitable, decreasing the desired supply. This is shown graphically
     as a leftward shift in the AS curve.

 4. Equilibrium occurs at the level of GDP where AD = AS. Insufficient aggregate demand could explain why
     the equilibrium occurs at a level of GDP less than potential. A decrease (or leftward shift) in aggregate
     supply could be another reason.

 5. Equilibrium real GDP will decrease and the price level will increase.
 6. Given the assumptions made here, the cuts in R&D funding should reduce productivity growth. The model

     would show this as a leftward shift in the SRAS curve, leading to a lower equilibrium GDP and a higher
     price level.
 7. An increase in the value of the stock market would make individuals feel wealthier and thus more
     confident about their economic situation. This would likely cause an increase in consumer confidence
     leading to an increase in consumer spending, shifting the AD curve to the right. The result would be an
     increase in the equilibrium level of GDP and an increase in the price level.
 8. Since imports depend on GDP, if Mexico goes into recession, its GDP declines and so do its imports. This
     decline in our exports can be shown as a leftward shift in AD, leading to a decrease in our GDP and price
     level.
 9. Tax cuts increase consumer and investment spending, depending on where the tax cuts are targeted. This
     would shift AD to the right, so if the tax cuts occurred when the economy was in recession (and GDP was
     less than potential), the tax cuts would increase GDP and "lead the economy out of recession."
10. A negative report on home prices would make consumers feel like the value of their homes, which for
      most Americans is a major portion of their wealth, has declined. A negative report on consumer
      confidence would make consumers feel pessimistic about the future. Both of these would likely reduce
      consumer spending, shifting AD to the left, reducing GDP and the price level. A positive report on the
      home price index or consumer confidence would do the opposite.
11. A smaller labor force would be reflected in a leftward shift in AS, leading to a lower equilibrium level of
      GDP and higher price level.
12. Higher EU growth would increase demand for U.S. exports, reducing our trade deficit. The increased
      demand for exports would show up as a rightward shift in AD, causing GDP to rise (and the price level to
      rise as well). Higher GDP would require more jobs to fulfill, so U.S. employment would also rise.
13. Expansionary monetary policy shifts AD to the right. A continuing expansionary policy would cause larger
      and larger shifts (given the parameters of this problem). The result would be an increase in GDP and
      employment (a decrease in unemployment) and higher prices until potential output was reached. After
      that point, the expansionary policy would simply cause inflation.
14. Since the SRAS curve is vertical in the neoclassical zone, unless the economy is bordering the
      intermediate zone, a decrease in AS will cause a decrease in the price level, but no effect on real economic
      activity (for example, real GDP or employment).
15. Because the SRAS curve is horizontal in the Keynesian zone, a decrease in AD should depress real
      economic activity but have no effect on prices.

Chapter 25

 1. a. An increase in home values will increase consumption spending (due to increased wealth). AD will
           shift to the right and may cause inflation if it goes beyond potential GDP.

      b. Rapid growth by a major trading partner will increase demand for exports. AD will shift to the right
           and may cause inflation if it goes beyond potential GDP.

      c. Increased profit opportunities will increase business investment. AD will shift to the right and may
           cause inflation if it goes beyond potential GDP.

      d. Higher interest rates reduce investment spending. AD will shift to the left and may cause recession if it
           falls below potential GDP.

      e. Demand for cheaper imports increases, reducing demand for domestic products. AD will shift to the

           left and may be recessionary.

 2. a. A tax increase on consumer income will cause consumption to fall, pushing the AD curve left, and is a
           possible solution to inflation.

      b. A surge in military spending is an increase in government spending. This will cause the AD curve to
           shift to the right. If real GDP is less than potential GDP, then this spending would pull the economy out
           of a recession. If real GDP is to the right of potential GDP, then the AD curve will shift farther to the
           right and military spending will be inflationary.

      c. A tax cut focused on business investment will shift AD to the right. If the original macroeconomic
           equilibrium is below potential GDP, then this policy can help move an economy out of a recession.

      d. Government spending on healthcare will cause the AD curve to shift to the right. If real GDP is less
           than potential GDP, then this spending would pull the economy out of a recession. If real GDP is to th
           right of potential GDP, then the AD curve will shift farther to the right and healthcare spending will be
           inflationary.

 3. An inflationary gap is the result of an increase in aggregate demand when the economy is at potential
     output. Since the AS curve is vertical at potential GDP, any increase in AD will lead to a higher price level
     (i.e. inflation) but no higher real GDP. This is easy to see if you draw AD1 to the right of AD0.

 4. A decrease in government spending will shift AD to the left.
 5. A decrease in energy prices, a positive supply shock, would cause the AS curve to shift out to the right,

     yielding more real GDP at a lower price level. This would shift the Phillips curve down toward the origin,
     meaning the economy would experience lower unemployment and a lower rate of inflation.
 6. Keynesian economics does not require microeconomic price controls of any sort. It is true that many
     Keynesian economic prescriptions were for the government to influence the total amount of aggregate
     demand in the economy, often through government spending and tax cuts.
 7. The three problems center on government's ability to estimate potential GDP, decide whether to influence
     aggregate demand through tax changes or changes in government spending, and the lag time that occurs
     as Congress and the President attempt to pass legislation.

Chapter 26

 1. No, this statement is false. It would be more accurate to say that rational expectations seek to predict the
     future as accurately as possible, using all of past experience as a guide. Adaptive expectations are largely
     backward looking; that is, they adapt as experience accumulates, but without attempting to look forward.

 2. An unemployment rate of zero percent is presumably well below the rate that is consistent with potential
     GDP and with the natural rate of unemployment. As a result, this policy would be attempting to push AD
     out to the right.
     In the short run, it is possible to have unemployment slightly below the natural rate for a time, at a price of
     higher inflation, as shown by the movement from E0 to E1 along the short-run AS curve. However, over
     time the extremely low unemployment rates will tend to cause wages to be bid up, and shift the short-run
     AS curve back to the left. The result would be a higher price level, but an economy still at potential GDP
     and the natural rate of unemployment, as determined by the long-run AS curve. If the government
     continues this policy, it will continually be pushing the price level higher and higher, but it will not be able
     to achieve its goal of zero percent unemployment, because that goal is inconsistent with market forces.

 3. The statement is accurate. Rational expectations can be thought of as a version of neoclassical economics
     because it argues that potential GDP and the rate of unemployment are shaped by market forces as wages
     and prices adjust. However, it is an "extreme" version because it argues that this adjustment takes place
     very quickly. Other theories, like adaptive expectations, suggest that adjustment to the neoclassical
     outcome takes a few years.

 4. The short-term Keynesian model is built on the importance of aggregate demand as a cause of business
     cycles and a degree of wage and price rigidity, and thus does a sound job of explaining many recessions
944

     and why cyclical unemployment rises and falls. The neoclassical model emphasizes aggregate supply by
     focusing on the underlying determinants of output and employment in markets, and thus tends to put
     more emphasis on economic growth and how labor markets work.

Chapter 27

 1. As long as you remain within the walls of the casino, chips fit the definition of money; that is, they serve as
     a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value. Chips do not work very well as money once
     you leave the casino, but many kinds of money do not work well in other areas. For example, it is hard to
     spend money from Turkey or Brazil at your local supermarket or at the movie theater.

 2. Many physical items that a person buys at one time but may sell at another time can serve as an answer to
     this question. Examples include a house, land, art, rare coins or stamps, and so on.

 3. The currency and checks in M1 are easiest to spend. It is harder to spend M2 directly, although if there is
     an automatic teller machine in the shopping mall, you can turn M2 from your savings account into an M1
     of currency quite quickly. If your answer is about "credit cards," then you are really talking about spending
     M1--although it is M1 from the account of the credit card company, which you will repay later when you
     credit card bill comes due.

 4. a. Neither in M1 or M2
      b. That is part of M1, and because M2 includes M1 it is also part of M2
      c. Currency out in the public hands is part of M1 and M2
      d. Checking deposits are in M1 and M2
      e. Money market accounts are in M2

 5. A bank's assets include cash held in their vaults, but assets also include monies that the bank holds at the
     Federal Reserve Bank (called "reserves"), loans that are made to customers, and bonds.

 6. a. A borrower who has been late on a number of loan payments looks perhaps less likely to repay the
           loan, or to repay it on time, and so you would want to pay less for that loan.

      b. If interest rates generally have risen, then this loan made at a time of relatively lower interest rates
           looks less attractive, and you would pay less for it.

      c. If the borrower is a firm with a record of high profits, then it is likely to be able to repay the loan, and
           you would be willing to pay more for the loan.

      d. If interest rates in the economy have fallen, then the loan is worth more.

Chapter 28

 1. Longer terms insulate the Board from political forces. Since the presidency can potentially change every
     four years, the Federal Reserve's independence prevents drastic swings in monetary policy with every new
     administration and allows policy decisions to be made only on economic grounds.

 2. Banks make their money from issuing loans and charging interest. The more money that is stored in the
     bank's vault, the less is available for lending and the less money the bank stands to make.

 3. The fear and uncertainty created by the suggestion that a bank might fail can lead depositors to withdraw
     their money. If many depositors do this at the same time, the bank may not be able to meet their demands
     and will, indeed, fail.

 4. The bank has to hold $1,000 in reserves, so when it buys the $500 in bonds, it will have to reduce its loans
     by $500 to make up the difference. The money supply decreases by the same amount.

 5. An increase in reserve requirements would reduce the supply of money, since more money would be held
     in banks rather than circulating in the economy.

 6. Contractionary policy reduces the amount of loanable funds in the economy. As with all goods, greater
     scarcity leads a greater price, so the interest rate, or the price of borrowing money, rises.

 7. An increase in the amount of available loanable funds means that there are more people who want to lend.
     They, therefore, bid the price of borrowing (the interest rate) down.

 8. In times of economic uncertainty, banks may worry that borrowers will lose the ability to repay their loans.
     They may also fear that a panic is more likely and they will need the excess reserves to meet their
     obligations.

 9. If consumer optimism changes, spending can speed up or slow down. This could also happen in a case
     where consumers need to buy a large number of items quickly, such as in a situation of national
     emergency.

Chapter 29

 1. a. The British use the pound sterling, while Germans use the euro, so a British exporter will receive
           euros from export sales, which will need to be exchanged for pounds. A stronger euro will mean more
           pounds per euro, so the exporter will be better off. In addition, the lower price for German imports will
           stimulate demand for British exports. For both these reasons, a stronger euro benefits the British
           exporter.

      b. The Dutch use euros while the Chileans use pesos, so the Dutch tourist needs to turn euros into
           Chilean pesos. An increase in the euro means that the tourist will get more pesos per euro. As a
           consequence, the Dutch tourist will have a less expensive vacation than he planned, so the tourist will
           be better off.

      c. The Greek use euros while the Canadians use dollars. An increase in the euro means it will buy more
           Canadian dollars. As a result, the Greek bank will see a decrease in the cost of the Canadian bonds, so
           it may purchase more bonds. Either way, the Greek bank benefits.

      d. Since both the French and Germans use the euro, an increase in the euro, in terms of other currencies,
           should have no impact on the French exporter.

 2. Expected depreciation in a currency will lead people to divest themselves of the currency. We should
     expect to see an increase in the supply of pounds and a decrease in demand for pounds. The result should
     be a decrease in the value of the pound vis à vis the dollar.

 3. Lower U.S. interest rates make U.S. assets less desirable compared to assets in the European Union. We
     should expect to see a decrease in demand for dollars and an increase in supply of dollars in foreign
     currency markets. As a result, we should expect to see the dollar depreciate compared to the euro.

 4. A decrease in Argentine inflation relative to other countries should cause an increase in demand for pesos,
     a decrease in supply of pesos, and an appreciation of the peso in foreign currency markets.

 5. The problem occurs when banks borrow foreign currency but lend in domestic currency. Since banks'
     assets (loans they made) are in domestic currency, while their debts (money they borrowed) are in foreign
     currency, when the domestic currency declines, their debts grow larger. If the domestic currency falls
     substantially in value, as happened during the Asian financial crisis, then the banking system could fail.
     This problem is unlikely to occur for U.S. banks because, even when they borrow from abroad, they tend to
     borrow dollars. Remember, there are trillions of dollars in circulation in the global economy. Since both
     assets and debts are in dollars, a change in the value of the dollar does not cause banking system failure
     the way it can when banks borrow in foreign currency.

 6. While capital flight is possible in either case, if a country borrows to invest in real capital it is more likely to
     be able to generate the income to pay back its debts than a country that borrows to finance consumption.
     As a result, an investment-stimulated economy is less likely to provoke capital flight and economic
     recession.

 7. A contractionary monetary policy, by driving up domestic interest rates, would cause the currency to
     appreciate. The higher value of the currency in foreign exchange markets would reduce exports, since
     from the perspective of foreign buyers, they are now more expensive. The higher value of the currency
     would similarly stimulate imports, since they would now be cheaper from the perspective of domestic
     buyers. Lower exports and higher imports cause net exports (EX - IM) to fall, which causes aggregate
     demand to fall. The result would be a decrease in GDP working through the exchange rate mechanism
     reinforcing the effect contractionary monetary policy has on domestic investment expenditure. However,
946

     cheaper imports would stimulate aggregate supply, bringing GDP back to potential, though at a lower price
     level.
 8. For a currency to fall, a central bank need only supply more of its currency in foreign exchange markets. It
     can print as much domestic currency as it likes. For a currency to rise, a central bank needs to buy its
     currency in foreign exchange markets, paying with foreign currency. Since no central bank has an infinite
     amount of foreign currency reserves, it cannot buy its currency indefinitely.
 9. Variations in exchange rates, because they change import and export prices, disturb international trade
     flows. When trade is a large part of a nation's economic activity, government will find it more advantageous
     to fix exchange rates to minimize disruptions of trade flows.

Chapter 30

 1. The government borrows funds by selling Treasury bonds, notes, and bills.
 2. The funds can be used to pay down the national debt or else be refunded to the taxpayers.
 3. Yes, a nation can run budget deficits and see its debt/GDP ratio fall. In fact, this is not uncommon. If the

     deficit is small in a given year, than the addition to debt in the numerator of the debt/GDP ratio will be
     relatively small, while the growth in GDP is larger, and so the debt/GDP ratio declines. This was the
     experience of the U.S. economy for the period from the end of World War II to about 1980. It is also
     theoretically possible, although not likely, for a nation to have a budget surplus and see its debt/GDP ratio
     rise. Imagine the case of a nation with a small surplus, but in a recession year when the economy shrinks.
     It is possible that the decline in the nation's debt, in the numerator of the debt/GDP ratio, would be
     proportionally less than the fall in the size of GDP, so the debt/GDP ratio would rise.
 4. Progressive. People who give larger gifts subject to the higher tax rate would typically have larger incomes
     as well.
 5. Corporate income tax on his profits, individual income tax on his salary, and payroll tax taken out of the
     wages he pays himself.
 6. individual income taxes
 7. The tax is regressive because wealthy income earners are not taxed at all on income above $113,000. As a
     percent of total income, the social security tax hits lower income earners harder than wealthier
     individuals.
 8. As debt increases, interest payments also rise, so that the deficit grows even if we keep other government
     spending constant.
 9. a. As a share of GDP, this is false. In nominal dollars, it is true.
      b. False.
      c. False.
      d. False. Education spending is much higher at the state level.
      e. False. As a share of GDP, it is up about 50.

       f. As a share of GDP, this is false, and in real dollars, it is also false.
      g. False.
      h. False; it's about 1%.
       i. False. Although budget deficits were large in 2003 and 2004, and continued into the later 2000s, the

           federal government ran budget surpluses from 1998-2001.
       j. False.

10. To keep prices from rising too much or too rapidly.

12. It falls below because less tax revenue than expected is collected.
13. Automatic stabilizers take effect very quickly, whereas discretionary policy can take a long time to

      implement.
14. In a recession, because of the decline in economic output, less income is earned, and so less in taxes is

      automatically collected. Many welfare and unemployment programs are designed so that those who fall

      into certain categories, like "unemployed" or "low income," are eligible for benefits. During a recession,
      more people fall into these categories and become eligible for benefits automatically. The combination of
      reduced taxes and higher spending is just what is needed for an economy in recession producing below
      potential GDP. With an economic boom, average income levels rise in the economy, so more in taxes is
      automatically collected. Fewer people meet the criteria for receiving government assistance to the
      unemployed or the needy, so government spending on unemployment assistance and welfare falls
      automatically. This combination of higher taxes and lower spending is just what is needed if an economy
      is producing above its potential GDP.
15. Prices would be pushed up as a result of too much spending.
16. Employment would suffer as a result of too little spending.
17. Monetary policy probably has shorter time lags than fiscal policy. Imagine that the data becomes fairly
      clear that an economy is in or near a recession. Expansionary monetary policy can be carried out through
      open market operations, which can be done fairly quickly, since the Federal Reserve's Open Market
      Committee meets six times a year. Also, monetary policy takes effect through interest rates, which can
      change fairly quickly. However, fiscal policy is carried out through acts of Congress that need to be signed
      into law by the president. Negotiating such laws often takes months, and even after the laws are
      negotiated, it takes more months for spending programs or tax cuts to have an effect on the
      macroeconomy.
18. The government would have to make up the revenue either by raising taxes in a different area or cutting
      spending.
19. Programs where the amount of spending is not fixed, but rather determined by macroeconomic
      conditions, such as food stamps, would lose a great deal of flexibility if spending increases had to be met
      by corresponding tax increases or spending cuts.

 1. We use the national savings and investment identity to solve this question. In this case, the government
     has a budget surplus, so the government surplus appears as part of the supply of financial capital. Then:

 2. a. Since the government has a budget surplus, the government budget term appears with the supply of
           capital. The following shows the national savings and investment identity for this economy.

      b. Plugging the given values into the identity shown in part (a), we find that (X - M) = 0.
      c. Since the government has a budget deficit, the government budget term appears with the demand for

           capital. You do not know in advance whether the economy has a trade deficit or a trade surplus. But
           when you see that the quantity demanded of financial capital exceeds the quantity supplied, you know
           that there must be an additional quantity of financial capital supplied by foreign investors, which
           means a trade deficit of 2000. This example shows that in this case there is a higher budget deficit,
           and a higher trade deficit.

 3. In this case, the national saving and investment identity is written in this way:
948

    The increase in the government budget surplus and the increase in the trade deficit both increased the
    supply of financial capital. If investment in physical capital remained unchanged, then private savings
    must go down, and if savings remained unchanged, then investment must go up. In fact, both effects
    happened; that is, in the late 1990s, in the U.S. economy, savings declined and investment rose.
4. Ricardian equivalence means that private saving changes to offset exactly any changes in the government
    budget. So, if the deficit increases by 20, private saving increases by 20 as well, and the trade deficit and
    the budget deficit will not change from their original levels. The original national saving and investment
    identity is written below. Notice that if any change in the (G - T) term is offset by a change in the S term,
    then the other terms do not change. So if (G - T) rises by 20, then S must also increase by 20.

 5. In the last few decades, spending per student has climbed substantially. However, test scores have fallen
     over this time. This experience has led a number of experts to argue that the problem is not resources--or
     is not just resources by itself--but is also a problem of how schools are organized and managed and what
     incentives they have for success. There are a number of proposals to alter the incentives that schools face,
     but relatively little hard evidence on what proposals work well. Without trying to evaluate whether these
     proposals are good or bad ideas, you can just list some of them: testing students regularly; rewarding
     teachers or schools that perform well on such tests; requiring additional teacher training; allowing
     students to choose between public schools; allowing teachers and parents to start new schools; giving
     student "vouchers" that they can use to pay tuition at either public or private schools.

 6. The government can direct government spending to R&D. It can also create tax incentives for business to
     invest in R&D.

 1. The answers are shown in the following two tables.

Middle East and North Africa $4,535

Sub-Saharan Africa                      $6,847

    East Asia appears to be the largest economy on GDP basis, but on a per capita basis it drops to third, after
    Europe and Central Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.
2. A region can have some of high-income countries and some of the low-income countries. Aggregating per
    capita real GDP will vary widely across countries within a region, so aggregating data for a region has little
    meaning. For example, if you were to compare per capital real GDP for the United States, Canada, Haiti,
    and Honduras, it looks much different than if you looked at the same data for North America as a whole.
    Thus, regional comparisons are broad-based and may not adequately capture an individual country's
    economic attributes.
3. The following table provides a summary of possible answers.

4. Low-income countries must adopt government policies that are market-oriented and that educate the
    workforce and population. After this is done, low-income countries should focus on eradicating other
    social ills that inhibit their growth. The economically challenged are stuck in poverty traps. They need to
    focus more on health and education and create a stable macroeconomic and political environment. This
    will attract foreign aid and foreign investment. Middle-income countries strive for increases in physical
    capital and innovation, while higher-income countries must work to maintain their economies through
    innovation and technology.
950

 5. If there is a recession and unemployment increases, we can call on an expansionary fiscal policy (lower
     taxes or increased government spending) or an expansionary monetary policy (increase the money supply
     and lower interest rates). Both policies stimulate output and decrease unemployment.

 6. Aside from a high natural rate of unemployment due to government regulations, subsistence households
     may be counted as not working.

 7. Indexing wage contracts means wages rise when prices rise. This means what you can buy with your
     wages, your standard of living, remains the same. When wages are not indexed, or rise with inflation, your
     standard of living falls.

 8. An increase in government spending shifts the AD curve to the right, raising both income and price levels.
 9. A decrease in the money supply will shift the AD curve leftward and reduce income and price levels. Banks

     will have less money to lend. Interest rates will increase, affecting consumption and investment, which are
     both key determinants of aggregate demand.
10. Given the high level of activity in international financial markets, it is typically believed that financial
      flows across borders are the real reason for trade imbalances. For example, the United States had an
      enormous trade deficit in the late 1990s and early 2000s because it was attracting vast inflows of foreign
      capital. Smaller countries that have attracted such inflows of international capital worry that if the inflows
      suddenly turn to outflows, the resulting decline in their currency could collapse their banking system and
      bring on a deep recession.
11. The demand for the country's currency would decrease, lowering the exchange rate.

Chapter 33

 1. False. Anything that leads to different levels of productivity between two economies can be a source of
     comparative advantage. For example, the education of workers, the knowledge base of engineers and
     scientists in a country, the part of a split-up value chain where they have their specialized learning,
     economies of scale, and other factors can all determine comparative advantage.

 2. Brazil has the absolute advantage in producing beef and the United States has the absolute advantage in
     autos. The opportunity cost of producing one pound of beef is 1/10 of an auto; in the United States it is 3/4
     of an auto.

 3. In answering questions like these, it is often helpful to begin by organizing the information in a table, such
     as in the following table. Notice that, in this case, the productivity of the countries is expressed in terms of
     how many workers it takes to produce a unit of a product.

                                 Country One Sweater One Bottle of wine

                                 France 1 worker    1 worker

                                 Tunisia 2 workers  3 workers

    In this example, France has an absolute advantage in the production of both sweaters and wine. You can
    tell because it takes France less labor to produce a unit of the good.
4. a. In Germany, it takes fewer workers to make either a television or a video camera. Germany has an

          absolute advantage in the production of both goods.
     b. Producing an additional television in Germany requires three workers. Shifting those three German

          workers will reduce video camera production by 3/4 of a camera. Producing an additional television
          set in Poland requires six workers, and shifting those workers from the other good reduces output of
          video cameras by 6/12 of a camera, or 1/2. Thus, the opportunity cost of producing televisions is lower
          in Poland, so Poland has the comparative advantage in the production of televisions. Note: Do not let
          the fractions like 3/4 of a camera or 1/2 of a video camera bother you. If either country was to expand
          television production by a significant amount--that is, lots more than one unit--then we will be talking

Access for free at openstax.org
                                                                                                                                                                                      951

          about whole cameras and not fractional ones. You can also spot this conclusion by noticing that
          Poland's absolute disadvantage is relatively lower in televisions, because Poland needs twice as many
          workers to produce a television but three times as many to produce a video camera, so the product
          with the relatively lower absolute disadvantage is Poland's comparative advantage.
     c. Producing a video camera in Germany requires four workers, and shifting those four workers away
          from television production has an opportunity cost of 4/3 television sets. Producing a video camera in
          Poland requires 12 workers, and shifting those 12 workers away from television production has an
          opportunity cost of two television sets. Thus, the opportunity cost of producing video cameras is lower
          in Germany, and video cameras will be Germany's comparative advantage.
     d. In this example, absolute advantage differs from comparative advantage. Germany has the absolute
          advantage in the production of both goods, but Poland has a comparative advantage in the production
          of televisions.
     e. Germany should specialize, at least to some extent, in the production of video cameras, export video
          cameras, and import televisions. Conversely, Poland should specialize, at least to some extent, in the
          production of televisions, export televisions, and import video cameras.
5. There are a number of possible advantages of intra-industry trade. Both nations can take advantage of
    extreme specialization and learning in certain kinds of cars with certain traits, like gas-efficient cars,
    luxury cars, sport-utility vehicles, higher- and lower-quality cars, and so on. Moreover, nations can take
    advantage of economies of scale, so that large companies will compete against each other across
    international borders, providing the benefits of competition and variety to customers. This same argument
    applies to trade between U.S. states, where people often buy products made by people of other states, even
    though a similar product is made within the boundaries of their own state. All states--and all
    countries--can benefit from this kind of competition and trade.
6. a. Start by plotting the points on a sketch diagram and then drawing a line through them. The following
          figure illustrates the average costs of production of semiconductors.

          The curve illustrates economies of scale by showing that as the scale increases--that is, as production
          at this particular factory goes up--the average cost of production declines. The economies of scale
          exist up to an output of 40,000 semiconductors; at higher outputs, the average cost of production does
          not seem to decline any further.
     b. At any quantity demanded above 40,000, this economy can take full advantage of economies of scale;
          that is, it can produce at the lowest cost per unit. Indeed, if the quantity demanded was quite high, like
          500,000, then there could be a number of different factories all taking full advantage of economies of
          scale and competing with each other. If the quantity demanded falls below 40,000, then the economy
952

           by itself, without foreign trade, cannot take full advantage of economies of scale.
      c. The simplest answer to this question is that the small country could have a large enough factory to

           take full advantage of economies of scale, but then export most of the output. For semiconductors,
           countries like Taiwan and Korea have recently fit this description. Moreover, this country could also
           import semiconductors from other countries which also have large factories, thus getting the benefits
           of competition and variety. A slightly more complex answer is that the country can get these benefits
           of economies of scale without producing semiconductors, but simply by buying semiconductors made
           at low cost around the world. An economy, especially a smaller country, may well end up specializing
           and producing a few items on a large scale, but then trading those items for other items produced on a
           large scale, and thus gaining the benefits of economies of scale by trade, as well as by direct
           production.

 7. A nation might restrict trade on imported products to protect an industry that is important for national
     security. For example, nation X and nation Y may be geopolitical rivals, each with ambitions of increased
     political and economic strength. Even if nation Y has comparative advantage in the production of missile
     defense systems, it is unlikely that nation Y would seek to export those goods to nation X. It is also the case
     that, for some nations, the production of a particular good is a key component of national identity. In
     Japan, the production of rice is culturally very important. It may be difficult for Japan to import rice from a
     nation like Vietnam, even if Vietnam has a comparative advantage in rice production.

Chapter 34

 1. This is the opposite case of the Work It Out feature. A reduced tariff is like a decrease in the cost of
     production, which is shown by a downward (or rightward) shift in the supply curve.

 2. A subsidy is like a reduction in cost. This shifts the supply curve down (or to the right), driving the price of
     sugar down. If the subsidy is large enough, the price of sugar can fall below the cost of production faced by
     foreign producers, which means they will lose money on any sugar they produce and sell.

 3. Trade barriers raise the price of goods in protected industries. If those products are inputs in other
     industries, it raises their production costs and then prices, so sales fall in those other industries. Lower
     sales lead to lower employment. Additionally, if the protected industries are consumer goods, their
     customers pay higher prices, which reduce demand for other consumer products and thus employment in
     those industries.

 4. Trade based on comparative advantage raises the average wage rate economy-wide, though it can reduce
     the incomes of import-substituting industries. By moving away from a country's comparative advantage,
     trade barriers do the opposite: they give workers in protected industries an advantage, while reducing the
     average wage economy-wide.

 5. By raising incomes, trade tends to raise working conditions also, even though those conditions may not
     (yet) be equivalent to those in high-income countries.

 6. They typically pay more than the next-best alternative. If a Nike firm did not pay workers at least as much
     as they would earn, for example, in a subsistence rural lifestyle, they many never come to work for Nike.

 7. Since trade barriers raise prices, real incomes fall. The average worker would also earn less.
 8. Workers working in other sectors and the protected sector see a decrease in their real wage.
 9. If imports can be sold at extremely low prices, domestic firms would have to match those prices to be

     competitive. By definition, matching prices would imply selling under cost and, therefore, losing money.
     Firms cannot sustain losses forever. When they leave the industry, importers can "take over," raising
     prices to monopoly levels to cover their short-term losses and earn long-term profits.
10. Because low-income countries need to provide necessities--food, clothing, and shelter--to their people. In
      other words, they consider environmental quality a luxury.
11. Low-income countries can compete for jobs by reducing their environmental standards to attract
      business to their countries. This could lead to a competitive reduction in regulations, which would lead to
      greater environmental damage. While pollution management is a cost for businesses, it is tiny relative to

                                                                                                                                                                                       953

      other costs, like labor and adequate infrastructure. It is also costly for firms to locate far away from their
      customers, which many low-income countries are.
12. The decision should not be arbitrary or unnecessarily discriminatory. It should treat foreign companies
      the same way as domestic companies. It should be based on science.
13. Restricting imports today does not solve the problem. If anything, it makes it worse since it implies using
      up domestic sources of the products faster than if they are imported. Also, the national security argument
      can be used to support protection of nearly any product, not just things critical to our national security.
14. The effect of increasing standards may increase costs to the small exporting country. The supply curve of
      toys will shift to the left. Exports will decrease and toy prices will rise. Tariffs also raise prices. So the effect
      on the price of toys is the same. A tariff is a "second best" policy and also affects other sectors. However, a
      common standard across countries is a "first best" policy that attacks the problem at its root.
15. A free trade association offers free trade between its members, but each country can determine its own
      trade policy outside the association. A common market requires a common external trade policy in
      addition to free trade within the group. An economic union is a common market with coordinated fiscal
      and monetary policy.
16. International agreements can serve as a political counterweight to domestic special interests, thereby
      preventing stronger protectionist measures.
17. Reductions in tariffs, quotas, and other trade barriers, improved transportation, and communication
      media have made people more aware of what is available in the rest of the world.
18. Competition from firms with better or cheaper products can reduce a business's profits, and may drive it
      out of business. Workers would similarly lose income or even their jobs.
19. Consumers get better or less expensive products. Businesses with the better or cheaper products increase
      their profits. Employees of those businesses earn more income. On balance, the gains outweigh the losses
      to a nation.
