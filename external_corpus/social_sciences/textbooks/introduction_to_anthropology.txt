What Is Anthropology?

always played a role in hunting game. (credit: "Illustration of activities of Lapps and Finns: Men and women hunting

1.3 Overcoming Ethnocentrism

INTRODUCTION Imagine a research project that contains these three members:
Randy Haas discovered the 9,000-year-old grave of a teenager buried with a hunting tool kit in the Andes
mountains of Peru. Haas found that this hunter from long ago was a young woman. This discovery has upset
the notion that hunting was the exclusive activity of men throughout human evolutionary history.
Daniel Miller is part of a global team researching how people use smartphones in various parts of the world,
including Brazil, Cameroon, Chile, China, Ireland, Italy, Japan, East Jerusalem, and Uganda. The team is
exploring how smartphones take on different functions in different cultural contexts. Focusing on Ireland,
8  1 · What Is Anthropology?

   Miller theorizes that smartphones become a kind of personal avatar, expressing and enacting the specific
   social identity of the user.

   FIGURE 1.2 Red-tailed monkeys, the subject of anthropologist Michelle Brown's study, are primates that are found
   in Central and East Africa. This red-tailed monkey lives in Uganda. They are social animals and live in groups of 8-30
   individuals. (credit: "Schmidt's Red-tailed Monkey" by Mehgan Murphy/Smithsonian's National Zoo, CC0 1.0)

   Michelle Brown spends long days observing blue monkeys, red-tailed monkeys, and baboons in a conservation
   park in Uganda. She records the behavior of these primates as they find food, communicate, and fight with one
   another. She collects urine and feces to analyze hormone levels, intestinal parasites, and DNA. She wants to
   understand how primates compete as individuals and groups for access to various foods in their environment.

   What kind of research project could encompass such a diversity of topics and methods? Since this is the first
   chapter of an anthropology textbook, you can probably guess. Though they conduct research on vastly
   different topics, all three are anthropologists. How could the work of these researchers be united in one
   academic discipline? The reason, as we will see, is that anthropology is vast.

   Anthropology, the study of humanity, is guided by a central narrative and set of research commitments.
   Anthropology aims to overcome bias by examining cultures as complex, integrated products of specific
   environmental and historical conditions. Anthropologists use many different research strategies in their
   efforts to represent people from cultures very different from their own.

   Anthropology explores controversial topics that may challenge individual assumptions and values. The goal is
   to understand the full experience of humanity, including elements that may seem unfamiliar or
   uncomfortable. Anthropology teaches a set of skills for setting aside personal perspectives and keeping an
   open mind while learning about the diversity of human practices and ideas. As discussed further at the end of
   this chapter, this does not mean abandoning individual personal values, but rather suspending judgment
   temporarily while learning to understand the perspectives of others.

   1.1 The Study of Humanity, or "Anthropology Is Vast"

   LEARNING OUTCOMES

   By the end of this section, you will be able to:

   Anthropology is a vast field of study--so vast, in fact, that anthropology is interested in everything.
   Anthropology is unique in its enormous breadth and its distinctive focus. Consider other disciplines. In the
   arts and sciences, each discipline focuses on a discrete field of social life or physical phenomena. Economists
   study economics. Religious scholars study religion. Environmental scientists study the environment.

Biologists study living organisms. And so on.

Anthropologists study all of these things. Put simply, anthropology is the study of humanity across time and
space. Anthropologists study every possible realm of human experience, thought, activity, and organization.
Human as we are, we can only engage in social and natural worlds through our human minds and human
bodies. Even engagement with nonhuman realms such as astronomy and botany is conditioned by our human
senses and human cognition and thus varies across different societies and different time periods.

You may be thinking, If anthropology is the human aspect of absolutely everything, then does anthropology
encompass the other social disciplines, such as political science, religious studies, and economics? This is not
the case. Certainly, anthropologists are frequently multidisciplinary, meaning that while their research and
teaching are focused within the discipline of anthropology, they also engage with other disciplines and work
with researchers and teachers in other fields. But the way that scholars in the other social disciplines approach
their subject matter is different from the way anthropologists approach those same subjects.

The distinctive approach of anthropology relies on a central narrative, or story, about humanity as well as a set
of scholarly commitments. This central story and these common commitments hold the discipline together,
enabling anthropologists to combine insights from diverse fields into one complex portrait of what it means to
be human.

Anthropology is everything, but it's not just anything. Anthropology is the study of humanity guided by a
distinctive narrative and set of commitments.

The Heart of Anthropology: Central Narrative and Commitments

Anthropologists are great storytellers. They tell many, many stories about all aspects of human life. At the
heart of all of these stories is one fundamental story: the "story of humanity," a rich and complex narrative. A
narrative is a story that describes a connected set of features and events. Narratives can be fictional or
nonfictional. The narrative of anthropology is a true story, a factual narrative about the origins and
development of humanity as well as our contemporary ways of life. The central narrative of anthropology can
be summarized this way.

Human beings have developed flexible biological and social features that have worked together in a wide
variety of environmental and historical conditions to produce a diversity of cultures.

Three features of this narrative are especially important to anthropologists. These features form three central
commitments of anthropology. In academic study, a commitment is a common goal recognized by the scholars
in a discipline.

Central Commitment #1: Exploring Sociocultural Diversity

As the narrative suggests, humans in a diversity of conditions create a diversity of cultures. Rather than trying
to find out which way of life is better, morally superior, more efficient, or happier or to make any other sort of
judgment call, anthropologists are committed to describing and understanding the diversity of human ways of
life. Setting aside judgments, we can see that humans everywhere create culture to meet their needs.
Anthropologists discover how different cultures devise different solutions to the challenges of human survival,
social integration, and the search for meaning.

What are you wearing today? Perhaps a T-shirt and jeans with sneakers, or a tunic and leggings with flip-flops.
What about your professor? Are they wearing a bathrobe and slippers, or perhaps a cocktail dress with
stilettos? You can be (almost) certain that will never happen. But why not? You might assume that what
Americans wear for class is completely normal, but this assumption ignores the question of what makes
something "normal."
10  1 · What Is Anthropology?

    FIGURE 1.3 Ghanaian professionals wearing local fashions to promote the national textile industry. (credit:
    "Ghanaian Ladies" by Erik (HASH) Hersman/flickr, CC BY 2.0)
    In many countries, for instance, university students typically wear dress shirts with slacks or skirts to class.
    Many Ghanaian students would not dream of wearing ripped jeans or tight leggings to class, considering such
    casual dress disrespectful. American students put much more emphasis on comfort than on presentation, an
    overall trend in American dress. Even in office settings, it is now acceptable for Americans to wear casual
    clothing on Fridays. In the West African country of Ghana, "casual Friday" never caught on, but office workers
    have developed their own distinctive Friday dress code. As the local textile industry became threatened by
    Chinese imports, Ghanaian office workers began wearing outfits sewn from locally manufactured cloth on
    Fridays, creating a practice of "National Friday Wear."
    So which way is better, the American way or the Ghanaian way? Anthropologists understand that neither way is
    better and that each addresses a need within a particular culture. Casual Friday is great for Americans who
    crave comfy leisurewear, while National Friday Wear is great for Ghanaians who want to boost their local
    economy and show their cultural pride.
    Anthropologists recognize not only diversity across different cultures but also the diverse experiences and
    perspectives within a culture. Do you ever buy used clothing at thrift shops, or do you know people who do? An
    old green men's trench coat bought at a vintage clothing store may be a favorite of a college student. The
    mother of that student may not feel the same way and offer to buy their child a new coat much to the distress of
    the owner of the coat! To people who have grown up in the 1930's and 1940's, used clothing was associated
    with the hard times of the Great Depression. For the newer generations, used clothing is a way to find unique,
    affordable clothing that can stretch the boundaries of mainstream style. Although people in a culture share a
    general set of rules, they interpret them differently according to their social roles and experiences, sometimes
    stretching the rules in ways that ultimately change them over time.

FIGURE 1.4 Ghanaian trader in her secondhand clothing shop (credit: "Market Woman - Kejetia Market - Kumasi -
Ghana - 03" by Adam Jones/flickr, CC BY 2.0)

In Ghana, most used clothing is imported from the United States and Europe in large bales that local vendors
purchase and sell in market stalls. A person from the United States or Europe is locally referred to as an
obruni. Used clothing is called obruni wawu, or "a foreign person has died," reflecting the assumption that no
living person would give away such wearable clothing. Many Ghanaians love to pick through the piles of obruni
wawu in the market, thrilled to find recognizable brands and unusual styles. Some, however, associate obruni
wawu with poverty. The stalls that sell obruni wawu are often called "bend-over boutiques," referring to the
subservient posture adopted by customers rifling through the piles of clothing on the ground. Obruni wawu is
suitable in some situations but certainly not in others. A particular Ghanaian movie included a scene where a
man trying to woo a much younger woman. When the man gave his would be girlfriend a bag full of obruni
wawu as a gift, it caused the audience to burst our laughing. The gift was humorous and inappropriate to the
audience.

As with clothing, different cultures come up with different solutions to common challenges such as housing,
food, family structure, the organization of work, and finding meaning in life. And people in every society
discuss and argue about their own cultural norms. Anthropology seeks to document and understand the
diverse range of solutions to common human challenges as well as the diversity of conflicting perspectives
within each culture.

Central Commitment #2: Understanding How Societies Hold Together

Just as the various parts of our bodies all work together (the brain, the heart, the liver, the skeleton, and so
forth), the various parts of a society all work together as well (the economy, the political system, religion,
families, etc.). Frequently, anthropologists discover that changes in one realm of society are related to changes
in another realm in unexpected ways. When farmers in Ghana began growing cocoa for export during the
colonial period, the agricultural shift dramatically altered gender relations as men monopolized cash crops
and women were relegated to vegetable farming for their families' consumption and local trade. As men
benefited from the profits of the cocoa trade, relations between men and women became more unequal.

Anthropologists have a favorite word for the way that all elements of human life interrelate to form distinctive
12  1 · What Is Anthropology?

    cultures: holism. Sometimes those parts reinforce one another, encouraging stability; sometimes they
    contradict one another, promoting change. Consider the caste system in India. Cultural anthropologist Susan
    Bayly describes how the beliefs and practices associated with caste in India have provided cultural integration
    and stability while also demonstrating a great deal of local variability and working as a force of social change
    (1999). Most Indians are familiar with two forms of belonging assigned by birth, the jati (birth group) and the
    varna (order, class, or kind). There are thousands of birth groups in the various regions of India, many specific
    to a single region. By contrast, there are four varnas known across India: Brahmins (associated with priests),
    Kshatriyas (associated with rulers and warriors), Vaishyas (associated with traders), and Shudras (associated
    with servile laborers). Another group, called "untouchables" or dalits, are outside the scheme of varnas.

    As described in the Vedas, the four varnas are ordered in an interdependent hierarchy reminiscent of human
    anatomy. The Rig Veda describes how the gods sacrificed the first man, Purusa, dividing his body to create four
    groups of humanity:

          When they divided the Purusa, into how many parts did they arrange him? What was his mouth? What
         his two arms? What are his thighs [loins] and feet called? The brahmin was his mouth, his two arms
         were made the rajanya [kshatriya, king and warrior], his two thighs [loins] the vaisya, from his feet the
         sudra [servile class] was born. (Bayle, 1999)

    Ancient texts envision caste as a means of social order as people in each caste perform different functions and
    occupations, all working together in harmony. Note, however, that such texts were written down by members of
    upper-caste groups, often Brahmin scholars. Anthropologists and historians who study the practices of caste
    argue that the caste system was never such a unitary and dominant force across the country but rather a
    flexible, regional, and constantly changing set of identities. In the colonial period, the British made the caste
    system more rigid and antagonistic, offering education and jobs to select caste groups. In the 20th century,
    many lower-caste groups have resisted their oppression by converting to Christianity or Islam and forming
    political parties to pressure the government for more opportunities for social advancement.

    Anthropologists are curious about how different cultures create different categories of people and use those
    categories to organize the activities of social life. In many farming societies, for instance, men do certain kinds
    of agricultural work and women do others. In societies where land must be cleared in order to sow crops, men
    often chop down trees and clear the brush while women do the planting. In societies that utilize large-scale
    industrial farming, migrants or people of a specific ethnicity or assigned racial category are often recruited (or
    forced) to perform the manual labor required to grow and harvest crops. In industrial capitalist societies, one
    group of people owns the factories and another group works the machines that produce the industrial
    products. Relations between groups can be cooperative, competitive, or combative. Some cultures promote the
    equality of social groups, while many others reinforce inequality among groups. Holism is not the same as
    harmony. Anthropologists are interested in how society holds together but also in the conditions that can
    cause conflict, change, and disintegration.

    You may have heard the word polarized used to describe the sense that two different groups in American
    society are moving farther and farther apart in their values, opinions, and desires. Some suggest that the
    contradictory perspectives of these two groups threaten to tear American society apart. Others suggest that
    Americans are united by deeper values such as freedom, equal opportunity, and democracy. Using holism to
    understand this issue, an anthropologist might consider how the perspectives of each group relate to that
    group's economic experiences, political convictions, and/or religious or moral values. A comprehensive use of
    holism would explore all of these aspects of society, looking at how they interact to produce the polarization we
    see today and suggesting what might be done to bring the two groups into productive dialogue.

    Central Commitment #3: Examining the Interdependence of Humans and Nature

    As our narrative suggests, anthropologists are interested in the natural environment, the way humans have
    related to the natural world over time, and how this relationship shapes various cultures. Anthropologists
    consider how people in different cultures understand and use the various elements of nature, including land,
    water, plants, animals, climate, and space. They show how people interact with these elements of nature in
    complex ways.

Archaeologists working in prehistoric sites all over the world have documented how prehistoric people
understood celestial objects and used them to navigate their waterways, create calendars and clocks, regulate
farming activities, schedule religious ceremonies, and inform political leaders. This area of study is called
archaeoastronomy. In Chaco Canyon in the American Southwest, archaeologists have discovered that
buildings in the major settlement areas were aligned so that certain windows would provide perfect vantage
points to view the sun and moon at pivotal times of the year, such as solstice and equinox. The Sun Dagger,
consisting of two whorl-shaped petroglyphs (stone etchings) on Fajada Butte, is precisely positioned under a
rock crevice so as to indicate the solstices and equinoxes when the sun shines through the crevice.
Unfortunately, tourist foot traffic at the site has altered the width and direction of the crevice so that the Sun
Dagger no longer marks these celestial events accurately.

 FIGURE 1.5 The Sun Dagger at Fajada Butte (credit: National Park Service/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)

The people of Chaco Canyon may have been particularly attuned to the features of their environment as they
constructed their complex civilization in the challenging environment of the high desert. With scarce rainfall
and brief growing seasons, their survival depended on accurate identification of opportune planting and
harvesting times. With the onset of a 50-year drought, farming became more and more precarious. Eventually,
the ancient peoples of Chaco were forced to abandon the area.

Some anthropologists study how people interact with the plants in their area. The field of ethnobotany
examines how people in different cultures categorize and use plants for food, shelter, tools, transportation, art,
and religion. Ethnobotanists also conduct research on plants used in healing to discover the relationship
between cultural practices and the pharmaceutical properties of these plants. Some examine the cultural use
of psychoactive plants such as mushrooms and peyote in religious ritual. For instance, anthropologist Jamon
Halvaksz studied the controversial use of marijuana among youth in New Guinea (2006). Young people told
Halvaksz that marijuana helped them work harder, overcome shame, and understand ancestral stories. Critics
of the practice told Halvaksz that marijuana dried the blood of people who used it, making their offspring weak
and feeble. Marijuana use has generated similar controversies in other countries, including the United States,
with some arguing that the drug provides relaxation and pain relief while others claim it interferes with
cognitive abilities and motivation.

Our relationship with nature is reciprocal. Nature shapes humanity, and humanity shapes nature. Exploring
14  1 · What Is Anthropology?

    how nature shapes humanity, anthropologists speculate about how aspects of the environment have shaped
    the emergence and development of human biology, such as our ability to walk, the shape of our teeth, and the
    size of our brains. Dramatic climactic shifts over the past several million years have forced periods of rapid
    biological and cultural adaptation, resulting in new hominin species and new skill sets such as language and
    toolmaking. In more recent archaeological time periods, environmental characteristics have shaped religious
    beliefs, gender relations, food-getting strategies, and political systems. Environmental forces can trigger the
    beginning or the end of a society. Some archaeologists study how natural events such as volcanic eruptions
    and droughts have led to mass migrations and the collapse of empires.

    Our reciprocal relationship with nature also works the other way around; that is, humans shape nature. Our
    environments are shaped by the food-getting methods of our societies as well as the way we acquire and trade
    resources such as oil, natural gas, diamonds, and gold. Many anthropologists explore how contemporary ways
    of life change the natural world at local, regional, and global levels. Farming dramatically impacts ecosystems
    with the clearing of prairies, wetlands, and forests. Fishing can deplete certain species, changing the whole
    ecosystem of rivers and coastal waters. Responding to population pressures, people construct dams to channel
    water to emergent cities. The redirection of water transforms regional ecosystems, turning wetlands into
    deserts and deserts into resource-hungry cities.

    Scholars use the term Anthropocene to describe the contemporary period of increasing human impact on the
    ecosystems of our planet. Large-scale pollution, mining, deforestation, ranching, and agriculture are causing
    dramatic environmental disruptions such as climate change and mass extinction of plant and animal species.
    Many anthropologists are studying these problems, focusing on how people are working locally, regionally, and
    globally to promote more sustainable ways of living in our natural world.

    1.2 The Four-Field Approach: Four Approaches within the Guiding Narrative

    LEARNING OUTCOMES

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:
      · Identify and define the four fields of anthropology.
      · Describe the work of professional anthropologists in each field.
      · Provide an example of how the four fields work together to explore common issues.

    Let's recall the central narrative of anthropology:

    Human beings have developed flexible biological and social features that have worked together in a wide
    variety of environmental and historical conditions to produce a diversity of cultures.

    Researching this argument is a vast endeavor requiring many complementary approaches and techniques.
    Anthropology comprises four main approaches, the four subfields of our discipline. Each subfield specializes
    in exploring a different aspect of the common narrative. Combining insights from the four fields gives us a rich
    and complex understanding of specific issues such as gender, inequality, race, and the environment. Let's take
    a look at each subfield and then examine how the subfields combine in the study of racial categories and
    relations.

    Biological Anthropology

    Biological anthropology focuses on the earliest processes in the biological and sociocultural development of
    human beings as well as the biological diversity of contemporary humans. In other words, biological
    anthropologists study the origins, evolution, and diversity of our species. Some biological anthropologists use
    genetic data to explore the global distribution of human traits such as blood type or the ability to digest dairy
    products. Some study fossils to learn how humans have evolved and migrated. Some study our closest animal
    relatives, the primates, in order to understand what biological and social traits humans share with primates
    and explore what makes humans unique in the animal world.

    The Dutch primatologist Carel van Schaik spent six years observing orangutans in Sumatra, discovering that
    these reclusive animals are actually much more social than previously thought (2004). Moreover, van Schaik
    observed that orangutans use a wide variety of tools and pass down skills to their young. By studying these

primates, van Schaik and other biological anthropologists gain insight into the origins of human intelligence,
technology, and culture. These researchers also warn that habitat loss, illegal hunting, and the exotic pet trade
threaten the survival of our fascinating primate cousins.

Biological anthropologists frequently combine research among primates with evidence from the human fossil
record, genetics, neuroscience, and geography to answer questions about human evolution. Sometimes their
insights are startling and unexpected. Anthropologist Lynne Isbell argues that snakes have played a key role in
the evolution of human biology, particularly our keen sense of sight and our ability to communicate through
language (Isabell, 2009). Isbell's "snake detection theory" posits that primates developed specialized visual
perception as well as the ability to communicate what they were seeing in order to alert others to the threat of
venomous snakes in their environment. She points to the near-universal fear of snakes shared by both
humans and primates and has documented the prevalence of snake phobia in human myth and folklore.
Isbell's research highlights how human-animal relations are central to humanity, shaping both biology and
culture.

Not all biological anthropologists study primates. Many biological anthropologists study fossilized remains in
order to chart the evolution of early hominins, the evolutionary ancestors of modern humans. In this field of
study, anthropologists consider the emergence and migration of the various species in the hominin family tree
as well as the conditions that promoted certain biological and cultural traits. Some biological anthropologists
examine the genetic makeup of contemporary humans in order to learn how certain genes and traits are
distributed in human populations across different environments. Others examine human genetics looking for
clues about the relationships between early modern humans and other hominins, such as Neanderthals.

Forensic anthropology uses the techniques of biological anthropology to solve crimes. By analyzing human
remains such as decomposed bodies or skeletons, or tissue samples such as skin or hair, forensic
anthropologists discern what they can about the nature of a crime and the people involved. Key questions are
who died, how they died, and how long ago they died. Often, forensic anthropologists can discover the age, sex,
and other distinctive features of perpetrators and victims. Looking closely at forms of bodily trauma and
patterns of blood or bullets, they piece together the story of the crime. They work on investigative teams with
law enforcement officers and medical experts in ballistics, toxicology, and other specialties. Forensic
anthropologists often present their findings as witnesses in murder trials.

Not all of these crimes are contemporary. Sometimes, forensic anthropology is used to understand historical
events. Excavating the historic Jamestown colony of early English settlers in North America, archaeologist
William Kelso found a human skull in the midst of food remains. Noticing strange cut marks on the skull, he
called upon Douglas Owsley, a forensic anthropologist working for the Smithsonian Institution, to help him
figure out what the markings meant. Owsley determined that the markings were evidence of intentional
chopping to the skull with a sharp blade. He concluded that the skeleton belonged to a 14-year-old girl who had
been cannibalized by other settlers after she died. This interpretation corroborates historical evidence of
severe starvation in the colony during the harsh winter of 1609-1610.

Archaeology

Archaeologists use artifacts and fossils to explore how environmental and historical conditions have produced
a diversity of human cultures - the study of archaeology. Artifacts are objects made by human beings, such as
tools or pottery. Fossils are the remains of organisms preserved in the environment. Archaeologists have
developed careful methods of excavation, or removing fossils and artifacts from the ground, in order to learn
as much as possible about how people lived in times before and after the development of writing. They are
interested in how people met basic needs such as clothing and shelter, as well how they organized their
societies in family groups, trade networks, and systems of leadership. Many archaeologists seek to understand
how humans lived in relation to the natural world around them, altering the environment at the same time that
the environment was shaping their evolution and social development.

A group of archaeologists led by Tom Dillehay spent seven years excavating a set of sites in northern Peru,
charting the development of human society in this area over a period of 14,000 years (2017). They traced the
society from the early ways of life to the emergence of cities and early states, discovering how people there
developed fishing, farming, and herding strategies that led to increased sociocultural complexity. The team
16  1 · What Is Anthropology?

    collected data on the plants and animals of the area as well as the buildings, tools, cloth, and baskets made by
    the people. They concluded that the people who lived in this area placed a high value on cooperation and living
    in harmony with nature.

    Some archaeologists focus on more specific topics in more recent time periods. Archaeologist Eric Tourigny
    examined the graves at pet cemeteries in the United Kingdom from 1881 to 1981(2020). Looking at the
    epitaphs on the gravestones of the pets, Tourigny noted a change from earlier Victorian ways of thinking of
    pets as friends to later, more modern ways of conceptualizing pets as members of the family. He noted, too,
    that epitaphs expressed an increasingly common belief that pet owners would be reunited with their pets in
    the afterlife.

    Cultural Anthropology

    Cultural anthropology is devoted to describing and understanding the wide variety of cultures referred to in
    anthropology's central narrative. Cultural anthropologists explore the everyday thoughts, feelings, and actions
    of people in different cultures as well as the cultural and historical events that they consider important.
    Examining social discourse and action, cultural anthropologists seek to understand unspoken norms and
    values as well as larger forces such as economic change and political domination. Cultural anthropologists also
    study how different societies are structured, including the roles and institutions that organize social life.

    Cultural anthropologists often live for many months or years in the societies they study, adopting local ways of
    living, eating, dressing, and speaking as accurately as possible. This practice is called fieldwork.
    Anthropologists who undertake fieldwork might write an ethnography, an in-depth study of the culture they
    have been studying. Classic ethnographies of the early 20th century often portrayed the cultures of non-
    Western peoples as harmonious and unchanging over time. Bronislaw Malinowski, a pioneer of the long-term
    fieldwork method, spent nearly two years studying trade and magic among the Trobriand peoples living in
    what is now the Kiriwina island chain northeast of New Guinea. His ethnography, Argonauts of the Western
    Pacific (1922), describes how Trobrianders undertook canoe voyages from island to island for the ceremonial
    exchange of white shell bracelets and red shell necklaces among different island groups, an exchange system
    known as the kula ring. Curiously, these highly valued objects had no use whatsoever, as no one ever wore
    them. Rather, the exchange of bracelets and necklaces functioned as a means of enhancing social status (for
    the givers) and reinforcing trade relationships. Malinowski argues that this form of exchange took the place of
    warfare. Exploring the kula ring in great detail, Malinowski also learned about many other aspects of
    Trobriand culture, such as the making of tools and canoes, farming practices, gender roles, sexuality, and
    magical beliefs and practices.

    Nowadays, cultural anthropologists tend to focus more on issues involving conflict and change, such as suicide
    bombing in Afghanistan (Edwards 2017), a creationist theme park in Kentucky (Bielo 2018), sperm donation in
    Denmark (Mohr 2018), and garbage pickers in Rio de Janeiro (Millar 2018). Often, anthropologists explore
    overlooked and marginalized perspectives on controversial issues, shedding light on the cultural complexities
    and power dynamics involved. Anthropologist Tracey Heatherington was interested in why some people were
    resisting the creation of a conservation park on the Italian island of Sardinia (2010). The central highlands of
    Sardinia are home to many endangered species and old growth forests, as well as local herding peoples who
    fiercely resisted the appropriation of their homeland. Heatherington's research identified three competing
    perspectives: those of global environmentalists, the national government of Italy, and the local people of
    Sardinia. The global environmentalists view the Sardinian highlands as a delicate ecosystem that should be
    protected and controlled by environmental experts. The Italian government sees in the same land an
    opportunity to develop ecotourism and demonstrate the Italian commitment to environmentalism. The local
    peoples of Sardinia treasure their homeland as the foundation of their way of life, an intimate landscape
    imbued with history and cultural value. As the controversy drew these three perspectives together, Western-
    led global environmentalism combined with national government to undermine the legitimacy of local
    knowledge and authority. Heatherington describes how stereotypes of Sardinians as ignorant and culturally
    backward were used to delegitimize their resistance to the conservation park, drawing our attention to forms
    of ecological racism that lurk in the global environmental movement.

Linguistic Anthropology

As you might guess, linguistic anthropology focuses on language. Linguistic anthropologists view language as
a primary means by which humans create their diverse cultures. Language combines biological and social
elements. Some linguistic anthropologists study the origins of language, asking how language emerged in our
biological evolution and sociocultural development and what aspects of language might have given early
hominins an evolutionary advantage. Other linguistic anthropologists are interested in how language shapes
our thinking processes and our views of the world. In addition to its cognitive aspects, language is a powerful
tool for getting things done. Linguistic anthropologists also study how people use language to form
communities and identities, assert power, and resist authority.

Linguistic anthropologists frequently conduct the same kinds of long-term, immersive research that cultural
anthropologists do. Christopher Ball spent a year living and traveling with the Wauja, an indigenous group in
Brazil (2018). He describes the many routine and ritualized ways of speaking in this community and how each
kind of talk generates specific types of social action. "Chief speech" is used by leaders, while "bringing the
spirits" is used for healing the sick. Ceremonial language is used for giving people names and for conducting
exchanges between different indigenous groups. Ball, like many linguistic anthropologists, also examined
public speeches, such as the ones delivered by Wauja leaders to protest a dam on a nearby river. Ball also
analyzed the forms of language used by state officials and development workers to marginalize and
subordinate indigenous groups such as the Wauja.

Language is central to the way we conceptualize ourselves and our lives. Have you ever been asked to write an
essay about yourself, perhaps as part of a school assignment or college application? If so, you might have used
different phrases and concepts than if you'd been chatting with a new acquaintance. The purpose and intended
audience of our language use shapes the way we represent ourselves and our actions.

Anthropologist Summerson Carr examined an addiction treatment program for homeless women in the
midwestern United States, looking at the role of language in the therapeutic process (2011). After observing
therapy sessions and self-help meetings, she describes how addiction counselors promote a certain kind of
"healthy talk" that conveys deep cultural notions about personhood and responsibility. As patients master this
"healthy talk," they learn to demonstrate progress by performing very scripted ways of speaking about
themselves and their addiction.

How the Four Fields Work Together: The Example of Race

With their unique methods and emphases, the four fields of anthropology may seem like completely different
disciplines. It's true that anthropologists from the four fields don't always agree on the best approach to
sociocultural enquiry. Biological anthropologists often see themselves as "hard" scientists committed to
studying humanity through the scientific method. Cultural anthropologists rely on the "softer" methods of
observation, participation, and interviews. Someone who studies the genetic distribution of blood types and
someone who studies an addiction treatment program may have a difficult time finding common ground.

Increasingly, however, urgent concerns such as inequality and climate change have highlighted the
importance of an integrated approach to the study of humanity. The issue of racial inequality is an excellent
example. Beginning with an approach from the cultural side of our discipline, many anthropologists explore
what we think we know about the concept of race. How many racial categories do you think there are in the
world? How can you tell a person's racial identity? What do you know about your own racial category?

Biological anthropologist Jada Benn Torres and cultural anthropologist Gabriel Torres Colón teamed up to
explore how people use genetic ancestry testing to construct notions of collective history and racial belonging
(2020). For instance, if you learn through genetic testing that your ancestors most likely came from Nigeria,
you might begin to feel a certain identification with that country and with the continent of Africa as a whole.
You might begin to feel that you have less in common with the people of your country of citizenship and more
in common with the people of your country of ancestry, a racial connection perhaps felt as more fundamental
than the sociocultural connection to your home culture. While concerned about the potential for spreading
misconceptions about racial categories, Torres and Colon also note that racialized solidarity across national
boundaries can foster transnational movements for social justice. Such research shows how we actively
18  1 · What Is Anthropology?

    construct our concepts about race using biological information about ourselves, all the time believing that
    those concepts are embedded in nature.

    FIGURE 1.6 This map shows the predicted skin colors of people based on the levels of ultraviolet radiation in the
    areas where they live. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

    Importantly, biological anthropology demonstrates that our common notions of race are inaccurate. Biological
    anthropologists such as Agustín Fuentes (2012) and Nina Jablonski (2006) have looked carefully at the global
    distribution of human traits such as skin color, facial features, hair texture, and blood type, among other
    markers, in order to determine if humans are indeed grouped into discrete categories based on race. Short
    answer: biologically speaking, there are no real racial categories. Each human trait varies along a spectrum,
    and the various traits are mixed and matched among people in ways that make racial distinctions impossibly
    inaccurate. As an example, take the issue of skin color, which is the most common way people assign race.
    Jablonski demonstrates that skin color varies along a spectrum, from pinkish beige to dark brown, with people
    throughout the world having skin of every possible shade between those two. Originally, humans evolving on
    the African continent had dark skin to protect them from the direct ultraviolet light of the sun. As some early
    humans migrated north into environments with less direct sunlight, their skin lightened to allow the
    absorption of vitamin D from the much weaker sunlight.

    Today, if we look at people with deep historical connections to particular geographical areas, we find that skin
    color shifts gradually with location. Imagine setting out on a road trip from Kinshasa, the capital of the
    Democratic Republic of the Congo, just a few degrees south of the equator in central Africa, and traveling all the
    way up to the city of Tromsø in Norway, north of the Arctic Circle. This 157-hour trip would take you through
    Nigeria, Niger, Algeria, Spain, France, Germany, Denmark, and Sweden. If you were paying attention to the skin
    color of the indigenous peoples in each location, you would notice a gradual shift from deep brown in Kinshasa
    to lighter brown in Algeria to dark beige in southern Spain to lighter beige in Sweden. You might also notice
    other changes, such as more green and blue eyes and more red and blond hair, as you head into northern
    Europe. At no point in your trip could you identify a boundary between groups. Rather, you would see a gradual
    spectrum of change.

    Whether looking at visible characteristics such as skin color or invisible genetic markers such as blood type,
    biological anthropologists have demonstrated time and time again that there is no scientifically justifiable way
    to divide the human population into racial categories. Any way you draw the lines, there will be more variation
    within categories than between categories.

    Does this mean that race does not exist? In terms of biology, that is exactly what it means. But in terms of social
    reality, unfortunately not. Race does not exist in nature, but race does exist in our minds, our practices, and
    our institutions. Archaeological excavations of the material lives of various groups in the United States,
    including people from China and Ireland as well as enslaved peoples from Africa, show how notions of race
    shaped their whole ways of life: the buildings in which they lived, the clothing they wore, the property they

owned, and the structure of their families (Orser 2007; Singleton [1985] 2016). In contemporary societies,
cultural anthropologists studying forms of racial inequality in societies all over the world--including the
United States, the Dominican Republic, Brazil, Japan, Kenya, and Zimbabwe--have uncovered the different
ways that each of these societies constructs racial categories and uses various criteria to assign (and often
reassign) race to a particular person.

Moreover, in-depth ethnographies illuminate the severity of racism in the everyday lives of people of color in
the United States and elsewhere. After three years of fieldwork on the West Side of Chicago, anthropologist
Laurence Ralph documented the suffering of people in this Black neighborhood as they contend with
discrimination, economic deprivation, gang violence, and political marginalization (2014). Ralph emphasizes
that the people he observed dream of a better life for themselves and their children, in spite of these struggles,
and describes how many turn to social and political activism in an attempt to make their neighborhood a
better place for everyone who lives there.

Linguistic anthropologists are interested in how race is constructed and expressed through language.
Marcyliena Morgan studied the underground hip-hop scene in Los Angeles, exploring how Black emcees and
musicians craft linguistic codes that reference their experiences of police violence, urban unrest, gang activity,
and gentrification (2009). Like Ralph, Morgan highlights the creativity and resilience of Black American
communities in the face of enduring racism in American society.

Taken together, these various anthropological approaches to race provide more insight and understanding
than any one approach ever could. Overturning the biological myth of race is essential to understanding the
complex reality of human diversity, but it is not enough. It would be a mistake to pretend that racial categories
do not matter just because the concept of race has no basis in biology. The combined work of archaeologists,
cultural anthropologists, and linguistic anthropologists demonstrates how the mythic notion of race has been
used to exploit and marginalize certain people throughout history and into the present. We also see how
people respond to racial subjugation with creativity and resilience, inventing cultural forms of resistance and
mobilizing their communities through social activism.

1.3 Overcoming Ethnocentrism

LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Define the concept of ethnocentrism and explain the ubiquity of ethnocentrism as a consequence of
      enculturation.
  · Distinguish certain forms of ethnocentrism in terms of their historical relationship to forms of empire and
      domination.
  · Identify primitivism in European and American representations of African peoples.
  · Identify orientalism in European and American representations of Asian and Middle Eastern peoples.

Have you ever known somebody who seems to think the world revolves around them? The kind of friend who is
always talking about themselves and never asks any questions about you and your life? The kind of person who
thinks their own ideas are cool and special and their own way of doing things is absolutely the best? You may
know the word used to describe that kind of person: egocentric. An egocentric person is entirely caught up in
their own perspective and does not seem to care much about the perspectives of others. It is good to feel proud
of your personal qualities and accomplishments, of course, but it is equally important to appreciate the
personal qualities and accomplishments of others as well.

The same sort of "centric" complex operates at the level of culture. Some people in some cultures are
convinced that their own ways of understanding the world and of doing things are absolutely the best and no
other ways are worth consideration. They imagine that the world would be a much better place if the superior
beliefs, values, and practices of their own culture were spread or imposed on everyone else in the world. This
is what we call ethnocentrism.

Enculturation and Ethnocentrism

We are all brought up in a particular culture with particular norms and values and ways of doing things. Our
20  1 · What Is Anthropology?

    parents or guardians teach us how to behave in social situations, how to take care of our bodies, how to lead a
    good life, and what we should value and think about. Our teachers, religious leaders, and bosses give us
    instruction about our roles, responsibilities, and relationships in life. By the time we are in our late teens or
    early twenties, we know a great deal about how our society works and our role in that society.

    Anthropologists call this process of acquiring our particular culture enculturation. All humans go through this
    process. It is natural to value the particular knowledge gained through our own process of enculturation
    because we could not survive without it. It is natural to respect the instruction of our parents and teachers who
    want us to do well in life. It is good to be proud of who we are and where we came from. However, just as
    egocentrism is tiresome, it can be harmful for people to consider their own culture so superior that they
    cannot appreciate the unique qualities and accomplishments of other cultures. When people are so convinced
    that their own culture is more advanced, morally superior, efficient, or just plain better than any other culture,
    we call that ethnocentrism. When people are ethnocentric, they do not value the perspectives of people from
    other cultures, and they do not bother to learn about or consider other ways of doing things.

    Beyond the sheer rudeness of ethnocentrism, the real problem emerges when the ethnocentrism of one group
    causes them to harm, exploit, and dominate other groups. Historically, the ethnocentrism of Europeans and
    Euro-Americans has been used to justify subjugation and violence against peoples from Africa, the Middle
    East, Asia, and the Americas. In the quest to colonize territories in these geographical areas, Europeans
    developed two main styles of ethnocentrism, styles that have dominated popular imagination over the past two
    centuries. These styles each identify a cultural "self" as European and a cultural other as a stereotypical
    member of a culture from a specific region of the world. Using both of these styles of ethnocentrism,
    Europeans strategically crafted their own coherent self-identity in contrast to these distorted images of other
    cultures.

    Primitivism and Orientalism

    Since the 18th century, views of Africans and Native Americans have been shaped by the obscuring lens of
    primitivism. Identifying themselves as enlightened and civilized, Europeans came to define Africans as
    ignorant savages, intellectually inferior and culturally backward. Nineteenth-century explorers such as Henry
    M. Stanley described Africa as "the dark continent," a place of wildness and depravity (Stanley 1878). Similarly,
    European missionaries viewed Africans as simple heathens, steeped in sin and needing Christian redemption.
    Elaborated in the writings of travelers and traders, primitivism depicts Africans and Native Americans as
    exotic, simple, highly sexual, potentially violent, and closer to nature. Though both African and Native
    American societies of the time were highly organized and well-structured, Europeans often viewed them as
    chaotic and violent. An alternative version of primitivism depicts Africans and Native Americans as "noble
    savages," innocent and simple, living in peaceful communities in harmony with nature. While less overtly
    insulting, the "noble savage" version of primitivism is still a racist stereotype, reinforcing the notion that non-
    Western peoples are ignorant, backward, and isolated.

    Europeans developed a somewhat different style of ethnocentrism toward people from the Middle East and
    Asia, a style known as orientalism. As detailed by literary critic Edward Said (1979), orientalism portrays
    peoples of Asia and the Middle East as irrational, fanatical, and out of control. The "oriental" cultures of East
    Asia and Middle East are depicted as mystical and alluring. The emphasis here is less on biology and nature
    and more on sensual and emotional excess. Middle Eastern societies are viewed not as lawless but as
    tyrannical. Relations between men and women are deemed not just sexual but patriarchal and exploitative.
    Said argues that this view of Asian and Middle Eastern societies was strategically crafted to demonstrate the
    rationality, morality, and democracy of European societies by contrast.

    In his critique of orientalism, Said points to the very common representation of Muslim and Middle Eastern
    peoples in mainstream American movies as irrational and violent. In the very first minute of the 1992 Disney
    film Aladdin, the theme song declares that Aladdin comes from "a faraway place / where the caravan camels
    roam / where they cut off your ear if they don't like your face / it's barbaric, but hey, it's home." Facing criticism
    by antidiscrimination groups, Disney was forced to change the lyrics for the home video release of the film
    (Nittle 2021). Many thrillers such as the 1994 film True Lies, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, cast Arabs as
    America-hating villains scheming to plant bombs and take hostages. Arab women are frequently portrayed as

sexualized belly dancers or silent, oppressed victims shrouded in veils. These forms of representation draw
from and reproduce orientalist stereotypes.

Both primitivism and orientalism were developed when Europeans were colonizing these parts of the world.
Primitivist views of Native Americans justified their subjugation and forced migration. In the next section,
we'll explore how current versions of primitivism and orientalism persist in American culture, tracing the
harmful effects of these misrepresentations and the efforts of anthropologists to dismantle them.

1.4 Western Bias in Our Assumptions about Humanity

LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Define and recognize cultural bias.
  · Analyze forms of cultural bias in our own interactions and institutions.
  · Describe how the four fields of anthropology can work together to expose and overturn the misconceptions of
      cultural bias.

Euro-American ethnocentrism is everywhere in American culture--in our movies, advertising, museums,
amusement parks, and news media. Though the styles have shifted somewhat in the past century, both
primitivism and orientalism still persist as two discernible styles of bias.

Primitivism and Orientalism in Popular Culture

Think for a minute about the last time you saw an image of an African person. Was it, perhaps, an image of
wide-eyed girl in tattered clothing in an advertisement from a development agency requesting a charitable
donation? Or maybe it was a news media photograph of a child soldier wielding an AK-47 in a conflict zone in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo or another African country. Africa is still popularly represented as a dark
place full of deprivation and crisis. Africans are frequently infantilized as simple children who need the
support and tutelage of White Western helpers. But isn't it true, you may say, that poverty and violent conflicts
are widespread in Africa? Isn't the representation accurate to some degree?

The most troubled places on the African continent are the places where European colonialism was most brutal
and violent. In what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Belgian king Leopold II oversaw a reign
of terror against the local peoples, encouraging their enslavement for the lucrative rubber trade. Elsewhere in
Africa, European colonial governments stole land from local peoples and confined them to reservations,
forcing them to work on European plantations in order to pay taxes to the colonial government. Colonial
officials fomented conflict by privileging some ethnic groups and repressing others. Where you see violence
and conflict in Africa today, the roots can often be traced to the colonial period. Is this painful history included
in American representations of Africa?

Moreover, there are many bright spots in Africa, places such as Ghana and Botswana, with growing economies
and stable democracies. Would it surprise you to learn that Ghana has a space program? That there are more
mobile phones than people in Kenya? That several electric cars are manufactured in Africa?

Similar distortions are applied to Native Americans, frequently represented as victims of history, poor and
helpless, in need of outside help. The primitivist gaze shapes the representation of Native Americans in
museums, which often feature dioramas of humble people with stone tools, buckskin clothes, and tepees,
either living a simple life close to nature or engaged in tribal warfare, their bodies painted with vibrant colors.
Of course, Native Americans do not live this way now, but these are the images that come to mind in the
popular imagination. It is of course important for non-Native Americans to learn about the cultures of Native
peoples before and during their contact with European settlers, but it is equally important to understand the
legacies of history in the contemporary living conditions and activities of Native communities. Rather than
seeing Native peoples as passive victims, popular culture should also depict the dynamic and creative
responses of Native Americans to the forms of cultural violence enacted against them.

    For instance, did you know that a Native food movement is surging across the United States, both on Native
    reservations and in American cities? Native food activists such as Karlos Baca and Sean Sherman are reviving
    and reinventing the balanced, healthy cuisines of their ancestors, featuring dishes such as braised elk leg and
    maple red corn pudding. Sherman and his partner, Dana Thompson, have founded the nonprofit group North
    American Traditional Indigenous Food Systems (NATIFS), devoted to preserving Native foodways. The group
    offers opportunities for tribes to set up Native cuisine restaurants, providing jobs and profits to communities
    with high unemployment. Watch this video (https://openstax.org/r/sheansherman) to learn more about Sean
    Sherman and the Native Food movement.

    Like primitivism, orientalism has endured in American and European cultures. In the two decades following
    the al-Qaeda attacks on American targets on September 11, 2001, the most prominent example of orientalism
    in American culture has been the stereotype that all Islamic peoples are fanatical and violent. The
    indiscriminate application of this stereotype to Islamic peoples across the Middle East was a major contributor
    to the 2003 American invasion of Iraq, a country that had nothing at all to do with the September 11 attacks. To
    promote the invasion, politicians used the orientalist notion that Iraq was a violent and irrational country
    stockpiling weapons of mass destruction (which turned out to be false). As the war raged on, the Iraqi people
    came to be categorized as either "unlawful combatants" or helpless victims of a cruel dictator. American
    officials argued that Iraqis needed the help of American troops to save them from their subjugation and teach
    them democracy.

    For many Europeans and Americans, these forms of ethnocentric bias distort views of peoples living in large
    geographical regions of the globe. Misunderstanding other cultures this way can result in policies and military
    actions that do not achieve desired results. Moreover, ethnocentric bias promotes and reinforces inequality
    among social groups within multicultural societies. When people with certain ethnic or racial identities are
    seen as helpless or violent, they face discrimination in their pursuit of education, employment, and justice.

    The Bias of Backwardness

    Common to both primitivism and orientalism is the notion that European and Euro-American cultures are
    more advanced and civilized than other cultures. Since at least the 19th century, Euro-American thinking has
    been dominated by the idea that the various cultures of the world can be evaluated on a scale of sociocultural
    sophistication from least advanced to most advanced. Typically, Native American and African cultures were
    considered the most primitive, while those of Asia and the Middle East were thought of as slightly more
    developed but certainly not as civilized as the societies of Europe, which were ranked at the top as the epitome
    of human progress.

Early anthropology played a role in promoting this ethnocentric way of thinking. Nineteenth-century
anthropologists detailed various hypothetical schemes charting the developmental stages that each culture
would go through in its pursuit of the European ideal of civilization. One very prominent scheme was proposed
by the British anthropologist Edward Tylor. Tylor suggested that each culture progressed from "savagery" to
"barbarism" to "civilization." Since the change from one stage to another could not be witnessed by the
researcher, such "evolutionary" schemes were largely based on hypothetical conjecture, sometimes called
"theorizing from the armchair."

While some anthropologists played a role in popularizing this way of thinking, others worked to expose it as
misguided and inaccurate. The writings of American anthropologist Franz Boas highlighted the fact that no
culture is isolated in its process of developmental change. Instead, each culture develops through interactions
with other cultures, as new ideas and inventions diffuse from one culture to the next. Moreover, cultural
change is not structured by an overall trajectory of progress as defined by the European example; rather,
cultures change in many ways, sometimes adopting new ways of doing things and other times reviving and
reclaiming older ways. Through these varied patterns of change, each culture forges its own unique history.

While the evolutionary schemes of 19th-century anthropology have been disproven, the underlying notion of
sociocultural progress toward a Euro-American ideal is still a widespread form of ethnocentric bias outside of
anthropology. Many people still refer to some countries as "developed" and "modern" and others as
"undeveloped" and "backward." Think for a minute: Which countries are generally thought of as modern?
Which ones are frequently referred to as undeveloped? What is really meant by these labels?

These labels are rooted in Euro-American values. Championing capitalism and technology, many Europeans
and Americans view the generation of material wealth as the primary measure of the success of any society.
The divide between the more and less "advanced" countries of the world is largely a distinction between the
richer and poorer countries. European and American societies, which have become wealthy through the
development of global trade and industrial capitalism, are considered the most successful. Societies that have
not achieved the levels of wealth and technology associated with Euro-American industrial capitalism are
sometimes labeled "undeveloped." Societies that have not industrialized at all are sometimes called
"premodern" or simply "traditional."

As with older evolutionary schemes, this way of thinking relies on the notion that each society pursues
economic development in isolation. The poorer countries of the world are told: if you work hard and apply the
correct economic policies, then you too can become rich like the United States, the United Kingdom, and
Germany. But how did those countries become rich in the first place? Certainly not in isolation. The Boasian
emphasis on cultural interaction also applies to economic change. To a large degree, European and American
societies became wealthy by dominating other societies and keeping them poor. European countries
constructed a system of global capitalism designed to make them very rich by extracting raw materials and
human labor from their colonies. In fact, that was the whole impetus for colonialism.

The cultural anthropologist Sidney Mintz is one of many who have studied how this happened. Mintz explored
how European merchants designed a very lucrative system of production and consumption based on sugar
(1985). As European consumers began developing a taste for sugar in the 17th century, European merchants
developed sugar plantations in the New World using the labor of enslaved people transported from West
Africa. Sugar produced on these plantations was exported to Europe and the rest of the world, earning a hefty
profit for the European merchants who designed the system. Local people living in the places where sugar was
produced did not benefit much from this trade, and enslaved people suffered and died for it. Similar systems
were developed for the production of other global commodities such as cocoa, coffee, tea, and cotton. Some
commodities required enslaved labor and others involved small farmers, but the basic structure of the trade
was the same. The economies of many South Asian and African countries were designed entirely around the
export of primary commodities, the production of which was controlled by European merchants who reaped
the profits from this global trade. Many postcolonial countries still rely on the export of these primary
commodities.

What do these historical processes mean for understanding the world today? European merchants and
governments crafted strategic ways of thinking about the parts of the world they wanted to invade and
24  1 · What Is Anthropology?

    colonize. To justify the development of the slave trade, the plantation system, and colonial rule, Europeans
    labeled many non-Europeans as backward peoples needing the civilizing influence of European domination.
    This form of bias persists in contemporary notions of backwardness applied to the poorer peoples and parts of
    the world.

    In reality, the colonial system was a global mechanism for European merchants and governments to extract
    wealth from other parts of the world. European merchants took great care to maintain control over these forms
    of highly profitable trade, edging out local merchants and forbidding local competition. Even today, we see the
    remnants of this system in Euro-American domination of global trade. If the world seems divided between rich
    and poor, it is not because some countries work hard and others are "backward." It is because the global
    system was founded on forms of inequality that endure into the present.

            PROFILES IN ANTHROPOLOGY

    Franz Boas
    1858-1942

    FIGURE 1.8 Franz Boas (credit: "FranzBoas" by Canadian Museum of History/Wikimedia Commons, Public
    Domain)

    Personal History: Franz Uri Boas was born in Germany to a middle-class Jewish family (Peregrine 2018). After
    completing a PhD in physics and mathematics, he worked as a geographer on an expedition to the Canadian
    Arctic, living and working with the Native Inuit peoples on Baffin Island. With his newfound passion for Native
    American culture, Boas returned to Germany to work at a museum and began conducting ethnographic and
    linguistic research among Native groups. In 1887, he came to the United States and established the first
    anthropology department at Clark University in Massachusetts. He spent most of his career as an anthropology
    professor at Columbia University and curator at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.
    Areas of Anthropology: Though he promoted a holistic approach integrating the four fields of anthropology,
    Boas was primarily a cultural anthropologist specializing in the Native peoples of the Northwest coast of North
    America. Between 1886 and 1900, he conducted 29 months of fieldwork in the region, focusing on the

1.5 · Holism, Anthropology's Distinctive Approach                                                                  25

Kwakiutl peoples of Vancouver Island. He recorded myths, songs, and folklore in Native languages and
described cultural activities such as food collection and artistic styles. Focusing on the linguistic and
psychological aspects of this rich ethnographic data, Boas sought to understand Native perspectives and
values. As the leading anthropologist of his time, he established an American tradition of recording
ethnographic observations in meticulous detail and promoted the goal of reaching for an insider's point of
view.

Accomplishments in the Field: Boas profoundly disagreed with ethnocentric and racist theories circulating in
the social sciences in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Some anthropologists of the day identified some
cultures as "primitive" or "savage," arguing that each culture developed in isolation along a common trajectory
toward "civilization." Rejecting this model, Boas used his ethnographic data to show that cultures do not
develop in isolation toward a common goal. Rather, each culture has its own unique historical trajectory, and
cultures are constantly changing by sharing new ideas and practices.

Importance of His Work: Boas was horrified by the use of anthropological methods to support the theories
and practices of White supremacy. In the 19th century, some American researchers measured the skulls of
various ethnic groups, arguing that people who had immigrated to the United States from northern Europe had
larger skulls and were therefore intellectually superior. In 1907, Boas conducted a survey for the U.S.
Immigration Commission measuring the skulls of 17,821 American immigrants and their children. Comparing
the head shapes of parents and children, Boas discovered that the children had larger skulls due to
environmental factors in their new homeland, such as diet and medical care. His findings dealt a strong blow
to race theory. Throughout his career, Boas spoke out against racism, arguing that biological differences have
nothing to do with culture, language, or achievement.

1.5 Holism, Anthropology's Distinctive Approach

LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Define and give examples of holism.
  · Analyze how different elements of society cohere with and reinforce one another.
  · Identify how different elements of society can contradict one another, motivating social change.

In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic swept across the globe. Nearly 210 million people had fallen sick with the
coronavirus and more than 4 million had died as of August 2021. Medical researchers are still studying the
long-term effects of this illness on the lungs and brains of people who have recovered. Some have discovered
psychological effects as well, such as increased risks for depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia.

Beyond the medical realm, the effects of the pandemic reached into every aspect of our societies and our
everyday lives. In societies all over the world, people were forced to remain at home, "sheltering in place" from
the dangers of the disease. Businesses closed their doors to the public, and many shut down permanently,
unable to pay their bills. By May 2020, nearly 50 million Americans had reported losing their jobs due to the
pandemic. The epidemic of disease ballooned into an epidemic of grief as people mourned the loss of the those
who had died and worried about those who had fallen sick. Stressed out by so many disruptions, some adults
turned to alcohol and drugs, and addiction rates soared. Incidents of domestic violence escalated. Racial
violence against Asian Americans increased as some Americans blamed China for the emergence and global
spread of the disease. People everywhere reported feeling lonelier and more cut off from their friends and
family members.

And yet there were also some positive consequences. Because people were not driving as much, air quality
improved in many urban areas, giving relief to many people who suffer from asthma. Looking up into the night
sky, some people were able to see stars for the very first time. Some people reported valuing their friends and
family members even more now that they could not spend time with them in person. New social media
technologies spread, such as Zoom, and many people learned to use existing technologies such as FaceTime
and Skype. People also became aware of the valuable contributions made by "essential workers" in drugstores,
hardware stores, and grocery stores as well as hospitals and nursing homes.
26  1 · What Is Anthropology?

    How did a virus cause so many changes? The various elements of society are entwined in a complex whole.
    Dramatic changes in one area, such as epidemic disease in the realm of public health, can trigger a chain of
    effects throughout other social realms, such as the family, the economy, religion, and the political system.

    You'll recall the word holism from our earlier discussion about anthropology's commitment to understanding
    how the many parts of society work together. Holism is a distinctive method of analysis that foregrounds the
    ever-changing relationships among different realms of culture.

    Society as an Integrated Whole

    Throughout the 2010s, infant death rates in certain rural areas in Africa decreased dramatically. While thrilled
    with this positive trend, researchers did not initially know how to explain it. Were mothers and fathers doing
    something different to promote the health of their babies? Were African governments providing better health
    services for infants? Were aid agencies providing more resources? None of these things seemed to be true in
    any significant way.

    The one thing that had changed in the areas with lower infant mortality was the spread of mobile phones.
    Could that have something to do with lower infant mortality? And if so, how? Researchers hypothesize that it
    wasn't just the possession or use of mobile phones that was making the difference--it was the capability to use
    mobile money transfers and other fintech. If a baby had a fever in the middle of the night, the mother could
    now immediately text members of her extended family to organize the necessary funds to take the baby to a
    hospital for treatment. Quicker treatment meant a better chance for recovery. Something that does not appear
    to be directly related to infant health may in fact have a great impact on it.

    Recall from the beginning of this chapter our discussion of the very broad scope of anthropology. While other
    disciplines focus on one realm of society, such as medicine or technology, anthropology ranges across all
    realms of human thought and activity. Using the technique of holism, anthropologists ask how seemingly
    disparate elements of social life might be related in unexpected ways.

    In American and European cultures, the most common form of marriage is a union of two people. In the United
    States, many marriages end in divorce and most people then remarry, resulting in a cycle of marriage-divorce-
    remarriage called serial monogamy. In other cultures, however, a man may have more than one wife. It might
    be tempting to think that the dominant form of marriage in a culture is related to morality or gender relations.
    It turns out, however, that one very significant influence on marriage patterns is the food-getting strategy of a
    particular culture. In small-scale farming cultures, the marriage of one man to two or more women provides an
    abundance of children to help out with the work of weeding, watering, fertilizing, and guarding the crops
    (Boserup [1970] 2007; Goody 1976). In cultures where children contribute to food production, the marriage of
    one man to multiple women is more prevalent. This isn't always the case, of course, as there are other factors
    that influence the form of marriage practiced in a culture, but the useful work of children does contribute to
    the popularity of this form of marriage.

    In the contemporary United States, by contrast, most people work not on farms but in offices, shops, and
    factories. Children are not valued as sources of household labor, and they are not legally permitted to work for
    wages. In fact, children can be viewed as a drain on the household, each one requiring a massive investment of
    resources in the form of health care, childcare, special equipment, educational opportunities, and expensive
    toys. In this context, the increased fertility of multiple wives might impoverish the household. Moreover, our
    fast-paced, capitalist economy requires a flexible and highly mobile work force. American workers can lose
    their jobs, and they must be prepared to move and retrain in order to find further work. Many Americans
    experience periods of uncertainty and precarity in their work lives, conditions that affect the livelihood of their
    households as well as their relationships with their marriage partners and children. Such a context contributes
    to smaller family size and fragile marriage bonds. The cycles of stability and disruption in American work life
    are mirrored in the cycles of marriage and divorce involved in serial monogamy.

    These are just two examples of why anthropologists are committed to taking such a broad view of the cultures
    they study. Often, the various realms of society are related in ways that are not at first apparent to the
    researcher. By specializing too narrowly on only one realm, the researcher might miss the wider forces that
    shape the object of study.

Sources of Contradiction, Conflict, and Change

Holistic analysis considers not only how the various features of culture hold together but also how change in
one feature can generate cascading changes among others. Often, anthropologists begin their analysis by
focusing on one significant change in the lives of a particular cultural group and then chart the ramifications of
that change through various other realms of culture.

Attiya Ahmad conducted research among South Asian women who migrate to the Middle East for jobs as
housekeepers (2017). She writes about how these women adapt to a new culture and living situation in Kuwait
and the disruptions they face when they return to their families and home cultures. On the job in Kuwait, these
domestic workers must learn to speak Arabic, operate household gadgets, prepare an entirely different
cuisine, respect Islamic norms and practices, and perform their appropriate gender role as female members of
a Kuwaiti household. They face the cultural requirement that women should be naram, or soft and malleable,
as they develop emotionally charged relationships with the various members of the household. These
requirements bring about profound personal transformations for these women as they deal with the
contradictions of being both successful wage earners and subordinated cultural others.

The motivation to migrate is primarily financial: the need to pay for schooling, marriages, medical care, and
other family expenses. While the women are working in Kuwait, their families become economically
dependent on the money they send back home even as their emotional relationships with their family
members become weaker and more difficult. When they return home, profoundly changed by their
experiences in Kuwait, their natal families nonetheless expect them to behave exactly as they did before they
left, observing the same gender and age-related norms that govern the household. This creates a sense of
internal conflict for these women. Unable to truly reintegrate with their natal families, many either seek out
new connections in their home communities or migrate back to Kuwait. Some begin learning more about
Islam by attending special da'wa classes, where they meet other women in the same situation. Finding ethical
inspiration in Islamic teachings, many do convert, against the objections of their natal families and their
Kuwaiti employers.

All cultures are constantly changing, with small changes in one realm snowballing into larger and larger
changes within and beyond that culture. The Me Too movement is another good example. What began in 2006
as a call by American activist Tarana Burke for solidarity and empathy with victims of sexual harassment has
now spread into many sectors of American society and across the globe. Initially focused on high-profile
celebrities and the movie industry, the Me Too movement has raised awareness of widespread sexual
harassment and assault in the fashion industry, churches, the finance industry, sports, medicine, politics, and
the military. Activists press for legal changes to protect workers, especially whistleblowers who come forward
with allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior. Evaluations of patriarchal and chauvinistic behavior in these
institutional realms have sparked scrutiny of the more informal cultural norms of American romance and
dating. The Me Too movement challenges the way Americans think about the gender roles of men and women,
appropriate speech and gestures, and the distinction between public life and private life.

The movement has prompted processes of dialogue and change in at least 28 other countries, including
Afghanistan, China, Nigeria, and the Philippines. The global campaign has been interpreted differently in each
of these cultural contexts as the transcultural intentions of American activists intersect with local norms of
gender and sexuality. Indeed, some critique the Me Too movement as ethnocentric. Though the calls for reform
resonated with French feminists, Me Too activism sparked a backlash among many other French people, with
some men and even women arguing that French men should have the right to make sexually provocative
comments and rub against women in public places.

While many anthropologists actively support the Me Too movement, our methods of cross-cultural
comparison call on us to set aside our personal values (at least temporarily) in order to understand how people
in various cultural contexts interpret and act on the cross-cultural campaign against gender-based
harassment and assault. This method of suspending personal values is key to understanding how all the
elements of a particular culture interact with one another, including pressures from the outside.

    1.6 Cross-Cultural Comparison and Cultural Relativism

    LEARNING OUTCOMES

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:
      · Define the concept of relativism and explain why this term is so important to the study of anthropology.
      · Distinguish relativism from the "anything goes" approach to culture.
      · Describe how relativism can enlighten our approach to social problems.

    Recall our earlier discussion of cultural styles of clothing. American clothing style is related to American
    values. Ghanaian clothing style is related to Ghanaian values. We have seen how different realms of culture are
    interrelated, fitting together to form distinctive wholes. Anthropologists use the term cultural relativism to
    describe how every element of culture must be understood within the broader whole of that culture. Relativism
    highlights how each belief or practice is related to all of the other beliefs and practices in a culture. The
    anthropological commitment to relativism means that anthropologists do not judge the merits of particular
    beliefs and practices but rather seek to understand the wider contexts that produce and reinforce those
    elements of culture. Even when studying controversial topics such as piracy and guerilla warfare,
    anthropologists set aside their personal convictions in order to explore the complex web of cultural forces that
    determine why we do the things we do.

    Relativism Is Not "Anything Goes"

    Critics of the notion of relativism, believing so strongly in their own cultural norms that they cannot set them
    aside, even temporarily. They argue that relativism is amoral, a refusal to condemn aspects of culture
    considered to be wrong and harmful. For them, relativism means "anything goes."

    For anthropologists, cultural relativism is a rigorous mode of holistic analysis requiring the temporary
    suspension of judgment for the purposes of exploration and analysis. Anthropologists do not think that violent
    or exploitative cultural practices are just fine, but they do think that the reasons for those practices are a lot
    more complex than we might imagine. And frequently, we find that the judgmental interventions of
    ethnocentric outsiders can do more harm than good.

    Morality, Activism, and Cultural Relativism

    A striking example of the application of cultural relativism in anthropology is the controversy surrounding
    female genital cutting (FGC), sometimes called female genital mutilation. FGC is a cultural practice in which an
    elder cuts a younger woman's genitalia, removing all or part of the clitoris and labia. The practice is common in
    parts of Africa and the Middle East. FGC is not only extremely painful; it can also lead to infection, urination
    problems, infertility, and complications in childbirth.

    The World Health Organization and the United Nations condemn the practice as a form of violence against
    children, a danger to women's health, and a violation of basic human rights. These organizations view FGC as a
    form of discrimination against women, enforcing extreme inequality among the sexes. Efforts to ban FGC have
    focused on educating parents and children about the medical harms associated with the practice. Local
    governments are encouraged to enact laws banning FGC and impose criminal penalties against the elders who
    perform it.

Despite decades of campaigning against FGC, however, the practice remains widespread. If condemning FGC
has not been effective in reducing it, then what can be done? Anthropologist Bettina Shell-Duncan has taken a
more relativist approach, attempting to understand the larger cultural norms and values that make FGC such
an enduring practice. Setting aside her personal opinions, Shell-Duncan spent long periods in African
communities where FGC is practiced, talking to people about why FGC is important to them. She learned that
FGC has different functions in different sociocultural contexts. Among the Rendille people of northern Kenya,
many people believe that men's and women's bodies are naturally androgynous, a mix of masculine and
feminine parts. In order for a girl to become a woman, it is necessary to remove the parts of female genitalia
that resemble a man's penis. Likewise, in order for a boy to become a man, the foreskin must be removed
because it resembles the folds of female genitalia.

Other societies value FGC for different reasons. Some Muslim societies consider FGC a form of hygiene,
making a girl clean so that she can pray to Allah. Some communities see FGC as a way of limiting premarital
sex and discouraging extramarital affairs. In the colonial period, when FGC was banned by the colonial
government, some Kenyan girls practiced FGC on themselves as a form of resistance to colonial authority. As
FGC is promoted and carried out by senior women in most contexts, the practice becomes a way for senior
women to solidify power and exert influence in the community.

People in communities practicing FGC are often aware of the efforts of outside groups to ban the practice. They
know about medical complications such as the risk of infection. But the denunciations of outsiders often seem
unconvincing to them, as those denunciations tend to ignore the cultural reasons for the endurance of FGC.
People who practice FGC do not do it because they despise women or want to harm children. Shell-Duncan
argues that parents weigh the risks and benefits of FGC, often deciding that the procedure is in the best
interest of their child's future.

Personally, Shell-Duncan remains critical of FGC and works on a project with the Population Council designed
to dramatically reduce the practice. Cultural relativism does not mean permanently abandoning our own value
systems. Instead, it asks us to set aside the norms and values of our own culture for a while in order to fully
understand controversial practices in other cultures. By suspending judgment, Shell-Duncan was able to learn
two important things. First, while campaigns to eradicate FGC frequently target mothers, providing them with
educational material about the medical risks involved, Shell-Duncan learned that the decision to go ahead with
the procedure is not made by parents alone. A large network of relatives and friends may pressure a girl's
parents to arrange for the cutting in order to ensure the girl's chastity, marriageability, and fertility. Secondly,
Shell-Duncan learned that people who practice FGC do it because they want the best for their girls. They want
their girls to be respected and admired, considered clean and beautiful, fit for marriage and childbearing.

Shell-Duncan argues that outside organizations should reconsider their efforts, focusing more on
30  1 · What Is Anthropology?

    communities than on individual parents. Awareness campaigns will be more effective if they resonate with
    local norms and values rather than dismissively condemning them as part of the whole culture of FGC. Some
    researchers urge anti-FGC activists to connect with local feminists and women's groups in an effort to
    empower local women and localize the movement against FCG. Some alternative approaches press for more
    incremental forms of change, such as moving the practice to more sanitary conditions in clinics and hospitals
    and reducing the severity of the procedure to smaller cuts or more symbolic nicks.

    As this example illustrates, cultural relativism is not an amoral "anything goes" approach but rather a strategy
    for forming cross-cultural relationships and gaining deeper understanding. Once this foundation has been
    established, anthropologists are often able to revise their activist goals and more effectively work together with
    people from another culture in pursuit of common interests.

    1.7 Reaching for an Insider's Point of View

    LEARNING OUTCOMES

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:
      · Define the notion of insider's point of view.
      · Critique the notion of insider's point of view, explaining how it is never perfectly achievable.
      · List and describe the distinctive methods anthropologists deploy in their attempts to represent an insider's
          point of view

    Bettina Shell-Duncan's work on FGC demonstrates the importance of setting aside your own values and
    opinions in order to see an issue from the point of view of those directly involved. This often means working
    across contexts, whether studying another group or another culture. Anthropologists across the four fields
    apply this technique. Cultural anthropologists talk to people and participate in social activities in order to
    understand cultural life. Archaeologists rely on artifacts and fossils to reconstruct the sociocultural life of
    peoples in earlier times and different places. Through these different methods, anthropologists all aim for the
    same thing: they want to understand the perspectives of the people who practice a particular culture,
    sometimes called an insider's point of view.

    The Challenge of Representing Others

    The anthropological goal of representing an insider's point of view is controversial. Is it truly possible to step
    outside your own identity to really understand a different perspective? How can a researcher from a particular
    culture possibly understand exactly how it feels to be a member of another culture? Even anthropologists who
    study their own cultures may find themselves researching people from different classes, ethnicities, or gender
    categories. Is it possible to accurately represent the perspectives of people whose lives are so different from
    your own? Is it ethical? Is it valuable?

    For decades, White European and American anthropologists conducted research and wrote ethnographies as
    if the challenge of representing cultures very different from their own was really no problem at all. Empowered
    by White privilege and ethnocentrism, many earlier anthropologists believed that long-term intensive
    fieldwork was enough to give them cross-cultural insight into the perspectives of the people they studied.

    Too frequently, those anthropologists reduced the complexity of the non-Western cultures they studied to just
    one point of view, as if the people in that society all interpreted their cultural rules the same way and never
    disagreed or changed the rules over time. In her book about Japanese culture, The Chrysanthemum and the
    Sword (1946), anthropologist Ruth Benedict describes Japanese people in terms of common personality traits,
    such as reverence for the emperor and a moral sense guided by shame. Critics have argued that her
    conclusions are skewed by her overreliance on very few informants, all of them Japanese people confined to
    internment camps during World War II. As we have explored in this chapter, every culture comprises multiple
    perspectives that often contradict one another, generating sociocultural conflict and change. Recognizing this
    situation, contemporary anthropologists often conduct research among several different subgroups and
    geographical locations, integrating insights from these various arenas into a comprehensive and dynamic view
    of cultural complexity.

    Then there is the question of deep-seated bias, often operating unconsciously among researchers and the

    Access for free at openstax.org
1.7 · Reaching for an Insider's Point of View                                                                     31

people they study. Consider the situation above in which a White American anthropologist conducts research
in an African country previously colonized by Europeans. European colonialism left behind a legacy of White
privilege in postcolonial African countries. Earlier anthropologists did not often recognize how racialized
power dynamics might shape their research and writing, distorting their representations of the peoples they
studied. In the 1960s, anthropologists began to think more carefully about these issues, realizing that an
insider's point of view is never perfectly achievable. As human beings, our own perspectives are conditioned
by our own enculturation, our own ways of seeing and thinking about the world around us.

If an insider's point of view is never really possible, should we give up on this aspirational goal of the
discipline? In such a scenario, researchers would only study and write about people from the same
sociocultural categories as themselves. So, for example, Americans would only research and write about other
Americans. But are all Americans really members of the same sociocultural category? Could an upper-class
Asian American from Manhattan research and write about a poor Black community in the Deep South? Could a
Latino man write about a group of Latinx/Latina/Latino people consisting of all genders? American culture is
not unique in its complex array of identities. In all cultures, people have multiple identities as members of
multiple sociocultural categories. While you may be an insider within your culture in some respect, you may
be an outsider by some other measure. The ethical question of who can represent who is riddled with
difficulties.

Moreover, resigning ourselves to studying "our own people," whoever they might be, is tantamount to giving up
on cross-cultural research and the insight, empathy, dialogue, and transformation that frequently result from
it. Anthropological insights have been key to rethinking American notions of sexuality, family, and race, among
so many other pressing issues. We need the skills of cross-cultural research now more than ever. While perfect
representations of different communities and cultures may be impossible, many anthropologists now deploy
innovative methods designed to address the problems of history and power at the heart of the discipline. The
aim is not to achieve perfect ethnography but to work ethically and collaboratively to produce what
contemporary cultural anthropologist Nancy Scheper-Hughes has termed "good enough ethnography."

Collaborative Methods of Representation

Faced with the challenges of representation, many anthropologists practice methods of collaboration with the
individuals and groups that they study. Collaborative ethnography has a very long history in cultural
anthropology, traceable all the way back to early Euro-American ethnographies of Native Americans. Often,
anthropologists began their research by employing a local person as a translator or field assistant, a role that
usually evolved into something much more cooperative.
32  1 · What Is Anthropology?

    FIGURE 1.10 Francis La Flesche (credit: "Francis laflesche" by National Anthropological Archives, Smithsonian
    Institution/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)

    Researching the Omaha peoples in the early 20th century, anthropologist Alice Cunningham Fletcher began
    working with a young Omaha man, Francis La Flesche. Through their collaboration, La Flesche became an
    ethnographer himself. While most anthropologists of the day merely acknowledged their local collaborators (if
    they did even that), La Flesche became a full coauthor of their joint ethnography, The Omaha Tribe (1911).

    Today, anthropologists collaborate with the people they study in a number of ways. Some involve local people
    as readers and editors of their work, sometimes including community responses in the published
    ethnography. Some conduct focus groups to generate local feedback on particular chapters. Some
    anthropologists hold community meetings or forums to talk about the major themes and implications of their
    work. And some, like Fletcher, collaborate with members of the local community as equal coauthors on books
    and articles. Such methods strengthen ethnography by ensuring accuracy, promoting multiple perspectives,
    and striving to make anthropological work more relevant to the communities being studied.

    Collaboration also draws attention to the personal side of ethnography. Instead of extracting ethnographic
    "facts" from the process of fieldwork, many contemporary anthropologists focus on describing particular
    people, insightful conversations, and cooperative practices encountered in their research. Through this kind of
    representation, culture is represented as a constellation of personal perspectives, each one shaped by the
    position of each person in that community. Anthropologists also now acknowledge that ethnography is shaped
    by the personal background and identity of the researcher as well as the motivations and intended audience of
    the research. Collaborative anthropologists frequently describe their research in the first person, openly
    acknowledging how their personal and cultural biases influence their research.

    Anthropologist Luke E. Lassiter takes a collaborative approach in his study of the song and dance of
    contemporary Kiowa communities of southern Oklahoma (1998). Lassiter describes how he became interested
    in Kiowa song as a boy through his involvement in the Order of the Arrow, an affiliate of the Boy Scouts. Moving
    beyond the superficial representations of Native American culture in Boy Scout teachings, Lassiter went on to
    attend powwows, where he met singers and learned more about Kiowa culture. He developed a close
    friendship with renowned Kiowa singer Billy Evans Horse, who taught Lassiter how to sing Kiowa songs and
    encouraged him to pursue his interest in Kiowa culture in graduate school. Instead of foregrounding his own

description of Kiowa song and dance, Lassiter highlights the individual experiences and opinions of his local
collaborators as they describe how songs are created, passed down, and interpreted in the community.

Collaborative anthropology is not only more ethical and accurate; it is also more socially conscious and
political. When anthropologists collaborate as equals, they often become socially involved and politically
committed to the welfare of the communities they study. There are various terms for this, among them
engaged anthropology, public anthropology, anthropological advocacy, and applied anthropology. When those
communities face struggles over land, food security, medical care, or human rights abuses, many
anthropologists support their interests in a number of ways. Anthropologists often speak out publicly, write
sympathetic ethnographies, testify in court, participate in protests, and coordinate with organizations that can
provide material aid. Anthropologist Stuart Kirsch was researching magic and sorcery in a Yonggom village in
Papua New Guinea when he became concerned about pollution from local copper and gold mines nearby
(2018). As the community he was studying mobilized to protect their environment, Kirsch became involved in
their lawsuit against the Australian owners of the mine. He contributed to a social and environmental impact
study and advised lawyers representing the affected communities. He spoke out to local media and scholarly
publications, explaining the environmental problems caused by pollution from the mine.

Working across Cultures toward Common Goals

Stepping back for a moment, consider the problems facing us as humans on our shared planet. Climate change
threatens the survival of humanity and the biodiversity of plants and animals. Forms of deeply entrenched
inequality fuel racial, ethnic, and class conflicts within and between nations. These are global problems,
transnational problems, cross-cultural problems. Human beings need to find a way to communicate and
cooperate across the sociocultural boundaries that divide us, always recognizing the power dynamics involved
in that process.

How can we do this? Anthropology teaches us that we may never understand exactly how it feels to be a
member of a different culture or group within our own culture. But if we want to work together with people of
different sociocultural backgrounds to solve these pressing global issues, we have to try. Long-term fieldwork
and cross-cultural collaboration are not perfect solutions to the challenges of cross-cultural understanding,
but these methods give us a place to begin. And anthropological methods and insights can be transformative,
making possible the kinds of empathy and dialogue necessary to solve our global problems.

The goal of this anthropology textbook is to guide you in this process of transformation as you learn about the
cultural lives of the various peoples with whom you share this planet.

INTRODUCTION Fieldwork is one of the most important practices of anthropology. While all of the subfields
of anthropology conduct fieldwork in some form to gather information, each subfield may use different
methods of conducting research. The concept of working in "the field" was traditionally based on the practice
of traveling to distant regions to study other cultures within their native environmental contexts. In recent
decades, "the field" has broadened to include diverse settings such as one's hometown (as in urban
anthropology), the Internet (visual or virtual anthropology), or collections in university archives and museums
(ethnohistory or museum anthropology).

    2.1 Archaeological Research Methods

    LEARNING OUTCOMES

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:
      · Describe archaeological techniques for uncovering artifacts.
      · Explain the importance of context in making sense of artifacts and describe how researchers record content
          while working in the field.
      · Describe the law of superposition as used in the field of archaeology.
      · Describe the different types of relative dating methods used by archaeologists.
      · Identify and briefly define four absolute or chronometric dating methods.

    Many people have an inherent fascination with the human past. Perhaps this fascination stems from the fact
    that people recognize themselves in the objects left behind by those who have lived before. Relics of past
    civilizations, in the form of human-made cultural artifacts, temples, and burial remains, are the means by
    which we can begin to understand the thoughts and worldviews of ancient peoples. In the quest to understand
    these ancient societies, human curiosity has sometimes led to fantastical myths about races of giant humans,
    dragons, and even extraterrestrial beings. In the realm of archaeology, less speculative methods are used to
    study the human past. Scientific approaches and techniques are the foundation of archaeology today.

    Archaeological Techniques

    In archaeology, the first step in conducting field research is to do a survey of an area that has the potential to
    reveal surface artifacts or cultural debris. Surveys can be done by simply walking across a field, or they may
    involve using various technologies, such as drones or Google Earth, to search for unusual topography and
    potential structures that would be difficult to see from the ground. Cultural artifacts that are found may
    become the basis for an archaeological excavation of the site. A random sampling of excavation units or test
    pits can determine a site's potential based on the quantity of cultural materials found. GPS coordinates are
    often collected for each piece of cultural debris, along with notes on specific plants and animal found at the
    site, which can be indicators of potential natural resources. Features such as trails, roads, and house pits are
    documented and included in a full set of field notes. Government agencies have different protocols about what
    constitutes an archaeological site; the standard in many areas is six cultural objects found in close proximity to
    one another.

    When preparing a site for excavation, archaeologists will divide the entire site into square sections using a grid
    system, which involves roping off measured squares over the surface of the site. This grid system enables
    archaeologists to document and map all artifacts and features as they are found in situ (in the original
    location). All objects and features uncovered are assigned catalog or accession numbers, which are written on
    labels and attached to the artifacts. These labels are especially important if artifacts are removed from the site.

    Excavation is a slow process. Archaeologists work with trowels and even toothbrushes to carefully remove
    earth from around fragile bone and other artifacts. Soil samples may be collected to conduct pollen studies.
    Ecofacts--objects of natural origins, such as seeds, shells, or animal bones--found at a site may be examined
    by other specialists, such as zooarchaeologists, who study animal remains, or archaeobotanists, who
    specialize in the analysis of floral (plant) remains with an interest in the historical relationships between
    plants and people over time.

    Every cultural and natural object and feature is fully documented in the field notes, with its exact placement
    and coordinates recorded on a map using the grid system as a guide. These coordinates represent an object's
    primary context. If uncovered objects are moved before documentation takes place, the archaeologist will lose
    the archaeological context of that object and its associated data. Archaeological context is the key foundation
    of archaeological principles and practice. In order to understand the significance and even age of artifacts,
    features, and ecofacts, one needs to know their context and association with other objects as they were found
    in situ. Objects that have been removed from their primary context are said to be in a secondary context.

    Careful and proper documentation is vitally important. This information becomes part of the archaeological
    record and guides and contributes to future research and analysis.

Archaeological Dating Methods

Establishing the age of cultural objects is an important element of archaeological research. Determining the
age of both a site and the artifacts found within is key to understanding how human cultures developed and
changed over time. Other areas of science, such as paleontology and geology, also use dating techniques to
understand animal and plant species in the ancient past and how the earth and animal species evolved over
time.

Relative Dating
The earliest dating methods utilized the principles of relative dating, developed in geology. Observing
exposed cliffsides in canyons, geologists noted layers of different types of stone that they called strata
(stratum in the singular). They hypothesized that the strata at the bottom were older than the strata higher up;
this became known as the law of superposition. According to the law of superposition, not just geological
layers but also the objects found within them can be assigned relative ages based on the assumption that
objects in deeper layers are older than objects in layers above. The application of the law of superposition to
archaeological fieldwork is sometimes called stratigraphic superposition. This method assumes that any
cultural or natural artifact that is found within a stratum, or that cuts across two or more strata in a cross-
cutting relationship, is younger than the stratum itself, as each layer would have taken a long time to form
and, unless disturbed, would have remained stable for a very long time. Examples of forces that might cause
disturbances in strata include natural forces such as volcanos or floods and the intervention of humans,
animals, or plants.

The law of superposition was first proposed in 1669 by the Danish scientist Nicolas Steno. Some of the first
applications of this law by scholars provided ages for megafauna (large animals, most commonly mammals)
and dinosaur bones based on their positions in the earth. It was determined that the mammalian megafauna
and the dinosaur bones had been deposited tens of thousands of years apart, with the dinosaur remains being
much older. These first indications of the true age of fossil remains suggested a revolutionary new
understanding of the scale of geological time.

It was eventually determined that if a specific set and sequence of strata is noted in several sites and over a
large enough area, it can be assumed that the ages will be the same for the same strata at different locations in
the area. This insight enabled geologists and archaeologists to use the structures of soils and rocks to date
phenomena noted throughout a region based on their relative positions. Archaeologists call this method
archaeological stratification, and they look for stratified layers of artifacts to determine human cultural
contexts. Stratigraphic layers found below cultural layers provide a basis for determining age, with layers
above assumed to be more recent than those below.
42  2 · Methods: Cultural and Archaeological

    FIGURE 2.3 According to the principle of superposition objects found at deeper layers (called stratum) are older
    than those found above. In this illustration, the pottery fragments in Stratum E can be assumed to be older than the
    shell buttons found in Stratum C. The objects nearest the surface (aluminum can, plastic bottle) are obviously most
    recent. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
    Another method of dating utilized by archaeologists relies on typological sequences. This method compares
    created objects to other objects of similar appearance with the goal of determining how they are related. This
    method is employed by many subdisciplines of archaeology to understand the relationships between common
    objects. For example, typological sequencing is often conducted on spearpoints created by Indigenous peoples
    by comparing the types of points found at different locations and analyzing how they changed over time based
    on their relative positions in an archaeological site.
    Another form of typological sequencing involves the process of seriation. Seriation is a relative dating method
    in which artifacts are placed in chronological order once they are determined to be of the same culture.
    English Egyptologist, Flinders Petrie introduced seriation in the 19th century. He developed the method to
    date burials he was uncovering that contained no evidence of their dates and could not be sequenced through
    stratigraphy. To address the problem, he developed a system of dating layers based on pottery (see Figure
    2.4).

timeline based on these features. (credit: "Evolution of Egyptian prehistoric pottery styles, from Naqada I to Naqada
II and Naqada III" by W. M. Flinders Petrie and A. C. Mace/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)

Typological sequences of pottery, stone tools, and other objects that survive in archaeological sites are not only
used to provide dating estimates. They can also reveal much about changes in culture, social structure, and
worldviews over time. For example, there are significant changes in stratigraphy during the agricultural age, or
Neolithic period, at around 12,000 BCE. These changes include the appearance of tended soils, pollens that
indicate the cultivation of specific plants, evidence of more sedentary living patterns, and the increased use of
pottery as the storage of food and grain became increasingly important. Archaeological evidence also shows a
growing population and the development of a more complex cultural and economic system, which involved
ownership of cattle and land and the beginning of trade. Trade activities can be determined when pottery types
associated with one site appear in other nearby or distant locations. Recognizing the connections between
objects used in trade can shed light on possible economic and political interrelationships between neighboring
communities and settlements.

Chronometric Dating Methods
Chronometric dating methods, also known as absolute dating methods, are methods of dating that rely on
chemical or physical analysis of the properties of archaeological objects. Using chronometric methods,
archaeologists can date objects to a range that is more precise than can be achieved via relative dating
methods. Radiocarbon dating, which uses the radioactive isotope carbon-14 (14C), is the most common
method used to date organic materials. Once a living organism dies, the carbon within it begins to decay at a
known rate. The amount of the remaining residual carbon can be measured to determine, within a margin of
error of 50 years, when the organism died. The method is only valid for samples of organic tissue between 300
and 50,000 years old. To ensure accuracy, objects collected for testing are promptly sealed in nonporous
containers so that no atmospheric organic substances, such as dust, pollen, or bacteria, can impact the results.

Dating systems that measure the atomic decay of uranium or the decay of potassium into argon are used to
date nonorganic materials such as rocks. The rates of decay of radioactive materials are known and can be
measured. The radioactive decay clock begins when the elements are first created, and this decay can be
44  2 · Methods: Cultural and Archaeological

    measured to determine when the objects were created and/or used in the past. Volcanic materials are
    particularly useful for dating sites because volcanoes deposit lava and ash over wide areas, and all the material
    from an eruption will have a similar chemical signature. Once the ash is dated, cultural materials can also be
    dated based on their position relative to the ash deposit.

    The technique of dendrochronology relies on measuring tree rings to determine the age of ancient structures
    or dwellings that are made of wood. Tree rings develop annually and vary in width depending on the quantity
    of nutrients and water available in a specific year. Cross dating is accomplished by matching patterns of wide
    and narrow rings between core samples taken from similar trees in different locations. This information can
    then be applied to date archaeological remains that contain wood, such as posts and beams.
    Dendrochronology has been used at the Pueblo Bonita archaeological site in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, to
    help date house structures that were occupied by the Pueblo people between 800 and 1150 CE. The Laboratory
    of Tree-Ring Research, based in Tucson, is the world's oldest dendrochronology lab. Go on a tree-ring
    expedition! (https://openstax.org/r/tree-ring)

    The most effective approach for dating archaeological objects is to apply a variety of dating techniques, which
    allows the archaeologist to triangulate or correlate data. Correlating multiple methods of dating provides
    strong evidence for the specific time period of an archaeological site.

    LEARNING OUTCOMES

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:
      · Describe conservation efforts undertaken in the United States in the 19th century.
      · Define salvage anthropology and describe its origins and methods.
      · Provide an example of an anthropologist who used their research to help the people they were studying.
      · Explain why museums can be said to have created exhibits reflecting limited interpretations and describe
          efforts to correct this limitation.

    Early Efforts

    The conservation movement began in the 19th century as people in Europe and America began to realize that
    human settlement and the exploitation of the world's natural resources had led to the destruction or
    endangerment of numerous animals, plants, and significant environments. Efforts began in the 1860s to
    understand and protect the remaining natural landscapes and habitats. These efforts were partly motivated by
    concern for wildlife and natural areas. However, also significant were the concerns of sporting organizations
    and recreationists. The primary aim of early conservation efforts was to preserve significant natural
    ecosystems for parks or wilderness areas so that sportspeople and outdoor enthusiasts would have places to
    hunt, fish, and explore. Many areas preserved by these early efforts are still protected today, such as
    Yellowstone and Yosemite National Parks in the United States.

An element of this early period of conservation was the effort to collect specimens for display in natural history
museums. This collection effort was part of a movement known as naturalism, which seeks to understand the
world and the laws that govern it by direct observation of nature. The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw a
marked growth in naturalist collections worldwide as many cities and nations sought to establish and fill their
own natural history museums. These collections have been particularly useful to zooarchaeologists and
archaeobotanists, who use specimen collections of mammals, birds, fish, and plants to identify natural objects
and animal remains found at human burial sites. Many archaeology labs have collections of animal skeletons
for comparative anatomy, analysis, and identification (see Figure 2.5).

Wildlife Forensics Lab in Ashland, Oregon, serve as a useful resource for zooarchaeologists. (credit: "Wildlife
Forensics Lab" by US Fish and Wildlife Service Headquarters/flickr, Public Domain)

In addition to animal specimens, Native American baskets and other Indigenous art objects were collected and
placed in natural history museums. When visiting the Auckland Museum in Auckland, New Zealand, visitors
today encounter two large totem poles in the foyer. Northwest Coast totem poles are common in most older
museums throughout the world. These totem poles were gathered from America's Northwest Coast in the late
19th and early 20th centuries as part of the worldwide conservation and naturalism movement. Most
museums sought to purchase such artifacts, but in some cases, artifacts were stolen when Indigenous owners
were unwilling to sell them. Many natural history museums also established dioramas depicting both
Indigenous peoples and animals in their "natural" world. The practice of installing dioramas of Indigenous
people is now heavily criticized because of the implication that Indigenous peoples are akin to animals and
plants. Many museums have stopped this practice and have even dropped the phrase natural history from
their names. However, the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC,
and the American Museum of Natural History in New York both maintain the designation and still display
dioramas of Indigenous peoples.

    Salvage Anthropology

    Connected to the collecting of Indigenous artifacts is a practice known as salvage anthropology. Salvage
    anthropology was an effort to collect the material culture of Indigenous peoples in the United States and other
    parts of the world who were believed to be going extinct in the later 19th century. During this period, many
    anthropologists dedicated themselves to collecting material objects, stories, language lists, and ethnographies
    from tribal peoples worldwide. Many collections were made through legitimate means, such as purchasing
    objects or sitting down with collaborators (called informants in older anthropological vernacular) to record
    traditional stories, but some collecting involved the theft of tribal cultural items or purchases from
    intermediary traders.

    Many of these anthropologists were hired by the Bureau of American Ethnology (BAE), a division of the
    Smithsonian Institution, and spent considerable time living with Native peoples on the reservations that were
    by then home to most Native Americans. Language was a special research focus for linguists and
    anthropologists, as many Native languages were rapidly going extinct. Through analysis of language, an
    anthropologist can understand the meaning of words and their context as well as gain a sense of a culture's
    philosophy and worldviews.

    Anthropologists were not paid well to do this work for the BAE. Some began supplementing their income by
    buying cultural objects at a low cost from the people they studied and selling those objects at a much higher
    rate to museums. This practice is now acknowledged as unethical and exploitative. The anthropological
    research of this period has also been criticized for focusing solely on cultural knowledge while ignoring the
    hardships faced by the culture. For example, few anthropologists chose to help their subjects address the
    circumstances of living in poverty on the reservations.

    Leonard J. Frachtenberg was an anthropologist working during the salvage anthropology period who did take
    action to help the people he was studying. Around the turn of the 20th century, Frachtenberg was conducting
    research to collect the languages of the people living on the Siletz Reservation, in Lincoln County, on Oregon's
    coast. He worked extensively with collaborators from the Coos, Coquille, Lower Umpqua, and Alsea
    tribes--some of whom were living at the Siletz Reservation and some who had returned to their native
    lands--and published a series of oral histories based on his research. He also helped the tribes locate lost
    unratified treaties from the 1850s and use those treaties to successfully sue the federal government. In the
    treaties, the government had promised to pay the Indigenous peoples of Oregon's coast for their ancestral land
    if they peacefully relocated to the Siletz Reservation. The people upheld their part of the bargain, but they

never received any payment. Frachtenberg helped a Coquille man named George Wasson travel to
Washington, DC, and locate copies of the treaties in the National Archives. In 1908, the tribes began the
process of successfully suing the federal government for payment for their lands. This process took some 40
years to complete for many tribes, and not all tribes have been fairly paid to this day.

Museum Collections

Most of the materials collected by anthropologists during the period of salvage anthropology ended up in
museums and university archives. Many natural history museums now display large dioramas featuring the
material objects of numerous tribes. Museum research libraries house extensive collections of manuscripts
and ethnographies. Archaeologists have contributed to these collections as well; many museums contain large
collections of human remains. Indigenous peoples have criticized these collections, especially the gathering of
human remains, which is seen as sacrilegious. Today, there are millions of sets of human remains (some full
skeletons, but most single bones) in museum repositories that have never been studied and perhaps never will
be.

Anthropologists spent so much of their time in the early period collecting that they had little time to study or
analyze what they found. Many collections were put in storage after the anthropologists who had gathered
them moved on to a new project or passed away. There are currently millions of material artifacts and
ethnographic manuscripts that have never been fully studied. These archived materials offer research
opportunities for anthropologists as well as for Indigenous peoples, who are making use of these collections to
help recover parts of their cultures that were lost due to the assimilation policies of the past 200 years.

One person who has taken advantage of these archives is linguistic anthropologist Henry Zenk. Zenk has spent
years studying the languages and cultures of the tribes of western Oregon, specifically the Chinook, Kalapuya,
and Molalla tribes. He conducted research with the Grand Ronde tribe in the 1970s and 1980s and became a
proficient speaker of Chinuk Wawa, a trade language spoken by tribes from southern Alaska to northern
California and as far east as Montana. He has taught the language at the Grand Ronde Reservation for nearly 30
years. He is also one of the experts on the Kalapuya languages, spoken by the Kalapuya tribes of the Willamette
and Umpqua Valleys, and in 2013, he began a project to translate the Melville Jacobs Kalapuya notebooks.

Melville Jacobs was an anthropologist from the University of Washington who studied the languages of the
Northwest Coast from 1928 until his death in 1971. He filled more than 100 field notebooks with information
on the languages of the peoples of western Oregon, with a special focus on Kalapuya. Jacobs published a book
of Kalapuya oral histories in 1945, Kalapuya Texts. He also worked with Kalapuya speaker John Hudson to
translate numerous texts prepared by earlier anthropologists Leonard Frachtenberg and Albert Gatschet.
Jacobs and Hudson were able to translate several of these previously gathered texts, but many remained
untranslated when Hudson died in 1953. Zenk, along with colleague Jedd Schrock, spent many years first
learning Kalapuya and then translating a set of the Jacobs notebooks that recorded the knowledge and history
of a Kalapuya man named Louis Kenoyer. In 2017, Zenk and Schrock published My Life, by Louis Kenoyer:
Reminiscences of a Grand Ronde Reservation Childhood. Zenk and Schrock's work is a fine example of the
research possibilities offered by the existing work of previous anthropologists.

Zenk worked closely with the Grand Ronde tribe on this project and endeavored to make sure that the
translation of Kenoyer's story would benefit the people of the tribe to help them to better understand their own
history. His research and work with members of the Grand Ronde tribe spanned 50 years, beginning with his
PhD project, which involved extensive work with Grand Ronde members, who at the time were not a federally
recognized tribe. In the 1990s, Zenk began working with the tribe to teach Chinuk Wawa to tribal members.
The tribe today has an extensive language immersion project to teach the language to young people. Zenk has
been a consistent influence, serving as advisor, teacher, master-apprentice instructor, and researcher. Zenk's
work has helped the tribe recover parts of its culture and history that had been lost for many decades.

Personal History: Albert Gatschet was a Swiss philologist and ethnologist who emigrated to the United States
in 1868. He had a great interest in linguistics and Native American languages, and he gained attention in 1872
for his comparative analysis of 16 southeastern tribal vocabularies, which opened up new areas of research in
linguistics. In 1877, he was hired to work on the Geographical and Geological Survey of the Rocky Mountain
Region as an ethnologist. He also collected many notebooks of languages from Native peoples in California and
Oregon. He is most noted for his studies of the languages of the southeastern tribes and his ethnography of the
Klamath Tribes of Oregon.

Gatschet was fluent in numerous languages and published in English, French, and German in the United
States and Europe during his career. He also became quite fluent in numerous Native languages. His first large
work was Orts-etymologische Forschungen aus der Schweiz (Etymological research on place names from
Switzerland, 1865-1867), a study of Swiss place names that is still the standard authority today.

Area of Anthropology: Philology, ethnology, linguistics

Accomplishments in the Field: One of Gatschet's most significant analyses was of the southeastern tribal
languages, principally the Timucua language of northern Florida. Based on analysis of the notes of the Catholic
priest Father Pareja, who had collected language texts from the Timucua people in 1612-1614, Gatschet
determined that Timucua was a distinct language group that had gone extinct. Gatschet also examined the
Catawba language of South Carolina, concluding that it was related to the Siouan languages of the western
Great Plains. From 1881 to 1885, Gatschet worked in Louisiana, discovering two new languages and
completing ethnographic descriptions of the southern tribes. In 1886, he found the last speakers of the Biloxi
and Tunica languages and related them to the Siouan languages as well. He published his studies of the Gulf
tribes in the two-volume work A Migration Legend of the Creek Indians (1884, 1888).

In 1877 and 1878, Gatschet spent time among the tribes of the Grand Ronde Reservation in Oregon. He
collected some of the first professional field notes on the Kalapuya, Molala, and Shasta languages from some of
the last speakers, and he published and made notes about the Kalapuya mounds. Upon leaving the reservation,
he spent time researching the traditions of the Tualatin Kalapuya people in their traditional lands in the
Tualatin Valley. He then went to the Klamath Reservation, where he collected field notes on the Klamath
language. He worked his field notes into a two-part work, The Klamath Indians of Southwestern Oregon (1890),
volume 2 of the US Department of the Interior's Contributions to North American Ethnology.

Gatschet was commissioned by the Bureau of American Ethnology (BAE) in 1891 to investigate the Algonquian
people of the United States and Canada, a study he never fully completed. Illness forced him to retire, but near
his death, he remained engaged in studies of Chinese languages.

After his death, his wife, Louise Horner Gatschet, sold his field notes to the BAE. She was also hired by the BAE
to help translate much of his work. Gatschet's letters mention his wife being with him throughout his travels;
she likely contributed in numerous ways to his field studies.

Importance of His Work : Gatschet was one of the first professional anthropologists to visit many tribes and
was able to collect ethnographies and narratives from peoples who were gone within the next decade. He
analyzed language families in the field and provided early frameworks of connected languages. Gatschet's
work is fundamental to the study of the languages of western Oregon and the southeast Gulf area of the United
States. His professional work, which applied rigorous methods to collect Native languages, predates much of
the work of Franz Boas, who is credited with implementing scientific methods in the study of human societies.

Interpretation and Voice

There is increasing acknowledgement of the role of interpretation in the study of the human past. Although
ideally grounded in well-conducted research and the best evidence available at the time, all conclusions about
what might have been are based on the interpretations proposed by the authors of history. The backgrounds
and viewpoints of those conducting research and publicizing findings play a significant role in the conclusions
50  2 · Methods: Cultural and Archaeological

    they reach and share with other scholars. Interpretation and perspective are affected by many factors,
    including racial category, nationality, religious beliefs, social status, political affiliation, ambitions, and
    education. For many years, anthropological studies were almost always conducted by White, male scholars
    who grew up in the Northern Hemisphere and were educated in the same system. These common
    backgrounds represent a significant interpretive bias.

    After being accessioned into museums, many collections of cultural artifacts have not been altered in more
    than 100 years. When these material objects were initially placed on display, choices about their arrangement
    and the written descriptions that accompanied them were made by museum curators. Most of these curators
    did not reach out to the originators of the artifacts or their descendants for input, and many exhibits do not
    accurately depict or describe the objects on display. Museum exhibits have been found to contain inaccurate
    information about objects' material composition, makers, tribal cultures, collection sites, and proper use.
    Many other display objects are lacking this information altogether.

    Several museums are now seeking the help of Native people to better understand and more accurately tell the
    story of their collections. These Native perspectives are correcting misconceptions about the meaning and
    context of cultural artifacts and providing correct information about basic things such as the materials and
    processes used in the objects' production. Native input is also guiding museums in making choices about how
    objects are arranged and displayed. This input has been invaluable in helping museums more accurately tell
    the stories and display the context of the peoples who originally created the objects on display.

    2.3 Ethnography and Ethnology

    LEARNING OUTCOMES

    By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
      · Identify early anthropological practices pertaining to ethnography.
      · Define ethnology and provide examples of how it is used in anthropology.
      · Describe efforts to achieve multiple perspectives in anthropological research.
      · Define feminist anthropology and describe its aims.

    The Development of Ethnography and Ethnology

    As discussed in What is Anthropology? ethnography is a method used by cultural anthropologists to create a
    description of a culture or society. Ethnographers gather and utilize information from many sources, such as
    fieldwork, museum collections, government records, and archaeological data. In the 19th century, a form of
    ethnography developed that was called armchair anthropology, in which theories about human societies and
    human behaviors were proposed solely based on secondhand information. Lewis Henry Morgan is a well-
    known practitioner of this type of research. The content of his most famous publication, League of the Ho-dé-
    no-sau-nee, or Iroquois (1851), was gathered primarily from other books he read. Morgan did meet with Native
    peoples at various times in his career, but he did not conduct ethnographic research among the Iroquois
    before writing League of the Ho-dé-no-sau-nee, or Iroquois.

    In the later 19th century, numerous anthropologists and other scholars undertook research projects with
    hundreds of tribes throughout the Americas, many of them by then living solely on federal reservations. Many
    of these researchers were influenced by Columbia University professor Franz Boas, a German scientist who
    was originally trained as a physicist but became most famous as an anthropologist. Boas insisted that scholars
    obtain ethnographical information directly from the peoples they aimed to write about, rather than collecting
    information from other published sources. Boas quickly established himself as a leader in the field of
    anthropology and eventually took an associate role at the federal Bureau of American Ethnology.

FIGURE 2.9 Franz Boas is credited with establishing the standards of field research that became the foundation of
contemporary anthropological practices. Here he is in 1915, 57 years old. (credit: "Franz Boas" by Canadian
Museum of History/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)

Boas advocated for and published in all four fields of anthropology and asked many key questions in his
scholarship. In his 1907 essay "Anthropology," Boas identified two basic questions for anthropologists: "Why
are the tribes and nations of the world different, and how have the present differences developed?" (Boas
[1974] 1982, 269). Boas was responsible for hiring scholars and sending them out into the field to collect
information about various Indigenous peoples. His standards of field research became the foundation of the
contemporary science of anthropology.

One area of interest for early anthropologists was the similarities and differences between various Indigenous
societies. This interest in comparison led to a branch of anthropology called ethnology, which is a cross-
cultural comparison of different groups. In early anthropology, ethnology's aim was to understand how various
Indigenous societies were related to one another. This included the relations among language dialects, dress,
and appearance and to what degree and in what direction various tribes had migrated from one location to
another. Early anthropologists explored these questions with the hope of tracking changes in tribal cultures.
Another leading concern was how Native peoples initially got to the Americas. Anthropologists have used the
practices of ethnology to establish relationships and shared cultural elements that help illuminate migration
patterns of peoples from the "old" to the "new" world. Ethnology is still a common practice in linguistics,
archaeology, and biological anthropology.

Some additional uses of ethnology are fused with archaeological methods and analysis. Ethnoarchaeology is a
form of archaeology in which, following methods largely created by American archaeologist Lewis Binford,
archaeologists access ethnographic information about recent or existing human cultures to draw conclusions
about human cultures in the archaeological past. In Binford's 1978 study Nunamiut Ethnoarchaeology, he
draws comparisons between the ways in which contemporary Indigenous peoples disposed of animal remains
and the evidence observed in Nunamiut refuse sites. These comparisons inform a model that is used to
understand more about how Indigenous peoples' ancestors may have disposed of remains in the past. Such
models are not perfect, but many Indigenous cultures have maintained aspects of their culture to the present
day.
52  2 · Methods: Cultural and Archaeological

    Perspective and Interpretation in Ethnography

    Ethnography is still commonly used by cultural anthropologists. Practitioners today consult multiple
    informants during their research in order to gather a variety of perspectives on a culture or society. No one
    person has a full or authoritative view of their own culture; multiple viewpoints are essential to a full
    description. Many early anthropological studies only invited male perspectives, introducing a male bias into
    the resulting ethnographies. Now, anthropologists deliberately seek varied perspectives, consulting people of
    different genders and ages and who occupy different roles.

    Anthropologists can introduce significant bias into an ethnography. The most challenging aspect of fieldwork
    in cultural anthropology is to observe and study another culture without bias. Having an ethnocentric or etic
    perspective means someone is judging a culture according to the standards of their own culture and belief
    system. To observe a culture from the perspective of the people being researched is to have an emic
    perspective. For anthropologists to be effective researchers, they must be able to observe and gather data
    from unbiased and emic perspectives. In addition, an anthropologist's interpretation of the information
    gathered can significantly alter their research findings. Earlier anthropologists were primarily male and White,
    so their findings were based on interpretations made through these lenses. Feminist anthropology attempts
    to address this male bias. Feminist anthropology is recognized as having begun as early as the 1850s, with
    attempts made (by male anthropologist) to include more information on women in their ethnographic
    research. In the 1920s, female anthropologists such as Zora Neale Hurston and Ruth Benedict began
    publishing in the field, but not until the 1928 publication of Margaret Mead's Coming of Age in Samoa did a
    female anthropologist gain prominence.

    FIGURE 2.10 This U.S. postage stamp honors anthropologist Margaret Mead. Mead was one of the first female
    anthropologists to be acknowledged for her work and insights. (credit: "Margaret Mead Stamp" by John Curran/
    flickr, CC BY 2.0)

    Women's contributions and perspectives became much more pronounced in the later parts of the 20th
    century. Feminist anthropologists seek not only to claim a role for themselves in the field equal to that offered
    to men but also to expand the focal points of anthropological inquiry to include areas of life such as family,
    marriage, and child-rearing, as well as the economic and social roles played by women. The dominance of
    male anthropologists had biased analysis of human societies toward male-dominated roles and activities.

Many early archaeological research, for example, assigned no role to women in early societies or assumed that
women's roles were limited to maintaining households and raising children. Evidence of women's subsistence
and economic activities was either not looked for or ignored. It was also assumed that women in early societies
had subservient roles to men, when in fact most early societies have now been found to be very egalitarian,
with equal status accorded to women and men. Feminist anthropology has both expanded research to include
women's roles and aimed to understand the gender roles in other societies on their own terms, rather than
according to the gender roles of the researcher's own society.

Other perspectives emerged in anthropology in the 1970s as more members of minority groups began
entering the field. One category of minority voices that has been a significant asset to anthropology is that of
people with Indigenous ancestors. Practitioners with this type of background are part of a subfield called
Indigenous anthropology. Indigenous anthropology is discussed in detail in Indigenous Anthropology.

2.4 Participant Observation and Interviewing

LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Define participant observation and identify best practices associated with it.
  · Describe what makes a good informant for anthropological research.
  · Describe best practices for conducting an interview from an unbiased and emic perspective.
  · Explain the concept of ownership of cultural information.
  · Identify the rights of study informants.
  · List practices required by institutional review boards before research can begin.
  · Describe the aim of long-term research projects in anthropology.

Participant Observation

Working in the field often places anthropologists in settings very different from what they are familiar with.
Upon first arriving at an unfamiliar field location, it is common for anthropologists to feel out of place and
uncomfortable as they adjust to a new culture and environment. Many anthropologists keep a daily log of their
feeling and impressions in their new environment. Researchers studying other cultures practice a method
called participant observation, which entails directly participating in the activities and events of a host
culture and keeping records of observations about these activities.

Researchers may create various types of records of their interactions as participants and their observations
about the host culture and environment. These might take the form of field notebooks, computer files, digital
recordings, photographs, or film. Researchers working in the field may also collect objects that will remind
them of the culture they are studying, often memorabilia such as maps, tourism brochures, books, or crafts
made by the people they are observing.

Some researchers regularly record impressions of activities while they are occurring so that they do not forget
to make note of important aspects of the culture. But many researchers will wait to take photos, draw images,
or write in their notebooks until after an activity is over so that they do not disturb the culture through their
efforts at documentation. In either case, it is important that researchers be respectful and responsible and
always ask for permission from subjects before taking photos or recordings. Many researchers will have
gathered signed permission from their subjects before beginning their research and will work with a
documented plan that has been approved by their institution before going into the field.

Interviewing Informants

An important source of information about a culture is interviews with various people who grew up in that
culture. Interviews can be uncomfortable for people, and it is important that researchers do all they can to help
subjects feel at ease. Researchers will normally conduct an interview in a familiar space for the informant,
such as the informant's home. They will help the subject ease into the interview by participating in
introductory and hosting protocols followed in that culture when a visitor comes to someone's home. The
researcher will start off the interview with the exchange of pleasant comments and will introduce themselves
54  2 · Methods: Cultural and Archaeological

    by explaining who they are, where they come from, and why they are doing this research. Then the interview
    may commence.

    Interviews can be short or long, and there may be follow-up meetings and further interviews based on how
    knowledgeable the informant is. Many informants are chosen because they are deeply conscious of multiple
    aspects of their culture. This type of insider information is vitally important to an anthropological research
    project. In addition to interview questions, survey questions may also be asked during these meetings. The use
    of recording equipment, for both audio and video recordings, is common during interviews. However, such
    equipment may be considered intrusive by some, and their use is always at the discretion of the informant.
    Express permissions must always be obtained both to create a recording and to use a recording in future
    projects.

    practices and challenges. (credit: "2015 06 24 Walking with the Maasai JPEG RESIZED 0025" by Make It Kenya

    Ethical Considerations

    Contemporary sociocultural researchers and anthropologists must follow protocols established by an
    institutional review board (IRB) as well as any research protocols specific to the culture being researched. For
    social science research, IRBs are committees housed within a university that must review and approve
    research plans before any research begins. There may also be a parallel review process within the host culture.
    The proposed research is normally fully planned out before the review process can begin, with specific
    information about the type of research that will be conducted, including examples of questions to be asked,
    potential risk factors to subjects, plans for emotional support for subjects, means of protecting the identity of
    subjects, language used to fully disclose the intent of the project to subjects, and the final plan for archiving the
    research data. Many Indigenous nations have their own research protocols, and foreign countries will have
    their own research protocols and processes for securing permission to conduct research as well.

    Researchers conducting sociocultural, medical, or clinical studies must gain written consent for all interviews
    from their informants, and they must be transparent as to why they are conducting research and how it will be
    used in the future. There are normally various levels of protocols pertaining to research, based on the potential
    to cause stress or harm to the subjects. At the highest level, full disclosure and signed permission as well as
    complete anonymity of the subjects involved in the project are required. A research plan should also specify
    whether recordings, notes, and data will be archived for future use or destroyed at the end of the project.
    Content gathered from research may make its way into articles or books or become part of a vast body of
    anonymous data available to other researchers. These possibilities should be discussed with collaborators.
    Collaborators are usually anonymous unless they choose to allow their names to be used. Many researchers
    now assign to their subject culture significant rights to review reports and edit and correct erroneous

information and interpretations as well as ownership rights of the final product and the research data.
Alternately, researchers may destroy research data once the project is over so that it cannot be used in ways
other than what was originally intended.

Long-term research projects are becoming the norm for many professional researchers, who establish trusting
relationships with collaborators over the length of their careers. During the early years of anthropology, it was
almost unheard of for researchers to establish long-term relationships with the subjects of their research, but
many scholars began to view short-term relationships as exploitative. Long-term relationships involve a
regular return to the subject culture, on an annual or semiannual basis, to follow up on projects and programs.
Researchers often include their subjects in the planning and administration of their projects and will at times
seek a research objective based on the needs of their subjects. This type of research is more open-ended and
often has an applied focus, seeking to solve problems and issues identified as significant by the collaborating
culture. Those who engage in this type of research make it a primary aim to help the collaborating culture
rather than to seek information pertinent to their personal projects.

This type of open-ended research has been developed in response to the criticisms of Indigenous scholars
such as Vine Deloria Jr., who questioned whether early anthropologists did anything beneficial for the people
they studied. A researcher working in this fashion will listen closely to the concerns expressed by those they
are studying and aim to identify a project that will ultimately help the collaborating culture address issues
identified as important, either by directly working toward a solution or by offering significant insights into the
causes and subtleties of the issue. The researcher will include members of the culture in their team, and the
results of the research will be given to the people for their use. Researchers working in this manner may still
publish their findings, but the subject community will be part of the decision-making regarding what is
important and what should and should not be published. The subject community will also have control over
any projects that develop based on the findings. In some cases, the researcher is required to submit all
manuscripts intended for publication to a committee formed by the collaborating culture for review,
correction, and approval. Many Indigenous anthropologists who are tribal members are required to submit
their publications to their tribal council for approval before they publish.

Contemporary anthropological researchers often assign ultimate ownership of the material they collect to the
culture-bearers who provided the information. In fact, there are scholars today who, when publishing findings,
assign authorship to the community they worked with and assign themselves the role of editor or compiler. An
example is the text Chinuk Wawa: Kakwa nsayka ulman-tilixam laska munk-kemteks nsayka / As Our Elders
Teach Us to Speak It, which is authored by the Chinuk Wawa Dictionary Project and published by the
Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon, with the scholar Henry Zenk acknowledged as
the compiler of the information. Intellectual property protocols in many countries now assume that ownership
of ethnographic content is assigned to the informants. Informants have rights, both legally and per IRB
policies, to both participate and not participate in a study and to have their data removed from a study if they
choose. Ethical researchers will listen to their informants, and if they are at all worried about the effect their
findings will have on their informants or other people, they will either pull the data out of the study or find a
way to make it completely anonymous. No researcher wants to have their informants adversely affected by
their involvement in a research project. The IRB-informed consent paperwork, which must be signed by all
informants, should address these concerns and allow the informants to freely choose their level of
participation.

2.5 Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis

LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Identify differences between quantitative and qualitative information.
  · Provide an example of how an anthropologist might model research findings.
  · Describe the steps of the scientific method.

Differences between Quantitative and Qualitative Information

Quantitative information is measurable or countable data that can provide insight into research questions.
56  2 · Methods: Cultural and Archaeological

    Quantitative information is one of the most direct ways to understand limited, specific questions, such as how
    often people in a culture perform a certain action or how many times an art form or motif appears in a cultural
    artifact. Statistics created from quantitative data help researchers understand trends and changes over time.
    Counts of cultural remains, such as the number and distribution of animal remains found at a campsite, can
    show how much the campsite was used and what type of animal was being hunted. Statistical comparisons
    may be made of several different sites that Indigenous peoples used to process food in order to determine the
    primary purpose of each site.

    In cultural research, qualitative data allows anthropologists to understand culture based on more subjective
    analyses of language, behavior, ritual, symbolism, and interrelationships of people. Qualitative data has the
    potential for more in-depth responses via open-ended questions, which can be coded and categorized in order
    to better identify common themes. Qualitative analysis is less about frequency and the number of things and
    more about a researcher's subjective insights and understandings. Anthropology and other fields in the social
    sciences frequently integrate both types of data by using mixed methods. Through the triangulation of data,
    anthropologists can use both objective and frequency data (for example, survey results) and subjective data
    (such as observations) to provide a more holistic understanding.

    Modeling

    Many anthropologists create models to help others visualize and understand their research findings. Models
    help people understand the relationships between various points of data and can include qualitative elements
    as well. One very familiar model is a map. Maps are constructed from many thousands of data points projected
    onto a flat surface to help people understand distances and relationships. Maps are typically two-dimensional,
    but we are of course all familiar with the three-dimensional version of a world map known as a globe. Maps
    and globes are built on data points, but they also include qualitative information, such as the colors used to
    represent various features and the human-assigned names of various geographical features. Other familiar
    types of models include graphs, calendars, timelines, and charts. GPS is also a significant modeling tool today.

    GPS, or the Global Position System, is increasingly used in archaeology. A model of a research site can be
    created using computer programs and a series of GPS coordinates. Any artifacts found or important features
    identified within the site can mapped to their exact locations within this model. This type of mapping is
    incredibly helpful if further work is warranted, making it possible for the researcher to return to the exact site
    where the original artifacts were found. These types of models also provide construction companies with an
    understanding of where the most sensitive cultural sites are located so that they may avoid destroying them.
    Government agencies and tribal governments are now constructing GPS maps of important cultural sites that
    include a variety of layers. Layering types of data within a landscape allows researchers to easily sort the
    available data and focus on what is most relevant to a particular question or task.

    Wild food plants, water sources, roads and trails, and even individual trees can be documented and mapped
    with precision. Archaeologists can create complex layered maps of traditional Native landscapes, with original
    habitations, trails, and resource locations marked. GPS has significant applications in the re-creation of
    historic periods. By comparing the placements of buildings at various points in the past, GPS models can be
    created showing how neighborhoods or even whole cities have changed over time. In addition, layers can be
    created that contain cultural and historic information. These types of models are an important part of efforts
    to preserve remaining cultural and historic sites and features.

    The Science of Anthropology

    Anthropology is a science, and as such, anthropologists follow the scientific method. First, an anthropologist
    forms a research question based on some phenomenon they have encountered. They then construct a
    testable hypothesis based on their question. To test their hypothesis, they gather data and information.
    Information can come from one or many sources and can be either quantitative or qualitative in nature. Part of
    the evaluation might include statistical analyses of the data. The anthropologist then draws a conclusion.
    Conclusions are rarely 100 percent positive or 100 percent negative; generally, the results are somewhere on a
    continuum. Most conclusions to the positive will be stated as "likely" to be true. Scholars may also develop
    methods of testing and retesting their conclusions to make sure that what they think is true is proven true
    through various means. When a hypothesis is rigorously tested and the results conform with empirical

2.6 · Collections                                                                                                    57

observations of the world, then a theory is considered "likely to be accurate." Hypotheses are always subject to
being disproven or modified as more information is collected.

2.6 Collections

LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Identify and explain the issues and needs of archival collections.
  · Identify and explain the issues and needs of three-dimensional collections.
  · Describe current controversies regarding ownership of anthropological artifacts and human remains.
  · Recall two pieces of legislature pertaining to questions of ownership.
  · Define provenance and describe its importance in anthropology.

Not all anthropological research is done in the field. There is much to be learned from the collections of
manuscripts and artifacts housed in universities and museums. These collections make it possible for
anthropologists to study human cultures within the setting of special research laboratories that have been
designed to preserve and organize materials collected and perhaps interpreted by scholars of the past.

Archives

Archival collections contain published, re-created, or original manuscripts that are deemed significant enough
to be placed in conditions designed to preserve them against damage or loss. Such collections may contain
correspondence, maps, drawings, original drafts of books, rare books, or other papers and media that need
special care. Photographs are a major resource in many archives, and they need special handling. Preservation
policies of archival collections include practices such as keeping resources out of direct sunlight and away
from moisture.

While archives offer researchers a great range of valuable resources, they typically impose rather strict
policies on those wishing to access these resources. Researchers typically must wear gloves when handling
materials to prevent damage from the oils and acidity of human skin. Normally, archival collections do not
circulate (i.e., cannot be removed from the host site), and researchers may have to apply for permission to
enter the site or use any information. Archives may charge varying rates to make copies of material or to use
images of the resources in their collection for publication. To access some archives, researchers must plan
ahead by scheduling a time to visit and making previous arrangements to access specific collections. Some
sites do not allow researchers to scan materials using flatbed scanners, instead stipulating the use of non-flash
photography or overhead scanning. Some archives do not allow the patron to scan, photograph, or copy a
manuscript in any way, with all arrangements for copies and reproductions having to go through the archive's
staff.

The first step in archival research is typically to review a list or similar finding aid that indexes and describes
the resources available in a collection. These descriptive aids can help researchers determine whether a
collection contains resources that fit their needs and can make a visit to a selected archive more efficient and
worthwhile. Finding aids have become so well constructed that they may provide researchers with enough
information to enable the researcher to request copies of specific materials and avoid the effort and expense of
traveling to the archive in person. Most archives offer downloadable finding aids of their most important
collections on their websites, and there may be additional printed finding aids available on request. Most
archives will make requested copies for a moderate fee and will mail or email researchers a packet of the
reproduced materials. The cost of procuring such copies is almost always much less than the cost of traveling
to an archive site and paying for housing and meals. However, if a collection is potentially full of material
important to a research project, it may be better to visit in person.

Three-Dimensional Collections

Three-dimensional collections of objects such as basketry and pottery are normally housed separately from
manuscript collections. Such collections may host tens of thousands of individual cultural objects. These
collections typically require much more care and management than manuscript materials. Extensive planning
goes into determining the best way to contain and store each type of object in order to slow deterioration over
58  2 · Methods: Cultural and Archaeological

    time, with special attention paid to both the temperature and the moisture levels in storage areas. Handwoven
    baskets will be supported so that their fibers are not under stress, and all organic objects will have been
    previously frozen, perhaps several times, to destroy any insects that may live in the fibers. Collections of
    animal and human remains utilized by biological anthropologists or archaeologists must be properly stored
    and controlled against further degradation by reducing temperatures and maintaining moisture controls.
    Some very ancient organic collections may need to be chemically stabilized so they do not degrade. Objects
    made from organic materials--such as wooden canoes, basketry, reed sandals, or human remains--are
    particularly prone to degradation. Organic artifacts that have been sealed away from contact with the air for
    centuries, such as boats found on the bottom of a river or lake, will degrade fast once exposed to the air, so they
    may be kept permanently frozen or preserved with an ammonium glycol solution to stabilize decay.

    FIGURE 2.12 This pair of yucca sandals, collected in 1875, is an example of an organic artifact of the Southern
    Paiute people. Yucca is a perennial plant with large tough leaves that can be used for various purposes. (credit:
    "Sandals, Southern Paiute, yucca, collected in 1875 - Native American collection -Peabody Museum, Harvard
    University - DSC05570" by Daderot/Wikimedia Commons, CC0)

    All objects in collections storage must be well organized to make them accessible for further research
    opportunities. Collection materials that have been used to make claims about human experience or evolution
    must remain accessible to future researchers in case there are challenges or additional questions about their
    findings. In addition, if an anthropologist who donated and is responsible for overseeing a collection at one
    institution should die or move to another research institute, there needs to be a plan for the period of retention
    for the collection, or the time that the collection will remain in the archive. Many biological and cultural
    collections have been preserved in repositories since the day they were collected, with no plans to ever remove
    them from an archive. There are collections in the Smithsonian Institution that have been there since the
    institution was built in the 1850s. These collections continue to grow at museums and universities around the
    world.

    In the early 20th century, many museums adopted the practices of painting objects with lacquer and spraying
    organic collections with pesticides such as DDT to prevent insect damage. These solutions were proven to
    ultimately be harmful. Lacquer tends to alter the color and chemical structure of objects and is thus not a good
    preservation material, and DDT and other pesticides pose health threats to humans. Both museum staff and
    tribal members who receive repatriated objects and human remains are very concerned about the hazards
    these chemicals pose to humans--and to the environment, if they should be reburied. Efforts to clean many
    collections are underway.

    Ownership

    A question being asked by both anthropologists and subjects of research today is who owns the objects housed
    in material collections. In the past, anthropologists or their host institutions assumed ownership of anything

    Access for free at openstax.org
2.6 · Collections                                                                                                     59

they collected, along with the right to publish images of materials and sign over ownership of the objects to
collections repositories. In recent decades, tribal peoples and other subjects of research have begun asking
questions about whether such objects really should be considered the property of these repositories. Many of
these artifacts were not even collected by scientists but rather donated or sold by collectors, some of whom
removed the artifacts from burial sites. Artifact hunting is a common cultural practice in some countries, such
as Peru, where many people dig in Inca sites to locate artifacts to sell.

Questions of ownership become particularly pressing when the objects in question are human remains. Until
the 1960s, tribal peoples in the United States had little or no power to repatriate their ancestors. Repatriation
is the process of restoring human remains and/or objects of religious or cultural importance to the peoples
from whom they originated. In the United States, repatriation is executed under the Native American Graves
Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), passed into law in 1990. Prior to 1990, Indigenous peoples in the
United States had no legal means to claim return of any of the millions of human remains that had been
collected and placed in museums and archaeological collections since the 19th century.

Another important piece of legislature is the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), passed in 1966. The
act was passed to ensure that federal agencies would identify and take actions to protect and preserve the
nation's historic sites and locations. It especially impacted Indigenous communities and their cultural and
historical resources. Section 106 of the NHPA requires that federal agencies follow a formal review process
before undertaking any type of development project (36 CFR 800). This process includes identifying what the
actual undertaking is, such as the development of a road or other major capital project. Once this is
established, the agency must make a good-faith effort to identify any historic resources (50+ years of age) in
the area and determine if they are eligible for protection under the NHPA. After this identification measure is
completed, the agency must initiate consultation with the state historic preservation officer (SHPO) or tribal
historic preservation officer (THPO) and other interested groups and individuals. This step can include a
variety of meetings or activities and a period of notification that a project is going to commence, during which
feedback is requested by the lead federal agency. Public meetings might be held, with speakers selected to
introduce and describe the project. During the consultation period, correspondence and feedback is welcomed
from concerned tribes, institutions, or individuals. Tribes and other community groups with an interest in any
cultural objects likely to be found on the site are required to be consulted. Successful consultation often takes
place during the earliest planning stages of a project. Lack of early consultation can lead to a failure to identify
historic resources of cultural and religious importance.

The process places the burden of determining the potential effects of the project on the federal agency,
according to three established categories: no potential to effect, no adverse effect, and adverse effect. The
agency must then seek concurrence from appropriate SHPOs and THPOs and potentially other consulting
parties. If there is an adverse effect, the agency, the SHPO and/or THPO, and other consulting parties will
negotiate mitigation terms and solidify them into a memorandum of agreement to ensure completion of the
agreed-upon mitigation measures. In most cases, Native groups do not believe that archaeological excavations
alone are an appropriate mitigation measure, but each community has its own interpretation of what is
appropriate.

Generally, anytime a road is built or a building is constructed, there needs to be a section 106 review of the
project because of the likelihood of encountering Native American cultural sites in almost all locations in the
United States. Through the consultation process and cooperation between SHPOs and THPOs, decisions are
made as to the status and disposition of any cultural objects recovered from cultural sites. Tribes typically
advocate for the non-disturbance of human remains and the return of cultural objects to the concerned tribes.
The NHPA is not perfect, as it does not completely halt construction that will destroy a cultural site and does
not apply to collections placed in repositories before 1966.

In the early 20th century, the United States made it illegal for nonscientists to remove artifacts from
archaeological sites on federal lands under a law called the American Antiquities Act (1906). More recently,
NAGPRA made it possible for tribes to repatriate objects covered under the act, such as human remains and
funerary objects. Under this law, more than 20,000 sets of remains had been repatriated as of 2010, but
millions of artifacts and sets of additional remains are still in repositories. In addition, there are human
remains and funerary objects of US origin in collections worldwide that are not subject to NAGPRA
60  2 · Methods: Cultural and Archaeological

    repatriation.

    One problem surrounding repatriation is that many artifacts and remains lack clear provenance, or detailed
    information about where they were found. Lack of clear provenance also limits an object's usefulness to
    researchers. In many cases, wide regions are provided as the origin of an artifact, making it unclear which
    specific tribal culture it relates to. Objects that, for example, are labeled as coming from "New York" may have
    been created by members of dozens of tribes or bands of tribes. In general, the more specific a provenance is,
    the better. Narrowing an object down to Buffalo, New York, reduces its possible tribal sources to just a few.
    Objects that have too broad of a context are nearly impossible to repatriate because repatriation is supposed to
    return an object or human remains to the original tribe. In 2010, NAGPRA was expanded to allow for groups of
    tribes to repatriate objects of wide regional association back to a previously agreed-upon reburial or
    repatriation location. Under this expanded version of the law, a greater number of objects and human remains
    will be able to be returned to their communities.

    Concerns about ownership have also been raised regarding the ethnological and ethnographic research
    collected in millions of documents in hundreds of research collections around the world. Some tribal peoples
    have raised concerns that this material represents their ancestral intellectual knowledge and that it was taken
    from them without full disclosure of how it would be used. Many anthropologists published books and/or made
    tenure at their universities based on such research. Meanwhile, little was done with the information to help the
    tribal peoples it described, who were struggling under political and legal pressures to assimilate. In some
    cases, tribal peoples have implemented research projects utilizing these manuscript collections that have the
    explicit goal of helping their people with cultural recovery efforts.

    One example of Indigenous peoples utilizing archive materials to their advantage is offered by Oregon's
    Coquille Indian Tribe, which made use of archival documents to successfully restore their tribe to federal
    recognition in 1989 after the tribe was declared "terminated" by the federal government in 1954. Their
    restoration bid was made difficult by the fact that the records of their tribal culture were collected in faraway
    archives. Essential to the tribe's success was George Wasson Jr., son of the aforementioned George Wasson who
    was aided by Leonard Frachtenberg. Wasson Jr. designed and implemented an effort to collect copies of
    anthropological manuscripts pertinent to the Coquille tribe from the Smithsonian Institution.

    In 1995, 1997, and 2006, the Southwest Oregon Research Project--a project initiated by the Coquille Indian
    Tribe, University of Oregon anthropologists, and students from western Oregon tribes--collected 150,000
    pages of documents about the tribes of western Oregon from the Smithsonian Institution and the National
    Archives. These materials have since become a major collection at the University of Oregon's Knight Library
    Archives, special collections division, and additional copies have been given to 17 regional tribes.

    These projects are examples of the repatriation of intellectual knowledge to the tribes that the information was
    collected from. Many libraries now have policies that allow concerned tribes to repatriate their intellectual
    knowledge in the form of copies of collection materials for little or no cost. Recordings of songs represent a
    particularly sensitive and special type of cultural artifact to many tribal people. Archives have historically not
    been very attentive to the concerns of tribes regarding their collections. For more information, consult the
    Protocols for Native American Archival Materials.

    Summers Collection and the Grand Ronde Tribe

    by author David Lewis

    The Summers Collection is a collection of more than 600 Native objects from the West Coast of the United
    States, collected by the Reverend Robert Summers, an Episcopalian minister. A large portion of the collection,
    some 300 objects, was collected from the Grand Ronde Indian Reservation, which is close to where Summers
    lived in McMinnville, Oregon. In the 1870s, Summers would regularly visit the people of Grand Ronde and
    purchase objects they had in their homes or were using. Most of these objects are woven baskets and trays
    made in a traditional manner, many predating the formation of the reservation in 1856. Sometime in the

1890s, Summers passed his collection on to his associate Reverend Freer, who donated the collection to the
British Museum in 1900.

The collection has remained part of the British Museum collections since then. The value of this collection lies
not only in the objects and their unusually good preservation but also in the care Summers took to document
the people he purchased them from, their use, and their cultural background. It was unusual in early
anthropology for a collector to be so comprehensive in documenting material collections. Summers was likely
aided by his wife, who was a professional botanist and would have been meticulous in her work documenting
botanical collections.

In the 1990s, the Grand Ronde tribe became aware of the Summers Collection at the British Museum. In 1999,
representatives of the tribe visited the museum, viewed the collection, took photos of all objects related to the
tribes, and copied all the notes they could. Since then, the tribe has worked through a series of museum
curators to see if it would be possible to repatriate the collection to the Grand Ronde. The British Museum is
one of the largest repositories in the world, holding sacred and cultural objects from numerous nations, many
once part of Britain's extensive colonial empire. The British Museum rarely allows repatriations, fearful that
allowing one to occur would set a precedent resulting in multiple other cultures submitting claims. Still,
curators of the North American collections have suggested that something could be worked out if there were a
book deal to help publicize their collections and significant enough publicity. In 2018, the Grand Ronde tribe
was able to negotiate the loan of some 16 objects from the collection. The objects were placed on display in the
new Chachalu Museum and Cultural Center in Grand Ronde. While there, the objects were studied by cultural
experts who focused on understanding how they were made and how they might be able to replicate the
techniques.

There are no protocols for international repatriation. The Grand Ronde tribe had to work diplomatically to
form negotiated agreements and establish a beneficial relationship with the British Museum. After more than
100 years of assimilation, many traditional skills had been lost to the Grand Ronde people. The opportunity to
regain some of this lost ancestral knowledge by studying these cultural goods is a rare gift.

        MINI-FIELDWORK ACTIVITY

Participant Observation

When practicing participant observation, researchers immerse themselves in a cultural context and make
observations and notes about what occurs. This activity is structured to take place in a few hours and can be
accomplished in your community.

  · Spend about an hour in a public place, such as a mall or store, coffeeshop, park, bus, train, or library, and
      observe what people around you are doing. Take notes about their actions, interactions, clothing, foods,
      mannerisms, and anything else that might seem interesting. Note characteristics and mannerisms
      pertaining to culture, language, ethnicity, masculine and feminine roles, and age-related roles.

  · Try not to be conspicuous, and do not record conversations unless they are spoken quite loudly so as not
      to be intrusive. If anyone asks what you are doing, just explain that you have an assignment in a college
      course to make an anonymous report on local culture.

  · Return home and write a two-page reflective report on your research. In the report, give specifics of what
      you witnessed, and analyze how you personally responded to different cultures or mannerisms. About
      two-thirds of the report should be ethnographic reporting, and one-third should be analysis.

  · Try to eliminate your personal bias or admit when you have one, and identify when you are basing your
      analysis on personal opinions.

  · Pay attention to the need to maintain the anonymity of your subjects as if this were an actual anthropology
      fieldwork assignment. Do not identify people by name; instead, use pseudonyms.

As a final step, give a five-minute presentation about your experience that summarizes the high points of your
62  2 · Methods: Cultural and Archaeological

    participant observation.

INTRODUCTION Though all humans have a set of basic needs, we meet those needs in very different ways in
response to environmental conditions and social circumstances. For example, consider the basic human need
for shelter. In places prone to flooding, people often build their houses on stilts, constructing patios and
walkways to connect their houses together. In mountainous areas, people sometimes carve their houses into
cliffsides. In societies with extreme inequality, some people live in luxury highrise apartments side-by-side

    with people who pitch their tents on the sidewalk. Humans have even constructed a complex dwelling adapted
    to the conditions of space, the International Space Center.

    Similarly, humans have a wide range of solutions to human needs for clothing, food, family life, health, and
    social order. In each society, the various solutions combine in a complex totality called culture. In this chapter,
    we explore the concept of culture, what it is and how to study it. Taking the need for shelter as a central
    example, we will see how culture is created and how it changes. We will learn about how different elements of
    culture interact with one another. As culture is a central concept in anthropology, our understanding of culture
    will guide our exploration of human lifeways throughout this textbook.

    3.1 The Homeyness of Culture

    LEARNING OUTCOMES

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:
      · Explain the importance of culture to the concept of home.
      · Identify the centrality of culture in the discipline of anthropology.
      · Describe how each of the four fields deploys the concept of culture.
      · Explain why culture feels familiar and "homey."

    FIGURE 3.2 The floor plan of a typical 21st-century middle-class American house consists of many individual
    rooms, including three to four bedrooms, a large kitchen, a family room, and an attached garage. This floor plan

    What place do you call home? For some people, home is a large, angular structure made of wood or brick, fixed
    on a permanent foundation of concrete, and rigged with systems to provide running water, electricity, and
    temperature control. Such houses have separate rooms for distinct activities, such as sleeping, bathing, eating,
    and socializing. Often, one bedroom is larger than the others and connected to its own bathroom. This is the
    "primary bedroom," designed to accommodate a married couple while their children sleep in smaller
    bedrooms. The room for cooking (the kitchen) used to be separated from the room where people socialized
    (the living room or great room), as it was assumed that one person (the wife) would cook in the kitchen while
    another person (the husband) relaxed alone or with company in the living room. More recently, open-concept
    architecture has eliminated the wall separating the kitchen from the living room, as adults often cook together
    or socialize as one cooks and the other relaxes.

In the 1960s, French scholar Pierre Bourdieu (1970) analyzed a typical house of a Kabyle family in northern
Algeria. Traditional Kabyle houses were rectangular buildings made of stone and clay with tiled roofs. Inside, a
waist-high dividing wall marked off one-third of the house. This marked-off section, set lower than the rest of
the house and paved with flagstones, was the stable, where animals were kept at night. A farming people, the
Kabyle kept oxen, cows, donkeys, and mules. Above the stable was a loft where women and children often slept,
though arrangements for sleeping and marital sex tended to vary.

FIGURE 3.3 These houses in Norther Algeria, built by the Kabyle people, are constructed of stone, and include
open space for both animals and human inhabitants under a shared roof. (credit: PhR610/flickr, CC BY 2.0)

The floor of the larger section of the house was higher and paved with a layer of black clay and cow dung that
women polished with a stone. This part was reserved for human use. In this larger, elevated section, a large
weaving loom sat against the wall opposite the door. Facing east, this wall with the loom received the most light
in the house. Guests and brides were seated here, as it was considered the nicest part of the house. Opposite
the dividing wall in the larger section was the hearth, surrounded by cooking tools, lamps, and jars of edible
grain. With the loom and the hearth, the main area of human activity in the house was associated with the
work of women. Bourdieu explained that men were expected to remain outside the house from dawn to
evening, working in the fields and associating with other men in public spaces. Women were supposed to
remain in the home.

In Bourdieu's analysis, the Kabyle house was divided into two realms: a dark, low realm associated with
animals and natural activities (sleeping, sex, childbirth, and death) and a lighter, higher realm associated with
humans and cultural activities (weaving, cooking, brides, and guests).

Humans all over the world require a place to gather, work, socialize, and sleep. Some have Western-style
houses, while others have compounds. Some live in tents made of wooden beams and covered with animal
skins or cloth, in caves hollowed out of sandstone or volcanic rock, or in wooden structures built on stilts or in
trees to avoid floods and predators. While these different forms of home are all designed to perform a common
function as human living spaces, they are distinctively shaped by local environments and lifeways. Houses are
most commonly built with locally available materials and designed to protect against local climatic conditions
and predators. Over generations, people develop distinctive technologies to transform available materials into
durable and functional homes. Different forms of family, different gender roles and relations, and different
70  3 · Culture Concept Theory: Theories of Cultural Change

    everyday activities determine the organization of space in these different homes. Dominant ideas about work,
    gender, marriage, parenting, hospitality, and status all shape the places we call home.

    Home, then, involves a combination of materials, technologies, social relationships, everyday practices, deeply
    held values, and shared ideas. In every culture, these features are uniquely combined to produce distinctive
    versions of home. Other combinations of features produce distinctive versions of clothing, food, work, and
    health. Growing up in a particular social group, a person learns these ways of living, eating, working, and so on
    and comes to consider them normal and natural. Anthropologists have a word for such integrated
    combinations of social and environmental features, and that word is culture. The ways of your culture are
    familiar to you, often so deeply ingrained that they come naturally. Culture itself feels like home.

    All four fields of anthropology are devoted to understanding human culture. Biological anthropologists are
    often interested in the emergence of culture in the course of human biological evolution. Archaeologists use
    material artifacts as keys to understanding the technologies, social practices, and ideas of ancient peoples.
    Cultural anthropologists often use participant observation to understand how the various features of culture fit
    together in contemporary societies. Linguistic anthropologists are interested in how language shapes and is
    shaped by other features in the constellation of culture.

    This chapter explores culture as a central concept in anthropology. We examine what distinguishes culture
    from other aspects of human experience and activity. In an effort to organize the vast array of things included
    in culture, we divide culture into three levels and consider how those levels fit together holistically--and what
    happens when they don't. Finally, we identify a set of contradictions built into the concept of culture and see
    how those contradictions illuminate the nature of human social life.

    3.2 The Winkiness of Culture

    LEARNING OUTCOMES

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:
      · Provide E. B. Tylor's definition of culture.
      · Distinguish natural behavior from cultural behavior.
      · Describe deliberate and nondeliberate ways that people acquire culture.
      · Explain how biological processes can be shaped by culture.

    In the last section, we referred to culture as a combination of materials, technologies, social relationships,
    everyday practices, deeply held values, and shared ideas. Nineteenth-century British anthropologist Edward
    Burnett Tylor defined culture as "that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law,
    custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society" (1873, 1:1). That's a lot
    to include in one concept! If all of that is culture, then what about human experience and activity is not
    culture?

    Consider this scenario. A student comes to class one day, and the instructor says, "I've decided that you're all a
    bunch of failures and I'm flunking the entire class." Imagine then that the instructor simply stands there after
    that announcement, blinking calmly as the class erupts in protest.

    Now imagine that same scenario with one very slight difference. The instructor announces, "I've decided that
    you're all a bunch of failures and I'm flunking the entire class." Then, as the class erupts in protest, the
    instructor calmly blinks one eye, leaving the other eye open.

FIGURE 3.4 Would you take this woman seriously? In American culture, winking, related to the normal biological
function of blinking, takes on special meaning in social interactions. (credit: Motion Picture News/Wikimedia

What just happened there? Blinking is a biological compulsion common to humans everywhere. Humans blink
to keep eyes hydrated and clear of debris. Humans are born knowing how to blink; nobody has to teach us. On
average, humans blink 15 to 20 times every minute. Without realizing it, people are necessarily blinking
throughout every conversation, every social interaction, every activity during the day. The people we talk to
and interact with are also blinking constantly, so often that everyone is accustomed to ignoring it. Blinking
does not affect the perceived meaning of speech or actions.

But if someone deliberately blinks one eye, leaving the other one open, that's a completely different matter. In
fact, leaving one eye open makes a blink a wink. Winking is not a biological necessity. Humans are not born
knowing to how to wink, and it takes some practice to learn how to do it. Because it requires deliberate effort
and people are not constantly doing it, winking can acquire special meaning in social interactions. In
American culture (and many others), a wink often indicates that someone is joking around and that whatever
they've just said or done should not be taken seriously. Of course, a wink can mean different things in different
societies. Moreover, a wink can mean different things in the same society. If someone on a date takes their
companion's hand and gives a cute little wink, the person may have reason to hope the winker is not just joking
around.

American cultural anthropologist Clifford Geertz (1973) used the example of winking to illustrate two
important aspects of culture. First, culture is learned. Innate human behaviors--that is, behaviors that people
are born with--are biological, not cultural. Blinking is biological. Acquired human behaviors--that is, behaviors
that people are taught--are cultural. Winking is cultural. This means that cultural behaviors are not genetically
inherited from generation to generation but must be passed down from older members of a society to younger
members. This process, as you'll recall from What is Anthropology? is called enculturation.

Some aspects of enculturation are deliberate and systematic, such as learning the rules of written punctuation
in a language. At some point in an English speaker's childhood, someone explicitly told them the difference
between a question mark and an exclamation point. Most likely, they learned this distinction in school, a
fundamental institution of enculturation in many societies. Religious institutions are another common force of
72  3 · Culture Concept Theory: Theories of Cultural Change

    enculturation, providing explicit instruction in cultural rules of morality and social interaction.
    Extracurricular activities such as sports, dance, and music lessons also teach children cultural rules and
    norms.

    While a great deal of very important cultural content is deliberately conveyed in these systematic contexts, the
    greater part of culture is acquired unconsciously by happenstance--that is, nobody planned to teach it, and no
    one made an effort to consciously try to learn it. By virtue of growing up in a culture, children learn what
    certain actions and objects mean, how their society operates, and what the rules are for appropriate behavior.

    Going back to the cultural notion of home, did anyone ever explain to you why your childhood home was
    structured in a certain way? Did anyone ever point out the cultural assumptions about gender and family built
    into your house? Probably not. Now, imagine that you were taken away from your parents as a baby and
    adopted by a family far away, with a very different way of life situated in a very different environment. With
    your adoptive family, you might have been raised in a very different kind of home. Growing up, your everyday
    habits, activities, and expectations would have been shaped by the setup of that home. Living in that house, you
    would have wordlessly absorbed a set of assumptions about family, gender, work, leisure, hospitality, and
    property. And all of it would seem quite natural to you.

    Many forms of culture are passed down through a combination of deliberate and unconscious processes.
    Perhaps when you were a child, someone told you what a wink was and showed you how to accomplish one; or
    perhaps you just witnessed a few winks, figured out what they meant from their contexts, and then learned
    how to accomplish one through trial and error. Geertz pointed out that there are two important aspects to
    winking: the meaning and the action. As both are learned, both are cultural. But perhaps more importantly,
    both the standardized action of winking and the assumed meaning of this action are commonly known among
    members of a group. That is, culture is shared.

    Consider another aspect of human biology: dreaming. People in all societies dream, and no one has to teach
    them how to do it. Dreaming is biologically innate and spontaneously performed. Biological researchers
    hypothesize that dreaming helps the human brain process daily stimuli and convert recent experiences into
    long-term memories. As a biological necessity for brain health, dreaming is natural, not cultural.

    But why do people dream in stories? And why are those stories so often confusing, even troubling? In many
    cultures, people are perplexed by their dreams, never really knowing what the objects and situations they
    dream about are meant to indicate--or if they have any meaning at all. In other cultures, however, dreams are
    recognized as arenas of spiritual communication with supernatural beings. In Ojibwa culture, young people
    are encouraged to fast for up to a week in order to bring on special visionary dreams (Hallowell 1992; Peters-
    Golden 2002, 188-189). In such dreams, a young person may be approached by a guardian spirit who imparts
    knowledge for successful hunting, warfare, or medicine. People are discouraged from discussing the meaning
    of these dreams, but young people are taught to expect and anticipate this kind of dream, and they know how
    to interpret the content of such dreams without discussion. The widely shared ability to dream such dreams
    and the shared knowledge to understand their content makes dreaming profoundly cultural among the
    Ojibwa.

    Summing up, when an element of human experience or behavior is learned and shared, we know it is an
    aspect of culture. That delineates the concept of culture to some degree. However, the variety of things that are
    learned and shared by humans in groups is still quite enormous, as indicated by Tylor's rambling list
    (knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, etc.). Instead of thinking of culture as one vast hodgepodge of
    things, it's helpful to break that hodgepodge into three basic elements. These basic elements of culture are
    understood to come together in larger combinations, or aggregates.

3.3 The Elements of Culture

LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Define the concept of material culture and provide examples of material culture.
  · Provide a detailed example of cultural practices.
  · Explain how cultural frames orient our experiences and actions.
  · Describe how norms and values are threaded through culture.
  · Explain how ideologies and worldviews shape our perception of the world around us.

The complex whole of culture can be broken down into three categories: what we make, what we do, and what
we think. The boundaries separating these categories are somewhat artificial because so much of cultural life
involves all of these things at once. However, it's useful to start with the basic building blocks of culture, then
see how those blocks can be put together to produce more complex structures.

Culture Is What We Make

Museums are buildings where objects of historical, artistic, scientific, or cultural interest are displayed. The
Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian has one of the world's largest collections of Native
artifacts, including many two- and three-dimensional objects such as baskets, pottery, and preserved
specimens representative of the lives of Native populations from all areas of the country.

FIGURE 3.5 This basket, woven by Kucadikadi (Mono Lake Paiute) artist Lucy Telles, is an excellent example of the
art of basket weaving. Telles, whose work was done in the early part of the twentieth century, is widely admired for
her use of color and innovative designs. (credit: "Mono Lake Paiute Basket" by Ernest Amoroso, National Museum of
the American Indian/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)

People living in groups learn to craft the things they need in order to make a living in their environment. Early
human ancestors learned how to make sharp blades useful for processing meat. They shared their knowledge
of toolmaking in groups, passing those skills down to younger generations. Objects that are made and used by
humans in group contexts are called material culture. All of the tools developed by early hominins (blades,
arrows, axes, etc.) are examples of material culture. All of the artifacts discovered by archaeologists (buildings,
pottery, beads, etc.) are examples of material culture. The specialized knowledge and skills used for making
material culture are called technology. Today, the word technology is often used to refer to electronic devices
such as smartphones and computers. For anthropologists, both smartphones and obsidian blades are forms of
material culture produced through specialized technologies. That is, technology refers to the knowledge and
skills required to make blades, phones, and other objects of material culture.

Material culture is not just found in museums, of course. Material culture is all around. All of the furniture,
appliances, books, dishes, and pictures on the walls in a typical American home are elements of material
culture, and they reveal a great deal about the whole way of life of a society.

Consider the toothbrush. It would be possible for people to clean their teeth with a found object such as a twig
74  3 · Culture Concept Theory: Theories of Cultural Change

    or leaf, or even with a finger. Ancient peoples often used a special chew stick, a twig with a frayed end. The
    bristled toothbrush was invented in 15th-century China and spread across Europe and into the United States,
    where it began to be mass produced in the late 19th century. Drugstores now feature many styles of toothbrush
    with an array of special features. Specialized teams design, manufacture, and market this wide variety of
    toothbrushes to consumers. Parents buy toothbrushes for their children and teach them the conventional
    techniques for brushing their teeth (little circles, two minutes, etc.). As adults, people often isolate themselves
    in a special room to brush their teeth in privacy. Even so, toothbrushing is a profoundly social act, relying on
    shared knowledge and observance of social norms for hygiene and health.

    Trees, rocks, microbes, and planets are all material objects, but they are not material culture unless they are
    made and used by humans in group contexts. For instance, a tree growing in a natural forest is not an object of
    material culture. However, an apple tree can be material culture if it is planted by a farmer in an orchard
    designed to produce fruit for human consumption. A microbe can be material culture if it is manufactured to
    improve human digestion or genetically engineered to fight cancer.

    FIGURE 3.6 This rock is on display in the British Museum. While a rock is not in and of itself material culture, this
    rock, which carries special meaning for those who view it, is. (credit: Archaeomoonwalker/Wikimedia Commons, CC
    BY 3.0)

    On display in the Cleveland Museum of Natural History is a gray rock. This rock was simply found by humans
    and never shaped for any particular use. Sitting there in the museum, it has no specific purpose other than to
    serve as an object of popular contemplation. Though it is a fairly unremarkable lump of basalt, thousands of
    people stop to gaze at this rock, reading the sign that describes how it was obtained, marveling at its presence
    there in the museum. Why? What's so interesting about a rock? This particular rock was collected by
    astronauts on the Apollo 12 mission to the moon. The rock serves as evidence of this magnificent feat of
    scientific engineering and a source of great pride to the culture that accomplished such a mission. We go to
    museums to view the items on display there, but clearly, the human activities surrounding those objects are
    what make them interesting to us. That is, culture is not just material objects--it's also what we do and what we
    think.

    Culture Is What We Do

    Ahmed is a carpet seller in the Istanbul Grand Bazaar. Every day, people from all over the world come into his
    stall to examine, and sometimes buy, the carpets in his inventory. Anthropologist Patricia Scalco (2019) met
    Ahmed while she was conducting research on market exchange in Istanbul. She carefully observed the set of
    sales strategies he had crafted to respond to customer desires and knowledge. When anyone pauses at the
    entrance, Ahmed greets the potential customer and ushers the person into his stall. Bringing out a silver
    platter, Ahmed offers the customer a cup of tea, a welcoming gesture. As the customer browses, Ahmed

3.3 · The Elements of Culture                                                                                       75

initiates a carefully constructed conversation designed to determine what sort of person this customer is, what
they are looking for, and what they really know (and do not know) about carpets. He pulls out various carpets
from the stacks, unfurling them as he describes their distinctive qualities. Ahmed identifies this interaction as
a sort of game he must play with his customers. European tourists in this Turkish marketplace are often
inspired by the desire for handmade traditional crafts made by local rural ethnic groups such as the Kurds.
These days, however, most carpets sold in the Istanbul market are industrially produced in Pakistan, India, and
China. However, in his many years of selling carpets, Ahmed has learned that he must play to Western
orientalist fantasies, weaving a distinctive story around the origins and manufacture of a carpet, in order to
win a sale. Like other merchants in this market, Ahmed has a family to support, and he cannot afford to openly
contradict the knowledge and desires of his customers.

Centered on the material culture of carpets, Ahmed's work illustrates the importance of what people do and
what they think in the making of cultural life. What people do and what they think are nonmaterial elements of
culture. In his everyday interactions with customers, Ahmed has developed a set of habitual practices
involving gesture and speech. Anthropologists use the term cultural practices to refer to this form of culture.
Routine speech communicates meanings and values (such as the "authenticity" of a carpet), while routine
action organizes social events (such as, hopefully, a sale). People from all walks of life develop similar
combinations of habitual action and speech that constitute the everyday culture of people in those
circumstances.

What do you do in the morning to get ready for the day? That is cultural practice. What do you do when
someone comes over to your house? That is cultural practice. What do you do when you're hungry? That is
cultural practice. Some cultural anthropologists focus on these everyday practices as keys to understanding
culture, while others are more interested in special events such as ceremonies and festivals.

For instance, Carnival in Brazil is an annual festival of music and dance held every year to mark the beginning
of the Catholic season of Lent. Parades of costumed dancers throng the streets of many cities, interacting with
the audience and attracting crowds of followers. Cultural anthropologist Kenneth Williamson (2012) studied
Carnival in Salvador, Bahia, in the north of Brazil. While Brazilian Carnival is framed as a national celebration,
Williamson found that Carnival in the poorer and largely Black city of Salvador is distinctively animated by the
politics of race. Local Carnival dance groups incorporate Black forms of movement such as capoeira, a
combination of dance and martial art techniques created by Brazilian enslaved peoples. Forms of music and
religion originating in Africa also contribute to the distinctiveness of Salvadoran Carnival. Carnival has
become increasingly commercialized as a tourist attraction in Salvador, bringing in Black and White tourists
alike. Black Brazilian activists complain that forms of Black culture are being appropriated and exploited as
forms of cultural leisure with little understanding of their deep cultural meanings as expressions of resistance
and survival. Meanwhile, most Black Salvadorans enjoy little benefit from the burgeoning tourist economy.

The practices of Turkish carpet merchants and Brazilian Carnival participants are both ways of doing culture,
every day and on special occasions. As we see in both examples, the materials and actions of culture are
infused with patterns of thought, some shared and some controversial. These ways of thinking constitute a
third element of culture.

Culture Is What We Think

Imagine that you are walking down the street and you see a building. You notice a mailbox next to a driveway.
You follow a little walkway lined with flowers to a front door. Below your feet, you find a mat that says,
"Welcome!" Peering through a window, you see a central room where two people are sitting on a couch, eating
chips, and watching television. Off to the side, there's a hallway. You can barely see the stockinged feet of a
small person resting on a bed. A dog barks.

What kind of place is this? Are you sure? How do you know?

Now imagine you are walking down the street and see another building. There are neon lights in the front
window and a large paved area to the side. As you enter the front door, a little bell jingles and young woman in
a white blouse greets you from behind a long table. To one side of that table is a large black machine with
buttons and numbers on it. The young woman carries a small leather folder in her hand and gives you an
76  3 · Culture Concept Theory: Theories of Cultural Change

    expectant smile. You look around to find a room full of people seated at tables of various sizes. Young people in
    white tops and black pants are scurrying here and there, some carrying giant platters. You hear music in the
    background. You smell something delicious.

    What kind of place is this? How do you know?

    In both scenarios, elements of material culture are combined with patterns of action and speech. In order to
    make sense of these two scenarios, we must use shared ways of thinking about them. What we know about the
    way of life in our society leads us to identify the first scenario as somebody's home. What we know about the
    circumstances of eating in public leads us to identify the second scenario as a restaurant.

    These patterned, shared ways of making sense of situations are called cultural frames. Cultural frames tell
    people where they are, what role they they play in that context, and what forms of behavior and speech are
    expected and appropriate. There are cultural frames for places, times, events, and relationships. If a couple
    have been dating for over a year, they probably use a cultural frame for romantic relationships to structure
    their actions and expectations in that relationship. And if one of the romantic partners invites the other to
    spend a holiday with their family, the invited person will probably summon a cultural frame for that holiday to
    tell them what to expect and how to behave.

    Cultural frames are complex cognitive models that incorporate various roles and actions patterned in space
    and time. A cultural role is a conventionalized position held by a person or persons in a particular context or
    situation. Sociocultural roles are associated with certain behaviors and actions. For example, "mother" is a
    sociocultural role in the cultural frame of "family." "Waiter" is a sociocultural role in the cultural frame of
    "restaurant." While these roles are found in many cultures, the actions and behaviors associated with them
    vary significantly across cultural contexts.

    In cultures that celebrate Mother's Day, it is conventional to send one's mother a card along with flowers and/or
    a gift. Anyone who has ever been shopping for a Mother's Day card has been bombarded with images and text
    that convey the stereotypical behaviors and preferences associated with motherhood. Many Mother's Day
    cards feature pastel flower arrangements with birds, butterflies, and delicate calligraphy. The text lionizes the
    emotional and material work of motherhood, praising the constant care and sacrifice of the good mother. In
    return, the card promises eternal gratitude.

FIGURE 3.7 This American Mother's Day card from 1916 would still be considered appropriate today. The norm for

The behaviors and actions associated with a sociocultural role are collectively called a norm. Norms are not
necessarily "normal" in the sense that they represent the most common features and behaviors exhibited by
people in a certain role. Do all mothers prefer pastel flower motifs over, say, images of books or sports? Rather,
norms tend to be idealized, a fantasy about how people in a role behave--or how they should behave. Why do
we associate flowers, pastels, cursive, and self-sacrifice with motherhood?

The answer lies in another thinking element of culture: values. Cultural values are notions about what is good,
true, correct, appropriate, or beautiful. A certain mainstream way of thinking about motherhood indicates that
mothers should be delicate and feminine, concerned with beauty and decorum. Moreover, mothers should
nurture and sustain growth. What better way of conveying these notions than through the imagery of pastel
flower arrangements? Messages of gratitude describe the sort of behavior considered appropriate to mothers.
A "good" mother is a mother who puts her children at the center of her life at all times, neglecting her own
interests for the benefit of her family.

In any culture, norms indicate how people should behave, and values explain why they should behave that way.
For example, the norm for women in the 1950s was to get married and work in the home rather than have a job
in the public workforce. Not that all women did this, or even most. Many mothers, particularly women of color,
were obliged to work outside the home just to make a living for their families. Nonetheless, normative
depictions of women as housewives dominated media and public discourse in mid-20th-century America,
establishing this idealistic norm. Why were mothers supposed to stay at home? A set of "family values"
appointed fathers as the breadwinning heads of household, while mothers were relegated to serving men by
keeping house and caring for children. Thus, the values that came to be associated with motherhood were
subservience, self-sacrifice, gentleness, and nurture--the very values we see celebrated on Mother's Day cards.

Norms and values can combine in larger models that depict how various social realms operate, such as the
family, the economy, the supernatural, and the political sphere. These models are known as ideologies. An
ideology identifies the entities, roles, behaviors, relationships, and processes in a particular realm as well as
the rationale behind the whole system. Take democracy, for instance. The political ideology of democracy
78  3 · Culture Concept Theory: Theories of Cultural Change

    envisions a society of equal individual citizens who each cast a vote on proposals for government action. The
    majority vote wins. The essential roles in this ideology are citizen voters and government. The essential
    actions are voting and government action. The rationale is that government should obey the wishes of the
    citizenry.

    Is this how democracy really works, though? What about the influence of powerful organizations such as the
    media and large corporations? Moreover, in most democracies, people do not vote directly on government
    policies but rather elect representatives, who craft laws and then vote on those laws themselves. Those
    representatives are accountable to citizens through the process of voting, but they are also strongly influenced
    by lobbyists representing business interests and the campaign donations of wealthy individuals and groups.
    Obviously, this ideology is a simplification of the way any democratic system really works. Ideologies are
    always partial, foregrounding the perspectives of some people in society while obscuring the perspectives of
    others.

    A worldview is a very broad ideology that shapes how the members of a culture generally view the world and
    their place in it. Worldviews tend to span several realms, including religion, economics, and politics. A
    worldview provides an overarching model for the purpose and process of social life, depicting "how the world
    works." Many West African cultures, for instance, are shaped by a worldview that identifies the rationale of
    society in the accumulation and distribution of material goods in extended families, communities, and the
    nation as a whole. People rise to leadership through their ability to accumulate wealth, but they are strongly
    obligated to distribute that wealth through their extended families and communities by funding the education
    and business ventures of family members and helping those in need. Beyond the family, the actions of political
    and business leaders are shaped by this worldview as well. A political leader is expected to support the
    generation of wealth while also making sure that the benefits are spread through the community. Moreover,
    leaders are expected to maintain relationships with departed ancestors who watch over their descendants.
    Through periodic rituals and offerings, leaders petition ancestors to bless their families and communities with
    prosperity and good fortune.

    3.4 The Aggregates of Culture

    LEARNING OUTCOMES

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:
      · Explain how elements of culture combine in aggregates.
      · Give three detailed examples of cultural symbols.
      · Explain how symbols are embedded in rituals.
      · Describe how social structures organize important cultural processes.

    An aggregate is a combination of elements. What we make, what we do, and what we think all combine in larger
    aggregates of culture. For instance, it's pretty clear that toothbrushes, moon rocks, restaurants, and Mother's
    Day cards must be understood as aggregates of material objects, practices, and ideas. In order to fully
    understand the toothbrush as a cultural object, we must examine not only its design and production but also
    how people use toothbrushes and why they use them. A set of routine practices surround our cultural objects
    (brushing), and those practices are supported by cultural ideas (hygiene).

    Symbols

    A symbol is an object, image, gesture, vocalization, or event conventionally associated with a particular
    meaning. anthropologist Jennifer Hasty was conducting fieldwork in Ghana during an election year, she
    noticed that the posters and pamphlets of one politician featured a broom. Confused, she asked a friend why a
    male politician would choose a humble domestic tool associated with women's work as his political motif.
    Making a sweeping motion with her hands, she explained, "Because he is promising to sweep away all the
    corruption." Turns out, he was the not the first to use this symbol. Over time, the broom has come to acquire
    political meaning as a symbolic anti-corruption tool in Ghana.

Ghanian politics, where they are understood as a symbol of a politician's intent to sweep away corruption. (credit:

Colors, shapes, gestures, animals, plants--all of these commonly acquire specific cultural meaning. For a
Hindu wedding, a bride typically wears a bright red sari, as red is an auspicious color associated with change,
passion, and prosperity. White, on the other hand, is typically worn to Indian funerals.
Symbols are useful cultural aggregates because they provide a kind of shorthand for expressing complex ideas.
Consider the American bumper sticker shown in Figure 3.9.

FIGURE 3.9 This popular American bumper sticker incorporates a variety of religious and social symbols. (credit:
"Coexistence" by Rusty Clark/flickr, CC BY 2.0)
Combining symbols from Islam, Judaism, Taoism, Christianity, paganism, women, men, and the peace
movement, this sticker aims to promote multicultural diversity. Rather than listing the various religions,
identities, and ideologies and describing the conflicts among them, the message simply incorporates their
symbols into a word urging mutual tolerance.
Although symbols have conventional meanings, they can mean different things in different contexts or to
different people. Although the intended meaning of the above bumper sticker is diversity, some people
80  3 · Culture Concept Theory: Theories of Cultural Change

    interpret it as an emblem of radical atheism. In the wake of the 2016 presidential election, some Americans
    started wearing safety pins to show their solidarity with LGBTQIA+ people, people of color, and others who had
    become targets of post-election harassment. For some, however, the safety pin symbolized pretentiousness
    and hypocrisy.

    Ritual

    Combining objects, actions, and meanings, ritual is a special kind of repeated, patterned action conventionally
    associated with a particular meaning. Rituals incorporate symbols and roles along with routinized activities
    such as gestures, music, and movement. Many rituals are performed by specialists in group settings to
    accomplish specific group or individual goals. Rituals bring together symbols, practices, and worldviews.

    Consider this popular American ritual. On the first Sunday in February, many Americans gather in each other's
    homes to watch the annual championship game of the National Football League (NFL) on television. So
    widespread is this practice that stores are nearly empty and many Christian churches cancel afternoon and
    evening activities. As a whole, the ritual consists of many roles and relationships as well as patterned actions
    and conventional meanings. At the heart of the action are the two teams competing against one another in a
    chaotic game featuring an oddly shaped ball carried forward in campaigns of full-frontal assault across a
    carefully marked field. The players are surrounded by referees, coaches, camera people, and cheerleaders,
    each group having a strategic role in the action. Surrounding the field are commentators who interpret and
    contextualize, giving meaning to the actions of the game. At home, some people watch the game closely,
    exclaiming with joy or disappointment and commenting on the comments of the commentators. Other people
    socialize with one another, watching the game intermittently. Vast amounts of food and drink are consumed by
    Americans on Super Bowl Sunday. Typical foods include potato chips, dips, barbecued chicken wings, and
    pizza. Beer is the beverage of choice for this occasion. An event celebrating competition, spectatorship, and
    consumption, Super Bowl Sunday is an effective ritual for reinforcing dominant values in a society structured
    by corporate capitalism. Notions of gender, race, and class are threaded through the various levels of play and
    consumption as well.

    In the Akan communities of central and southern Ghana, in West Africa, leaders perform a ritual called Adae
    that uses important cultural symbols and reinforces cultural commitments to authority, ancestors, and shared
    prosperity. In the Akan society, people are given special wooden stools to mark certain stages in life, such as
    puberty and marriage. A person's stool is said to contain the personal power of the owner, symbolizing the life
    essence of that person.

nkonuafieso. Twice every 42 days (once on a Wednesday and once on a Sunday), a community leader makes a
procession to the stool house of the ancestral leaders of the community. Entering the stool house, the leader
must remove their sandals and lower the cloth worn draped around their shoulders, symbolizing their
humility and respect for the ancestors. Then the leader greets the ancestral leaders one by one, making
offerings of drink and food and asking for blessings and prosperity for the community.

Special rituals called rites of passage are used to mark the movement of a person from one social status to
another. Naming ceremonies, puberty rites, weddings, and funerals are all common rites of passage.
Anthropologist Arnold van Gennep (1960) identified three stages in rites of passage: separation, transition,
and incorporation. In the first phase, separation, individuals, or groups are taken out of their everyday social
context, leaving their original social status. In the second phase, transition, people exist in an in-between state
outside of conventional norms of dress and action. In this phase, people are often dressed in special costume,
made to engage in unusual behaviors, and taught special forms of secret knowledge. In the third phase, people
are brought back into society in a formal ceremony and introduced as subjects in a new social category.

Initiation rituals are a common rite of passage in many societies. In many African societies that practice
initiation, young people are gathered together in a group and taken to a special camp outside the town or
village. This constitutes the separation phase. In the next phase, transition, members of the group are often
dressed alike and made to follow a common set of rules and schedule of activities. They may be required to
perform unusual feats, such as eating strange foods. Their bodies may be scarified or tattooed. Elders give
them special knowledge essential to performing their future roles as women or men. For instance, girls may
learn explicit lessons about conception and childbirth. Finally, when the transition is complete, initiates are
returned to the town or village and presented as women or men. Often, the completion of initiation marks a
young woman as formally eligible for courtship and marriage.

Social Structure

The way a society is formally organized is called social structure. Typically, a society organizes a set of routine
activities and objects in space and time to accomplish a particular function, such as community decision-
making, the production and circulation of goods, or religious observance. Social structure is the framework for
those realms, designating when, where, how, and by whom these functions are accomplished. Social structures
combine material culture (such as buildings) with practices (such as meetings) and ideas (such as the rules
and procedures of those meetings).

Consider the social structure of community decision-making, or the political realm. In some societies,
community decisions are routinely made under the authority of a person inhabiting an inherited political
office, called a chief or king (such as the Akans, discussed in the last section). Chiefs often have a council of
community elders, the heads of local extended families. A chief is expected to consult with this council in all
community matters. Other groups in society may represent the interests of youth, women, farmers, or traders.
Each group will have its own leader who communicates directly with the local chief. Regular procedures
govern how issues are raised and discussed and how decisions are taken. Together, the groups, roles,
relationships, and procedures all constitute the social structure of the political system.

Rather than seeing social structure as fixed and immobile, some anthropologists emphasize that people
continually make and alter their social structures through everyday forms of interpretation, participation, and
resistance. These processes mean that social structures are always subject to a variety of forces in a constant
state of change.

    3.5 Modes of Cultural Analysis

    LEARNING OUTCOMES

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:
      · Explain how evolutionary theories have been applied to the study of human culture.
      · Identify two critiques of evolutionary approaches.
      · Describe how anthropologists have studied the functionality of culture.
      · Distinguish Malinowski's functionalism from Radcliffe-Brown's structural functionalism.
      · Explain how ontological anthropology defines the study of reality.

    Anthropologists have a number of ways of studying the elements and aggregates of culture. Some approaches
    emphasize the development of a particular aspect of culture over time, while other approaches examine how
    the different parts of culture fit together.

    Evolution, Adaptation, and Historical Particularism

    Some anthropologists are interested in the origins of human cultural forms and how these forms have changed
    over long periods of time. Just as Charles Darwin applied the notion of evolution to explain how biological
    species change over time, many 19th-century anthropologists used evolution to explain how cultures changed
    over time. This approach is called cultural evolutionism. Like Darwin, these anthropologists believed that
    simple forms evolved into more complex forms. Comparing different cultures of the world, they assigned the
    ones they considered more rudimentary to earlier evolutionary stages, while the ones they considered more
    complex were assigned to the more advanced stages. For example, British anthropologist Edward Tylor argued
    that human culture evolved from savagery through barbarism to civilization. He identified savagery with
    people who used gathering and hunting to meet their basic needs. The domestication of animals and plants
    was associated with barbarism. Civilization resulted from more advanced forms of farming, trade, and
    manufacturing as well as the development of the alphabet. Not surprisingly, British scholars identified their
    own culture as highly civilized.

    Elaborating on Tylor's scheme, American anthropologist Lewis Henry Morgan subdivided each of these three
    stages into an even more elaborate model and proposed a mechanism for moving from stage to stage. Morgan
    focused on technology as the primary driver of cultural evolution. New and better ways of making things,
    according to Morgan, resulted in new patterns of social practice and thought. Advanced technology was
    associated with advanced civilization.

    But is technology the only measure of cultural accomplishment, or even the best one? Members of societies in
    which people gather and hunt for a living have vast stores of knowledge about their environments. Typically,
    they can name hundreds of plant species and tell when and where to find each of them. Many hunters can
    examine animal tracks to discern the species, sex, age, and condition of the animal as well as how long ago the
    tracks were laid. People in these societies also actively sustain and nurture diversity in their environments,
    careful to avoid depleting important resources. Is it really accurate to think of such cultures as simple? All
    cultures are complex, though in different ways. Technology is highly valued in American culture, while
    environmental knowledge and sustainability have historically been less valued. Is it any wonder that early
    American anthropologists ranked other cultures according to one of their own most cherished values? Perhaps
    people in more environmentally sustainable cultures might consider the United States to be an example of
    environmental savagery.

    Both Tylor and Morgan, like most anthropologists of their day, thought that all cultures passed through this
    single set of stages in the march toward civilization. This kind of theory is called unilineal evolution.
    Disagreeing with this way of thinking, anthropologists such as Franz Boas argued that there is no single line of
    cultural evolution but that each culture changes according to its own unique historical trajectory. Moreover,
    cultures evolve not in isolation but in constant interaction with one another. Rather than focusing on
    technological changes within a culture, Boas highlighted the diffusion of material objects, practices, and ideas
    among cultures in complex relations of trade, migration, and conquest.

    Though theories of unilineal cultural evolution have been largely abandoned, some anthropologists are still

interested in discovering regular patterns that might govern how human cultures change over long periods of
time. In the 1950s, American anthropologist Julian Steward developed an approach called cultural ecology,
recognizing the importance of environmental factors by focusing on how humans adapt to various
environments. Steward's approach showed how humans in each environmental zone develop a set of core
cultural features that enable them to make a living. Central to each cultural core are ways of getting or making
all the resources necessary for human survival--in particular, food, clothing, and shelter. Similarly,
anthropologist Marvin Harris developed a theory called cultural materialism, arguing that technology and
economic factors are fundamental to culture, molding other features such as family life, religion, and politics.

Though recognizing the importance of cultural change, many anthropologists reject the notion that all cultures
change according to a general universal model, such as cultural materialism. Drawing from the Boasian notion
that each culture follows its own historical path; many cultural anthropologists analyze change in terms of
historical particularism. In this approach, contemporary processes are understood as products of the unique
combination of internal and external forces unfolding over time in a particular culture.

Functionalism

Rejecting the comparative unilineal models that assigned each culture to an evolutionary stage, a number of
cultural anthropologists developed a radically different approach that attempts to understand each
contemporary culture in its own terms. Functionalism seeks to understand the purpose of the elements and
aggregates of culture in the here and now.

Bronislaw Malinowski, an early proponent of this approach, argued that the function of culture is to meet
human needs. All humans need to satisfy the need for food, clothing, and shelter. The fundamental purpose of
culture is to provide a means of satisfying those needs. In the course of meeting those basic needs, humans in
all cultures develop a set of derived needs--that is, needs derived from the basic ones. Derived needs include
the need to organize work and distribute resources. Family structures and gender roles are examples of
cultural elements addressing these derived needs. Finally, cultures also address a set of integrative needs,
providing people with guiding values and purpose in life. Religion, law, and ideologies fulfill these integrative
needs. Malinowski sought to understand both the biological and psychological functions of culture.

At first glance, this approach may not seem all that different from evolutionary approaches that identify the
core set of cultural features devoted to human survival. What was so different in Malinowski's approach was
his attempt to show that even so-called primitive societies had functionally complex cultural systems for
meeting the full array of human needs. Malinowski's three-volume ethnography of the economics, religion, and
kinship of the Trobriand people of Papua New Guinea demonstrated this fact in striking and elaborate detail.

A second version of functionalism, advocated by British anthropologist Alfred R. Radcliffe-Brown, identified
the functions of various elements of culture in a slightly different way. Rather than looking for the way culture
satisfies biological or psychological needs, structural functionalism focused more on how the various
structures in society reinforce one another. Culture is not a random assortment of structural features but a set
of structures that fit together into a coherent whole. Common norms and values are threaded through the
family structure, the economy, the political system, and the religion of a culture. Structural functionalists
conceptualized culture as a kind of machine with many small parts all working in tandem to keep the machine
operating properly. While recognizing the value of this approach, contemporary anthropologists have
complicated the mechanistic model of culture by pointing out that the various elements of culture come into
conflict just as often as they reinforce one another. Although few anthropologists would now identify
themselves as structural functionalists, the holistic approach to culture as an integrated system is derived
from this important theoretical foundation.

Structuralism

In the previous paragraph, you learned about structural functionalism, an approach that marries
functionalism with social structure. In a different sense, the term structure can refer to patterns of thought
embedded in the culture of a people--that is, conceptual structure. French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss
pioneered this approach, sometimes called French structuralism. Lévi-Strauss considered culture to be a
system of symbols that could be analyzed in the various realms of culture, including myths, religion, and
84  3 · Culture Concept Theory: Theories of Cultural Change

    kinship. In these realms of culture, objects and people are organized into symbolic systems of classification,
    often structured around binary oppositions. Binary oppositions are pairs of terms that are opposite in
    meaning, such as light/dark, female/male, and good/evil. For example, kinship systems are varied and
    complex, but they are fundamentally structured by oppositions such as male versus female, older versus
    younger, and relation by blood versus relation by marriage. Lévi-Strauss examined myths as well, showing how
    the characters and plots emphasize binary oppositions. Consider the many European folktales featuring an
    evil stepmother (Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty), a character that combines the opposition of good versus evil
    with the opposition of blood relation versus relation by marriage. Lévi-Strauss argued that myths operate as
    public arenas for conceptually pondering and processing the fundamental categories and relations of a
    culture.

    Ontology

    In recent decades, some cultural anthropologists have come to focus on the nature of reality, including but not
    limited to human perspectives and experiences. Ontology is the study of the true nature of existence. In some
    cultures, for instance, the social world consists not only of embodied persons but also of spirit beings, such as
    ancestors and witches, who interact with people in mysterious ways. And in some cultures, people are not just
    bodies but assemblages that include souls, spirits, characters, or fates. Ontological anthropology explores
    how culture constructs our social and natural realities, what we consider real, and how we act on those
    assumptions. Reaching beyond human realities, ontological anthropology also attempts to include nonhuman
    perspectives, relationships, and forms of communication.

    For instance, in his provocative ethnography How Forests Think (2013), anthropologist Eduardo Kohn
    describes how the web of life in the Amazon rainforest consists of continual communication among plants,
    animals, and humans. He examines how Amazonian peoples engage with dogs, spirits, the dead, pumas, rivers,
    and even sounds. Humans and these nonhuman beings are both antagonistic and interdependent in this
    interactive web. Predators and prey read one another's behavior, interpreting intentions and motivations.
    Kohn's effort is to get beyond conventional modes of human thought and language to understand how humans
    are embedded in nonhuman ecological realities.

            PROFILES IN ANTHROPOLOGY

    Dame Mary Douglas
    1921-2007

    Dame Mary Douglas (https://www.openstax.org/r/wiki_Mary_Douglas).

    Personal History: Mary Douglas was born in San Remo, Italy; her British parents had stopped off on their way
    home from Burma, where her father had been working as a colonial civil servant. As children, Mary and her
    younger sister lived with their mother's parents in England until they were old enough to be sent to Catholic
    boarding school--a fairly common practice for the children of colonial officers. After the death of her mother
    and her dearly loved maternal grandfather, young Mary found security in the order and routine of the convent
    school (Lyons 2011). This respect for rules and order combined with a reverence for the Catholic Church to
    shape her lifelong commitment to studying the sacred aspects of the social order.

    Area of Anthropology: At Oxford, Douglas studied with the prominent structural functionalist E. E. Evans-
    Pritchard. From him, she learned that African belief systems such as witchcraft were structured by an
    underlying logic. In this approach, the goal of fieldwork is to examine oral forms of culture as well as ritual and
    social practice in order to discern the underlying logic that governs culture as a whole. Douglass went to the
    Kasai region of what was then the Belgian Congo, where she studied how the Lele people used animals in
    practical and symbolic ways. She was particularly interested in a strange animal called the pangolin. Though a
    mammal, the pangolin has scales and no teeth.

3.5 · Modes of Cultural Analysis                                                                                     85

FIGURE 3.11 This pangolin is classified as a mammal but has scales like a reptile or fish. Pangolin were considered
sacred to the Lele people, who did not classify them as a food animal. (credit: Official photographer of the U.S.
Embassy in Ghana/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)

Douglas described how the Lele observed a fundamental distinction between edible and inedible animals.
Animals who lived among humans, such as rats and domesticated chickens, were considered part of society
and therefore inedible (most of the time). Only wild animals were considered food. Pangolins are wild animals,
but the Lele did not eat them (usually). Why? Douglas argued that the weirdness of the pangolin made people
single it out for special consideration. Pangolins have scales like fish, but they live on land and climb trees.
They look vaguely reptilian, but they do not lay eggs, instead giving birth to live young. Rather than teeth, they
have long snouts that they use to vacuum up small insects. Thus, the pangolin defied the conventional
categories the Lele used for dividing up the animal world. This breach of categories made the pangolin both
repellent and sacred to the Lele. Members of a special fertility cult engaged in rituals in which they ate
pangolins to ingest the power of this anomalous animal.

As this examination of cultural categories and anomalies suggests, Douglas was also influenced by Claude
Lévi-Strauss and the approach of French structuralism. Like Lévi-Strauss, Douglas viewed culture as a
coherent system of categories that were expressed in oral culture and social practice.

Accomplishments in the Field: Following her work on the Lele people, Douglas went on to conduct a broadly
comparative study of objects, practices, and people that were considered ritually dangerous, subject to rules of
prohibition called taboos. She showed how the subjects of taboos are often "matter out of place" (Douglas 1966,
44), things that defy conventional categories for dividing up the social and natural world. In her most famous
work, Purity and Danger (1966), Douglas examines a wide range of taboos, such as rules against eating certain
foods or engaging in sex at certain times or with certain persons. She examines the set of social and dietary
rules established by ancient Hebrews, detailed in the book of Leviticus in the Old Testament. According to
these rules, the Jewish people were forbidden from eating pigs, shellfish, and certain wild animals. They were
not allowed to wear garments made of cloth that combined different fibers--such as, for example, a linen-
cotton blend. Men were prohibited from having sex with menstruating women. In fact, women were
considered so unclean during menstruation that anyone or anything that touched a menstruating woman
became contaminated for the rest of that day.

What do all of these prohibitions have in common? Douglas shows how each forbidden object or condition
produced discomfort because it transgressed conventional categories. Shellfish, for instance, are sea animals,
but they don't have fins or scales, and many of them do not swim. Menstruation is blood loss, but it does not
indicate injury. Moreover, menstruation is hidden and connected to the dangerous states of pregnancy and
childbirth. In Hebrew law, menstruation itself was considered a dangerous and contaminating exception to the
purity of persons and objects.
86  3 · Culture Concept Theory: Theories of Cultural Change

    In her later work, Douglas applied this style of analysis to a variety of other social phenomena, including
    humor and trickster figures. She argued that humor functions as a release for thoughts and actions that might
    threaten the social order. Whereas taboos regulate and prohibit interaction with dangerous objects, animals,
    and people, humor seeks to sap them of their dangerous power by making light of them.

    Importance of Her Work: After more than 25 years of teaching at the University of London, Douglas moved to
    the United States, where she held positions at the Russell Sage Foundation and Northwestern University. She
    continued to publish widely on such topics as consumerism, environmental risk, and decision-making in
    bureaucracies. When she retired, she moved back to England. In 2006, she was made Dame Commander of the
    Order of the British Empire. She died in 2007 at the age of 86.

    3.6 The Paradoxes of Culture

    LEARNING OUTCOMES

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:
      · Identify four paradoxes in the concept of culture.
      · Define four mechanisms of cultural change.
      · Provide a detailed example of the mobility of culture.
      · Describe culture as an arena of argument and contest.
      · Explain how members of a culture can have different versions of their shared culture.

    As European immigrants settled in the western frontier of the United States, they faced the challenge of
    reinventing the elements of culture familiar to them in very different environmental and social conditions.
    Used to living in houses made of wooden planks or logs, they found themselves on vast plains with very few
    trees. A common adaptation to this environmental limitation was to dig into a slope of earth to create a dugout
    home with turf walls and roof.

    FIGURE 3.12 This Nebraska home, photographed with cow on its roof in 1870, was constructed in the side of the
    hill directly behind it. While such dugout homes were practical and functional, those who lived in them typically
    strove to replace them with wood-frame houses, as symbols of wealth and achievement. (credit: Solomon D.
    Butcher/Library of Congress, Public Domain)
    While these homes were perfectly functional, many Euro-American settlers considered them dirty and
    backward. When their farming ventures became prosperous, they often undertook the great expense of
    importing wood from forested areas to build the kind of house familiar to them from life back east, either on
    the East Coast of the United States or in the European countries they originally came from.
    While conducting fieldwork in Lesotho in the 1980s, cultural anthropologist Jim Ferguson observed that

    Access for free at openstax.org
3.6 · The Paradoxes of Culture                                                                                        87

people who became prosperous often replaced their round homes made of mud and stone and thatched roofs
with rectangular ones featuring cement floors and galvanized steel roofs. While the round buildings were
functionally adapted to local conditions, made of local materials, cool on hot days, and warm in cool nights, the
rectangular ones heated up like ovens under the hot sun and were noisy in the rain. The materials were
imported and expensive. Talking to one man who was planning to replace his round house with a rectangular
one made of cement and steel, Ferguson suggested that local building methods and materials might be
superior to foreign ones.

      Looking me carefully in the eye, he asked, "What kind of house does your father have, there in
      America? ... Is it round?" No, I confessed; it was rectangular. "Does it have a grass roof?" No, it did not.
      "Does it have cattle dung for a floor?" No. And then: "How many rooms does your father's house
      have?" ... I mumbled, "About ten, I think." After pausing to let this sink in, he said only: "That is the
      direction we would like to move in." (Ferguson 2006, 18)

In both cases, for Euro-American settlers and Lesotho villagers, the idea of home is not a settled matter but
subject to the forces of environmental adaptation, functionality, social status, and ideological debate. Both
examples illustrate a set of tensions at the heart of the concept of culture. Originally, anthropologists studied
culture as a fairly stable and consensual set of features commonly embraced by the people of a certain
geographical area. In the course of the 20th century, however, anthropologists began to realize that this notion
of culture was misleading and incomplete. In the early 20th century, American anthropologist Franz Boas
argued that the elements of culture are highly mobile, diffusing through the cultural contacts of trade and
migration. Since the 1960s, cultural anthropologists have come to emphasize the controversial aspects of
culture: how people disagree and argue over the dominant values and practices of their societies. Much of this
controversy stems from the unevenness of culture within a society--how people in different social categories
and subgroups participate differently in their common culture, with different versions or perspectives on the
same cultural norms and practices.

Despite these forces of change and controversy, there is something durable and shared about culture, some set
of common elements that distinguishes the whole way of life of each society. Even as cultures change through
innovation and contact, they often hold on to some of their distinctive features. In the 1980s, some scholars
thought that increases in global trade, migration, and technology were transforming all the diverse societies of
the world into one uniform global monoculture. In the 2020s, we see that the opposite has happened. In many
parts of the world, we have seen a resurgence of cultural identities and explicit efforts to maintain, rehabilitate,
and reinvent forms of cultural heritage.

So riddled with contradictions is the concept of culture that some anthropologists have suggested ditching the
whole notion altogether and finding some other concept to bind together the four fields in their pursuit of
knowledge about humanity. Perhaps such an integrated understanding of humanity isn't even possible.

Or maybe the contradictions of culture are the most illuminating aspects of the culture concept. Maybe those
contradictions are anthropology's most important contribution to our understanding of humanity. This
textbook takes the latter approach. Culture is the whole way of life of a people subject to a set of contradictory
forces. These forces constitute four central paradoxes of culture.

Paradox 1: Culture Is Continuous, but It Changes

Cultural materials, practices, and ideas are handed down from older to younger members of a culture, giving
some degree of continuity to culture over time. However, many factors can intervene in this process of cultural
reproduction to subtly alter or dramatically change the elements and aggregates of culture. In some contexts,
younger people either fail to precisely learn the culture of their elders or deliberately reject those cultural
lessons. Through travel and trade, people learn about other ways of doing things, and they take these ideas
back to their own cultures, trying them out to see how they might improve their own ways of life. Accidents and
deliberate experimentation introduce new possibilities. People may simply get tired of doing things one way
over and over and thrill at some refreshing style or craze.

We can identify four main mechanisms of cultural change. These four mechanisms overlap and interact as the
history of a culture unfolds over time. Diffusion is the movement of an element of culture from one society to
88  3 · Culture Concept Theory: Theories of Cultural Change

    another, often through migration or trade. Friction occurs when two or more elements of culture come into
    conflict, resulting in alteration or replacement of those elements. Innovation is the slight alteration of an
    existing element of culture, such as a new style of dress or dance. Invention is the independent creation of a
    new element of culture, such as a new technology, religion, or political form.

    In the examples at the beginning of this section, building techniques and ideals move along with human
    migration to new settings, where they must be altered to fit the materials and challenges of the new
    environment. In colonial and neocolonial contexts, dominant groups may introduce the techniques and ideals
    of their own homelands as "superior" even if they don't work very well in the environments of colonial
    conquest.

    Some cultural inventions are so successful that they transform the whole way of life of a people. Consider the
    information technologies that have reshaped American life since the 1970s, such as computers, the Internet,
    and cell phones. These tools have changed the ways Americans communicate, work, learn, shop, navigate, and
    entertain themselves. Diffusing through trade, these inventions have transformed cultures all over the world in
    diverse ways. In many societies, modes of interacting through communication technologies come into conflict
    with norms for interacting face-to-face, creating friction between the two realms. Where the movements,
    behavior, and social relationships of young women are tightly controlled, for instance, mobile phones allow
    women to secretly make new friends, explore new topics of conversation, and engage in behavior their elders
    might not sanction.

    Sometimes the forces of innovation and invention catch on, and sometimes they don't. In the 1970s, Ralph
    Hasty, a disc jockey from southwest Missouri, moved to Northern California, where he lived and worked for
    many years. There, he learned about a new technology for building houses in the form of geodesic domes,
    structures comprising intersecting polygons assembled from prefabricated kits. In late 1980s, he returned to
    live in southwest Missouri, bringing with him this enthusiasm for geodesic construction. He ordered a kit and
    built a geodesic dome house on a piece of rural land, intending to sell the house and use the profits to build
    more of these geodesic wonders. Well, things did not exactly go to plan. The locals apparently found the house
    far too weird to suit their notion of home. From the outside, the dome looked like some sort of futuristic
    greenhouse or zoo habitat. On the inside, conventional furniture did not fit in the oddly shaped rooms of the
    dome. Once finished, the geodesic home sat on the market for a number of months, and eventually, he had to
    sell it at a loss. It must be mentioned that Ralph Hasty, geodesic innovator, continued to live in a conventional
    rectangular house for the rest of his life.

    FIGURE 3.13 Ralph Hasty stands in front of the geodesic dome he built. Although providing all of the needs of a
    secure and warm dwelling space, it was hard to find a buyer for this unconventional home. (credit: Jennifer Hasty,

Paradox 2: Culture Is Bounded but Mobile

Because many elements of culture are shaped by environmental forces, trading opportunities, and local
histories of settlement, culture becomes associated with territory. But because of the mobility of people,
objects, and ideas, culture rarely stays within the boundaries of any society; rather, it wanders restlessly along
lines of travel, communication, conquest, and trade.

People move around a lot, and this is nothing new. On the popular British television series Time Team,
archaeological excavations all over the United Kingdom uncover artifacts from ancient times that were
produced in far-flung places such as Rome, Scandinavia, and the Middle East. In episode 4 of season 16 (2015),
the team excavated a town in Wales that was constructed by Romans during the time of Roman conquest.
There, archaeologists unearthed the foundations of Roman buildings along with a variety of Roman objects,
including a third-century Roman coin, a Roman tool for removing earwax, a twisted-wire bracelet, and a knife
handle decorated with gladiators. Other Time Team investigations have uncovered artifacts from travelers and
pilgrims to sacred religious sites. These objects have diffused to British cultures through conquest, trade, and
migration. As people move around, so do objects, technologies, practices, and ideas.

However, certain integrated sets of things, practices, and ideas do cluster in certain places. Take a look at the
cloth in Figure 3.15. This kind of cloth is quintessentially African. It's called wax print, and indeed, clothing
made of wax-print cloth is very popular in many parts of Africa. Wax-print cloth is industrially produced cotton
cloth with intricate designs and bold colors. In most African countries, a vast selection of designs and brands of
wax prints can be found in any market. Rather than buying ready-made clothes in clothing shops, people more
often purchase cloth in the market and take it to a seamstress or tailor to be made into the garment of their
own choosing.

Many wax-print designs are symbolic, serving as a means of nonverbal communication for the people who
wear them. Some cloths are associated with proverbs, occasions, monuments, and famous people. In the West
African country of Ghana, many cloth designs are named using the vivid proverbs of the large Akan cultural
group. One popular design features a bird in flight, associated with the Akan proverb Sika wo antaban,
meaning "money takes flight." Another elaborate motif is called Akyekyde? Akyi, or "the back of the tortoise,"
worn by wise people who move through life with slow intention. One design with long, corrugated stripes is
called sugarcane, which is said to mean "I love you like sugar."

    Though iconically associated with African dress, wax print actually originated in Indonesia, derived from local
    techniques for making batik cloth. Batik is made using wax to draw designs on plain cotton cloth that is then
    immersed in a dye bath. When the wax is melted off, the design remains against the background of color. When
    the Dutch colonized Indonesia in the 1700s, Dutch merchants were impressed with the beauty of local batik
    and sought to use their own methods of mass-produced block printing to imitate the vibrant colors and
    elaborate designs of Indonesian cloth.

    In the 1880s, Dutch and British merchants introduced their own mass-produced wax prints to people in their
    African colonies, particularly along the west coast of Africa. Dutch wax cloth was enthusiastically embraced by
    Africans, who began to infuse certain patterns with social meanings. With independence in the mid-20th
    century, many African countries developed their own wax-print textile industries using designs developed by
    local artists.

    Exemplifying the cultural paradox of locality and mobility, wax-print cloth is culturally embedded in African
    culture while carrying a complex history of global trade, appropriation, and colonial domination.

    In the context of global power relations, the mobility of culture poses questions about who has the right to
    claim or use elements of culture diffused from elsewhere. As part of the process of cultural immersion and
    participant observation, many cultural anthropologists adopt the dress, diet, gestures, and language of the
    peoples they study while they are conducting fieldwork. Often, anthropologists bring their love of these
    cultural elements back to their home societies and continue to use and practice them to show their
    appreciation for the cultures they have studied. However, some people may find it unsettling to see a white
    Euro-American anthropologist wearing an African wax-print dress--or a silk sari from India, or an ornately
    woven lliclla cape from Peru. In your travels, have you ever purchased an item of clothing or jewelry worn by
    local peoples? Is it appropriate to wear such items in your home society?

    If someone is using cultural items as a way of honoring that culture, many people would think it's perfectly
    fine. If someone is wearing items from another culture as a form of humorous costume, such as a sports
    mascot or Halloween costume, most people would find that offensive. An even more serious problem emerges
    when a person uses or claims cultural elements from another society in order to make a profit. What if, for
    instance, someone from the American fashion industry copied a wax print motif such as Sika wo antaban,
    using the design for American clothing, housewares, or art? The elements of culture, both material and
    nonmaterial, constitute the intellectual property of the people of that culture. Claiming or using the elements
    of another culture inappropriately is called cultural appropriation.

appropriate to certain people in certain situations. That is to say, culture is consensual; through their words
and actions, people agree to a certain way of doing things. As discussed earlier in this chapter, culture includes
conventionalized roles, behavioral norms, and shared ideas for framing situations.

For example, imagine that someone in the United States has just graduated from college and is looking for a
job. What should that person do? In the United States, it is common to spend time crafting an impressive
résumé, using a specific form of technical language that accentuates the quality of a person's skills and
experiences while demonstrating their educational background. Instead of listing "worked as a camp
counselor," someone might indicate that they "developed systems of cooperative leadership among youth in an
environmental awareness program." A recent graduate would likely post this linguistic masterpiece to a job
search website such as Indeed.com.

For many people in China, such a strategy would seem very rudimentary and even grossly inadequate. Seeking
opportunities for education, employment, and business, people in China frequently rely on a cultural system
known as guanxi. Informed by Confucianism, guanxi refers to gifts and favors exchanged among people in
wide social networks based on mutual benefit. Guanxi is based on family ties but also includes relationships
formed in schools, in workplaces, and even among strangers who meet at parties or through mutual friends
(Yin 2017). While still in school, a student may be on the lookout for people who might be able provide access
to employment opportunities in the future. Using the practices of guanxi, the student would seek to establish
personalized links with such people in the hope that these links might prove advantageous in the future.

Say, for instance, a student hopes to get a job in solar technology after graduation. That student might seek out
professors whose teaching and research suggest connections in that industry. To establish relations of guanxi,
the student would not only take courses from that professor but also attempt to establish some sort of personal
rapport. This is typically done through strategic gift giving. In a particularly brutal winter, a student might knit
a sweater for the professor. An artistically inclined student might sketch a portrait of the professor and frame it
as a gift. Importantly, the gift must go slightly beyond the bounds of their professional relationship as professor
and student. Over time, the student might find ways to meet with the professor, further cementing the social
bond. After carefully cultivating this personalized relationship over months or years, the student might then
ask the professor to use industry connections to help them find a job.

What this means is that personal connections can be just as important as, if not more important than, the
language or qualifications of a person's résumé. While Americans emphasize the importance of job-search
techniques, personal connections also play a role in securing employment in the American context,
particularly in highly paid, competitive industries such as software development and finance. In many
societies, people prefer to work with people they trust. Rather than hiring a random stranger, many prefer to
hire someone recommended by a trusted friend or business partner. In guanxi relationships, relations of trust
are established through the exchange of gifts and favors over time.

But what if the people who are hired in competitive industries are the ones who deployed their strategic social
connections and not necessarily the ones who are most skilled, talented, or otherwise best suited to the work?
What if the companies who are hired to complete infrastructure projects such as roads and bridges are not
necessarily the most competent or experienced ones but those who have given strategic gifts to government
officials? What if people use their guanxi networks to obtain special privileges, such as government licenses or
social services? Legal scholar Ling Li (2011) argues that some people use the cultural system of guanxi to
facilitate and rationalize bribery and other acts of corruption.

In 2012, the Chinese government launched an ambitious campaign against corruption among government
officials. More than 100,000 people have been investigated and charged with corruption, including many high-
ranking government officials, military officers, and senior executives of state-owned companies. Investigations
have revealed how powerful people use their extensive guanxi networks to secure deals, exert influence, and
extract goods and services. The campaign against corruption in China raises questions about the morality and
legality of guanxi practices.

Although guanxi is a widely accepted system for gaining access to goods, services, and opportunities, people
who don't have elite connections may feel that this informal cultural system is unfair. For personal or ethical
reasons, some people may challenge or resist the practices of guanxi. Chinese journalist Lijia Zhang (2013)
92  3 · Culture Concept Theory: Theories of Cultural Change

    describes how she was denied a promotion in her first job because she refused to give the expected guanxi
    gifts to her boss. Zhang reports that most Chinese people complain about the widespread practices of
    corruption but are forced to use their guanxi networks to get ahead in life.

    Guanxi illustrates how culture can be generally taken for granted but also highly controversial. Many other
    cultural norms are also widely accepted but challenged and resisted by certain groups who are disadvantaged
    or limited by those norms. Gender roles are a good example, as are norms of sexuality and marriage.

    Paradox 4: Culture Is Shared, but It Varies

    The examples of guanxi and the geodesic dome both illustrate another paradox: how culture is widely yet
    unevenly shared among members of a group. Different members of and groups in a society have different
    perspectives on their shared culture--and different versions of that culture. Among elites, the use of Chinese
    guanxi (or American "networking") might seem to be a more personal and trustworthy process for making
    things happen. But for people who lack access to elite networks, these cultural norms may seem to be an
    exclusive and unfair tool of class oppression.

    Returning to the notion of home, consider the many, many versions of home in your society. People in different
    subgroups and regions live in structures of different shapes and sizes that are made of different materials. And
    yet, the members of a culture do share a common set of assumptions about home. Home is where we live,
    where we sleep, and most often where our family lives as well. Even with such diversity, people in a society
    have a common image or ideal of home. On the West Coast of the United States, geodesic innovators sought to
    expand the notion of home with a new shape and a new way of building. But in southwest Missouri, that
    variation of home did not take root. Alas.

    The four paradoxes all illustrate how culture operates as a force of stability in a society while also generating
    forms of constant alteration, adaptation, and change. As culture is mobile, controversial, and variable, some
    elements are always in the process of transformation even as other elements are maintained and reinforced.
    Over time, people reinterpret their cultural norms and practices and sometimes even reject them altogether in
    favor of some other way of thinking or doing things.

    This paradoxical view of culture points to the dynamic tensions of people living in groups. Societies are
    collectivities of individuals, families, regional groups, ethnic groups, socioeconomic classes, political groups,
    and so on. Culture provides a way for people to live and work together while also allowing for the expression
    and performance of distinctive differences. Rather than breaking down, culture responds to pressures for
    change with adaptation to new conditions. The paradoxes that make culture seem impossible also make
    culture flexible and durable. In an era that combines increasing polarization with an urgent need for
    cooperative change, perhaps we need culture now more than ever.

            MINI-FIELDWORK ACTIVITY

    Romance over Time

    Write down the answers to the following questions. What does a person in your culture do when they want to
    become romantically involved with a particular someone? Are there common practices for this? What rules
    guide this behavior, explicit or implied? What are the different roles involved? Are there symbols and rituals?
    Is there some amount of disagreement in your culture about any of these activities?

    Now, find a person in your culture who is much older than you, perhaps a person over 70 years old. Ask that
    person to describe how people did the same things when they were your age. Ask the same set of questions,
    and write down the answers.

    How have romantic relations changed over time? What forces have shaped this change? What aspects have
    remained the same? What explains the durability of some practices? Based on this trajectory of change, can
    you predict how romantic relations will change in the future?

explains the biological variation seen in our ancestors across time. Chapters 4, Biological Evolution and Early
Human Evidence and Chapter 5, The Genus Homo and the Emergence of Us, represent a field of study that is
probably the most dynamic, controversial and highly debated subfield of anthropology. Perspectives and
opinions vary not only within the mindset of the general public but also amongst scientists and

    anthropologists alike. As the human fossil puzzle begins to fill in with new discoveries, we find ourselves
    gaining valuable insights into what makes us human and the ways in which we are a part of, not separate from,
    the natural world. Despite our advances in the field, we also have to be prepared for the possibility we may end
    up with more questions than answers! It is these very reasons that explain why so many of us find this such a
    fascinating field and why so many of us take it so personally. It is after all a journey into the discovery of who
    we are and where we came from; and that should be of interest to all of us as members of the Homo genus.

    4.1 What Is Biological Anthropology?

    LEARNING OUTCOMES:

    By the end of this section, you will be able to:
      · Identify the five subfields of biological anthropology.
      · Explain how each of the subfields contributes to our understanding of human origins and evolution.
      · Understand the historical context of the field of biological anthropology.

    Looking to the Deep Past

    Biological anthropology, also referred to as physical anthropology or evolutionary anthropology, is one of the
    four major subfields of anthropology. While the other subfields focus on current and relatively recent human
    cultures, biological anthropology looks to the deeper past, asking questions about what it means to be human
    by exploring where humans came from as a species. Biological anthropology comprises numerous areas of
    study: human biological variation, paleoanthropology (human and primate evolution), primatology (the study
    of nonhuman primates), bioarchaeology (the study of bones found at archaeological sites), and genetic
    anthropology (the application of molecular science to archaeological, historical, and linguistic evidence to
    reveal the history of ancient human origins and migration). Each of these areas of study contributes something
    to anthropologists' understanding of current human physical characteristics and behaviors.

    Exploring What It Means to Be Human

    Studies of human biological variation evaluate the physical similarities and differences between human
    populations across both time and space. Differences in morphology include features such as height, jawline,
    eye sockets, and ear and nose shape and size. Biochemical differences account for variations in the sense of
    smell, mutations in the CCR5 gene that offer resistance to HIV, and variations in skin pigmentation in response
    to levels of exposure to ultraviolet rays from the sun.

    FIGURE 4.2 These variations in modern human skin pigmentation are the result of evolutionary adaptations to
    different levels of exposure to ultraviolet rays from the sun. (credit: "School Diversity Many Hands Held Together" by

    The study of human biological variation is closely linked to the original conception of biological anthropology,

which was formalized in 1930 with the establishment of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists,
recently renamed the American Association of Biological Anthropologists. The change in name is an effort to
move away from the term physical anthropology, which has come to be associated with views promoting
scientific racism that no longer represent or align with views held by anthropologists today. In 1951, American
anthropologist Sherwood Washburn introduced a "new physical anthropology," changing the focus from racial
typology and classification to the study of human evolution and the evolutionary process. This new focus
expanded anthropology as a field to include paleoanthropology and primatology

Paleoanthropology looks at the fossil evidence of humanity's ancestors along with ancient material culture
such as tools and other human artifacts. The physical morphology (shape and size) of skulls and other
postcranial material (skeletal remains other than the skull) allow paleoanthropologists to form hypotheses
about important milestones in human evolution over time.

Primatology examines the behavioral and physical attributes of both living and fossil primates as well as their
relationships with their environments. Humans are primates who share a common ancestry with nonhuman
primates. By studying nonhuman primates, anthropologists can gain a better understanding of what it means
to be a primate and what it means to be human.

Genetic anthropology is used within several areas of biological anthropology. In this specialized area, DNA
testing is combined with archaeological, historical, and linguistic evidence to reveal the history of ancient
human migration or to track human disease.

Forensic anthropology is a subfield of biological anthropology that applies scientific methods to the analysis
of human remains for the purposes of identifying a victim and determining the possible cause of death. A
major difference between forensic anthropology and other types of biological anthropology is that forensic
anthropology is usually focused on crime scenes involving the death of an individual, whereas other types
primarily focus on understanding patterns and features that may appear in a group or an entire population.
Beginning in World War II, forensic anthropologists have been instrumental in helping identify victims of war
and disasters. They have played critical roles in identifying victims of the Thailand tsunami in 2004 and the
destruction of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. Today, most forensic anthropologists work in a
medical examiner's office, assisting with autopsies and examinations of skeletal remains.

Bioarchaeology studies human remains in archaeological settings with a focus on what skeletal material can
reveal about the culture, diet, and presence of disease in a population. Bioarchaeologists are also interested in
the socioecological system of a population, which helps anthropologists better understand the roles of
environmental and ecological pressures and influences in shaping cultural identity, social inequity,
sustainability, and access to and use of resources. Based on the biological remains found at archaeological
sites, bioarchaeologists explore questions pertaining to social and funerary behavior, diet and nutrition,
health, and disease. Bioarchaeology offers a window into the connections among biology, society, and culture.
An example of what a bioarchaeologist might study is skeletal evidence of infant cranial boarding, which was
practiced by many cultures, including the ancient Maya, the Inca, and some Native North American groups.
The process involved binding a child's head to a flat board in order to artificially deform the skull, possibly to
meet an aesthetic ideal or to signify social status. Bioarcheologists have found that variations in how the board
was attached to the skull provide important information about an individual's social identity.

Area of Anthropology: The focus of Professor's David's work has been biological anthropology and Egyptology.

Accomplishments In the Field: Professor David is a Director of the KNH Centre for Biological and Forensic
Studies in Egyptology at the University of Manchester. In this role, she established the Ancient Egyptian
Mummy Tissue Bank, one of the only such tissue banks in the world. She served as the keeper of Egyptology at
the Manchester Museum and has often worked in collaboration with Egypt's Ministry of Health and Population
on public health projects. One such project involved the identification of antibodies against schistosomiasis, a
parasite spread by freshwater snails, in Egyptian mummies.

David was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2003 for her work in Egyptology. David
has appeared in or consulted on several documentaries, including the television miniseries Private Lives of the
Pharaohs (2000) and Secrets of the Pharaohs (2001) and the documentary short Mummies: Secrets of the
Pharaohs (2007).

Importance of Her Work: Ann Rosalie David was the first woman in Britain to hold a professorship in
Egyptology. She was a pioneer in biomedical research, conducting research on disease, diet, and lifestyles in
ancient Egypt. In 2010, her work on ancient Egyptian mummies found evidence to suggest that cancer may be
a human-created disease, attributable in part to modern pollution and changes in lifestyle and diet (David and
Zimmerman 2010).

4.2 What's in a Name? The Science of Taxonomy

LEARNING OUTCOMES:

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Describe the historical context of binomial nomenclature and scientific classification.
  · Distinguish between the different categories of groups found in Linnaean classification.
  · Explain the different definitions of species and how they are applied to different populations.

Defining the Science of Taxonomy

Taxonomy is defined as the classification and naming of things. Taxonomy organizes things into groups based
on predefined criteria. The criteria can be as simple as color or height or as complex as the presence or
absence of a trait, gene, or behavior. Taxonomy is a critical component of biological anthropology because it
helps anthropologists organize humans and their evolutionary ancestors both spatially (by location) and
temporally (through time).

Taxon refers to a specific subgroup, such as the genus. Taxa is the plural form of taxon, used to refer to all
groups. The classification system used for organizing living organisms was originally developed in the 18th
century by Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus. His system, which he called the Systema Naturae, uses a
structure known as binomial nomenclature. Binomial nomenclature assigns two Latin names to each
organism. The first is termed the genus name. The second is the specific or the trivial name, commonly called
the species name. In print, genus and species names are italicized. The first letter of the genus is capitalized,
while the species or trivial name is lowercase. For example, the scientific name for the house cat is Felis catus,
and the name for modern human beings is Homo sapiens. Linnaeus's binomial nomenclature established a
shared scientific language that would become universal across countries and cultures, avoiding the confusion
caused by regional and colloquial names.

In addition to establishing a shared language, Linnaeus's naming system groups organisms that share
common traits. For example, he grouped together animals with mammary glands into the category mammals.
Mammals were further broken down according to other traits. For example, mammals that have opposable
102  4 · Biological Evolution and Early Human Evidence

     thumbs were grouped together as primates, and those without opposable thumbs were grouped as non-
     primates. This is a hierarchical classification scheme, meaning that organisms are grouped into successive
     levels from the broadest category of domain to the more specific level of species.

     When Linnaeus first created his Systema Naturae, he built five hierarchical levels into his taxonomy: kingdom,
     class, order, genus, and species. Humans are in the kingdom Animalia, the class Mammalia, the order
     Primates, the genus Homo, and the species sapiens. Over time, many levels have been added to the Linnaean
     system of classification, including domain, phylum, subclass, superorder, family, and tribe. The addition of
     these taxon groups has enabled biological anthropologists to better understand the variations present in
     various groups of organisms. However, biological anthropologists spend the majority of their time trying to
     understand the species level.

     FIGURE 4.5 This chart details the Linnaean hierarchical classification for the monarch butterfly. The broadest
     category, "Life", appears at the top of the chart, with classifications of increasing specificity at each level that
     follows. "Species" is the most granular level. (attribution: Copyright Rice University/OpenStax, under CC By 4.0

     Defining a Species

     While species is a word that most people are familiar with and comfortable using, just what determines a
     species is incredibly difficult to define. At the most basic level, a species comprises a group of organisms with
     shared characteristics that distinguish them from other groups. Most scientists distinguish a species based on
     behavior, genetics, and/or morphology. Species definitions are the basis for scientific names. The common
     name of a species, on the other hand, is usually based on general physical characteristics noted by a culture or
     local population. Common names are also referred to as folk taxonomy or ethnotaxonomy (classifications
     influenced by culture, etc.). There is a growing interest among anthropologists and the scientific community in
     preserving Indigenous classifications of the natural world and connecting them with scientific classifications.

     Decisions related to classification often involve tremendous taxonomical controversy, especially within the
     field of biological anthropology. There are more than 20 distinct species definitions, or ways of categorizing or
     distinguishing one type of organism from another. Below are the four most common definitions of a species.

     Biological Species
     The biological species definition states that a species is a group of interbreeding organisms that are

     Access for free at openstax.org
4.3 · It's All in the Genes! The Foundation of Evolution                                                           103

reproductively isolated from other groups of organisms. Reproductive isolation means that members of a
species are not able to mate successfully with members outside their species. Gorillas, for example, cannot
successfully breed with Pan paniscus, the bonobo. The biological species definition uses the ability to
interbreed as its foundation because successful mating leads to gene flow, or the movement of genetic material
from one population to another.

Ecological Species
The ecological species definition emphasizes the role of natural selection in maintaining species boundaries.
This concept is based on the idea that gene flow is neither necessary nor sufficient to maintain species
boundaries. Instead, natural selection plays an important role in maintaining the boundaries between species.
In nature, species boundaries are often maintained even though there is a substantial amount of gene flow
between species. Gene flow between species generally occurs at places called hybrid zones, areas of overlap
where two species are known to successfully breed. A classic example of a hybrid zone occurs on the island of
Sulawesi in Southeast Asia, where Macaca maura (the moor macaque) and Macaca tonkeana (the Tonkean
macaque) are known to have successfully interbred for more than 150 years. Despite this, the integrity of the
two distinct species has been maintained.

Phylogenetic Species
The biological species definition is based on breeding behavior, specifically whether species are capable of
mating with one another. This foundation is problematic when trying to identify species over time. It is hard to
know whether two fossil specimens were capable of interbreeding. It is also difficult in the fossil record to
distinguish between interspecific variation (differences between members of two different species) and
intraspecific variation (variation within a species). Imagine finding the bones of two individuals, one five feet
tall and the other six feet four inches. Identifying whether these individuals were members of two different
species (interspecific variation) or representative of the normal variation within a given species would be
extremely challenging.

These problems are addressed by the phylogenetic species definition. The phylogenetic species definition
states that a species can be determined by shared possession of one unique characteristic. For example,
imagine you found a group of fossil leg bones. In order to decide if they were from the same species, you would
need to determine if they had a trait in common that only these fossil leg bones possessed. If the bones all
possessed trait A and this trait was not found in any other species already identified, then you would have a
new species, and all of the fossil leg bones could be placed in that species.

Mate Recognition Species
The mate recognition species definition states that a species is a set of organisms that recognize one another
as potential mates. A classic example of a group of species that can be distinguished using this definition is
American crickets. Within a single habitat in the United States, there might be over 30 different species of
crickets. Each species of cricket is known to produce a distinct song. Despite all these different species living
side by side, the female cricket of each species will only mate with a male after hearing the male sing her
species-specific song. The song, and the female recognition of it, constitutes a mate recognition system. This is
analogous to the biological species definition in that the song acts as a reproductive isolating mechanism.

4.3 It's All in the Genes! The Foundation of Evolution

LEARNING OUTCOMES:

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Define alleles, genes, phenotypes, and genotypes.
  · Distinguish the process of mitosis from the process of meiosis.
  · Explain how Mendel's laws of heredity affect human variation.
  · Explain how the multitude of evolutionary forces contribute to variation in the human condition.

The Units of Life

Cells are the basic units of life in all organisms. They are the smallest entities that are capable of self-
reproduction. There are two main types of cells: prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, named for the types of
104  4 · Biological Evolution and Early Human Evidence

     organisms in which they occur. Prokaryotes are single-celled organisms, such as bacteria and archaea.
     Eukaryotes are more complex, multicellular organisms, such as plants and animals (including humans). One
     of the most important components of eukaryotic cells is the enclosed nucleus at the center of the cell;
     prokaryotic cells do not have this nucleus. The nucleus of a eukaryotic cell houses all of the genetic material, or
     DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), that controls cellular function. Normally, the DNA forms a long string within the
     nucleus.

     There are two main types of eukaryotic cells: somatic cells and sex cells (also known as gametes). The somatic
     cells make up the structural components of a body, such as the tissues, muscles, and organs. The sex cells are
     specifically involved in reproduction. The function of the sex cells is to unite with a sex cell from another
     individual to form a fertilized egg, also known as a zygote. In animals, there are two types of sex cells: ova, or
     eggs, and sperm.

     Cell division is the process that results in the production of new cells. However, sex and somatic cells divide
     differently. The cellular division of somatic cells is known as mitosis, while the cellular division of sex cells is
     known as meiosis. Mitosis of somatic cells is sometimes referred to as simple cell division because the parent
     cell divides once to produce two daughter cells that are genetically identical to each other and identical to the
     original parent cell. During mitosis, the DNA genetic material forms structures known as chromosomes. Each
     daughter cell inherits an exact copy of all 46 chromosomes found within the parent cell.

     FIGURE 4.6 In somatic cell division, also known as mitosis, the parent cell divides to produce two daughter cells
     that are genetically identical to each other and to the parent cell. (credit: "Major events in mitosis"by Mysid/
     Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)

     Meiosis, or sex cell division, is more complicated. This type of cellular division only occurs in the testes of
     males and the ovaries of females. Instead of just one division, meiosis results from two cellular divisions that
     produce four daughter cells. In meiosis, the four daughter cells each receive half of the original genetic
     material from the parental cell. Thus, each daughter cell only has 23 chromosomes.

     It is on the chromosomes that genes are housed. Genes are the fundamental unit of heredity. They are best
     understood as the sequence or ordering of the DNA material that is housed in the nucleus. The genotype is the
     genetic material found within an organism's cells and it is the expression of these genes that will produce the
     phenotype or observable trait. Sometimes, the sequencing of the DNA material produces a variation of a gene,
     known as an allele. An allele is defined as a similar but slightly different form of the same gene that can
     activate the expression of a specific trait.

     Gregor Mendel and the Laws of Heredity

     The true nature of inheritance was not really understood until the beginning of the 20th century, when the
     19th-century work of Gregor Mendel, a Catholic priest from Slovakia, was rediscovered. While in college,
     Gregor Mendel was introduced to cell theory, which states that all organisms are composed of cells and that
     cells are the fundamental unit of all living things. Cell theory raised many questions in Mendel's mind,
     including whether both parents contribute equally to the cells in their offspring. In 1854, Mendel began a
     series of experiments with pea plants to help resolve this question and better understand how traits are
     inherited from generation to generation.

FIGURE 4.7 Gregor Mendel was a Catholic priest whose experiments with selective breeding of pea plants
established many of the rules of heredity. (credit: "Gregor Mendel Monk" by William Bateson, Mendel's Principles of
Heredity: A Defence/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)

The first stage of Mendel's experiments was identifying plants that breed true, meaning that each parent only
produces one kind of offspring when self-crossed. A self-cross is essentially a self-mating; some plants, such as
peas, have both male and female parts and can self-fertilize. Not all self-crosses are the same as the parent
plant, however. For example, self-crossed pea plants that have yellow pods sometimes produce offspring with
yellow pods and sometimes produce offspring with green pods. Mendel continued to selectively breed only
those pea plants that produced offspring that were the same as the parents. He called them purebreds and
referred to them as the P1 generation. It took him more than two years to establish plants that always bred
true.

Then Mendel selected seven traits of his pea plants that each had two distinct phenotypes, or observable
expressions of the trait. For example, seed shape can be either round or wrinkled, while pod color can be
either yellow or green. Over the next eight years, Mendel studied the mating and resulting traits of more than
28,000 plants. Mendel's first round of experiments used his purebred pea plants to create what is known as a
monohybrid cross. A monohybrid cross is a mating between two purebred individuals who differ in a single
characteristic. In Mendel's monohybrid crosses, the parent pea plants differed from one another in terms of
whether the pods of the parental pea plants were yellow or green or whether the seeds of the parental pea
plant were wrinkled or round.
106  4 · Biological Evolution and Early Human Evidence

     FIGURE 4.8 Mendel identified a number of distinct characteristics observable in the seeds, flowers, pods, and
     stems of pea plants. He used these observable traits as the basis for his breeding experiments, taking note of which
     traits were dominant and which unexpressed (or recessive) in offspring. (credit: "Mendel Genetics" by LadyofHats/
     Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
     In his first monohybrid crosses, Mendel mated a purebred yellow pea plant with a purebred green pea plant.
     He found that all the offspring resulting from this monohybrid cross were yellow, even though when the green
     peas self-crossed, all their offspring were green. In other words, all the hybrid offspring were yellow in color. A
     hybrid plant is one in whose parents differ in a term of a specific characteristic, such as pod color or seed
     shape. The trait that was expressed (yellow) Mendel referred to as dominant, and the trait that disappeared
     (green) he referred to as recessive. Mendel's next set of experiments involved mating two hybrid plants--in
     other words, those that resulted from the monohybrid cross. In these experiments, he found that the recessive
     traits reappeared in a ratio of three dominant to one recessive.

     FIGURE 4.9 These diagrams are examples of Punnett squares, a simple method for predicting the observable
     results of breeding experiments. In the top square, a purebred green plant (yy) is crossed with a hybrid yellow plant
     (Yy). The four possibilities for offspring appear in the four interior squares of the diagram. In this case, half of the
     offspring will be hybrid yellow and half will be purebred green. The bottom diagram shows the results of a cross
     between a purebred green and a purebred yellow plant - in this case, all offspring are hybrid yellow. (credit:

     Mendel's experiments suggested two very important facts. First, Mendel noted that various expressions of a
     trait (such as pea color) were controlled by discrete units that occur in pairs and that offspring inherited one

     Access for free at openstax.org
4.3 · It's All in the Genes! The Foundation of Evolution                                                             107

unit of each pair from each parent. This observation became Mendel's first law of inheritance, the law of
segregation, which states that the two alleles for each trait segregate, or separate, during the formation of
gametes (eggs and sperm) and that during the reproductive process, the alleles combine at random with other
alleles. Today, we know that the process of meiosis--division of sex cells--explains Mendel's law of segregation.
Each of the seven traits identified by Mendel is controlled by a pair of genes in the plant, one on each
chromosome. During the reproductive cycle, the chromosomes separate from one another so that each gamete
has only one allele for each trait. During fertilization, the alleles combine, and the two-gene state is restored.

After Mendel established his first law of inheritance, he extended his studies to more complex situations. He
began performing experiments with two set of traits, using dihybrid crosses. A dihybrid cross is a cross
between individuals who differ with respect to two gene pairs--for example, a cross between a plant with a
round yellow pea and a plant with a wrinkled green pea. Because yellow and round are both dominant traits
and wrinkled and green are both recessive, all the offspring resulting from the first-generation mating were
100% yellow and round. The green color and the wrinkled pea shape had disappeared. However, these
recessive traits reappeared in a ratio of three dominant to one recessive when two round yellow individuals
from the first-generation dihybrid cross were mated. The green color and the wrinkled pea shape had not truly
disappeared. In the second generation of the dihybrid cross, Mendel found that 9/16 of the offspring were
round and yellow, 3/16 were wrinkled and yellow, 3/16 were round and green, and 1/16 were wrinkled and
green. The results of these dihybrid crosses indicate that the two characteristics--pea color and pea
shape--segregate independently. The expression of one trait is not influenced by the expression of the other
trait. This is known as the law of independent assortment, which is Mendel's second law of inheritance. There
is nothing to dictate that round peas will be yellow or that wrinkled peas will be green. The alleles that code for
different traits sort independently of one another during sex cell division (meiosis).

Mendelian Inheritance in Humans

Mendel's laws of inheritance also apply to humans. Indeed, the principles of segregation and independent
assortment account for the transmission of certain human traits. Human blood type is one of the most familiar
Mendelian traits. Blood type has three phenotypes--A, B, and O--based on three alleles of a single gene. If only
the A allele or both the A and O alleles are present, the phenotype is A. If only the B allele or both the B and O
alleles are present, the phenotype is B. If both A and B are present, the phenotype is AB. If neither A nor B is
present, the phenotype is O. Note that O is recessive to both A and B, while A and B are codominant.
Codominance means that instead of one allele masking the other, the products of both alleles are observed.
Additional examples of Mendelian traits, or those controlled by a single gene, include Huntington's disease,
widow's peak, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, Tay-Sachs disease, hemophilia, and red-green color
blindness. OMIM, or Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (https://openstax.org/r/onlinemendelian), hosts an
online database of almost 5,000 Mendelian human traits.

It is important to note that the majority of human traits are not controlled by a single pair of genes. More often,
a single gene can have multiple effects. Even more commonly, multiple genes are needed to produce a single
effect. These are referred to as polygenic traits. Most human traits are polygenic, not Mendelian. A good way of
determining if a trait is polygenic is to assess whether the trait can be measured. Traits that can be measured,
such as height or weight, are polygenic. Also, traits that have a wide range or lots of variability and can be
affected by environmental factors are probably polygenic. The survival of a species depends on genetic
diversity and variation. If there is a reduction of a gene pool due to geographic isolation or other environmental
factors than a species is at risk of extinction.

     4.4 Evolution in Action: Past and Present

     LEARNING OUTCOMES:

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       · Identify the major contributors to evolutionary theory and their specific theoretical contributions and historical
           context.
       · Explain the theory of evolution and how it applies to the understanding of human origins.
       · Identify the key differences between Linnaean classification and phylogenetics.
       · Define key evolutionary processes such as genetic drift, allopatric speciation, etc.

     Contemporary biological anthropologists utilize an evolutionary perspective. This means that the principles of
     evolution are used to understand how and why living organisms, including people, thrive in almost every
     environment on Earth. More specifically, natural selection is accepted as the guiding force that shapes why
     living things are the way they are. Out of all the possible variations of beings competing for the same resources
     on Earth, those that prospered were the ones better suited to their environments than all other competitors.
     The principles of evolution and natural selection will be discussed in some detail in the next few sections, but
     it is important to establish at this early point that this chapter relies on the foundational assumption that
     natural forces are the only forces directing the development of life on Earth.

     Early Evolutionists and the Fixity of Species

     Evolution is defined as change in the allele frequency within a gene pool that can lead to changes in an
     organism's morphology (form and structure) over time. Evolution involves the processes of mutation, natural
     selection, and speciation, which will be introduced in upcoming sections. Prior to the 19th century, the
     prevailing idea in Western thought was that nature was fixed and static; it was made by a supreme being in the
     form it currently appeared, and it did not change. Within this fixed natural system, living creatures were
     arranged within a set order that was considered to have been decreed by God, known as the great chain of
     being. This order featured God at the top, angels beneath God, and then humans. Below humans were various
     types of animals, followed by plants and minerals. This hierarchy was significant both because it placed some
     creatures above others and because it distinctly separated humans from the rest of the animal world.

     During a period stretching from the 14th through the 18th centuries, some people began to question whether
     the natural world was as static as it was traditionally perceived to be. The British scientist and architect Robert
     Hooke is remembered as the first person in the Western world to claim not only that nature has changed over
     time but also that evidence of these changes remain. He hypothesized that fossils are the remains of actual
     plants and animals that were once alive. This conclusion was contrary to the previously accepted conclusion
     that fossils were nothing more than stone images. Hooke also noted that many marine fossils were located far
     away from any existing ocean, and he came to the then radical conclusion that Earth's geography and physical
     features had experienced dramatic changes.

     The first person to propose a mechanism by which species could change was French naturalist Jean-Baptiste
     Lamarck, best known for having developed the first theory of macroevolution, a hypothesis about how the
     actual transformation from one species into another species could occur. Lamarck's theory relied on the now
     defunct idea of the inheritance of acquired characteristics.

     Lamarck argued that the usefulness of a trait or organ could be ascertained based on its complexity or size. In
     particular, he believed that the usefulness of an organ could be judged by its size and the usefulness of a trait
     by its complexity. He speculated that organs and traits that help a creature to survive will become bigger and
     more complex over time, while those that are of little use will become smaller and simpler and eventually
     disappear. His classic example of this theory in action is the long neck of a giraffe. Lamarck speculated that as
     giraffes stretched their necks to reach the leaves at the tops of trees, their necks would grow longer, and
     furthermore, these longer necks would be inherited by the subsequent generations. This theory of the
     inheritance of acquired characteristics is also known as Lamarckian inheritance. One of the interesting things
     about Lamarck's theory is that he believed that wishes, desires, wills, and needs were all sufficient to motivate
     change. That is, wishing for or desiring a change in one's physical characteristics could make that change
     happen.

There are two primary problems with Lamarckian inheritance. First, desires, wishes, and needs do not change
physical characteristics without a deliberate change in behavior. Someone may wish for blue hair, but their
hair color will not change without dye. The second problem is that the inheritance of acquired traits is not
possible. If someone dyed their hair blue, their children would not inherit blue hair. Traits that are acquired
during a lifespan are not passed on to subsequent generations.

Just because Lamarck's theory of macroevolution is not correct does not mean that it is insignificant. Lamarck
recognized the importance of interactions between organisms and their environments in the evolutionary
process and was the first to propose a mechanism by which evolutionary change from one species into another
could actually occur.

Georges Cuvier, another Frenchman and a leading scientist in the early 19th century, made numerous
contributions to evolutionary thinking. He is best known for his theory of catastrophism, which he developed
to explain the increasing number of fossils that were being found, some displaying impressions of creatures no
longer found anywhere on Earth. Catastrophism proposes that floods, earthquakes, and other natural
disasters--understood within the theory as acts of God--have been responsible for killing all the animals alive
in certain places at certain times. According to Cuvier, either new animals have been created or the areas had
been repopulated by animals from neighboring areas. To be consistent with emerging fossil evidence
indicating that organisms had become more complex over time, Cuvier proposed that new organisms with a
more modern appearance were the result of a more recent creation event. While scientists no longer adhere to
catastrophism as a viable theory, Cuvier's idea of extinction continues to be an important component of
evolutionary thinking today.

Another major contributor to evolutionary thinking was Scottish geologist Charles Lyell, known as the father of
modern geology. He wrote a three-volume treatise, Principles of Geology (1830-1833), in which he argued that
contemporary geological processes were the same as those that occurred in the past. These processes, such as
wind and rain, produced the contemporary geological landscape. Mountains, lakes, and rivers were all created
by these geological processes, many of them slow moving. This theory has come to be known as the principle
of uniformitarianism. Lyell suggested that in order for such slow-acting forces to produce momentous change,
Earth must be much older than previously suspected. Prior to Lyell's publication, the majority of natural
historians believed that the earth was less than 6,000 years old, a number arrived at through calculations
made based on the Old Testament. By altering the suspected age of the earth from several thousand years to
millions of years, Lyell changed the framework within which scientists viewed the geological past.

Charles Darwin's Role in Changing Views of the Natural World

Charles Darwin introduced a new way of seeing the world that was both highly criticized and acclaimed in the
scientific community of his time. In spite of resistance by various segments of society, his theories of natural
selection became the foundation of biological science. New knowledge pertaining to genetics and molecular
science has strengthened Darwin's theories rather than weakened them.

Darwin the Apprentice
When he was 17 years old, well before he gained a reputation as a naturalist, scholar, and scientist, Darwin was
studying to be a medical doctor at the University of Edinburgh. Like many young people, he began to question
his original choice of studies, and he decided to instead learn taxidermy under John Edmonstone. John
Edmonstone was born enslaved and grew up on a plantation owned by a Scottish politician in what is now
Guyana in South America. Charles Waterton, the son-in-law of the plantation owner and a renowned naturalist,
would visit the plantation often. He started inviting Edmonstone to accompany him on his frequent travels into
the rainforest. On his travels, Edmonstone gained considerable knowledge about the flora and fauna of South
America along with impressive taxidermy skills.

After gaining his freedom in 1817, John Edmonstone taught taxidermy at the University of Edinburgh, where
he served as a mentor to Darwin over a period of several months. It is believed that Darwin's relationship with
Edmonstone may have influenced his abolitionist views, which were later strengthened by firsthand accounts
of slavery while Darwin was on his infamous voyage to the Galápagos Islands off the coast of Ecuador.

     Darwin the Explorer and Scholar
     Charles Darwin left the University of Edinburgh and decided to pursue theology at Christ's College, Cambridge.
     His studies there led to his appointment in 1831 as a naturalist on the HMS Beagle for a five-year scientific
     expedition around the world. During this voyage, Darwin collected, dissected, and organized various
     specimens, especially in the Galápagos Islands, a chain of islands off the western coast of South America. His
     observations in the Galápagos marked a crucial point in his thinking on evolution. He noted that the fauna and
     flora of the western coast of South America were similar to those he observed in the Galápagos, but still distinct
     enough to be considered different species. More surprisingly, the animals of each of the various islands in the
     Galápagos chain differed slightly from one another. Darwin observed 13 different types of finches throughout
     13 different small islands. The birds on each island differed in the structure of their beaks, their body form,
     and the color of their feathers. Each species was specifically adapted to the specific habitats on each of the
     islands. Darwin used the techniques that Edmonstone taught him to preserve the Galápagos finches, which
     became key pieces of evidence supporting Darwin's theory of natural selection.

FIGURE 4.11 Charles Darwin is acknowledged as the father of the theory of natural selection. His work built upon
the ideas of many other thinkers. His great contribution was in synthesizing these ideas into a coherent theory

During his travels on the Beagle, Darwin had been thinking about artificial selection--the selective breeding of
animals to produce traits that humans find useful, commonly associated with the process of domestication.
Darwin understood that artificial selection provided important clues about the natural evolution of species.

While on board the HMS Beagle, Darwin read a book by English economist Thomas Robert Malthus titled An
Essay on the Principle of Population (1798). Darwin obtained two important points from this book. The first
was that human populations, if unrestrained, will grow exponentially. This means that they will double each
generation. The second point was that food resources increase much more slowly than population does.
Malthus noted that the growth of human populations is kept in check by a limit of food resources, which
creates a struggle for existence. The struggle for existence is not just about getting enough food but also about
survival. In other words, it is about an individual's ability to both find enough food and not become another
organism's food. This simple concept, the struggle for existence, provided Darwin with a mechanism for how
evolution could occur. Darwin realized that individuals with favorable characteristics for living in an
environment are the ones that will survive to the age at which they reproduce, while those with less favorable
variations will not. This mechanism for "selecting for" certain traits and features is known as the theory of
natural selection.

Darwin concluded from his observations that when a group of animals of the same species are geologically
separated, they develop into separate species. This evolutionary process is commonly referred to as allopatric
speciation (or geographic speciation) and is based on the principles that related species share a common
ancestor and that species change over time.

Darwin did not originate the idea of evolution. Many of the ideas used by Darwin in his theory of natural
selection were developed by other thinkers. Darwin was also not the only person thinking about natural
selection. Another British natural historian, Alfred Russel Wallace, developed the same idea at roughly the
same time, entirely independently of Darwin. Whereas Darwin developed his ideas based on his travels to the
Galápagos, Wallace's thinking was influenced by his own travels through the Malay Archipelago between
112  4 · Biological Evolution and Early Human Evidence

     Indochina and Australia. Wallace outlined his theory of evolution by natural selection in a letter written to
     Darwin while he was in Malaysia. As Darwin had not yet published his own work, Wallace and Darwin jointly
     presented papers introducing the theory of natural selection. In 1859, Darwin finally published his book On
     the Origin of Species, some 20 years after his voyage on the HMS Beagle.

     Understanding Darwin's Theory of Natural Selection

     The theory of natural selection has five main components:

     1. All organisms are capable of producing offspring faster than the food supply increases.
     2. All organisms show variation.
     3. There is a fierce struggle for existence, and those with the most suitable variations are most likely to

           survive and reproduce.
     4. Variations, or traits, are passed on to offspring (inherited).
     5. Small changes in every generation lead to major changes over long periods of time.

     A popular but often-misunderstood concept related to natural selection is the term survival of the fittest.
     Survival of the fittest does not necessarily mean that the biggest and fastest survive; instead, it refers to those
     who are most evolutionarily fit. This means that an organism has traits that are sufficient for survival and will
     be passed on to future generations. The term survival of the fittest was not even introduced by Darwin; rather,
     it was first used by English philosopher, anthropologist, and sociologist Herbert Spencer, who promoted the
     now discredited ideology of social Darwinism. Social Darwinism applied the concept of Darwin's biological
     evolution to human societies, proposing that human culture was progressing toward the "perfect human."
     Spencer's writings became integrally related to the 19th-century rise of scientific racism and European
     colonialism.

     FIGURE 4.12 This peppered moth is well camouflaged on the trunk of this tree. A darker colored moth would more
     easily be seen and eaten and would thus be less likely to pass on its genes to offspring. Natural selection relies upon
     the ability of natural variations to increase an individual's chances of reproduction. (credit: Ben Sale/Wikimedia

     Examples of Darwin's theory of natural selection can be found throughout the natural world. Perhaps one of
     the best known is the color change observed in peppered moths in England during the 19th century. Before the
     Industrial Revolution, peppered moths in England were a light grey color, well camouflaged on tree branches
     and less likely to be eaten by birds. Occasionally, through the process of mutation, black moths would appear
     in the population, but these were usually quickly eaten because they were more visible against light-colored
     bark. When soot from coal factories began to cover the bark of the trees, the black moths became better
     camouflaged and the white moths were now more visible. Consequently, the black moths were the ones to
     survive to reproduce, while the white ones were eaten. In a few decades, all the peppered moths in the cities

were black. The process was termed industrial melanism. As coal usage decreased and the bark of the trees
once again became lighter in color, white moths again dominated the urban areas.

Examples of natural selection in modern times are numerous. Pesticide resistance in insects is a classic
example. Pesticide resistance refers to the decreasing susceptibility of a pest population to a pesticide that
previously was effective at controlling it. Pest species evolve pesticide resistance via natural selection, with the
most resistant individuals surviving to pass on their ability to resist the pesticide to their offspring. Another
good example is the rise of "superbugs," bacteria that have become increasingly resistant to antibiotics.

The Processes of Evolution
Mutation is the creative force of evolution and represents the first stage of the evolutionary process. Mutation
is defined as an alteration in a genetic sequence that results in a variant form. For a mutation to have
evolutionary significance, it must occur in the sex cells (sperm and ova). This is because only genetic
information that is in the sex cells is passed on from generation to generation. Mutations in non-sex
chromosomes will not be passed on from one generation to the next. Whereas other evolutionary forces can
modify existing genetic material, only mutation can produce new genetic material. One of the most interesting
things about mutations is the fact that they are random. There is no way of predicting when a specific mutation
will occur; all scientists can do is estimate the probability of a mutation occurring. Mutations do not
necessarily appear when they are needed.

The conventional view is that mutations are harmful, but this is not always true. Some mutations are harmful,
some are advantageous, and some are neutral. Advantageous mutations lead to changes that improve an
individual's survival and/or chances of reproduction. The mutation that confers resistance to insecticide in
mosquitos led to changes that improved their survival. Likewise, the mutation for black coloration in peppered
moths led to increased survival during the Industrial Revolution. Neutral mutations have no effect on survival
or reproduction. And some mutations are in fact quite harmful and do negatively affect certain individuals'
survival and reproduction.

Mutations generally occur spontaneously in response to conditions in the body or in the environment. The
exact cause of a mutation cannot usually be determined, and the rate of mutation is very difficult to determine.
This is because mutations that are neutral or do not lead to obvious changes often go unnoticed. The
probability of a mutation at any given gene is between 1 in 10,000 and 1 in 100,000. While the probability that
a specific point in an individual's genetic material will have a mutation is clearly very low, the probability that
the totality of an individual's genetic material will have at least one mutation is much higher. The point is that
while rare, mutation is also common. For example, although many mosquitoes have adapted to insecticides
through a mutation that confers some resistance to the chemicals, if the mutation had not already been
present in the population, the mosquitoes would have died out. The need for a specific mutation had no effect
on whether the mutation appeared or not.

There is currently a controversial pilot program in Florida aimed at dealing with mosquitoes against which
insecticide sprays have increasingly become ineffective. The first genetically modified mosquitoes were
released in the Florida Keys in May of 2021. The genetically altered mosquitoes produce female offspring that
die in the larval stage, preventing them from growing to adulthood, in which they can then bite and spread
disease. Genetic science currently has the power to use mutations to control or even wipe out an entire
species. Genetic engineering has the potential to benefit humanity, but it will undoubtedly also raise ethical
questions and controversy.

     reducing the mosquito population. (attribution: Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
     Genetic Drift
     Genetic drift is defined as the effect of random chance on a population, notably the way in which it determines
     whether an individual survives and reproduces or dies. Imagine that you stick your hand into a bucket filled
     with Halloween candy. What is the probability you will withdraw a Snickers bar? The composition of Halloween
     candy in your bucket will be affected by the proportion of people handing out Snickers bars compared to other
     candy. If each bucket of Halloween candy were a population, then one could say that genetic drift--random
     chance--was affecting the composition of the candy in your Halloween bucket. An important point about
     genetic drift is that it is directly and inversely related to population size. The smaller the population, the larger
     the influence of genetic drift; the larger the population, the smaller the influence of genetic drift. In a large
     population, say 100,000, removing a couple of individuals will have a truly miniscule effect on the population.
     Note that in early human evolution, however, population sizes were small, so the effect of genetic drift may
     have been substantial.
     Gene Flow
     Gene flow is another important evolutionary force, involving the exchange of genetic material between
     populations and geographic regions. Without gene flow, there would be no diversity--and without diversity, a
     species is at higher risk of extinction. Gene flow can be seen in the process of pollination, in which bees or
     butterflies carry and transfer pollen from one area to another. Anytime a gene is introduced to a new
     population where it did not exist before, that is gene flow.

genetic material, in the form of pollen, from one flower to another. (credit: "Honey Bee on a Dandelion, Sandy,
Bedfordshire" by Orangeaurochs/flickr, CC BY 2.0)
Speciation
Speciation is the rise of a new species in response to an environmental change or pressure. Allopatric
speciation, mentioned previously, is the most common form of speciation event. During allopatric speciation, a
species diverges when two populations become isolated from one another and continue to evolve. This
isolation is created by geographic barriers such as mountains, rivers, or oceans. A good example of allopatric
speciation is the different species of squirrel found on the two sides of the Grand Canyon. Descended from a
common ancestor, the squirrels became reproductively isolated from one another by the Grand Canyon,
eventually resulting in different species.

FIGURE 4.15 An example of allopatric speciation is the different species of squirrels that inhabit the Grand
Canyon. The squirrel on the left is a Harris antelope squirrel and the one on the right is a white-tailed antelope
squirrel. They look similar but are different species. (credit: left, "Harris Antelope Squirrel" by Saguaro National
Park/flickr, CC BY 2.0; right, "White-Tailed Antelope Squirrel" by Renee Grayson/flickr, CC BY 2.0)
Sympatric speciation involves species that are descended from a common ancestor and remain in one
location without a geographic barrier. A good example is the East African cichlid fish, which experience
reproduction isolation due not to a physical barrier but to females' selection of mates with certain coloration.
The amount of light that reaches different levels and depths of the lake impacts how colors in the males appear
to the females. The East African cichlid fish are also a good example of adaptive radiation. Adaptive radiation is
seen when one or more species give rise to many new species in a relatively short time. Research shows that an
explosion of about 250 very diverse species of cichlids in Lake Tanganyika occurred in less than 10 million
116  4 · Biological Evolution and Early Human Evidence

     years (Takahashi and Koblmüller 2011). Other research suggests that the common ancestor was the result of a
     hybrid swarm from two different locations, as seen in Figure 4.16. (Meier et al. 2017).

     FIGURE 4.16 There are more than 250 different species of East African cichlid fish, all traceable to two common
     ancestors. The process through which a great number of species arises from a common ancestor within a relatively
     short period of time is known as adaptive radiation. (credit: "1471-2148-5-17-3" by Phylogeny Figures/flickr, CC BY
     2.0)
     In peripatric speciation, members of the same population are separated and over time evolve as separate
     species. Ring speciation is considered by some to be a type of peripatric speciation. Ring speciation occurs
     when several species coexist for a time in a region near one end of a geographic barrier. When part of the
     population migrates away from the original population (or gene pool) to the other side of the barrier,
     reproductive isolation results. Reproductive isolation is strongest for that part of the population that is farthest
     away from the original population. When too much variation has occurred between two groups, they will no
     longer interbreed, and as a result, speciation--the development of two separate species--can occur. While fairly
     rare, ring speciation is believed to explain the different species of the California salamander genus Ensatina.

FIGURE 4.17 This map shows the range of different species of the California salamander genus Ensatina, believed
to have developed through the process of ring speciation. In ring speciation, reproductive isolation leads to the

barrier. (credit: Thomas J. Devitt, Stuart J. E. Baird, and Craig Moritz/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 2.0)

Gradualism vs. Punctuated Evolution
Biological anthropologists are interested not only in how a species is best defined but also in how often and by
what means new species are developed. The traditional view of evolution assumes that morphological,
behavioral, and genetic changes occur gradually and accumulate in a single unbroken and unbranching line;
this view of evolution is known as gradualism. If this perspective is correct, scientists would expect to find
numerous fossils exhibiting evidence that they are slowly and gradually transitioning into new and distinct
species. However, while fossils are rare, fossils showing evidence of transitional forms are even rarer. While the
dearth of transitional fossils is often attributed to the incompleteness of the fossil record, it has caused some
biological anthropologists to question if evolution is truly gradual.

What can be observed in the fossil record are static populations that are interrupted by sudden bursts of
change. This phenomenon of long periods of stasis, or no change, followed by quick periods of change is
known as punctuated equilibrium. Instead of a gradual accumulation of small changes, punctuated
equilibrium suggests that rapid changes due to a variety of environmental factors, including climate change,
are characteristic of the formation of new species. The fossil data for a large number of organisms show just
this--long periods of stasis followed by rapid and massive change. The scarcity of intermediary forms in the
fossil record has led some to conclude that punctuated equilibrium is the dominant theory. However, the fact
that intermediary forms do exist suggests that gradualism is also an important factor in the evolution process.
One research study found that 30 to 35 percent of speciation events occurred as the result of a sudden event or
change, while the remainder showed evidence of gradualism (Phillips 2006). In both the gradual and
punctuated models, speciation takes the form of branches through time rather than a linear progression.
Evolution is neither linear nor progressive, but rather a branching process--a tree of life containing both areas
of divergence and points of a shared common ancestry.

     The Tree of Life: Showing Evolutionary Relationships

     FIGURE 4.18 This sketch made by Charles Darwin illustrates his attempts to think through the branches of
     evolutionary relationships. (credit: Charles Darwin/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
     During Darwin's time, evolutionary relationships had to be determined largely by structural morphologies and
     physical characteristics. Molecular science had not yet been developed. The binomial nomenclature discussed
     earlier not only allowed distinction between species but also provided clues to evolutionary relationships. For
     example, which of the below species of butterfly would be the most distantly related?

       · Danaus gilippus
       · Danaus genutia
       · Limenitis archippus
       · Danaus plexippus
       · Danaus petilia
     The answer, of course, would be Limenitis archippus, the viceroy butterfly, which is a mimic of the monarch
     butterfly (Danaus plexippus). The first part of the viceroy's name, Limenitis, is the genus. The fact that it is
     different from the others shows that it is more distantly related.

     FIGURE 4.19 Species can sometimes be difficult to identify by physical characteristics alone. The two butterflies in
     this image are examples of two different species, one a monarch and the other a viceroy butterfly. What differences
     can you see? (credit: left, "Today's Mass Extinction and Holocene-Anthropocene Thermal Maximum" by

     identify by physical characteristics alone. Species that exhibit mimicry and larval forms in different stages of

development can take on the appearance of other organisms, resulting in errors in classification. Can you tell
which of the butterflies in Figure 4.19 is the monarch? Close examination reveals that the markings on the
wings are a bit different. The monarch is on the left, and the monarch mimic, the viceroy, is on the right.
Likewise, in Figure 4.20, you can see how it might be difficult to correctly classify barnacles, crabs, and limpets
based on physical appearances. One may be tempted to classify the barnacle and the limpet as being closely
related due to the conical shells that they share, when in actuality, the barnacle is more closely related to the
crab, as they are both crustaceans. The conical shells of the barnacle and the limpet are similar adaptations in
response to similar environmental pressures, not evidence that they are closely related or share a common
ancestor.

FIGURE 4.20 Classifying species based on physical similarities alone can lead to false conclusions. Although
barnacles and limpets look much more like one another than they do the crab on the left, barnacles are actually
more closely related to the crab. (credit: left, "DSC_5206" by Sally Wyatt/flickr, CC BY 2.0; top right, "Barnacles" by
Mo Riza/flickr, CC BY 2.0; bottom right, "Limpet Family at Sunny Cove" by Tim Green/flickr, CC BY 2.0)

Structural Morphologies as Evidence of Relationship
Structural similarities may be derived traits (homologous structures), inherited from a common ancestor, or
they may have developed independently (analogous structures). An example of a homologous structure is the
grasping hand found in both humans and chimpanzees, which suggests that humans and chimpanzees share a
common ancestor that also had a grasping hand. Analogous structures are seen in the wing of a butterfly and
the wing of a bat. While both wings serve a similar function, these two organisms likely developed their wings
independently and do not necessarily share a common ancestor. Identifying homologies is essential for
creating hierarchies of phylogenetic relationships because homology indicates that shared features are due to
common descent. However, homologies can be difficult to identify in nature, and they are easy to confuse with
analogous traits.

     Cladistics, or the use of cladograms, is a method of visually distinguishing between homologous ancestral and
     derived characteristics. Ancestral characteristics are found in the common ancestor of the species being
     classified, whereas derived characteristics are only found in the groups in question. An ancestral
     characteristic that humans share with common ancestors is opposable thumbs. In contrast, a derived trait that
     is only found in modern humans is the chin. By exclusively looking at derived characteristics, biological
     anthropologists can develop a clearer understanding of the relationships between the groups being studied.

     The Molecular Tree of Life and Phylogenetics
     The emergence of genetic and molecular science has provided additional tools and lines of evidence to verify
     evolutionary relationships. The phylogenetic tree is a model used by modern taxonomists to reveal the
     complexity and diversity of life and its many branches. Phylogenetic trees show how species and other taxon
     groups evolved from a series of common ancestors. They are based on both physical and genetic evidence.

What Is a Primate?

lemurs, monkeys, gibbons, and human beings. (credit: Dawn Armfield/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)

Primates--including human beings--are characterized by a number of distinct physical features that
distinguish them from other mammals. These include

  · opposable thumbs and (in nonhuman primates) opposable big toes;
  · the presence of five digits (fingers or toes) on the appendages;
  · flat nails instead of curved claws;
  · pads at the tips of the fingers made up of deposits of fat and nerves;
  · reduced reliance on sense of smell and a relatively small snout;
  · depth perception;
  · binocular vision (being able to see one image with both eyes);
  · a relatively slow reproductive rate;
  · relatively large brain size; and
  · postorbital bars (bony rings that completely surround the eyes).

     The first four traits enhance dexterity and enable primates to use their hands and feet differently from other
     mammals. Other traits on this list represent a shift in emphasis among the sense organs between primates and
     other mammals. Primates are characterized by a greater emphasis on vision and a reduced reliance on smell
     relative to other mammals.

     Primate Behavioral Variation

     Anthropologists regularly ask, "What makes us human?" Comparative studies of humans with nonhuman
     primates help answer this question. Comparing the behavior of nonhuman primates and the behavior of
     human beings helps anthropologists identify what culture is and develop operational definitions for it. Without
     the comparative perspective provided by primatology, anthropologists would be missing an important piece of
     the puzzle of what makes humans human. Without primatology, anthropologists would not be able to fully
     understand humankind.

     Studying nonhuman primates in their environment is key to understanding variations in behavior and can
     shed light on humanity's ancient past. Primatologists are studying the chimpanzees at Gombe National Park in
     Tanzania, where they live in the rainforest. The behavior of chimpanzees that live in the tropical regions of
     Africa is quite different from the behavior of chimpanzees that live in the savanna at Fongoli in Senegal, in
     West Africa. Gombe chimps hunt red colobus monkeys without the use of tools, just catching them with their
     hands, while the Fongoli chimpanzees hunt galagos (also known as bush babies) using sticks that they adapt
     and used as spears (Pruetz, J.D, et al, 2015). The two environments also show differences in gender roles with
     both males and females in the Fongoli savannah group involved in hunting while only male chimpanzees hunt
     in the rainforests. Studying how these nonhuman primates both make and use tools is critical for
     understanding how humans' fossil ancestors may have used and constructed tools.

     An important question that primatologists and biological anthropologists seek to answer is the question, do
     nonhuman primates have culture? Whenever we see an exchange of ideas where one individual is involved in
     teaching another and when that knowledge is passed on to others in a group is according to anthropologists, a

form of culture. We see this happen in chimpanzee groups where older chimpanzees teach the young how to
use sticks to termite-fish, the process of extracting termites from a termite mound using a stick.

Explaining Primate Success

Why primates evolved as they did and how they filled and exploited the range of ecological niches they now fill
are questions that have not yet been adequately addressed. Over the last century, various hypotheses have
been raised to account for the evolution of primates and their unusual anatomical characteristics. These
theories include the arboreal theory, the visual predation hypothesis, and the angiosperm theory.

The arboreal theory proposes that primates evolved the traits they did as an adaptation to life in the trees.
Specifically, primates evolved thumbs and big toes that are perpendicular to the other digits to help them
grasp onto branches.

Matt Cartmill, a professor of anthropology at Boston University who spent his career trying to understand why
primates evolved the way they did, has complicated this theory. Cartmill recognized that forward-facing eyes
are characteristic not only of primates but also of predators such as cats and owls that prey on small animals.
Thus, forward-facing eyes, grasping hands and feet, and the presence of nails instead of claws may not have
arisen as adaptations to an arboreal environment. Rather, they may be adaptations that helped early primates
succeed as predators. According to the visual predation hypothesis, primate features are adaptations for
hunting insects and other small prey in the shrubby forest undergrowth and the lowest tiers of the forest
canopy.

The angiosperm theory states that the basic primate traits developed in coevolution with the rise of flowering
plants, also known as angiosperms. Flowering plants provide numerous resources, including nectar, seeds,
and fruits, and their appearance and diversification were accompanied by the appearance of ancestral forms
of major groups of modern birds and mammals. Some argue that visual predation is not common among
modern primates and that forward-facing eyes and grasping extremities may have arisen in response to the
need for fine visual and tactile discrimination in order to feed on small food items, such as fruits, berries, and
seeds, found among the branches and stems of flowering plants.

Primate Classification and Taxonomy

Scientists generally classify the order Primates into two suborders: Strepsirrhini (prosimians) and
Haplorrhini (tarsiers and anthropoids).

The Strepsirrhini or Prosimians
The Strepsirrhini are considered to be primitive primates that evolved much earlier than other primates. This
124  4 · Biological Evolution and Early Human Evidence

     suborder includes lemurs and lorises. All the Strepsirrhini primates, or strepsirrhines, possess numerous
     anatomical traits that distinguish them from the Haplorrhini primates, or haplorrhines. These include a
     clawlike nail on the second toe, referred to as a grooming claw, and incisors in the lower jaw that are tightly
     packed together and protrude from the mouth, forming what is called a toothcomb. There are seven families of
     living strepsirrhines, and all of them are found in what anthropologists refer to as the Old World, which
     consists of the continents of Africa, Asia, and Europe. Five groups of living strepsirrhines are found only on the
     island of Madagascar off the coast of Africa. Two additional families are found in Africa and Asia.

     FIGURE 4.26 The pygmy slow loris (Nycticebus pygmaeus) is an example of a Strepsirrhini primate. Pygmy slow
     lorises be found in Vietnam, Laos, and a province of China. (credit: Lionel Mauritson/Wikimedia Commons, Public
     Domain)

     The Haplorrhini or Anthropoids
     The Haplorrhini are broken down into two further infraorders, Simiiformes and Tarsiiformes, and the
     Simiiformes are further divided into Platyrrhini and Catarrhini. The Platyrrhini, or platyrrhines, are
     exclusively found in the New World (specifically Central and South America) and are colloquially referred to as
     New World monkeys. Their name is derived from the rounded shape of their external nostrils, which open off
     to the sides. New World monkeys are also distinguishable by their prehensile tails that serves as an extra limb
     for extra support when moving in the trees. The Catarrhini, or catarrhines, are found throughout Africa and
     Asia. They differ from the New World primates in that they possess narrow nostrils that face downward. The
     Catarrhini contain two superfamilies, Cercopithecoidea and Hominoidea, and are exclusively Old World. The
     Cercopithecoidea contain two main groups: cheek pouch monkeys (Cercopithecinae) and leaf-eating monkeys
     (Colobinae). The most distinctive feature of the cercopithecoid primates is their molars, which exhibit two
     parallel ridges. The most distinguishing feature of the hominoids is that they do not have tails and are largely
     terrestrial, or ground-dwelling. Examples of Hominoidea include gibbons, chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans,
     and humans.

     The Tarsier Puzzle
     The tarsier, which belongs to the family Tarsiidae, has both prosimian and anthropoid characteristics, which
     has made it difficult for scientists to classify. Tarsiers are currently classified within their own classification
     under the haplorrhines. One of the characteristics that tarsiers share with other haplorrhines, (including
     humans) is the inability to manufacture their own Vitamin C. They are the smallest known primate and are
     nocturnal, with extremely large eyes that take up much of the space in their skull. Due to their size of the eyes,
     the tarsier cannot rotate them; instead, it can rotate its head 360 degrees like an owl. Tarsiers are also the only
     primate carnivore, eating largely flying insects and sometimes small animals like bats and lizards. Tarsiers do
     not do well in captivity. They are extremely sensitive to noise and can become easily stressed. In fact, they can

become so stressed that they die by suicide by banging their heads against tree trunks.

4.6 Origin of and Classification of Primates

LEARNING OUTCOMES:

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Explain the concept of deep time.
  · Define fossils and explain some dating methods used on fossils.
  · Identify some of the key characteristics of early primate fossils, including their respective time periods.

Understanding Concepts of Time

Geologists divide deep history into time periods known as eras. Eras are generally based on the fossil life forms
observed. The oldest of the geological eras is the Eoarchean, which began approximately four billion years ago.
The majority of the fossil evidence that we have for primate evolution comes from the Cenozoic era--the
current geological era, dating from 65 million year ago (MYA) to the present. The Cenozoic era is divided into a
series of epochs. Each epoch is associated with specific forms of primates that evolved during that time period.

Fossils and Dating Methods

Biological anthropologists primarily, although not exclusively, study fossil artifacts. A fossil is any remainder
of a plant or animal that has been preserved in the earth. Upon the death of an organism, its body slowly
decomposes until all that remains are the teeth and the bones or a mere impression of the organism's original
form. Under most conditions, teeth and bones and impressions eventually deteriorate, too. However,
occasionally conditions are favorable for preservation. Examples of favorable materials for fossil formation
include volcanic ash, limestone, and mineralized groundwater. Scientists do not have fossils of everything that
lived in the past, and in some cases, remains from only a few individuals of a species have been found. The
fossil record is very incomplete. Robert Martin, a curator at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago,
126  4 · Biological Evolution and Early Human Evidence

     estimates that there have been more than 6,000 primate species, while the remains of only 3 percent have
     been found. Fossils are very rare, but they are extremely informative about human biological evolution.

     Making Sense of Fossils

     An important part of understanding fossils is determining how old they might be and putting them in
     chronological order. In order to use a primate fossil to reconstruct the evolutionary history of primates,
     anthropologists must first be able to estimate approximately how old that specific fossil is. For some time,
     relative dating methods were the only methods available for dating fossils. Relative dating calculates the
     approximate age of a fossil in comparison to other fossil specimens. The last half century has seen important
     advances in absolute dating, including techniques that have made possible the dating of the earliest phases of
     primate evolution. Absolute dating calculates the actual biological age of a fossil in years within a range of
     years.

     Relative Dating Techniques

     Stratigraphy is the best-known and most commonly used method of relative dating. Stratigraphy is based on
     the observation that soil is deposited in successive layers, or strata. The oldest layers of soil (and any artifacts
     or fossils within them) will appear beneath more recent layers of soil (and any artifacts or fossils within them).
     In addition to using the location of layers of soil to date fossils deposited within these layers, biological
     anthropologists also sometimes make use of other items consistently found in a specific layer of the soil. These
     items are referred to as indicator artifacts because they help indicate the relative age of fossils and other
     artifacts. The best indicator artifacts are those that have a wide geographic distribution, are presence for a
     short period of geological time, and/or are from a species that underwent rapid evolutionary change. Different
     indicator artifacts have been used to ascertain relative age in different areas of the world. In Africa, elephants,
     pigs, and horses have been used to establish relative dates of different geological strata. The stratigraphy at
     Olduvai Gorge in East Africa, for example, was established based on fossil pigs. The various species of pig in
     successive strata are different and distinct, allowing paleoanthropologists to distinguish the strata based on
     the pig species found within them. Once the stratigraphy of an area is established, the relative ages of two
     different fossils in different sites can be determined by the associated indicator artifacts.

     If a site has been disturbed, stratigraphy will not be a satisfactory way to determine relative age. In such a
     situation, it may be possible to use absolute dating methods to estimate the age of fossils found together in a
     disturbed site.

     Absolute Dating Techniques

     Many absolute dating methods are based on the rate of decay of a radioactive isotope. A radioactive isotope is a
     chemical element that dissipates excess energy by spontaneously emitting radiation. These emissions happen
     at known and stable rates. Once the rate of decay of a radioactive isotope is established, the age of a specimen
     containing that isotope can be estimated within a range of possible error.

     C-14
     The best-known method for determining the absolute age of fossils is carbon-14 or 14C (pronounced "C-14")
     dating. All plants and animals contain the isotope carbon-14 (14C). Plants absorb 14C from the air, and animals
     ingest plants containing the isotope. Because plants only absorb 14C when they are alive and animals only
     consume plants when they are alive, scientists can determine how long ago an animal or plant died based on
     the amount of 14C that remains in their cells. Carbon-14 has a known half-life of 5,730 years. This means that
     approximately half of the original 14C in an organism will be eliminated in 5,730 years after its death. For
     example, if an organism had an original 14C value of 100, then after 5,730 years, only 50 units of 14C would be
     present.

     Thermoluminescence
     Another absolute dating technique that is frequently used by paleoanthropologists is thermoluminescence
     dating. Thermoluminescence dating requires that either the fossils to be dated or the sediments that the fossils
     are within have been exposed to a high-temperature event, such as a volcanic explosion. During such a high-
     temperature event, all the radioactive elements within the material are released. Consequently, the amount of

4.6 · Origin of and Classification of Primates                                                                       127

radioactive elements that have accumulated in the artifact since the time of the high-temperature event can be
used to calculate the artifact's age.

Primates of the Paleocene Epoch
The Paleocene epoch began approximately 65 MYA and ended about 54 MYA. It is the most poorly understood
epoch of the Cenozoic era, as it is the time period with the fewest fossils to represent it. However, this epoch is
considered important to primate evolution because it offers the first unequivocal record of the earliest
primates. Evidence of the most primitive primate yet identified was found in the U.S. state of Montana, in a
geological deposit that was dated to the earliest part of the Paleocene. This creature is known as Purgatorius.
Purgatorius is similar to extinct and living primates - and distinct from other mammals - in the presence of an
elongated last lower molar and an enlarged upper central incisor (resulting in what one could think of as "Bugs
Bunny teeth"). These two characteristics, which are shared by all living primates today, suggest that
Purgatorius may be the common ancestor of later primates.

FIGURE 4.28 Purgatorius unio may be the common ancestor of all later primate. Remains of Purgatorius unio have
been found in deposits dated to be about 63 million years old. (attribution: Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY
4.0 license)

Primates of the Eocene Epoch
The Eocene epoch, which began approximately 54 MYA and ended about 34 MYA, is marked by the
disappearance of Purgatorius and the first appearance of primates that more closely resemble modern-day
primates, especially in the fact that they possess postorbital bars composed entirely of bone. A postorbital bar
is a bony ring surrounding the entirety of the eye orbit. This contrasts with other mammals whose postorbital
bars are part bone and part cartilage. Some fossil specimens also possess a toothcomb and/or a grooming
claw, characteristics that are exclusively found in strepsirrhine primates today. Other anatomical
characteristics that are significant would be the ankle bones which researchers believe played a key role in the
evolutionary success of primates. The evolution of primates during the Eocene was tremendous. It has been
hypothesized that there were four times as many strepsirrhine primates during the Eocene than there are
living primates today. Fossil primates in Eocene deposits are common in North America and Europe and are
becoming known in Asia and Africa. However, there are currently no known fossil primates from the Eocene in
South America or Antarctica.

Primates of the Oligocene Epoch
The Oligocene epoch, which began approximately 34 MYA and ended about 22 MYA, marks the appearance of
the first fossil monkeys. The earliest unambiguous haplorrhine fossils were found at the Fayum, an
archaeological site about 60 miles from Cairo, Egypt, that today represents part of the Sahara. The Fayum
primates are divided into two main groups: Parapithecoidea and Propliopithecoidea. Based on their teeth,
these primates are believed to be the earliest New World and Old World monkeys, respectively. Teeth are
generally described according to a dental formula that indicates the number of each type of teeth in each
quadrant of the jaw. An organism with a 2.1.2.3 dental formula has two incisors, one canine, two premolars,
and three molars in each quadrant of their upper and lower jaws. Based on the presence of a third premolar, a
128  4 · Biological Evolution and Early Human Evidence

     trait found in all New World monkeys, it is probable that Propliopithecus represents the earliest New World
     monkeys, even though they first evolved in Africa. Likewise, it is probable the propliopithecoids represent the
     earliest catarrhine primate, as they are the first fossil monkeys that possess a dental formula of 2.1.2.3 found
     in catarrhine primates.

     Miocene Apes
     The Miocene epoch contains fossil evidence of some of the earliest apes such as Proconsul africanus africanus
     which lived in Africa from 23 to 14 mya. The earliest Miocene ape, found in Africa, is Proconsul. Unlike
     modern-day apes, the Proconsul lacked long, curved digits, suggesting that they were able to hang from
     branches but more often moved about on all four of their limbs. Proconsul also lacked a tail, which is why they
     are considered apes and not monkeys. Like all Old World monkeys and apes, including humans, their teeth
     show a pattern of 2.1.2.3. Another well-known ape from the Miocene is Sivapithecus. Sivapithecus fossils are
     very common throughout Asia, with a particularly large number having been found in Turkey. Like modern-
     day humans, they exhibit very thick dental enamel, suggesting that these apes regularly ate very hard foods.
     The most intriguing aspect of Sivapithecus morphology is that the skulls show a tremendous resemblance to
     the living orangutan in features such as its tall nasal openings and high eye sockets.

     FIGURE 4.29 Sivapithecus is one the earliest known ape species. Fossil remains exhibit the tall nasal openings and
     high eye sockets currently visible in orangutans. (credit: "Sivapithecus indicus (Fossil Ape) (Dhok Pathan Formation,
     Upper Miocene; Potwar Plateau, Pakistan)" by James St. John/flickr, CC BY 2.0)
     While it is known that orangutans probably evolved from a Sivapithecus-type ape, there are no clear
     candidates for the ancestors of modern African great apes. There have only been two fossils found that clearly
     and unequivocally belong to the ancestors of modern African apes. Samburupithecus is a large late Miocene
     ape found in northern Kenya. It is known to resemble modern African apes. It differs from other Miocene
     fossils in having molar teeth that are elongated in a direction from the front of the mouth toward the back,
     instead of from cheek to tongue. Another fossil from the late Miocene (9-10 MYA) that is sometimes identified
     as an ancestor of modern African apes is Ouranopithecus, found in Greece, which has facial morphology that
     links it to both African apes and humans.

4.7 Our Ancient Past: The Earliest Hominins

LEARNING OUTCOMES:

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Compare and contrast some early hominin species.
  · Identify some key adaptations and characteristics found in early hominins.
  · Identify key adaptations and derived traits that emerged in changing environments.

Walking on Two Feet

The term hominin refers to all species considered to be in direct lineage to humans, which include the genera
Homo, Australopithecus, Paranthropus, and Ardipithecus. Hominids refers to all modern and extinct great
apes, which include humans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and orangutans and their ancestors. These terms have
been understood to represent different things over the years, but the definitions provided here are the most
current. While all hominins may differ in varying ways from one another, they all share one anatomical
behavioral complex: bipedal locomotion.

Scientists can hypothesize about how a creature moved by analyzing several aspects of its morphology.
Brachiators, animals that move by swinging from branch to branch, generally have long arms, while leapers,
animals that propel their bodies through the force of their lower limbs, have relatively long legs. Arboreal
primates have arms and legs of equal length. In bipedal locomotion, one leg is called the stance leg, and the
other is called the step leg. While the stance leg is on the ground, the step leg is off the ground and striding
forward. During normal walking, both feet are on the ground only about 25 percent of the time. As speed of
locomotion increases, the percentage of time that both feet are on the ground decreases. As a result, for most
of the time that bipedal organisms are moving, their body is balanced on only one of their legs (the stance leg).
To ensure that bipedal organisms do not fall over while balanced on their stance leg, they have undergone
many anatomical changes since the earliest hominin ancestors.

One of the most important anatomical changes that facilitate successful bipedalism is the angling of the femur
(upper leg bone) inward at what is referred to as a valgus angle, which positions the knees and feet under the
center of the pelvis. Bipedal hominins have also evolved spinal curves that make it possible for the hips to
balance the weight of the upper body. The evolution of the arch in the foot as well as the realignment of the big
toe so that it is parallel to the other toes is also instrumental in transmitting weight during the step phase of
bipedal locomotion.
130  4 · Biological Evolution and Early Human Evidence

     FIGURE 4.30 In humans, the femur bones angle inward. This adaptation, known as the valgus angle, makes
     bipedal locomotion (walking upright) more comfortable and more efficient. (attribution: Rice University, OpenStax,
     under CC BY 4.0 license)
     The most important evidence of early hominin bipedalism is provided by the work of English
     paleoanthropologist Mary Leakey. In the 1980s, Mary Leakey discovered a 75-foot trail of footprints made by
     three bipedal individuals who had crossed a thick bed of wet volcanic ash about 3.5 MYA. These footprints
     were found in East Africa at the site of Laetoli. Based on the date and the location, it is probable that these
     footprints were made by Australopithecus afarensis. Analysis of the Laetoli footprints indicates a modern
     striding gait.

     FIGURE 4.31 These replicas of the 3.6-million-year-old hominin footprints found in Tanzania by Mary Leakey are
     on display at the National Museum of Nature and Science in Tokyo, Japan. (credit: "Australopithecus afarensis Fossil
     Hominid Footprints (Pliocene, 3.6-3.7 Ma; Laetoli Area, Northern Tanzania, Eastern Africa)" by James St. John/
     flickr, CC BY 2.0)
     The evolution of hominin bipedalism required complex anatomical reorganization. For natural selection to
     produce such a tremendous amount of change, the benefits of these changes must have been great. There have
     been dozens of hypotheses for these changes, ranging from freeing hands to carry tools, food, or offspring to
     increasing energy efficiency or thermoregulation (the ability to maintain the body's temperature) by exposing

more of the body's surface. None of the hypotheses are testable, making it truly challenging to understand why
humanity's ancestors made such a huge behavioral shift. The next sections explore some of the key discoveries
of early hominin fossils in which anthropologists see some of the earliest indications of the adaptation of
bipedalism in the human story.

Miocene Hominids

The first hominid fossils appear in the late Miocene, 10 to 5 MYA. Sometime between 7 MYA and 4 MYA,
hominids moved out of the trees and began to adapt more fully to a ground-based living niche. Unfortunately,
the fossil evidence from this time period is extremely sparse, but new finds continue to be discovered.

A complete cranium of Sahelanthropus tchadensis was found in 2002 by French paleoanthropologist Michel
Brunet and his team in Chad in West Africa. Sahelanthropus is a fossil ape that lived approximately 7 MYA and
is claimed by some researchers to be the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees. Genetic studies
indicate that humans and chimpanzees diverged from one another sometime between 5 MYA and 7 MYA, so
this species lived right at the time of the divergence. The cranial capacity is a mere 350 cubic centimeters (cc),
which is equivalent to a chimpanzee; the modern human cranial capacity is approximately 1,400 cc.
Sahelanthropus also has a very large brow ridge (the large bone above the eyes), and the location of the
foramen magnum, the opening at the base of the skull where the spinal column enters the skull, suggests that
its head was not held over its spine and thus it was not bipedal.

Orrorin tugenensis was found in Kenya in 2001 by geologist Martin Pickford of the Collège de France and
paleontologist Brigitte Senut of France's National Museum of Natural History. Orrorin tugenensis was dated to
approximately 6 MYA. Orrorin was proposed to be a hominin due to anatomical traits that suggest bipedalism.
For example, the femoral head (the big, rounded ball at the top of the leg bone that connects the leg to the hip)
is much larger than in quadrupedal apes, suggesting the femur was being used to support the weight of the
upper body. The muscles attached to the femur also suggest bipedal movement. Another feature that suggests
that Orrorin is truly a hominin is the teeth, which exhibit thick dental enamel and small, square molars, much
like modern humans.

Pliocene Hominins

The Pliocene epoch extended from 5 MYA to 1.8 MYA. Fossils from the Pliocene show evidence of the evolution
of hominins that are clearly bipedal. They also show evidence of clear, albeit primitive, cultural behavior.
Climatically, the Pliocene was colder than the preceding Miocene, which resulted in changing sea levels and an
increase in ice at the poles, opening up some previously inaccessible areas. During this period, North and
South America became connected through the Isthmus of Panama, and a land bridge across the Bering Strait
appeared between Alaska and Siberia.

Ardipithecus ramidus
Ardipithecus ramidus was found in Ethiopia in 1992 by American paleoanthropologist Tim White and was
dated to about 4.4 MYA. This is the first discovered hominin species to be dated to the Pliocene era. Based on
the forward position of the foramen magnum, it can be concluded that Ardipithecus was bipedal. Also, the
upper arm bones are very small, suggesting that the arms were not used to support weight during locomotion.
Ardipithecus possesses numerous traits, such as thin dental enamel, evidence of a reduced canine, and an
opposable big toe. As a result of the latter trait, many believe that Ardipithecus was bipedal on the ground and
quadrupedal in the trees. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the fossil bones were found in relatively
heavily forested environments. The reduced canine is a derived trait appearing even earlier than A. ramidus
and is not what we would typically see in African ape males who have large intimidating canines. Current
hypotheses suggest that over time smaller canines became dominant when there became less need to show
aggression along with a female preference for males with milder temperaments (Suwa, G., et al. 2021).

     The Robust and Gracile Australopithecines
     The next few sections will examine various australopithecine species that had diverse physical characteristics
     related to morphology of the teeth and skull. Based on these characteristics, paleoanthropologists classified
     these species into gracile and robust forms, as illustrated in Figure 4.33. Gracile species had a more
     pronounced projection of the jaw (prognathism), less flared cheeks with no sagittal crest, and smaller teeth
     and jaws. The sagittal crest in the robust australopithecines accommodated large temporalis jaw muscles for
     chewing tough plant materials.

     FIGURE 4.33 Australopithecine species are classified as either robust or gracile. A defining feature of the robust
     species is the sagittal crest visible on the Paranthropus boisei skull on the left. Gracile species, such as A. afarensis,
     on the right, display more pronounced projection of the face (prognathism). (credit: left, Rama/Wikimedia

and A. sediba. The robust australopithecines (classified under the genus Paranthropus) include Paranthropus
robustus, P. boisei, and P. aethiopicus. The gracile species emerged around 4 MYA and disappeared 2 MYA,
while robust species continued to exist for another million years. The next sections will first take a look at
some of the gracile forms of australopithecine, followed by the robust forms.

Australopithecus africanus
Australopithecus africanus was the first australopithecine discovered, in 1924, and was described by
Australian anatomist and anthropologist Raymond Dart, who found the fossil in a box of fossils sent to him by
lime quarry workers at a site called Taung in South Africa. The most notable specimen in the box was a skull
from a child, which Dart had to chip away from the stone it was embedded in. It took Dart four years to
separate the teeth. The skull is now known as the Taung skull or Taung child. Dart argued that the Taung child
represents "an extinct race of apes intermediate between living anthropoids and man" (Wayman 2011). He
noted that the skull was long and narrow, not rounded as in modern humans, and its brain averaged a mere
422 cc, equivalent to a chimpanzee. However, the Taung child did not possess brow ridges, had circular orbits,
and had minimal prognathism as well as small canines and no diastema (space in the jaw for large canines to
be positioned when the mouth closes). These latter traits are all analogous to modern humans. Most
importantly, Dart noted that the forward position of the foramen magnum indicated that the skull was poised
on top of the vertebral column, suggesting bipedalism and an upright posture.

africanus, displays traits that resemble modern humans in some ways but not others. (credit: Daderot/Wikimedia

Australopithecus afarensis
In 1973, a good portion of a skeleton (about 40 percent) was found in the Afar region of Ethiopia by American
paleoanthropologist Donald Johanson. He called the skeleton Lucy, after a Beatles song. It was dated to around
3.75-2.8 MYA and was determined to be a member of the species Australopithecus afarensis. Like all fossils
recently discovered, Lucy was given an identification or accession number, KNM-AL-288. The KNM acronym
stands for the Kenya National Museum, where the fossil is housed, and AL stands for the Afar locality where
the fossil was found. Since then, more specimens of this species have been found in Kenya, Tanzania, and
Ethiopia, all in East Africa.

     and toes of A. afarensis are apparent. (credit: "Australopithecus afarensis Fossil Hominid (Lucy Skeleton) (Hadar

     Australopithecus afarensis is dated from 3.9 to 2.9 MYA with an endocranial capacity of around 400 cc, which
     is approximately the same as a common chimpanzee. There are two morphological features that provide
     evidence that A. afarenis moved more like a great ape than a human. First, it had arms that were substantially
     longer than modern humans'. Long arms are generally found in animals that hang from branches, suggesting
     that A. afarensis also exhibited this behavior. Also, A. afarensis possesses finger and toe bones that are long
     and curved, another characteristic of animals that hang from branches. However, there is one important
     morphological feature of A. afarensis that suggests that this species may have moved somewhat like modern
     humans. The shape of A. afarensis's pelvis (hip bones) looks substantially more like a modern human's than it
     does an ape's. Instead of the hip bones being long and narrow, they are short and wide. Most
     paleoanthropologists believe that this change in pelvic shape indicates that A. afarensis moved like modern
     humans do, on two legs. While A. afarensis may have locomoted bipedally, the morphological differences
     between A. afarensis and modern humans suggest they did not move in exactly the same way. Current
     consensus is that A. afarensis was both tree dwelling and bipedal. Other anatomical evidence of bipedalism
     includes a more anterior position of the foramen magnum and the angle of the femoral head and neck.

     Australopithecus garhi
     Also found in Ethiopia, Australopithecus garhi is dated to approximately 2.5 MYA. Its cranial capacity is
     slightly greater than A. afarensis, at 450 cc. Australopithecus garhi has incisors that are larger than those of
     any of the known australopithecines or Homo. The function of the large incisors is not yet known. The most
     exciting aspect of A. garhi is that it provides evidence of the earliest use of stone tools by a hominin.
     Specifically, A. garhi fossils were found with fossil bones of ruminants, such as antelopes, that displayed
     numerous cut marks. Cut marks are made on bones by the process of removing meat from the bones with
     stone or metal tools. Based on this finding, biological anthropologists have hypothesized that A. garhi used
     some type of stone tool for butchering.

Australopithecus sediba
In 2008, the clavicle bone of Australopithecus sediba was discovered by Matthew Berger, the nine-year-old son
of American paleontologist Lee Berger, in Malapa, South Africa. Further excavation in a cave feature uncovered
two partial skeletons, one of an adult female and the other a younger juvenile. A. sediba is considered an
important species because it appears in the fossil record around the time of the first emergence of the genus
Homo around 2 mya. The classification of A. sediba was initially difficult to determine, due to its complex
overlapping features, which include humanlike spine, pelvis, hands, and teeth and a chimpanzee-like foot.
This combination of traits suggests both tree climbing and bipedal adaptations. After studying the
characteristics collectively, anthropologists classified A. sediba as a species of Australopithecus. It is
considered a direct ancestor of Homo erectus and Homo ergaster, which are discussed in Chapter 5, The
Genus Homo and the Emergence of Us . It is believed that A. sediba could be a descendent of A. africanus,
which suggests the species may be a dead end within the lineage to humans. Its classification and relationship
with the genus Homo will likely remain highly debated.

Paranthropus robustus
Thirteen years after Raymond Dart's discovery, South African paleontologist and medical doctor Robert Broom
discovered Paranthropus robustus at a site called Kromdraai in South Africa. The most obvious difference
between Dart's and Broom's respective fossils, A. africanus and P. robustus, is that the morphology of Broom's
fossil is much larger. Its features include a sagittal crest and a flared zygomatic arch for the attachment of a
large temporalis muscle for chewing a diet reliant on hard nuts and seeds. This interpretation was further
supported by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which was used to evaluate the markings etched into the
teeth. As the teeth increased in size the incisors and canines shrank, giving Paranthropus a flatter face with
less projection of the jaw. There are some who argue that depending on the environment and locale, some
Paranthropus may have been omnivores, with varied diets similar to those of H. ergaster. (Lee-Thorp,
Thackeray, and van der Merwe 2000).

Paranthropus boisei
Following in Broom's footsteps, other scientists began searching for fossils in East Africa. Beginning in 1931,
Kenyan and British paleoanthropologist Louis Leakey and his wife, Mary Leakey, worked in what is known as
the Eastern Rift Valley, which is a 1,200-mile trough extending through Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania. They
searched for almost 30 years before they found their first hominin fossil, Paranthropus boisei
(OH-5)--originally classified as Zinjanthropus boisei--in 1959. It is often referred to as the hyper-robust
hominin because of its mohawk of bone on the top of the skull. Other features include a low or absent forehead,
a flat face, large jaws, and large attachment sites over the entire skull for chewing muscles.

     Paranthropus aethiopicus
     We have little knowledge about Paranthropus aethiopicus (shown in Figure 4.37), which has been dated to
     about 2.5 MYA and is referred to as the "black skull." It is believed that this species falls somewhere between
     the robust and gracile australopithecines, having characteristics of both. The species was discovered in
     Ethiopia in 1967 by a French expedition team headed by Camille Arambourg and Yves Coppens.

     Landmarks and Questions

     While the fossils discovered up to this point have provided a small window into the story of humanity's past,
     they have also simultaneously raised numerous questions. Questions related to phylogenetic relationships and
     points of divergence are challenges for paleoanthropologists, who have only fragmentary fossil evidence to
     build hypotheses around. Nevertheless, the discoveries that have been made represent important landmarks
     in anthropologists' understanding, providing clues that will lead to the next steps in the human journey.

     Pedestrian Survey

     Conduct a pedestrian survey to try to locate fossils near where you live (trilobites in New York, ammonites in
     Texas, shark teeth near riverbeds, arrowheads). Think about where you would most likely find a fossil and why.
     Try to extract one without destroying the environment around it, which provides important context. Try to
     figure out what kind of fossil it is by doing some Internet research. Why do you think that this fossil was
     preserved? What information would make the search for fossils easier?

5.4 Tracking Genomes: Our Human Story Unfolds
INTRODUCTION Our human story continues with the rise of the genus Homo which at one time represented
at least 8 different species in our human lineage - with only H. sapiens surviving. The genus Homo displays
some of the most diverse and complex examples of both australopithecine and Homo characteristics, which
has made the classification of species in this genus challenging. In this chapter we take a look at how
paleoanthropologists have defined Homo and at attempts to answer the question, "What does a species of the
genus Homo look like?"

     5.1 Defining the Genus Homo

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       · Describe the time periods and geological context of the genus Homo.
       · Identify some key differences between the genus Homo and Australopithecus.
       · Define some of the limitations of and challenges in the classification of hominin species in the genus Homo.
       · Explain the concept of encephalization as it relates to early hominin evolutionary development and as a tool for
           hominin classification.

     Putting Homo into Context

     Before learning about the hominin species that make up the category genus Homo, it will be helpful to become
     familiar with the key archaeological time periods with which Homo is associated. The species and cultural
     developments mentioned below will be explored in greater detail in the sections that follow.

       · Lower Paleolithic (from roughly 3 million years ago to approximately 300,000 BCE): This period includes
          H. habilis and the Oldowan tool industry, followed by H. ergaster and the Acheulean tool industry.

       · Middle Paleolithic (approximately 300,000-40,000 BCE): This period includes continued use of
          Acheulean tools by H. heidelbergensis, followed by H. neanderthalensis and the Mousterian tool industry.

       · Upper Paleolithic (approximately 43,000-26,000 BCE): The Upper Paleolithic saw the emergence of cave
           art like that found in the famous Chauvet Cave in France (Figure 5.29), Venus figurines (Figure 5.28), and
           an increased use of bone and antler in tools and jewelry. The most recent ice age occurred during this
           time, with glaciers covering huge parts of the planet. The emergence of Paleoindians and the use of Clovis
           points, which were used to kill large game such as mastodons and mammoths, occurred near the end of
           this time period.

       · Neolithic (Agricultural Age) (8,000-3,000 BCE): New innovations appear during the agricultural age, or
          "Neolithic revolution," as H. sapiens set up permanent settlements. Humans begin to transition from
           being hunters and gatherers to growing grow crops, owning land, and domesticating animals.

     The Challenge of Defining the Genus Homo

     The previous chapter introduced the australopithecines, who were diverse in their physical characteristics
     (gracile and robust), with large jaws and teeth and small brain size. A key characteristic shared by both the
     australopithecines and the genus Homo is bipedalism. The transition to bipedalism is linked with various
     anatomical changes, including longer legs, changes in spinal curvature, and the development of arches in the
     feet to conserve energy and increase balance when walking.

     What criteria other than bipedalism might be used to classify a species under the genus Homo? Many
     anthropologists have attempted to establish specific criteria to use in determining a classification of Homo.
     Paleoanthropologists Mary Leakey, Louis Leakey, and John Napier, as well as primatologist Phillip Tobias,
     were among the first to extensively study the fossils of Homo habilis, considered to be one of the earliest
     species in the genus Homo. H. habilis had a brain size of around 661-700 cc, which was larger than the
     australopithecines', with hands that were capable of the dexterity needed for making tools, due to bone
     structure changes and a repositioning of the thumb, which allowed for better grip.

     The type specimen OH 7 of H. habilis dated between 2 and 1.7 MYA and was found in 1960 at Olduvai Gorge by
     Jonathan and Mary Leakey. It was described by Louis Leakey in 1964. Type specimen refers to a specimen that
     serves as the standard for the taxon or classification group for that species. OH 7 is the identification or
     accession number of this specific specimen and stands for "Olduvai Hominid #7." The specimen consisted of a
     partial juvenile skull, hand, and foot bones. It possessed teeth that were much smaller than those of any
     australopithecine and was possibly in coexistence with the robust australopithecines (Paranthropus). Based on
     an endocranial cast (an imprint of the interior of the brain case), it was determined that H. habilis may have
     possessed what is called a Broca's area in the brain. Broca's area, which includes two Brodmann areas
     (referred to as 44 and 45), is located in the middle of the left cerebral cortex of the brain and is especially
     important for speech development (Figure 5.2). Some scientists have suggested that H. habilis started to

develop the neural networks necessary for human speech, while others argue that H. habilis probably already
had speech.

The postcranial features (skeletal structures in the body other than the skull) of Homo habilis are not as well
established, as is the case for many other early hominin fossils. This can be problematic, as many hominin
species coexisted with overlapping traits. Likewise, it can be problematic to have postcranial material and not
the cranium or skull. The skull often serves as a diagnostic tool when postcranial materials do not provide
enough evidence or provide confusing evidence.

Based on their research on H. habilis, Mary Leakey, Louis Leakey, and John Napier proposed the following
criteria for classifying Homo: a brain size over 600 cc; a round, globular skull; tool use; reduced prognathism
(protrusion of the jaw) and smaller jaws and mandibles; humanlike postcranial features; and feet that are fully
adapted for walking (Leakey, Tobias, and Napier 1964). While this list established specific and fairly
comprehensive guidance, the diversity of traits and the ways in which they overlapped didn't always line up
with the criteria.

H. habilis has been at the center of several debates regarding their taxonomic position and relationship with
other early archaic Homo species. For example, H. habilis was initially believed to have been a direct human
ancestor through the lineage of Homo erectus and then modern humans. This viewpoint is now debated and
has resulted in a scientific divide between those supporting H. habilis and those suggesting another Homo
species, H. rudolfensis, as being the ancestor of H. erectus. H. rudolfensis is an archaic Homo dated to about 2
MYA, which coexisted with other Homo species during that time period. A cranium was discovered in 1972
along Lake Turkana in Kenya by Bernard Ngeneo, a local Kenyan. The specimen was later described by
paleoanthropologist Richard Leakey. There is a lot that is not known about this species; scientists are missing
postcranial materials, and as of yet no tools have been found. There are hypotheses that propose that H.
rudolfensis might be a H. habilis male, exhibiting a larger cranium than that seen in a female H. habilis. Others
suggest it is a completely different species. Another controversy centers on tool use. While Homo habilis was
long regarded as the earliest hominin to use stone tools, it has been determined, based on evidence of
cutmarks, that at least one australopithecine (A. garhi) used stone tools before H. habilis, at around 2.6 MYA
(Semaw et al. 1997).

     While there are still questions as to the phylogenetic relationship of H. habilis and H. rudolfensis, there is
     general agreement that Homo did evolve from Australopithecus. The timing and placement of the split
     between Australopithecus and Homo, however, is still debated. H. habilis was determined to not be an
     Australopithecus due to its smaller teeth, a humanlike foot, and hand bones that suggested an ability to
     manipulate objects with precision.

     One of the main considerations in classifying H. habilis as a Homo and not an Australopithecus was its cranial
     capacity, which is a measurement that indicates brain size. With some exceptions, cranial capacity can serve
     as an indicator of where a hominin fossil might belong in the hominin phylogenetic tree. Encephalization
     refers to a progressive increase in brain size over time. In human evolution, we can observe encephalization
     beginning with Homo habilis and progressing more rapidly through H. erectus. Encephalization correlates
     with an increase in behavioral, cognitive, and cultural complexity. Cognitive developments correspond with
     our ability to construct and form ideas, including the ability think in and communicate via symbolic and
     abstract language, such as that used in storytelling, ritual, and art. There are always exceptions, however, such
     as the island-dwelling, small-brained H. floresiensis, who will be introduced later in this chapter. In spite of
     having a very small brain, H. floresiensis made and used tools and built fires. This discovery has challenged
     what we thought we knew about the correlation of brain size and cognitive development in human evolution.

     The encephalization quotient (EQ) can serve as a good indicator (with some exceptions) of classification
     within the genus Homo. The encephalization quotient is a calculation arrived at by comparing the ratio
     between actual brain size (determined with either a mass or volume calculation) and expected brain size. Body
     size is a factor in these measurements as expected brain size reflects the relationship between brain and body
     size for a given taxonomic group (Jerison 1973). The larger the brain weight relative to the overall body weight,
     the more likely that the brain was used for more complex cognitive tasks. Harry J. Jerison (1973) was the first
     to develop EQ measurements. The formula he used for calculating EQ in birds and mammals is brain mass/
     0.12 × (body mass)0.66. Other formulas have also been proposed, such as EQ = brain mass (11.22 × body mass
     0.76) (Martin 1981). While EQ is a strong tool for studying brain size in early hominins, there are always
     potential margins of error when dealing with fragmentary fossils, and increasingly alternative forms of
     measurements are being proposed. One study proposes that EQ should no longer be used as a tool in
     calculating brain size in primates and other vertebrate species, based on the premise that cognitive
     performance does not depend on body size and so body size should not be included in the formula (Schaik et
     al. 2021). Other theories consider the number of cortical neurons and neural connections as most important
     when considering cognitive ability (Roth and Dicke 2012). According to this approach, the density of the cortex

5.2 · Tools and Brains: Homo habilis, Homo ergaster, and Homo erectus                                              145

is more associated with intelligence than is brain size. These alternate approaches would perhaps better
explain those exceptions in the fossil records, such as H. floresiensis. Other interesting research is looking at
potential levels of cognition and memory as it relates to levels of tool complexity (Read and van der Leeuw
2008).

In spite of these criticisms, many see EQ measurements as providing fairly consistent results. Modern humans
(Homo sapiens) have an EQ of roughly 6.0-7.0 (meaning that their brain mass is six to seven times greater
than what one would expect to find in a comparable mammal of the same body size). H. erectus has an EQ of
4.0, while for an australopithecine EQ is around 2.5 to 3.0 (Fuente 2012, 227). Figure 5.4 shows increases in
average brain sizes for various species over time.

years. (Xiujie, Wu, and Norton 2007). (credit: Gisselle Garcia, artist (brain images), CC BY 4.0)

5.2 Tools and Brains: Homo habilis, Homo ergaster, and Homo erectus

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Compare and contrast the anatomy and material culture of H. habilis, H. erectus, and H. ergaster.
  · Define the term "tool industry" and describe the tools typified by the Oldowan and Acheulean industries.
  · Identify possible correlations between the environment, diet, new behaviors, and brain growth.

The Toolmakers

Archeologists use the word industry to describe a classification or assemblage of stone tools. The Oldowan tool
industry is the oldest known stone tool industry. It dates from around 2.5 to 1.5 MYA. Because there were
several hominins in Africa during this time, it is unclear whether these tools were created and used by H.
habilis or by Paranthropus boisei, or by both (Susman 1991). Oldowan tools are fairly crude and primitive in
appearance, which can make it difficult to find and identify them in the field.
146  5 · The Genus Homo and the Emergence of Us

     FIGURE 5.5 An Oldowan tool. This chopper is made of quartzite and dated to the lower Paleolithic period. (credit:
     Locutus Borg/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
     Mary Leakey was the first to create a system to classify Oldowan assemblages, basing her classification on
     utility, or how the tools were used. Later efforts were made to classify tools based on how the tools were made.
     All Oldowan tools were created by using hard hammer percussion, in which flakes are chipped away from a
     stone, resulting in a "core". These cores served as basic tool that could have been used for killing game, cutting
     meat and plants, and possibly woodworking. Oldowan toolmaking is the earliest evidence of "flint knapping," a
     technique that became more complex over time, resulting in more sophisticated tools (Figure 5.6).

     FIGURE 5.6 Demonstration of flint knapping, an ancient technique for shaping stones into useful tools. (credit:
     "Flint-knapping Demonstration" Tonto National Monument/NPS photo/flickr, CC BY 2.0)
     Handedness, or brain lateralization (i.e., whether one is right-handed or left-handed), is a cognitive
     development that can be inferred through evidence of the use of a dominant hand in creating and using tools.
     The use of a dominant hand suggests a possible reorganization of the brain. It is believed that about 90 percent
     of humans are right-handed, which differs from apes, which are closer to 50 percent. David Frayer (2016), an
     anthropologist from the University of Kansas, has concluded that the brain lateralization of Homo habilis was
     more like that of modern human than that of apes. Frayer found striations on the teeth of a 1.8-million-year-
     old Homo habilis fossil that indicate right-handedness. He concluded that meat was pinched between the teeth
     and held in place with the left hand, while the right hand cut the meat with a tool. Brain lateralization,
     increasing brain size, and tool use are just some of the key developments we see in the genus Homo.

Homo ergaster

Homo ergaster is the first Homo that looks much like H. sapiens. A key difference between H. ergaster and
earlier hominins is that H. ergaster exhibits substantially less sexual dimorphism in body size. H. ergaster
males were only 20 percent larger than females. Likewise, modern human males are only 15 percent larger
than females. This contrasts sharply with all other previous hominins, such as the australopithecines, in which
males were 50 percent larger than females. It is well established that in mammals, significant dimorphism is
associated with polygyny, and a lack of dimorphism is associated with a monogamous mating system. It has
been suggested that the reduction in dimorphism seen in H. ergaster may indicate less male-male competition
for access to females and perhaps a shift toward a monogamous mating system, with substantial parental
investment in offspring.

Other similarities between H. ergaster and modern humans are seen in the teeth and postcranial features. The
average cranial capacity of H. ergaster is 1,100 cc, which is just a bit smaller than that of modern humans, who
average 1,400 cc. There is a very important specimen of H. ergaster that bears mentioning, the Nariokotome
Boy. This specimen was discovered in 1984 by Kenyan paleontologist Kamoya Kimeu near Lake Turkana in
Kenya. It is dated to approximately 1.6 MYA. The specimen is believed to represent a boy of about 12 years old,
determined by various dental and cranial features. He was about 5 feet 4 inches tall, roughly the same height
as a modern boy of the same age (Figure 5.7). It has been estimated that his adult height would be around 5 feet
10 inches, with an estimated cranial capacity of 900 cc. The Nariokotome Boy looks tremendously modern in
appearance despite being 1.6 million years old.

Homo ergaster Technology
Homo ergaster continued to use Oldowan stone tools, but they also began to construct much more complex
tools, referred to as the Acheulean industry (Figure 5.8). These tools have been found throughout Africa,
Europe, and the Middle East and are first noted as appearing approximately 1.6 MYA to 200,000 years ago.
These types of tools are rarely found in Asia. It is currently unclear whether this is because the Acheulean
industry had not yet been developed when H. erectus migrated to Asia or because bamboo (a plant found in
148  5 · The Genus Homo and the Emergence of Us

     abundance in Asia) was found to be a more versatile resource than stone. As wood and bamboo are
     biodegradable, no remains of tools constructed from these materials would exist today.

     FIGURE 5.8 This hand axe, found in the Zamora province, Spain, displays the form and construction techniques
     typical of the Acheulean industry. (credit: Jose-Manuel Benito/Locutus Borg/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
     Unlike Oldowan tools, Acheulean tools actually look like tools. Acheulean tools are distinct from Oldowan tools
     in that they were modified on both sides, resulting in a symmetrical tool with two faces, also known as biface.
     One end of the tool was tapered, while the other end was rounded. The creation of symmetrical objects from
     stone materials is believed to represent an increase in cognitive ability as well as motor skills in the tool maker.
     These bifaces were struck from large flakes, which had themselves been struck from boulder cores. This
     required a more delicate technique than banging one rock into another. Acheulean tools were typically created
     used the soft hammer technique. In this technique, hard rock such as flint is chipped by striking it with a softer
     material such as bone or wood. The gentler blows detach small flakes that leave smooth, shallow scars,
     creating a straighter and more uniform cutting edge.
     The main advantage of Acheulean technology is that it allowed hominins to get a better grip on their tools, as
     they were shaped to fit the hand. This tool type was used primarily as a hunter's knife but also for chopping,
     scraping, and even piercing. The most common type of biface tool is a hand axe. Note that even though these
     tools are called axes, they are held in the palm of the hand. Another type of Acheulean biface used by Homo
     ergaster is called a cleaver (Figure 5.9). The cleaver had a wide cutting edge across the end instead of a point
     and was best suited for hunting or hacking wood. Another Acheulean tool is the side scraper, used to scrape
     hides that could then be turned into simple clothing.

Evidence of an Increase in Meat Eating
In 1973, a specimen of H. ergaster known as KNM ER 1808 was found in Koobi Fora, Kenya. Dated to about 1.7
MYA, this is the most complete H. ergaster specimen ever found. Analysis of KNM ER 1808 suggests that H.
ergaster may have been eating carnivore liver, which is high in Vitamin A. This may indicate a dietary shift
toward increased meat eating by H. ergaster.

Homo erectus: A Success Story

Homo erectus is the longest-surviving species in the genus Homo. For almost two million years, H. erectus
existed and evolved. Also known as the "Upright Man" or Java Man, H. erectus was first found in Indonesia in
1891 by Eugene Dubois, a professor of anatomy at the University of Amsterdam. At a site called Trinil, he found
a skull cap and a femur. He named the specimen Pithecanthropus erectus. The most current dates for Homo
erectus are 1.2-1.6 million years ago. H. erectus exhibits a cranial capacity averaging 900 cc and several
distinguishing characteristics. These characteristics include a slightly projecting nasal spine, shovel-shaped
incisors, a nuchal crest (a ridge in the back of the skull that supported strong neck muscles), very thick skull
bones, and pronounced brow ridges. They also had longer legs, evidence that they were utilizing energy much
more efficiently when walking and becoming effective hunters. We also see a diminishing of the protruding jaw
(or prognathism) that was so prominent in the australopithecines.
150  5 · The Genus Homo and the Emergence of Us

     FIGURE 5.10 This Homo erectus cranium exhibits a number of defining features, including a projecting nasal
     spine, thick skull bones, and pronounced brow ridges. (credit: Daderot/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)

     There is evidence that H. erectus was using fire around 1.7-2.0 MYA, which would make it the first or one of
     the first hominins to do so. Ancient hearths, charcoal, and charred animal bones have been found in
     Zhoukoudian, China. This evidence suggests that H. erectus was hunting, cooking, and eating meat. Also found
     at Zhoukoudian are a number of fossil skulls that were once thought to display evidence of cannibalism.
     However, recent research evidence suggests that the remains of these H. erectus were prey to animal
     scavengers such as hyenas (Boaz et al. 2004).

     The Smithsonian Institution has created an interactive tool (https://openstax.org/r/human-evolution-
     interactive-timeline) that visually illustrates the interrelationships between an increasingly variable and
     colder climate, encephalization, bipedalism, and new technologies and tool use. These correlations align with
     fossil evidence indicating changes in diet and caloric requirements in response to a colder and changing
     climate, which ultimately fueled a growing brain. The "expensive tissue hypothesis" proposes that maintaining
     a brain is metabolically expensive and that, in order to meet the energy requirements of a larger brain, our
     digestive system became smaller and shorter, making it more suited for higher-quality, nutrient-dense food
     such as meat (Aiello and Wheeler 1995). The list below summarizes some of the key evolutionary changes seen
     in H. erectus from 2 MYA to possibly as recent as 50,000 years ago, which provide further support for these
     correlations (Dorey 2020).

     1. There is a progressive increase in brain size in H. erectus, from about 550 cc to 1,250 cc.
     2. There is evidence of increased use of fire and of eating cooked meat at H. erectus sites. H. erectus would

           have needed as much as 35 percent more calories than previous hominins (Fuentes 2012).
     3. The eating of softer foods as a result of cooking meat and plants alleviated the need for large chewing teeth

           and jaws. Over time teeth became smaller, which resulted in thicker enamel.
     4. There is a gradual decrease in prognathism, and as in H. habilis, skulls provide evidence of smaller teeth

           and jaws, which would have made room for larger brains.
     5. H. erectus is taller than any other previous hominin, with longer legs that provided the ability to run great

           distances and chase prey. New research is shedding some additional light on the possible benefits of
           running in early hominins The fossil evidence suggests that endurance running is a derived adaptation of

     the genus Homo, originating about two million years ago, and may have been instrumental in our
      evolution (Bramble and Lieberman 2004).

The Homo ergaster and Homo erectus Debate

There is great debate as to whether Homo ergaster and Homo erectus are one species or two. Some refer to H.
ergaster as the "early" H. erectus. Their differences are largely geographical: H. ergaster is associated with
Africa and H. erectus with Asia. Yet some researchers have concluded that H. ergaster and even H. habilis
should be referred to as H. erectus. Whether to lump or split the diverse species in the genus Homo is an
ongoing challenge in the scientific community. While there are some anatomical differences between H.
erectus and H. ergaster, they are fairly minimal.

FIGURE 5.11 Homo erectus (left) has a sagittal keel (ridge on top of head), a shorter forehead, and a different-
shaped skull than Homo ergaster, seen on the right. (credit: (left) kevinzim/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 2.0; (right)

The diversity and number of evolutionary changes seen in H. erectus indicate that H. erectus set the stage for
the arrival of the archaic Homo, which we will cover in the next section.

5.3 The Emergence of Us: The Archaic Homo

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Describe the context, time frame, and key anatomical characteristics of archaic Homo.
  · Explain the potential environmental conditions that led to evolutionary change in anatomy and material culture
     seen in archaic Homo.
  · Compare and contrast the current hypotheses regarding the extinction of the Neanderthal.

Defining the Archaic Homo

There is no universal consensus on what is included within the term "archaic Homo." The term is used as an
umbrella category encompassing all the diverse Homo species after H. erectus. Hominin species classified as
archaic Homo typically have a brain size averaging 1,200 to 1,400 cc, which overlaps with the range of modern
humans. Archaic Homo are distinguished from anatomically modern humans by the characteristics of a thick
skull, prominent supraorbital ridges (brow ridges), and lack of a prominent chin. Archaic Homo are viewed as
transitional between H. erectus and H. sapiens and display many overlapping and varied traits. It has been
proposed that archaic Homo may have been the first species to use language, based on the size of their brains
152  5 · The Genus Homo and the Emergence of Us

     and the fairly large social groups they lived in. Archaic Homo species as presented here will be divided into
     two groups: the Early Archaic (800-250 KYA) and the Late Archaic (300-30 KYA).

     Early Archaic Homo

     Homo antecessor
     Homo antecessor has been found in Spain, France, and England and dates to around 1.2 MYA to 800 KYA.
     These specimens represent the oldest fossil evidence for the presence of the genus Homo in Europe. Some
     scientists have suggested that this species is the ancestor of Homo heidelbergensis, while others suggest that
     H. antecessor is the descendent of H. ergaster. Homo antecessor was first found at the Sima de los Huesos site
     of the Sierra de Atapuerca region in Spain. Within this site is a cave known as the Pit of Bones, where more
     than 1,600 fossils of 28 individuals have been found that date at or before 780,000 years ago. The site is an
     important one that stretches over a long period of time and displays the emergence and divergence of various
     Homo physical characteristics that later appear in the Neanderthal. Evidence from nuclear DNA suggests that
     early hominins at this site were related to the Neanderthal and not the Denisovans, indicating divergence
     earlier than 430,000 years ago (Meyer et al. 2016). The section on the Neanderthal will explore further the
     interbreeding and divergences of the Neanderthal, Denisovans, and modern Homo sapiens.

     Homo antecessor was almost six feet tall and males weighed about 200 pounds, well within the range of
     variation for modern humans. Other anatomical features of this species include a protruding occipital bun (a
     bulge found in the occipital area of the skull), a low forehead, no strong chin, and a cranial capacity of about
     1,000 cc. It has been suggested that the purpose of the occipital bun is to balance the weight of the anterior
     portion of the skull and face. One very modern trait exhibited by this species is the presence of a facial
     depression above the canine tooth called the canine fossa, which is also found in modern humans. The best-
     preserved fossil is a maxilla (upper jawbone) of a 10-year-old individual.

     In addition to the fossil bones, 200 stone tools and 300 animal bones were also found at Gran Dolina, another
     location at the Atapuerca site, along with a carved stone knife. Stone tools at this site were predominantly
     Oldowan style and constructed from local raw materials. Tools included cutting flakes and hand-held cores. It
     has been suggested that the absence of retouched tools at this site indicates that these tools were created
     primarily for processing and eating meat. Cutmarks are present on the majority of animal remains. One of the
     most intriguing observations about this site is that there are numerous large animal carcasses (mostly deer)
     that are believed to have been transported to the site rather than consumed where they were killed. Some
     scientists have suggested that the practice of bringing food back to the site is evidence of social cooperation,
     suggesting both a division of labor and a custom of food sharing.

     Many of the bones of Homo antecessor show the same evidence of cutmarks as the animal bones, indicating
     that flesh was removed from the bones with the goal of dismemberment. Some scientists have taken this to
     mean that H. antecessor practiced cannibalism. However, humans have also been known to remove the flesh
     from bones during funerary rites. Whether the cutmarks made by H. antecessor represent cannibalism, a
     funerary rite, or another yet unknown practice is still being debated.

     Homo heidelbergensis
     Homo heidelbergensis is an incredibly variable group. Many archaic Homo species are included in this group
     because they possess features that can best be described as a mosaic between H. ergaster, H. erectus, and
     anatomically modern humans (AMH). This section looks at just a few of the specimens that are regularly
     attributed to Homo heidelbergensis.

     One of the most important Homo heidelbergensis specimens is known as Mauer. It was found in 1907 in
     Germany and is represented by a mandible (lower jaw) that is dated to approximately 600,000 years ago. It has
     a robust mandible and a receding chin like earlier Homo ergaster but has very small molars like anatomically
     modern H. sapiens. The jaw is so big and the teeth are so small that there is plenty of space for additional teeth
     to develop behind the wisdom teeth. Given that the third molar (the wisdom tooth) has already erupted, it has
     been suggested that this individual was between 20 and 30 years at death.

Another important specimen of Homo heidelbergensis is known as the Petralona cranium. It was found in
1960 in Greece. Dates are uncertain but believed to be in the range of 100,000 to 700,000 years. Animal fossils
found with the specimen indicate Petralona is between 350,000 and 200,000 years old. It combines Homo
ergaster-like traits, such as massive brow ridges and thick cranial bones, with a cranial capacity of 1,200 cc,
which is similar to anatomically modern H. sapiens.

A third specimen of Homo heidelbergensis is known as Bodo. It is very possibly the oldest archaic human
specimen from Africa and was found in Ethiopia in 1976. It is dated to approximately 600,000 years and has a
relatively large cranial capacity of 1,250 cc, which is again within the range of variation for modern humans. It
is a robust cranium with very thick bones and two separate brow ridges.

Homo heidelbergensis Technology and Culture
Bodo is associated with Acheulean bifacial hand axes. Some scientists have suggested that Bodo butchered
animals because Acheulean hand axes have been found with animal bones. There are cutmarks on the Bodo
cranium that resemble those made by cutting fresh bone with stone tools. It has been suggested that the Bodo
cranium is the earliest evidence of the removal of flesh immediately after death using a stone tool. The
cutmarks were made symmetrically and with specific patterns on the cranium, which is interpreted as strong
evidence that the defleshing was done purposefully for funerary practices. Once again, others have suggested
that the cutmarks indicate that Bodo may have been practicing cannibalism.

In addition to their use of stone tools from the Acheulean tool industry, Homo heidelbergensis is also believed
to have used spears. The earliest known spears have been found in Schöningen, Germany, and are dated to
about 400,000 years ago. The spears were made either from spruce or pine wood and are believed to have had
a range of about 35 meters. Probably the most important technological achievement evident in these spears is
the use of hafting technology. Hafting involves attaching stone points to a handle made of another substance,
such as wood, metal, or bone. The spears found at Schöningen represent one of the first known instances in
which hominins united separate elements into a single tool.

Hafting gives stone tools more utility, as they can now be thrown (as with a spear), shot (as with an arrow), or
used with more leverage (like an axe). These hafted stone points are able to be used with increased force and
effectiveness, allowing people to hunt and kill animals more efficiently. This increased efficiency in hunting
and killing animals is believed to have created a situation in which H. heidelbergensis had regular access to
154  5 · The Genus Homo and the Emergence of Us

     meat and other high-quality foods. Some have suggested that the presence of spears represent evidence that
     H. heidelbergensis could hunt herd animals that can run faster than a human, and that they had sophisticated
     hunting strategies requiring cognitive skills like anticipatory planning.

     Like Homo ergaster and Homo erectus, Homo heidelbergensis occupied both caves and open-air sites.
     However, they did not just use the sites as is, they modified them. One of the most interesting aspects of the
     cultural behavior of Homo heidelbergensis is that they are associated with clear archeological evidence for
     modified dwellings. For example, in the Czech Republic there is a modified dwelling that consists of a stone
     foundation that is approximately 700,000 years old. Most likely, this dwelling had a roof constructed of thick
     branches. Other modified dwellings have been found in Germany and France.

     Evidence of controlled fire has been found at most reasonably preserved Homo heidelbergensis sites. The
     oldest established continuous fire site for Homo heidelbergensis is from Israel and is dated to around 780,000
     years old.

     Late Archaic Homo

     Homo naledi: A Rising Star
     The most recently described archaic Homo is known as Homo naledi. They were found in the Rising Star cave
     system in South Africa in 2013 and 2014 (Figures 5.14-5.15) and are dated to approximately 235,000-335,000
     years old. Over 1,500 bones from as many as 15 individuals were recovered from the cave, which is possibly
     the largest assemblage of a single hominin species yet discovered. Despite their relatively recent date, they
     have exceptionally small cranial capacities, comparable to the robust and gracile australopithecines, which are
     around 560 cc. The encephalization quotient of H. naledi is estimated at 4.5, which is the same as H.
     floresiensis but notably smaller than all other Homo (contemporary Homo are all above 6). The presence of
     this small-brained hominin at the same time that Neanderthals and Homo heidelbergensis were around is
     further evidence that multiple hominin lineages were coexisting and evolving at the same time. The
     classification of H. naledi proved to be a challenge, as the specimens presented a mosaic of traits and
     characteristics associated with an array of other hominin species.

Homo naledi: Did They Bury Their Dead?
Homo naledi has not yet been found in association with any stone tools. Despite a lack of established tool use,
there is fairly convincing evidence that H. naledi may have used the cave system as a place to bury their dead.
The hypothesis that H. naledi had a ritualistic mortuary practice is based on several observations, such as the
bones appearing to lack evidence of gnawing marks from predators and the lack of evidence of layers of
sediment that would suggest the bones were deposited by flooding (Dirks et al. 2015). In 2017 additional fossil
remains were found in a second chamber in the Rising Star cave system (Hawks et al. 2017), but these remains
don't as yet appear to offer additional evidence to support the hypothesis of an intentional burial.

Some scientists believe that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that H. naledi were involved in funerary
ritual practices. They have noted that the preservation of H. naledi specimens are similar to that of cave-
dwelling baboons that have died natural deaths. At Sima de los Huesos, remains of about 28 Neanderthal and
H. heidelbergensis fossils were found in a cave dated to about 430,000 years ago. Researchers who examined
the scattering patterns of the remains at both the Rising Star cave system in Africa and the Sima de los Huesos
site in Spain (Egeland et al. 2018) concluded that the sites showed evidence of having been scavenged but that
this doesn't disprove the possibility that they may also be deliberate burials. The verdict is still out on this. Lee
158  5 · The Genus Homo and the Emergence of Us

     Berger and other scientists are conducting further investigations of the H. naledi skeletal deposits to further
     explore the possibility they might be evidence of something more deliberate than the actions of predators.

     Rethinking the Neanderthal

     Homo neanderthalensis
     The word "Neanderthal" might conjure up stereotypical images of a brutish caveman-like creature holding a
     club in one hand and dragging supper with the other. No one said entertainment had to be scientifically
     accurate, but media can create false perceptions and stereotypes about the past. This section takes a closer
     look at who the Neanderthal people were and the role they played in the human story.

     FIGURE 5.20 Distribution map of Neanderthal sites. The red squares mark locations of Neanderthal remains and
     the shaded area represents the supposed territory of Neanderthal people in Europe and Asia. (credit: modification
     of work Neanderthal distribution by Berria/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 4.0)
     Neanderthals have been found only in regions of Europe and the Middle East and are dated to between about
     400,000 and 40,000 years ago. The first fossils, which were found in the Neander Valley, were believed to be
     the remains of an extinct kind of human. The Germans called them the Neanderthals, the people of the
     Neander Valley.

     Neanderthals possess several distinctive anatomical characteristics: the skull and brain is larger than that of

5.3 · The Emergence of Us: The Archaic Homo                                                                         159

humans, with an average size in Neanderthals of 1,520 cc compared to modern humans' 1200-1400 cc. Does
the Neanderthal's larger brain size mean that it was more intelligent than modern humans? As mentioned
earlier in this chapter, while there does seem to be a correlation between brain size and complex cognitive
skills, the brain in some hominins may have been organized differently than that of modern humans, with
different anatomical areas of the brain emphasized. It is believed that in the Neanderthal brain, the frontal
region, which is the center of speech and language, was less developed, while the back of the brain, which
deals with the senses, was more developed. This greater development in the back area of the brain could be a
survival adaptation found in Neanderthals who had to hunt in often harsh and difficult conditions.

Philip Lieberman, a cognitive scientist at Brown University, argues that Neanderthals lacked the anatomy
necessary for humanlike speech. He drew this conclusion based on a reconstruction of a Neanderthal throat,
which indicated that the neck could not accommodate the vocal apparatus of modern humans (Lieberman,P.
2007). While there is evidence of a hyoid bone, a small horseshoe-shaped bone in the front of the neck, that
would have been able to anchor the tongue muscles, other anatomical evidence suggests that the larynx in
Neanderthals was placed high in the throat. A highly placed larynx limits an animal's ability to produce many
sounds, such as vowels. In humans, the larynx is positioned further down into the throat. The Neanderthal has
been determined to have possessed the gene FOXP2, which is linked to the ability to understand complex
language, but the verdict is still out as to whether they were able to produce complex language. It is believed by
some researchers that the ability to produce complex speech gave H. sapiens a significant edge over the
Neanderthal.

Other skull characteristics of the Neanderthal include an occipital bun at the back of the skull (as also seen in
H. antecessor and H. erectus), large brow ridges (which are not solid bone and create an air cavity), a large
nasal cavity, and incisors that show a rounded pattern of wear, especially in older individuals. Their large front
teeth typically show excessive wear. Chipping and pitting on the incisors are believed to have been caused by
chewing on leather. The postcranial bones show that they had a broad scapula, which indicates that their
rotator cuff muscles were well developed. They possessed a robust humerus with a massive head and the
ability to rotate their arms, which suggests they were capable of throwing projectiles and using spears.

Some of the best-known Neanderthal specimens come from a place called Shanidar Cave in Iraq. Within this
cave, various skeletal remains of eight individual Neanderthals were found. These remains are identified as
Shanidar 1-9, which were discovered between 1957 and 1961, and Shanidar 10, which was discovered in
2006. Nearly all the skeletal remains show some evidence of trauma, suggesting that hunting was risky
business. At various Neanderthal sites it has been observed that men and women exhibit similar cranial
injuries, suggesting that women might have also engaged in hunting activities. However, the number of
injuries in women were significantly fewer than those found in men (Beier et al. 2008). In a comparative study,
it was established that during the Upper Paleolithic, modern H. sapiens sustained similar injuries as the
Neanderthal, but interestingly, these injuries were less likely to result in death (Beier et al. 2008).

Shanidar 3 features a 40-to-50-year-old Neanderthal man who suffered a rib injury, potentially as the result of
an encounter with an animal, and suggests healing as a result of care from others. Shanidar 1, called the "Old
Man" (30-45 years old was old in Neanderthal terms), had multiple traumas to his body, one of which resulted
in blindness in one eye. He was also missing the lower part of his right arm and hand, which suggests the
earliest amputation on record. Although he did heal from this amputation, it may have left him paralyzed on
the right side of his body. He also had no teeth. It is believed he was kept alive by taking food that had been
chewed by others for him. There is evidence of many of these individuals healing from their injuries, which
suggests that compassion and a sense of social responsibility for disabled members of the community existed.

     The Flower Burial Hypothesis
     The remains found at Shanidar 4 in Iraq suggest that the Neanderthal practiced intentional burials, or
     deliberate placing of the dead in a ritualistic manner. At Shanidar 4, the individual is placed on his left side
     with his legs drawn up in a flexed position. Pollen analysis of the soil surrounding the corpse suggests that
     spring flowers had been placed in the grave, possibly indicating that the Neanderthal had a belief in an afterlife
     and established mortuary practices. However, there has been a lot of debate as to whether there is sufficient
     evidence to conclude that that the pollen found at some of the Neanderthal sites was a result of ritualistic
     placement of flowers. Opposing hypotheses propose that the pollen was brought into the cave and deposited by
     burrowing rodents (Sommer 1999). In spite of these counterclaims, the consensus supports the theory that the
     Neanderthal did practice intentional burials. This is largely based on evidence such as the careful placement
     of bodies in specially dug shallow pits. Recent research at both Shanidar Cave and other sites now support the
     claim that the Neanderthal did practice ritual and intentional burial.

     Neanderthal Creativity and Material Culture
     Neanderthals have been labeled, perhaps unjustly, as a species with a limited ability to communicate in
     symbolic or abstract forms. Until recently, the Neanderthal had been assumed to lack the cognitive skills

5.3 · The Emergence of Us: The Archaic Homo                                                                         161

associated with the practice of ritual and art. However, cave paintings discovered in Spain in 2012 by Alistair
Pike, an archaeologist at the University of Southampton, UK, challenge that assumption. These paintings,
which have been dated to around 65,000 years ago, before the arrival of H. sapiens in the region, have been
determined to be the creative works of the Neanderthal and are currently considered the oldest cave art ever
found. This discovery may change what people have previously thought about Neanderthal cognition and their
ability to express symbolic thought. It should be acknowledged that the ability to depict the world evident in
these paintings does not compare with that in the artwork from H. sapiens sites like Chauvet and Lascaux in
France (to be discussed later in this chapter).

Neanderthals created more technologically advanced tools than those produced by H. erectus and seen in the
Acheulian tool industry. The tool industry associated with the Neanderthal hominins is called the Mousterian
tool industry or the Middle Paleolithic tool industry. Archeological sites that date to the Neanderthal period
are dominated by flake tools. This means that the Neanderthal struck flakes from cores and then used the
flakes as their tools instead of the core. This resulted in smaller and sharper tools with increased utility.

What Happened to the Neanderthal? What Gave Modern Humans the Edge?
The Neanderthal went extinct around 35,000 to 50,000 years ago. There have been various hypotheses as to
what caused this, many connected to the fact that Neanderthal coexisted with H. sapiens in regions of Europe
and Asia for an estimated 2,600-5,400 years. These hypotheses include an inability to adapt to a changing
climate and colder temperatures, the spread of disease, competition for food with H. sapiens, and even
aggressive takeover by the H. sapiens, who may have been better able to adapt to environmental changes due
to more complex technology and language skills. Another theory points to evidence that the Neanderthal
tended to live in small, scattered groups with limited genetic diversity and low birth rates, which potentially
impacted the ability of the Neanderthal to be competitive. A low gene pool can result from reduced birth rates
and low survival rates of young children. New genetic evidence shows that the Neanderthal were genetically
less diverse and more isolated than H. sapiens. And then some argue that the Neanderthal didn't go extinct at
all because some people still have Neanderthal genes in them.

Are You a Neanderthal?
Recent genetic evidence indicates that human-Neanderthal interbreeding (https://openstax.org/r/the-scientist)
was happening as far back as 125,000 years ago. From one Neanderthal toe bone found in the Denisova cave in
Siberia Russia, the Max Planck institute has been able to produce a whole genome which revealed evidence of
inbreeding amongst the Neanderthal, along with interbreeding with their cousins the Denisovans (discussed
further in next section), as well as a mystery yet to be identified species, as well as Homo sapiens (Pennisi, E.,
2013). The genetic evidence is most prominent in people of East Asian descent, accounting for between 2.3
percent and 2.6 percent of their DNA. Various mutations and diseases are linked to this Neanderthal DNA,
including diabetes, addictions, depression, allergies, and Crohn's disease. One study suggests that Neanderthal
genes gave people some level of protection from getting a severe case of COVID-19 (Huber, J., 2018), although a
later study (Zeberg and Pääbo 2020) proposes that Neanderthal genes may have increased the risk of
respiratory failure as a result of the COVID-19 virus. Such differences may have to do with different genetic
clusters in Neanderthal populations in different geographical regions (Mortazavi et al. 2021). Neanderthal
genes are believed to have provided immunity to some viruses that H. sapiens, arriving from Africa, would not
have had time to build up an immunity against. On the reverse side, H. sapiens may have brought diseases
from Africa that the Neanderthal did not have resistance to, possibly playing a role in their extinction. As Janet
Kelso, a computational biologist at the Max Plank Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, states, "Viral
challenges, bacterial challenges are among the strongest selective forces out there" (Akst, 2019).

The Denisovans

The Denisovans, like Homo naledi, are archaic Homo. There are not a lot of specimens--just one finger bone,
three teeth, some long bone (https://openstax.org/r/Long_bone) fragments, a partial jawbone, and a parietal
bone (https://openstax.org/r/Parietal_bone) skull fragment. Because of this lack of evidence, very little is
known of their anatomical features. Some of the specimens come from Denisova Cave in Siberia, Russia, and
are dated to between 500,000 and 30,000 years ago. These dates are arrived at based on the few fossils that
exist, inferences made from genetic studies, and sediment analysis. More recently another specimen was
found on the Tibetan plateau. In 1980 a jaw and two teeth were uncovered in the Baishiya Karst Cave by a
162  5 · The Genus Homo and the Emergence of Us

     monk, but it wasn't until 2010 that scientists were able to study the jaw. Dating placed the specimen at
     approximately 160,000 years ago. Protein analysis determined the jaw to be of Denisovan origin and from a
     member of a population who were most likely well adapted to living in high altitudes (Chen et al. 2019).

     Because so few bones have been found, most understanding of this species comes from genetic analyses.
     According to nuclear DNA studies, Denisovans and Neanderthals were more closely related to each other than
     they were to modern humans. DNA evidence suggests that the Denisovans interbred with modern humans and
     with local Neanderthal populations over multiple time periods. Tracing the male Y chromosome, one study
     indicated that interbreeding between early humans and Neanderthals actually replaced the ancient Denisovan
     Y chromosome once found in Neanderthals. The time of divergence of the Denisovan is estimated to be around
     700,000 years ago, with modern humans diverging from the Neanderthal around 370,000 years ago (Petr et al.
     2020). H. heidelbergensis is typically considered to have been the direct ancestor of both Denisovans and
     Neanderthals, and sometimes also of modern humans.

     One specimen is a first-generation hybrid, Denisova 11--nicknamed "Denny (https://openstax.org/r/
     Denny_hybrid_hominin)"--that had a Denisovan father and a Neanderthal mother (Slon et al. 2018). Denisova
     11 was found in Denisova Cave in Russia and provides evidence that Late Pleistocene Homo species interbred
     when the groups met. Comparison of the DNA of these three groups suggest that most modern-day Europeans
     and Asians inherited about 1-4 percent of their DNA from Neanderthals, with no Denisovan ancestry in
     Europe and 0.1 percent in China. The genetics found in Tibetans, Melanesians, and Indigenous Australian are
     currently being challenged; originally, they were thought to be about 3-5 percent Denisovan and 2.74 percent
     Neanderthal. Statistical geneticist Ryan Bohlender and his team have investigated the percentages of extinct
     hominin DNA in modern humans. They concluded that Neanderthals and Denisovans are not the whole story
     and that there could be a third group yet unknown contributing to the Pacific Islander genome (Rogers,
     Bohlender, and Huff 2017). Statistical and genetic evidence can serve as indicators of the existence of a group
     for which no fossils have yet been found. These are referred to as ghost populations. For example, there are
     indications that 2-19 percent of the DNA of four West African populations may have come from an unknown
     archaic hominin that split from the ancestor of humans and Neanderthals between 360 KYA and 1.02 MYA
     (Durvasula and Sankararaman 2020). The hypothesis of a third lineage in the genus Homo appears to have
     received further confirmation with a discovery in China.

     New Homo Genus Discovery Homo longi, or Dragon Man

     Recently a new archaic Homo fossil surfaced in Harbin, China, dated to about 146,000 years ago (Ji et al. 2021).
     Given the name H. longi, it has also been called "Dragon man (https://openstax.org/r/dragonman)" as its
     origins were determined to be in the province of the Black Dragon River. The fossil (referred to as the Harbin
     cranium) was donated to the Hebei GEO University museum after being hidden away in a well in the 1930s
     during the construction of a railway bridge. The verdict is still out as to whether H. longi represents a lineage of
     the Denisovans or a new species, but it is clear it was robust and able to adapt to one of the coldest regions of
     China. It had a large brain, thick brow ridges, and fairly large teeth, similar to what is found in the Denisovans.

     Regional Evolutionary Adaptations: Homo floresiensis

     The Hobbit of Flores
     Homo floresiensis, also known as "the Hobbit" or "Flores Man," was discovered on the island of Flores in
     Indonesia in 2003. The species has been dated to approximately 100,000-60,000 years ago. What was
     surprising about this species is its size. An adult individual stood about 3 feet 7 inches tall. Liang Bua, the cave
     where H. floresiensis was found, shows evidence of the use of fire for cooking and contains bones with
     cutmarks. Since the initial discovery, partial skeletons of nine individuals have been found.

     H. floresiensis, like the earlier hominins, did not possess a chin, and its leg bones are thicker than those of
     modern humans. They had flat feet that were relatively long in comparison to the rest of their bodies. As a
     result of these anatomical differences, it is believed that their bipedalism was quite different from that of
     modern humans, with a high stepping gait and slower walking speed. H. floresiensis also had substantially
     more mobility in the elbow joint, which suggests that they were tree climbers.

     Their small brain size is not believed to have affected their intelligence. This challenges the view that larger

     Access for free at openstax.org
5.3 · The Emergence of Us: The Archaic Homo                                                                          163

cranial capacity equals higher cognitive skills. Although H. floresiensis has a brain size of just 380 cc, equal to
the size of an orange, evidence indicates that they made tools, used fire, and hunted very much like H. erectus.
The brain of H. floresiensis does contain a Brodmann area, which is associated with cognitive abilities, that is
the same size as that found in modern humans.

Some have suggested that H. floresiensis is a sister species of Homo habilis that branched off before or shortly
after the evolution of Homo habilis. Other hypotheses suggest that they were the descendants of H. erectus who
became stranded on the island after arriving via water, possibly on bamboo rafts.

Another Homo species similar in size to H. floresiensis was H. luzonensis, found on the island of Luzon in the
Philippines and dated to at least 50,000-67,000 years ago. H. luzonensis displays a hybrid of australopithecine
traits (including curved hands and feet) and Homo characteristics, yet lived alongside modern H. sapiens.
Clearly the genus Homo is more diverse and complex than was originally thought, especially within the special
evolutionary pressures of island environments.

in Germany. (credit: Daderot/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)

Island Dwarfism as an Evolutionary Explanation
Numerous hypotheses have been proposed to account for the small brain size found in both H. floresiensis and
H. luzonensis. One initial theory was that H. floresiensis had microcephaly, which is a genetic condition
creating an abnormally small head. This was discounted as an explanation once additional specimens were
found exhibiting the same size. Perhaps the most convincing explanation is an evolutionary theory called
island dwarfism, which notes that the evolutionary pressures on islands can be very different from those
found on the mainland. Island dwarfism posits that mainland small animal species that colonize islands might
evolve larger bodies if the island does not contain key predators. On the other hand, larger species may
become smaller due to more limited resources in an island environment. According to the island dwarfism
hypothesis, H. erectus made its way to Flores, where its descendants became isolated and grew progressively
smaller to make the most of limited resources in the island environment. This theory is supported by the fact
that there are unique sizes displayed by other animals found with H. floresiensis, including a dwarf species of
primitive elephant called a Stegodon. As H. floresiensis's body shrank, its brain may have undergone
"neurological reorganization" to fit a smaller cranial space while maintaining its brain-to-body ratio. The only
164  5 · The Genus Homo and the Emergence of Us

     potential large predator that may have been a threat to H. floresiensis was the Komodo dragon, which ate most
     of the large mammals on the island. Nevertheless, predation pressures for the little people were likely quite
     low--that is, until H. sapiens arrived.

     The Emergence of Us: Homo sapiens

     Modern H. sapiens first appeared about 200,000 years ago in Africa. Anthropologists generally classify these
     people as "anatomically modern H. sapiens," which is a way of noting that while their bodies are the same as
     modern humans, they had not yet developed the cultural traditions, symbolic behaviors, and technologies that
     are seen among later H. sapiens, including people of today. Probably the most defining feature of anatomically
     modern H. sapiens is their chin. Modern H. sapiens is the first hominin to exhibit a projecting chin. One of the
     most common explanations for this anatomical feature is that the chin evolved in response to human speech
     and protects the jaw against stresses produced by the contraction of certain tongue muscles.

     Sometime around 40,000 years ago there was an abrupt change in tool technology, subsistence patterns, and
     symbolic expression among H. sapiens. These changes seem to have occurred almost simultaneously in
     Africa, Asia, Europe, and Australia. While there is evidence of some creative artistic activity in earlier groups
     like the Neanderthal, they were not on the same scale as that seen during the Upper Paleolithic, which is also
     referred to as "the human revolution." The level of cultural changes associated with this period has been
     compared to the level of change that occurred during the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century.

     Among these changes, H. sapiens began assembling a much more elaborate tool kit by constructing tools from
     a wider variety of materials including antler, ivory, and bone. During the Upper Paleolithic, humans shifted
     from the manufacture of round flakes to the manufacture of blade tools. This construction method is known as
     the blade tool industry. Blades are stone flakes that look like a modern knife blades--they are long, thin, and
     flat, and they have a sharp edge. They have a much longer cutting edge than flakes do and are thus more
     efficient than older technologies. The prepared-core technique of the Mousterian that provided pre-shaped
     flakes was refined and extended to create pre-shaped blades.

     and was much more efficient than previous technologies. (credit: "Large Knife Upper Paleolithic or later

Over the 23,000 years of the Upper Paleolithic, there were many distinctive tool industries within the larger
category of the blade tool industry, including the Aurignacian, Gravettian, Solutrean, and Magdalenian. The
most significant tool during the Upper Paleolithic was the burin. The burin is a narrow-bladed flint capable of
scraping narrow grooves in bone. Scraping two parallel grooves would allow a sliver of bone to be detached as
stock for a needle, pin, or awl.

The Gravettian tool industry lasted from approximately 33,000 to 22,000 years ago. During this tool industry,
there are many instances of animal remains being used for both decorative and traditional tool purposes. For
example, the teeth of arctic foxes were used for decoration, while their arm bones were used as awls and barbs.
Some animal bones such as mammoth tusks and bones were used to not only create tools, but also to make art,
as seen in the Lion figurine in Figure 5.26. This figurine could be the earliest example of a figure having both
human and animal characteristics, a form often associated with shamans or priests. Some have proposed that
the "lion man" is actually a woman due to the lack of a lion mane.

FIGURE 5.26 An ancient figurine of a lion sculpted from a mammoth's tusk. This figure was discovered in a German
cave in 1939 and dated to around 40,000 years ago, making it one of the oldest figurative sculptures yet discovered
and the earliest example of an animal-shaped figurine. (credit: JDuckeck/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)

The Solutrean tool industry utilized tool-making techniques not seen before. It produced finely worked bifacial
points made with lithic reduction percussion rather than flint knapping. Lithic reduction is the process of
fashioning stones or rocks into tools or weapons by removing some parts. The lithic core, such as a partially
formed tool or naturally formed rock, is held in one hand and struck with a hammer or percussor with the
other hand. As flakes are detached, the original mass of stone or lithic core is reduced.

In addition to stone tool innovations, the Solutrean is characterized by the appearance of the atlatl
(https://openstax.org/r/throwing-arrow), or spear thrower. An atlatl is a long stick used to propel a spear or
dart. Functioning as an extension of the arm, this stick of wood or antler added kinetic energy, and therefore
range, to a short spear tipped with flint or bone. The earliest archeological evidence for this tool innovation
comes from France, where a 17,500-year-old atlatl was found constructed out of reindeer antler. It is believed
that the atlatl was used by humans to hunt large fauna.
166  5 · The Genus Homo and the Emergence of Us

     old. (credit: "Atlatl throwing demonstration" by Hannah Schwalbe/NPS/flickr, Public Domain)

     By 17,000 years ago, the Solutrean tool industry was replaced by a new tool industry known as the
     Magdalenian tool industry. During this period, bone and ivory continue to be used, as well as stone. Unlike
     Mousterian tools, Solutrean tools are made not only from nearby rocks, but also from rocks that have been
     transported over relatively long distances. Keep in mind that this required not only transporting the selected
     rocks, but also finding and extracting them.

     The Gravettian tool industry is best known for carved Venus figurines portraying a woman, typically made
     from ivory or limestone. Most figurines have small heads, wide hips, and large breasts. Most researchers
     believe that they served a ritual or symbolic function. Some have suggested that they represent an expression
     of health and fertility.

During the Upper Paleolithic, H. sapiens created a great deal of cave art. More than 350 cave painting sites
have been discovered, the majority located in France and Spain. Cave art seems to have been created
continually from 40,000 to 10,000 years ago and then disappeared around 10,000 years ago, likely due to
climate change. As temperatures increased, underground shelters were gradually replaced by surface
settlements. The most well-known cave sites in France are the Chauvet (https://openstax.org/r/chauvet-
archeologie-culture) (32,400 years ago) (Figure 5.29) and Lascaux Caves (17,000 years ago). The art in both
caves features common subjects, such as bison, horses, and deer, as well as tracings of human hands. Most of
the animals depicted were commonly hunted but were not always found with associated deposits of bones. The
cave art produced during the Upper Paleolithic show a level of sophistication and even sacredness not seen
previously in human history.

     Cave paintings were made with natural pigments created by mixing ground-up elements, such as dirt, red
     ochre, hematite, manganese oxide, and animal blood, with animal fat and saliva. Paint was applied using twigs
     formed into brushes and blow pipes made from bird bones, through which paint was sprayed onto the cave
     wall. Hand stencils on cave walls can be found in many locations around the world including Africa, Argentina,
     Europe, and Australia. Anthropologist Dean Snow (2013) conducted research at eight cave sites in France and
     Spain to determine who the artists might be. Based on calculated measurements of the handprints, he
     concluded that 75 percent of the ochre stenciled handprints in the Paleolithic caves were made by women.

     5.4 Tracking Genomes: Our Human Story Unfolds

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       · Describe how mtDNA sheds light on early human migrations and explain the Out of Africa model.
       · Explain how studying the genomes and coevolution of lice can fill current gaps in the human fossil record.
       · Describe the origin of human variation from an evolutionary perspective.

     Mitochondrial Eve

     Begun in 1990 and concluding in 2003, the Human Genome Project was an ambitious international effort that
     sequenced about 99 percent of the human genome with an accuracy of 99.99 percent. Genetics has thus far
     largely confirmed the Out of Africa theory, which proposes that early humans left Africa around 100,000
     years ago and migrated to diverse areas of the world. When early humans left Africa and moved into Europe,
     they not only lived alongside but also interbred with non-African species such as the Neanderthal, who were
     already inhabiting the region.

     Molecular anthropologists have an interest in determining when living human populations began diverging
     from one another. This has been difficult to do using nuclear DNA because it mutates much too slowly for
     measurable accumulations to occur in 200,000 years. Many of the genetic studies that have been conducted
     are thus based on genetic material carried in the mitochondria (mtDNA), which are passed on maternally.
     There is no recombination in mtDNA, so unless the mitochondria carries a novel mutation, a child has exactly
     the same mitochondrial genes as its female genetic contributor (which may be its mother, egg donor, or
     someone in a similar genetic relationship). The mitochondria of every living person is a copy, modified only by
     rare mutations, of the mitochondria passed down via matrilineal descent from a population in our ancient
     past. This population is referred to as Mitochondrial Eve or mtMRCA (mitochondrial most recent common
     ancestor), believed to have lived in southern Africa 100,000-200,000 years ago.

     As discussed in Chapter 4, the longer ago two populations share a common ancestor, the more time there is for
     mutations to occur and for adaptations and change to take place. Although genetic variation is small among
     the world's human populations, it is greatest in Africa. This indicates that the human populations in Africa
     have the longest established genetic lineage. While multiple hypotheses exist as to human origins and new
     evidence could change the current views, the consensus is an Out of Africa model traced back to the
     matrilineal descent of a population living in Africa about 200,000 years ago.

     How the Genome of Lice Can Fill in the Gaps

     While perhaps not a pleasant thought, lice have long been a part of human history. Studying the coevolution
     relationship between humans and lice has shed much light on human story. Dr. David Reed, the Curator of
     Mammals and Associate Director of Research and Collections at the University of Florida Museum, has been
     studying the coevolution of humans and lice, an area of research that has developed only within the last 20
     years. Reed's groundbreaking research has the potential to fill in some big gaps in humans' rather sketchy
     fossil record and provides important data that might have applications in medicine and biology. Two questions
     that this research has already begun to ask are when did we become less hairy and when did we start wearing
     clothes.

Figure 5.31 shows three types of lice associated with humans: the head louse (Pediculus humanus capitis), the
body louse (Pediculus humanus corporis), and the crab louse or pubic louse (Pthirus pubis). Body lice infest
clothing and lay their eggs on fibers in the fabric. Head and pubic lice infest hair, laying their eggs at the base of
hair fibers. The human head and body lice (genus Pediculus) share a common ancestor with chimpanzee lice,
while crab lice (genus Pthirus) share a common ancestor with gorilla lice. By tracking louse variations,
scientists have been able to determine when the head louse and pubic louse diverged, enabling estimates as to
when we lost our extra hair and when we started to wear clothes. It is interesting to note that the divergence of
the genus Pediculus (head and body lice) correlates with the divergence of the human lineage from
chimpanzees about six million years ago. Research on lice also provides further support for the Out of Africa
model of human migration. Reed has observed that the genome of African lice shows a higher degree of genetic
diversity than that of lice found elsewhere in the world, supporting the hypothesis that both humans and lice
existed in Africa first.

Many hypotheses about what may have triggered the loss of hair in humans point to thermoregulation, the
need to control body temperature in extreme conditions. Living in the heat of the savanna, humans needed a
cooling mechanism to enable them to be better hunters. Other evidence of adaptation to the heat includes the
appearance of sweat glands, which are more numerous in humans than in other primates. Another theory
about the cause of the loss of hair among humans suggests that it was an adaptation to control parasites on the
body. Did people immediately throw on clothes after losing all of that extra body hair? Reed's research suggests
that the wearing of clothes was not something that happened quickly. Humans lost body hair about a million
years ago and didn't start wearing clothes until around 170,000 to 190,000 years ago. That's about 830,000
years living in their birthday suits! When humans began to wear clothes, the body louse adapted structures
that enabled them to attach to clothes instead of hair.

     Personal History: From the time Molly was young, she knew she wanted to be an anthropologist.
     She took an archaeology class at the local community college when she was a high school student and went to
     field school over the summer. In college, she completed a double major in archaeology and anthropology, with
     a minor in Museums and Society. She later gained experience working with different museum collections and
     held internships at the Baltimore City Medical Examiner's Office and the Smithsonian Museum of Natural
     History. After completing her undergraduate degrees, she knew that she wanted to pursue anthropology as a
     full-time career and began working towards her master's and doctorate in biological anthropology.

Area of Anthropology: For Molly the most interesting thing about biological anthropology is the information
that bones can tell us. Initially she was interested in what the history of disease could tell us about the lives of
people in the past, but as she worked with biological anthropologists, her focus shifted to understanding how
evolution can impact the shape of different bones.

She received her undergraduate degree from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, and her
Master's degree from the University of Florida, where she is currently a PhD candidate. Her research interests
include comparative anatomy, cranial morphology, and anatomical sciences education. She is most interested
in how cranial morphology varies within and between species and how it is impacted by factors such as
evolution and selective breeding practices. Her earlier research focused on the differences in cranial
morphology in dogs created by artificial selection for facial reduction. Her dissertation research currently
focuses on a comparative study of facial reduction across bats, primates, and dogs.

Accomplishments in the Field: For Molly her most important accomplishment in the field of anthropology has
been in education and outreach. Throughout her time in graduate school, she was involved in school visits,
working with teachers to facilitate the inclusion of human evolution into existing science curricula. She has
specifically focused on helping educators find teaching materials that are culturally inclusive and responsive.
She has led multiple professional development workshops for teachers on the same topic and has visited over
two dozen classrooms and interacted with over 1,200 students in the last four years. Making science accessible
to K-12 educators is an extremely important part of being a researcher, and she believes everyone in academia
should strive to be effective science communicators.

"Studying biological anthropology helps us better understand our origin story as a species. It helps us
recognize why our anatomy is the way that it is, how morphological changes over time can take place, and why
we have such a diversity of life on earth. Just being able to recognize and identify our anatomy is only half the
challenge--more important is our understanding why various traits are adaptive, how structure relates to
function, or why leftover anatomical traits still persist in our body to this day."

Natural Selection and Human Variation: Are Humans Still Evolving?

Human variability is attributed to a combination of environmental and genetic factors, including social status,
ethnicity, age, nutrition, quality of life, access to healthcare, work and occupation, etc. As mentioned in
Chapter 1, anthropology contributes many insights into both the social construct of race and the impacts racial
categories have on people's lives. The focus in this chapter is the role of natural selection in human variation.

A number of changes are associated with the Neolithic era and the rise of agriculture around 10,000 to 8,000
years ago. Many have noted that changes during this time period did not have positive effects on human and
environmental health. The evolutionary mismatch hypothesis proposes that our bodies are best suited to the
environments we have spent much of our evolutionary history in, which are very different from the
environments we inhabit today (Li, van Vugt, and Colarelli 2018).

Humans evolved for one million years as hunter-gatherers. Today, human bodies are still trying to adapt to the
largely grain-based diet brought about by agriculture, a diet characterized by less diversity and lower levels of
nutrition than that of a typical hunter-gatherer. Incomplete adaptation to this change has made people
susceptible to a number of diseases and nutritional deficiencies. Lactose intolerance is a prime example. The
domestication of cattle and the drinking of cow's milk began during the agricultural age, not very long ago in
evolutionary history. Currently 65 percent of humans are unable to digest cow's milk. Dental caries (cavities)
are another problem linked to the change in diet associated with agriculture. The grain-based and high-sugar
diets associated with agriculture are very different from the diet of hunter-gatherers. Neither our bodies nor
the bacteria in our mouths have had time to fully adapt to this change.

Another adaptation that took place during the Neolithic era is related to variation in skin pigmentation.
Humans who left Africa and settled in Europe about 40,000 years most likely had dark skin with high levels of
melanin, which provides protection against ultraviolet radiation New data confirms that about 8,500 years
ago, early hunter-gatherers in Spain, Luxembourg, and Hungary also had darker skin. Skin pigmentation is an
adaptation to ultraviolet radiation, with different tones offering different advantages, depending on one's
172  5 · The Genus Homo and the Emergence of Us

     distance from the equator. As humans migrated to the Northern Hemisphere, they were exposed to less
     ultraviolet radiation, which also meant less absorption of the Vitamin D needed for strong bones and other
     important immune functions. In order to compensate for this loss and to allow for greater exposure to
     ultraviolet radiation, skin pigmentation became lighter.

     Another example of human variation as a result of adaptation to the environment can be seen in Indigenous
     populations in the Andes, Tibet, and the Ethiopian highlands. Each of these three groups faces the same
     environmental challenge, living in a low-oxygen environment, and they have responded with unique
     adaptations. Tibetans compensate for low oxygen levels by taking more breaths per minute than people who
     live at sea level. Those living at high altitudes in the Andes have been found to have higher concentrations of
     hemoglobin in their blood than other people. Ethiopians living at altitudes of 9,800 to 11,580 feet have neither
     of these adaptations. The explanation as to how the Ethiopian highlanders thrive in their environment is still a
     mystery.

     Andes have been found to have higher concentrations of hemoglobin in their blood than other people. (credit:

     This chapter has explored just some of the immense biological and cultural diversity of the genus Homo. This
     diversity has emerged in response to highly complex and variable environments connected to factors such as
     exposure to UV radiation, low oxygen levels at high altitude, changes in diet as a result of hunting or
     agricultural practices, geographic isolation in island populations, and climate variability and temperature. The
     genus Homo has proven to be resilient and adaptive in response to whatever environment or challenge it has
     faced. Variation is the key to survival. While scientists recognize that biological and cultural variation has
     greatly contributed to our human evolution, the human species is now facing a moment in which we must
     contemplate a difficult question: To what extent has our success as a species jeopardized the survival of other
     species and the health of the planet we all call home?

6.5 Language and Power
INTRODUCTION Talk, talk, talk. As human beings, that is what we do all day (and sometimes all night). Even
when we are alone, we might be listening to the radio, watching a video, reading, or texting--all activities that
incorporate language. Language is often considered to be one of the quintessential elements of humanity, key
to our social interactions and cultural development. No other animal does it the way we do. A few apes have
been taught words in sign language, mainly using simple word combinations to ask for particular treats or
desired activities. Is that anything compared to what we do with language?
Consider a situation from the author, Jennifer Hasty's own fieldwork.

     While conducting research in Ghana, I once attended a large family gathering to honor the birth of a
     child, an event called an "outdooring." After everyone had arrived and socialized a bit, a middle-aged
     man stood up and took the microphone in his hand to pour libation. Libation is the ritual offering of
180  6 · Language and Communication

          drink to the ancestors, welcoming them to the ceremony and asking for their blessings. As he took the
          cup in his hand, he surveyed his audience, then stopped short, appearing extremely embarrassed.
          Looking down at his feet, he sputtered, "Oh! When the tongue is present, the teeth do not make noise."

          Everyone laughed. It was a proverb I'd heard before, but I had no idea what it meant in this context.
          The speaker stepped aside as an even older man rose from a table at the edge of the gathering and
          slowly made his way to the microphone. The first speaker had assumed he was the eldest member of
          the family present at the gathering, but in fact, his older brother was there. By the rules of seniority, it
          was the older brother who should present the libation.

     What did the proverb mean in that situation? In most cultures, people do not usually explain proverbs, so the
     listener has to piece together the meaning. In this case, the proverb was used metaphorically to compare the
     production of words in the mouth and the roles of the people involved in this particular performance of
     libation. The nimble tongue is central to human speech, while the teeth play a more fixed and supportive role,
     providing surfaces used by the tongue to make certain sounds. Alone, the teeth can only clash against each
     other meaninglessly. A tongue is needed to produce speech. Using the proverb, the first speaker was
     comparing his elder brother to the tongue--he was more central to the gathering and more proficient in the
     production of ceremonial speech such as libation. The younger man assigned himself the role of a tooth, only
     able to make noise rather than ceremonial speech.

     In humans, language has developed into an extremely complex feature of sociocultural life. Just as the tongue
     is central to the production of human speech, language is central to the production of human culture. The
     subfield of linguistic anthropology examines the role of language in sociocultural life. Linguistic
     anthropologists are interested in how language affects our thinking and our experience of the world around us.
     Some explore the different categories of formal and informal speech that people have developed to organize
     rituals and ceremonies as well as everyday activities. Others listen carefully to various kinds of conversation,
     looking for patterns in the way people interpret and build on one another's speech acts.

     The discipline linguistics is devoted to the study of language. Linguistics is the science of language, including
     subfields devoted to speech sounds, word forms, word arrangement, meanings, and practical language use.
     One subfield of linguistics, sociolinguistics, examines the social context of language use, such as how language
     varies according to age, gender, class, and race. While sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology share an
     interest in the social side of language, linguistic anthropologists tend to focus on language as an aspect of
     larger cultural processes. Rather than looking at language as a sole object of study, linguistic anthropology
     studies language as one cultural element among many, all interwoven into the sociocultural life of a people.

     6.1 The Emergence and Development of Language

     LEARNING OUTCOMES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
       · Describe the communicative abilities of wild animals such as birds and primates.
       · Distinguish primate communication from human language.
       · Identify the biological features of early hominins that were central to the emergence of language.
       · Identify the archaeological evidence for the emergence of language.

     There are some seven thousand languages spoken in the world today. Most people are proficient in at least one
     of them, possibly more. But people are biologically capable of mastering any of them, and have been since
     birth. Humans are born language ready. For a human baby, any language will do. With passive exposure to
     language (simply hearing it without any formal instruction), human toddlers learn the complex rules and vast
     vocabularies of the language spoken (or signed) around them. This astounding feat is made possible by
     specific biological features in the brains and bodies of human babies, features designed to help them
     understand and produce language. The learning of language then triggers further changes in our brains,
     making possible certain kinds of reasoning and thought as well as communication with others.

FIGURE 6.2 When teaching language to their children, some parents teach signs (such as those of American Sign
Language) as well as spoken words for objects. The theory is that sign language and spoken language are processed
in different parts of the brain. Teaching these two forms of language together may provide deeper cognitive
reinforcement and greater chance of recall. This baby is making the sign for "bird." (credit: "Bri signs `Bird'" by Bev

Drawing on biological and archaeological evidence, researchers seek to understand how, why, and when
humans developed the biological features associated with language and, once language emerged, how the
practice of language changed the way of life of early humans. Language became a building block for human
culture of increasing complexity. Innovations such as stone tools, hunting, and using fire for heat and cooking
were made possible by language. In turn, these new skills enhanced the survival of those who practiced them,
increasing the likelihood that those people would live to pass on their genetic makeup to their offspring. This
means that certain biological features were key to the invention of human culture and that human culture was
key to the biological development of humans. We think of this as a reciprocal system of biocultural coevolution.
Put another way, biology and culture developed in tandem, with language as the link between the two.

No one really knows when or how humans invented language. The problem is that language, whether spoken
or gestural, leaves no direct trace in the archaeological record. Lacking direct evidence, researchers must be
creative, combining various indirect forms of evidence to suggest theories about how language may have
begun in humans. Based on such methods, researchers think that language may have emerged between
50,000 and 200,000 years ago. The largeness of this window of possibility is due to the indirect nature of the
evidence and a great deal of controversy about which elements may have been most important in the process
of language development. In this section, we look at these forms of indirect evidence, starting with
communication in the animal kingdom.

Animal Communication

All animals communicate with each other and even with other species (Tallerman and Gibson 2011). Many use
vocalizations like calls, growls, howls, and songs. Many also use gestures such as dances, postures, and facial
expressions. Some change the color of their scales, skin, or fur. Some produce strong-smelling body fluids
sprayed in their environment or rubbed on their own bodies. All of these activities are used to tell other
animals about territory, food sources, predators, and mating opportunities.
182  6 · Language and Communication

     FIGURE 6.3 Canada geese fly in a V formation to conserve energy and to keep track of all the birds in the
     formation. Coordination and communication are essential for the group. (credit: "Canada Geese" by Alex Galt, US
     Fish and Wildlife Service/flickr, CC BY 2.0)
     Many people might be tempted to think that animals speak to each other just as we do, that their various forms
     of communication are roughly equivalent to language. Does your dog bark and jump excitedly whenever you
     pick up the leash? Isn't that a way of saying, "C'mon! Let's go for a walk!"
     Some forms of animal communication are fairly simple, such as this canine leash mania. Others are far more
     complex, such as the way an octopus can change the color of and patterns on its skin for hunting, courtship,
     and camouflage. Fireflies use bioluminescence to attract mates and as a defense mechanism. Some fish
     generate electric fields to advertise their species and sex. Many animals use a vast lexicon of postures and
     gestures to communicate messages to one another and even to other species. When a bird issues a predator-
     alert call, squirrels respond as well. Many mammals pay attention to the predator warnings of birds.
     Are these complex forms of communication equivalent to language? Take a closer look at one famous example
     of complex animal communication and compare it to human language.

     A Waggle is Not a Word: The Complexity of Language

     Consider the famous "waggle dance" of the honeybee. Upon finding a good source of nectar such as a grove of
     wildflowers, a worker bee returns to the hive and performs a special flight pattern consisting of a figure-eight
     waggle followed by a return loop alternating right and left. The direction and duration of the waggle
     communicate the direction and distance to the location of the desirable food source (Seeley 2010; Frisch
     1993).

FIGURE 6.4 Diagram of the waggle dance of the honeybee. The movements performed by the bee during this
dance communicate the direction of and distance to a food source to its fellow hive members. (credit:

The waggle dance is certainly a complex and effective form of communication, but does it qualify as language?
Communication refers to the transfer of information from a sender to a receiver. Communication can be
voluntary or involuntary, simple or complex. Language is a specific, complex, systematized form of
communication involving the use of vocal or gestural units (words or signs) that can be combined and
recombined in larger structures (sentences) that can convey an infinite array of complex meanings. Language
is a form of communication. Not all communication is language.

Central to the infinite possibilities of language is a set of rules that govern just how sounds, signs, words, and
phrases may be combined. These rules structure the order of words, dictating, for example, where to put
subjects and actions in an utterance so that listeners will be able to find them. Rules also tell us whether words
indicate a single thing or multiple things and whether actions occur in the past, present, or future. Complex
forms of animal communication such as the waggle dance do contain some systematic rules governing the
sequence, duration, and intensity of certain segments of the communication, but they are highly constrained
to very limited contexts. For example, the waggle dance can be used to signal nectar sources near and far, but it
cannot be used to discuss the weather or comment on the laziness of the queen. Unlike the relatively "closed"
systems of communication common among animals, human language is open-ended. Our languages have the
distinctive quality of allowing actors to combine units in an infinite number of ways to produce new meanings.

Simple Signs and Pant-Hoots: Language in Primates

Biological anthropologists posit that we share a common ancestor with the other great apes (gorillas,
chimpanzees, bonobos, and orangutans) about five to eight million years ago. As nonhuman primates do not
produce language in the wild, the biological and cultural features that promoted language must have emerged
after that. However, studies aimed at teaching human language to nonhuman primates have revealed that
individuals of these species are able to master basic vocabulary and use simple words and word combinations
to obtain the things they want. So the great apes must have some biological features that enable them to learn
human language in a partial and limited way.

You may have heard of Koko, the gorilla famous for learning to use sign language. Sign language is used in such
studies because nonhuman primates lack the distinctive vocal tract required to make the sounds of human
language. Researcher Penny Patterson taught Koko to use about a thousand signs, roughly the vocabulary of a
three-year-old child (Patterson and Linden 1981). Patterson reported that Koko could comment on things that
were not currently present in her environment, such as personal memories. According to Patterson, Koko
could joke and lie and teach other gorillas to sign. She could even invent new signs. Many of these claims are
disputed by other researchers. Some point out that the evidence is largely anecdotal and relies on the
interpretation of Patterson herself, hardly an objective observer. Though controversial, Patterson's path-
184  6 · Language and Communication

     breaking work with Koko provided a wealth of data and opened up new possibilities for understanding the
     language abilities of nonhuman primates.

     FIGURE 6.5 Koko learning to play the guitar. Koko became famous for learning to communicate with humans using
     roughly 1,000 signs taught to her by researcher Penny Patterson. (credit: "ODCnewBegin9" by FolsomNatural/flickr,
     CC BY 2.0)
     Human-reared chimps, gorillas, bonobos, and orangutans have all been taught to use gestures or tokens to
     refer to things in the world around them, often combining those signs in a rule-based way to make comments
     and requests. Even though many linguists are skeptical of these studies, the use of symbolic systems in
     cooperative interactions to achieve goals does seem to indicate that great apes have the basic capacity to
     generate some sort of protolanguage. Protolanguage refers to a very simple set of gestures or utterances that
     may have preceded the development of human language. But do apes display these abilities due to some innate
     capacity or because we have taught them symbolic systems? Perhaps learning a symbolic system has changed
     the brains of these individual animals in distinctive ways.

     FIGURE 6.6 Chimpanzees use gestures and facial expressions as well as vocalizations to communicate with one
     another. (credit: "Chimpanzees" by foshie/flickr, CC BY 2.0)

the wild, looking for those biological features that might underpin the human capacity for language. Wild
chimpanzees, for instance, produce a wide range of calls, including hoots, pant-hoots, pant-grunts, pant-barks,
rough-grunts, nest-grunts, alarm barks, waa-barks, wraas, screams, and soft panting play sounds (Acoustical
Society of America 2018). Primatologists have listened closely to these calls. Some argue that chimp
vocalizations are not much like human language, as calls are fairly fixed and limited in their meanings.
Chimps may use a rough grunt to indicate a food source, but they do not seem to have specific grunts for
specific food types. Monogamous pairs of gibbons, a smaller species of ape, are known to perform elaborate
morning duets. Gibbons have an array of predator calls as well. Research comparing duets with predator calls
suggests that gibbons compose their songs to convey specific information, each note carrying a certain
meaning (Clark et al. 2006). While impressive, the ability to manipulate notes to convey a limited range of
meanings is still a far cry from the infinite productivity of human language. The limitless recombination of
signs that produces the flexible, open-ended quality of language is missing in the communication systems of
wild primates.

Human Biology and the Emergence of Language

There must be something special about us to make possible the distinctively flexible and open-ended
communication system of language. Research has focused on our throats, our brains, and our genes, looking
for the biological features that allowed for the emergence of language.

The Vocal Tract
Humans have evolved a very unusual vocal tract with a descended larynx (otherwise known as the "voice box")
and a large and rounded tongue positioned in the mouth to enable a remarkable array of sounds (Lim and
Snyder 2015). Some researchers suggest that our throats may have evolved in response to walking upright or
changes in diet or a combination of those two factors. Humans also have more deliberate control over
breathing than nonhuman primates. In order to better understand when hominins developed this distinct
vocal apparatus, researchers examine the hyoid bones of hominins to see if they resemble those of modern
humans. The hyoid is a U-shaped bone in the human throat that helps us swallow and move our tongues. The
few hyoids that have been found in the fossil record suggest that our distinctive vocal tract may have been
developed around 500,000 years ago. This means that Neanderthals likely had the same vocal abilities as
modern humans.

FIGURE 6.7 Evolutionary changes in the vocal tract enabled the development of spoken language in humans. The
image on the left shows the vocal structures an early ancestor to humans. The image on the right shows the vocal
tract of modern humans. The position of the vocal structures in the early ancestor allows for eating and breathing at
the same time. The position of these structures in modern humans allows more sounds to be produced and more
words to be spoken in sequence. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

Brain Structure
Several features of the human brain are considered prerequisites to language, including the overall (large) size,
the division into specialized hemispheres, and certain structures like Broca's and Wernicke's areas. Broca's
area is a region of the brain associated with the production of speech. Wernicke's area is essential to the
comprehension of language. Both are most often located in the left hemisphere of the human brain (for left-
186  6 · Language and Communication

     handed people, both can be located on the right side). How did we acquire these brain features so essential to
     language? A great deal of controversy surrounds this question, as researchers debate when and how these
     structures evolved.

     FIGURE 6.8 The locations of Broca's area and Wernicke's area in the human brain. Broca's area, responsible for
     the articulation of speech, is next to the motor area, where the movements of the body are controlled. Wernicke's
     area, associated with language comprehension, is situated beside the primary auditory area, where sounds are
     processed. (credit: "1605 Brocas and Wernickes Areas-02" by OpenStax College/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 3.0)
     Most recently, research has focused on "mirror neurons," special brain cells that seem to enable mimicry
     (Lim and Snyder 2015). Many researchers think that the ability to understand the actions of others and
     recreate those actions ourselves is a fundamental prerequisite for language. That is, in order to be able to talk
     to each other, early hominins must have been able to evaluate and interpret each other's actions and
     reproduce them in similar contexts. In primates like monkeys, scientists have discovered a system of
     specialized neurons called the "mirror neuron system" that enables primates to recognize and imitate actions.
     Monkeys and apes cannot talk, but they can recognize, interpret, and imitate actions performed by other
     primates. The neurological studies that revealed mirror neurons are too invasive to perform on humans, but
     neuroimaging studies suggest that a similar mirror neuron system does exist in humans.

     between humans and can even happen across species. You can make your dog yawn! (credit: "Sleepy" by

close to Broca's area. So it is possible that the mirror neuron system inherited from primates provided a
foundation for the later emergence of a brain structure devoted to language production in hominins. If
imitation and language are in fact connected in this way, then a system of gestures may have paved the way for
the development of language. Some researchers now hypothesize exactly this: that hominin language evolved
from a system of gestures to a system of vocalizations.

The "Language Gene"
In the late 1980s, medical researchers became aware of a particular speech disorder common among
members of one family in West London. Many members of this family could not pronounce words. Many
stuttered. Many had very limited vocabularies. Geneticists traced the disorder to a genetic mutation on
chromosome number 7 of the human genome. (See Biological Evolution and Early Human Evidence for more
on chromosomes and genes.) The mutation was located on a gene named FOXP2, prompting some researchers
to dub this "the language gene." Some hypothesize that FOXP2 may have played a role in the development of
language in humans (Lim and Snyder 2015).

At first, researchers thought that only humans had the FOXP2 gene, but subsequently a form of this same gene
has been identified in many vertebrates, including mice, bats, fish, and songbirds. In mice, the gene appears to
be related to vocalizations. In birds, it seems to be linked to birdsong. All primates have FOXP2, but the human
copy is slightly different than that of nonhuman primates. Some researchers think this mutation occurred
around 260,000 years ago and may have enabled the development of spoken language in Neanderthals and
Homo sapiens.

Other researchers are skeptical of the notion that one gene could be responsible for the emergence of spoken
language (Tallerman and Gibson 2011). Many anatomical developments and cognitive processes--connected
to different parts of the human genome--are involved in human language. These developments and changes
would have required mutations in other parts of the genome of early Homo. While the mutation of FOXP2 in
Homo may have played a role in language development, other mutations would have been important as well.

Hominin Material Culture

Evidence from the material culture of hominins such as Homo habilis and Homo erectus is also used to
speculate about the emergence of human language. Early hominins developed stone tool technologies and
created stunning works of art. The production and use of such tools and artwork must have required a
complex set of social and cognitive abilities. Those same types of social and cognitive skills are important to
human language. It is possible that language emerged as part of a whole complex of material culture.

Archaeological evidence and linguistic theory come together in a model suggesting that the invention of tools
by early hominins was linked to the invention of language. Some linguistic theorists suggest that the
evolutionary changes in brain structure that allowed for the development of tool use also support the
emergence of language. Furthermore, the innovations of tools and language are entwined in a reciprocal
relationship; evolutionary pressure to develop tools stimulated the development of language, and the
development of language facilitated increasingly complex tool making and tool use.

There are two theories to explain the connections between advances in tool use and language. The first rests
on the assumption that tool making requires a considerable degree of cognitive planning. You cannot make a
useful tool by just picking up a rock and randomly chipping away at it. Hominins like Homo habilis and Homo
erectus must have known just what kind of rocks would work as base and chipper and how to execute a set of
precise chips in a certain sequence to achieve a sharp blade without breaking the core. The mental processes
important to this sort of planning are hypothesized to have also enabled hominins to do the sort of quick
planning involved in the production of complex speech (Tallerman and Gibson 2011).

A second theory linking tool use and language emphasizes the importance of imitation in passing along the
complex set of skills involved in tool making. Neuroscientist Michael Arbib suggests that the ability to imitate
may have generated the first gestural language among hominins (2011). And he has developed a model to
describe how imitation and tool making may have evolved together over time. About 2.5 million years ago,
Homo habilis began making basic stone choppers, cores with flakes removed, used for butchering carcasses.
Such choppers are called Oldowan tools, named after the site in Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania where they were
188  6 · Language and Communication

     first found. Arbib has theorized that the production of Oldowan tools required the ability for hominins to
     imitate each other's actions. Simple imitation would make it possible for a learner to reproduce the actions of
     an accomplished tool maker through observation and mimicry. This ability to imitate is biologically rooted in
     the system of mirror neurons discussed earlier. As hominin brains acquired the ability of simple imitation
     involved in tool production, they might also become capable of the kind of gestural communication we see in
     apes today--not language, but a precursor to it. Investigate this diagram for more about the evolution of
     language (https://openstax.org/r/researchgate).

     The array of action-oriented mirror neurons, tool innovation, and language all progressed together in hominin
     evolution. As tool technology developed, Homo erectus began making distinctive pear-shaped hand axes about
     1.6 million years ago. A more intricate form of imitation would have been necessary to teach this sort of tool
     making to others, corresponding to the emergence of protolanguage. This protolanguage might have been a set
     of simple one-word utterances corresponding to concepts such as "yes," "no," "here," or "there."

     We don't have any hominin brains to examine, but remember that in the human brain, the system of mirror
     neurons is assumed to be situated near Broca's area, which is associated with human speech. So very likely,
     protolanguage emerged in the same part of the brain as the ability to imitate. The explosion of innovations in
     tool making over the past 100,000 years is linked to the emergence of complex human language. While the
     development of mirror neurons and the ability to learn tool making required biological changes to the brain,
     Arbib argues that the last step, the emergence of language, was purely cultural.

     6.2 Language and the Mind

     LEARNING OUTCOMES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       · Describe the role of language in categorizing items in the natural world.
       · Explain the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.
       · Provide at least two examples of linguistic universals.
       · Describe how metaphor shapes how we talk about abstract concepts.

     As discussed in the previous section, certain cognitive abilities were crucial to the development of language in
     humans. And reciprocally, once language emerged, it shaped our thoughts and actions in ways that helped our
     species cooperate, invent, learn, and adapt to the environment. Language must have been a fundamental
     element in the creation of human culture (singular) and the eventual development into human cultures
     (plural) as different groups of humans moved into different geographical areas and began adapting to different
     conditions.

     One key advantage of language is that it provides a way of encoding specific information about the
     environment and sharing that information with others so that it endures over time. If, say, there are snakes in
     an area, it would certainly be important to distinguish the venomous ones from the harmless ones, so probably
     there would be separate words for those two categories of snake or at least words for each specific snake so
     that people could alert each other to the presence of a dangerous one.

     This means that early language must have been developed relative to environmental conditions. Linguistic
     anthropologists are interested in the way that language varies across cultures, reflecting different
     environmental, historical, and sociocultural conditions. This is called linguistic relativity.

     On the other hand, languages are also constrained by human anatomy and cognitive abilities. Say there were
     two species of snake in an area, one poisonous and the other harmless, but you could not tell them apart by
     looking at them. (This is actually an adaptive strategy deployed by harmless animals called adaptive mimicry.)
     In this case, early humans probably would have had just one word for snake, indicating that sometimes a
     snake's bite made you sick and sometimes it didn't. As this example shows, the human visual apparatus
     shapes our understanding of the world, which, in turn, shapes our language.

     Consider another example from the natural world--the beetle. There are over 300,000 types of beetles in the
     world. How many can you name? All of them? Ten of them? Two of them? Outside of written scientific
     taxonomy, there is no language in the world that contains separate terms for each kind of beetle. This is not

6.2 · Language and the Mind                                                                                        189

only because there are only a few thousand of each type of beetle living in any one environment but also
because of limits to the number of terms any person can learn and remember. Our vocabulary is constrained
by the limits of human memory.

So language is shaped not only by environmental conditions but also by how humans interact with their
environments. Our common human anatomy influences our comprehension of the world, and that
comprehension is expressed in language. This insight suggests that all languages must have some things in
common by virtue of the fact that all humans have the same anatomy and cognitive abilities. Some linguistic
anthropologists are interested in discovering these linguistic universals.

In the next section, we take a look at some intriguing research on both linguistic relativity and linguistic
universals, seeking to better understand how language interacts with our human minds.

Linguistic Relativism and the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis

As seen in previous chapters, it was lamentably common for scholars in the early 20th century to think of non-
Western societies as backward and primitive, incapable of complex, abstract thought. Franz Boas worked hard
to disprove these racist notions, seeking to demonstrate the equal sophistication of all peoples and cultures.
Boas trained a student named Edward Sapir who was particularly interested in how non-Western languages
conveyed forms of complex, abstract thought that were different from the Euro-American habits of thought.
Sapir, in turn, trained a student named Benjamin Whorf who further elaborated on this theme in his own
research (Ahearn 2017). The result is what we have come to call the "Sapir-Whorf" hypothesis.

The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis argues that the particular language you speak influences how you think about
reality (Lucy 2001). Thus, different languages encourage different habits of thought. This is an essential tenet
of linguistic relativity. Whorf based his argument on a comparison between the Native American language of
Hopi and what he called "Standard Average European" (SAE), a broad category of European languages
including English. Whorf was interested in how speakers of each language might think differently about time.
In English vocabulary, time is divided into units that can be counted. English speakers talk about the number
of seconds, minutes, or days before an event or consider the number of months or years since something
190  6 · Language and Communication

     occurred. In Hopi, according to Whorf, time is conceived as indivisible and enduring, a whole process
     unfolding. The Hopi talk about the flow of events in a completely different way, a processual way Whorf termed
     "eventing." Whorf argued that these linguistic features profoundly influenced sociocultural life in each of these
     two contexts. Holding with the understanding of time as process, Hopi culture emphasized preparation,
     endurance, and intensity. Coordinating with the SAE expression of time as countable units, Euro-American
     culture emphasized schedules, accounting, and record keeping. Many people use a calendar to keep track of
     meetings, appointments, and assignments. Whorf would argue that the English language encourages us to
     think of time and events in this way, as a spatialized set of boxes to be filled up with discrete objects.

     In connection with the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, it is sometimes said that the "Eskimos" have 400 words for
     snow. This notion is both problematic and untrue. The first problem is that "Eskimo" is considered a
     derogatory term by the Inuit and Aleutian peoples to whom it has been applied. And, secondly, the claim turns
     out to be wrong. Anthropologist Laura Martin (1986, also described in Ahearn 2017) has debunked the myth by
     documenting that Arctic peoples really have just two root words for talking about snow, one for snow that is
     falling and the other for snow that is on the ground. They use these roots much as English-speakers would, to
     talk about snowstorms, snowflakes, snow drifts, and snow melt. The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is not typically
     applied to the vocabularies of different cultures anymore.

     Recall the earlier example about snakes. We hypothesized that a culture might not distinguish between two
     species of snakes if those snakes looked identical. But if people gradually came to notice that the poisonous
     snakes were always found in trees while the harmless snakes were always found on the ground, it is likely that
     a different term would come to be used for the tree-dwelling kind of snake, the one with the harmful bite. That
     is to say, even if a culture previously had only one term for snake, the people in that culture could easily
     understand that there were, in fact, two kinds and would be able to change their language to mark that
     difference in their vocabulary for future reference. Their vocabulary would not limit their thinking to such a
     degree that they could not conceive of two different kinds of snake.

     Rather than specific vocabulary words, researchers who study linguistic relativity have come to focus on larger
     abstract topics like space. In languages such as English, when people want to tell someone where a particular
     object is, they most frequently use language focused on their own bodies. English-speakers say, "You have a bit
     of arugula on the left side of your mouth" or "Grab the pink top hat on the shelf above you." This way of talking
     relies on the human body as a point of reference and therefore is relative to the bodies of the speaker and/or
     hearer. This creates confusion when the speaker is facing the person they are talking to, sometimes prompting
     someone to say, "No, my left, not your left!" Steven Levinson has conducted research on languages that do not
     use the human body to talk about direction at all (2003). Instead, they use the cardinal directions (north, south,
     east, west) and specific features of their environments (mountains, oceans) to talk about where things are. A
     speaker of the Australian indigenous language of Guugu Yimithirr might say, "Watch out for the snake just
     north of your foot!" This way of talking about space is absolute, not relative. Such speakers never have to say
     "No, my north, not your north," as there's only one absolute north. Research suggests that these different ways
     of reckoning give us different kinds of mental maps, such that a Guugu Yimithirr speaker might be better at
     absolute navigation than an English speaker, and perhaps more adept at finding her way back home if she lost
     her way.

     Linguistic Universals and Folk Taxonomies

     While linguistic relativists explore how different linguistic patterns shape different thought patterns (and vice
     versa), other linguists are interested in how all languages are constrained by our common human biology and
     in finding universal linguistic patterns. There are specific domains of language that lend themselves
     particularly well to this kind of inquiry. One of them is color. The reason for this is that color relies directly on
     our human visual system, invariant across cultures.

     And yet there is enormous diversity in the ways that different cultures divide up the spectrum of possible color.
     Some cultures have hundreds of color terms, while others have only two or three. Researchers Brent Berlin and
     Paul Kay analyzed the color term systems of 98 languages and found that the diversity of color term systems is
     governed by one set of rules. All of these color term systems are comprised of a few basic colors with specific
     colors added to the scheme over time (Kay 2015, Berlin and Kay 1969). The color schemes of all cultures are

     Access for free at openstax.org
6.2 · Language and the Mind                                                                                           191

based on the distinction between black and white (or light and dark). If a culture has only two terms, those two
terms will always be black and white. The next most important color is red. If a culture has three color terms,
those terms will be black, white, and red. Next comes green and yellow, then blue, then brown, then purple,
pink, orange, and gray, always in that order. Berlin and Kay suggested that these rules form a pattern for the
way all languages develop over long periods of time. Although the scheme proposed by Berlin and Kay has
been revised a little in the past 50 years, the basic tenets have held up pretty well (Haynie and Bowern 2016).

FIGURE 6.11 Berlin and Kay's developmental scheme for the elaboration of color terms. Some cultures only
distinguish black from white. When another term emerges, that color is red. After that, green and yellow are added,
either one first. Then blue and brown are added, in that order, and then one of these four: purple, pink, orange, or
gray. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

Vox: The Surprising Pattern behind Color Names around the World

Oddly, though this finding lends very strong support to the notion of linguistic universals, the very same
research has also been used to argue for linguistic relativity. Paul Kay later teamed up with another linguist,
Willet Kempton, to consider how different color schemes might affect how people "see" color in the
environment around them (1984). They presented people with color chips on the spectrum between true blue
and true green. They asked subjects how they would group all the colors into two categories. People who spoke
languages that had terms for both blue and green drew a more distinct boundary between the two colors than
people who had just one word for both blue and green.

Clearly, relativity and universalism are both aspects of human language. Our common biology plays a role in
how humans interact with the world, providing regularity to the way all languages categorize not only color but
also plants, animals, weather, and other natural phenomena. Researchers who study the systems of categories
people use to organize their knowledge of the world have a term for those cultural systems: folk taxonomies.
The folk taxonomy for any area of human knowledge reflects both human biology and the surrounding
environment and sociocultural practices. There are folk taxonomies for plants, animals, clouds, foods, and the
cries of babies.

Folk taxonomies are not just vocabulary terms; they frequently structure any kind of distinction that is
meaningful within a culture, even those that rely on simple qualifiers like "good" and "bad." One example is
death, surely invariant across cultures. Societies all over the world distinguish between a "good" death and a
"bad" death. These notions reflect cultural beliefs and values--such as the American notion that a good death
is a painless one. Among the Akan peoples of Ghana, a good death is the death of someone who has led a very
long life, achieving all of the culturally valued accomplishments in life, such as getting married, having
children, accumulating property, and providing support to friends and family members (Adinkra 2020).
Imagine a very old great-grandmother surrounded by her many descendants as she lies in her bed, heaving
one final breath as she drifts away peacefully into death. That is a good death. A bad death is tragic and violent,
the sudden death of a person who has not had the chance to really live a full life. Think of a young person
drowning or dying in a traffic accident. That is a very bad death. If someone has had a good death, that person
is eligible to become an ancestor if the correct rituals are performed. The body must be washed, publicly
mourned, and buried in a beautiful casket in a public cemetery, often with grave goods like tools and money to
help the person in the afterlife. Ancestors are important, as they watch over their living relatives, possibly
192  6 · Language and Communication

     helping them out if called upon through libation or other ritual means. If someone has had a bad death,
     however, they may become an angry ghost, haunting family members with bad luck. The funeral rites of bad
     deaths are rushed, minimal, and private in order to avoid commemorating or communicating with the agitated
     spirit.

     Categorization is central to our perceptions, thoughts, actions, and speech. The way humans categorize objects
     and experiences is limited by the way our brains and bodies work, resulting in linguistic universals like the
     developmental scheme of color terms. However, the complex meanings associated with cultural categories
     vary widely, resulting in a great deal of linguistic relativity. Linguistic relativism and universalism are often
     described as opposite positions, but in fact, they are both essential and complementary features of human
     language.

     Meaning and Metaphor

     How are you feeling today? Are you feeling up or feeling down? If you're feeling low, try doing something fun to
     lift your spirits. Take care of yourself so you don't fall into a depression.

     An old theory suggested that languages are primarily referential; that is, each language contains a set of
     vocabulary terms that correspond to elements in the natural world. According to this theory, language
     functions as a mirror of reality. We have seen in the last section, however, that different languages divide up
     the natural world in different ways, from the natural domains of color and plants to the human domains of life
     and death. Moreover, humans use language to talk about abstract issues like mood, social relationships, and
     communication itself. It is fairly easy to use our terms for spatial organization to talk about the location of
     concrete objects like arugula on somebody's face. But what about more abstract issues? How do we talk about
     becoming friends with someone? How do we discuss an argument we're making in a term paper? How do we
     talk about how we're feeling today?

     Mood is like color insofar as the human physiology of mood structures a set of near-universal basic categories
     including happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise. And yet, because mood occurs on a spectrum,
     it is divided up in different ways by different cultures. Consider "schadenfreude," a German word combining
     the roots for "damage" and "joy." Schadenfreude refers to taking pleasure in another's misfortune. There is no
     equivalent word in English.

     We don't just use language to identify the emotions we're feeling. We also talk about the process of developing
     an emotion, how one mood leads to another, and how we can prevent ourselves from feeling a certain way.
     These are mysterious and abstract processes. How do we do this? We use metaphor. A metaphor is a linguistic
     idiom where use what we know about something concrete to think and talk about something abstract.
     Cognitive linguists George Lakoff and Mark Johnson argue that metaphor is the primary way we create
     complex meaning in language (1980). In terms of mood, we use our concrete language of direction to talk
     about our abstract experience of mood. A positive mood is understood as up, while a negative mood is
     considered down. If you're feeling really happy, you might say you're on top of the world. If you're really sad,
     you might say you're down in the dumps. In fact, the word for prolonged sadness, depression, literally refers to
     a sunken place or the act of lowering something.

     Metaphor is one of those things that you don't notice until you start paying attention to it. And then you realize
     that it's everywhere: in the way you think about time, number, life, love, physical fitness, work, leisure, sleep,
     and thought itself, just to name a few highly metaphorical topics. Just about any abstract area of experience is
     structured by metaphorical thinking. Here are three common metaphors in English, with examples.

     LIFE IS A JOURNEY

          He took the wrong path in life.
          As you move ahead, you should follow your dreams.
          When I left home, I came to a crossroads in life.
          If you work hard, you'll arrive at a sense of accomplishment later in life.

     LOVE IS SWEET

          She's my sweetheart.

     The newlyweds went on a honeymoon.
     Sugar, would you pass the salt?
     Our love was sweet, but then it went sour.

ARGUMENT IS COMBAT

     The candidate launched a personal attack against her opponent.
     His position on taxes is indefensible.
     Armed with facts, she won the argument.
     His criticism really hit the mark.

There are thousands and thousands of metaphors in English. Many abstract domains rely on a combination of
various metaphors used to describe different aspects of the experience. You can think of love as sweet (as
above) but also as a journey (as in "Will the couple go forward together, or will they go their separate ways?") or
as combat (as in "He slew me with his come-hither glance").

Metaphor is found in all human languages. Some specific metaphors, like the directional metaphors used to
describe mood, are found in many, many cultures. A study by Esther Afreh (2018) found that the king of Asante
(in Ghana) frequently uses metaphorical language in his public speeches, including such familiar ones as "life
is a journey," "life is a battle," "ideas are food," "knowing is seeing," and "death is sleep." Though the speeches
were delivered in English, Afreh notes that these metaphors also exist in Akan, the local language of the Asante
people. Alongside her analysis of the English-language speeches, she notes many proverbs and phrases in
Akan that use the same metaphors.

As with our discussion of categorization in the last section, metaphor is both relative and universal. Lakoff and
Johnson argue that our common human biology structures our experiences of things like emotion and life.
When you're feeling really sad, you might literally feel like lying down, and when you're really happy, you might
jump with joy. We may use the notion of a journey to structure our understanding of life, social relationships,
and time in general because in our everyday life, we move forward in space to pursue objects and activities.

Sometimes the reasons for cross-cultural similarities are not so directly linked to human biology. English and
Chinese have similar metaphorical systems for talking about moral issues. In both languages, the adjective
meaning "high" is associated with things that are lofty, noble, or good, while the adjective "low" is used to
describe things that are mean, contemptible, or evil (Yu 2016). Alternatively, it is also possible in both
languages to describe moral behavior as "straight," while immoral behavior can be termed "crooked."

On the other hand (to deploy a useful metaphor), different cultures do rely on different metaphors to talk about
some domains of experience, metaphors that emphasize certain aspects of those abstract topics. Consider the
English notion that "time is money." This is a metaphor, pure and simple, but many English speakers believe it
to be absolutely true. You can spend time, waste time, save time, and invest time. So time does seem like
money in capitalist cultures. But time is not literally money. Nor is time a journey or a horizontal line in space,
though these are common ways of thinking about time in the English language. Time is just time, an abstract
idea. Certainly Whorf did not find the Hopi talking about time as money. English speakers think of time in
terms of money because they live in a society in which time is treated as money, a society that tends to
monetize nearly everything, from land and labor to advice, attention, and even body parts like human sperm.

6.3 Language, Community, and Culture

LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Explain the role of culture in the acquisition of language.
  · Describe how language can form the foundation of sociocultural groups in speech communities.
  · Describe how people code-switch among speech communities.

While language is critical to individual human thought, its basic function is to communicate messages in
human communities. That is, language is fundamentally social. Through social interaction, humans learn the
language of their community. And through language, humans express community identity and coordinate
194  6 · Language and Communication

     their activities.

     Language Acquisition and Language Socialization

     Imagine that someone handed you a babbling baby and said to you, "Teach this baby the basic rules and values
     of our culture." What would you do?

     Likely, you'd start by teaching the baby your language. Without language, it's pretty hard to teach rules and
     values (unless you are a really good mime). Luckily, babies come into the world with special cognitive abilities
     that make them ready to learn language. Most babies undergo a rapid process of language learning between
     the ages of nine months and three years. Babies proceed through a set of stages that allow them to learn
     language just by being exposed to surrounding talk. Many scholars study the problem of language acquisition,
     examining precisely how humans manage to learn language in a diversity of sociocultural contexts.

     So your babbling baby would probably learn language just by being exposed to it. But what if someone wanted
     to hasten the process or make sure their baby was particularly excellent with language?

     An American would probably interact with the baby in a particular way, sitting the baby on their lap facing
     them, pointing to objects and asking basic questions in a quiz-like fashion. "See the cookie? Where did the
     cookie go? In my tummy!" The person might say these types of things while talking in a high-pitched, sing-
     song voice. Linguists call this type of talk "motherese." In many other cultures, caregivers do not interact with
     babies in this way. In some cultures, oversimplified "baby talk" is considered detrimental to language learning.
     The context of language learning might involve a whole host of characters beyond the baby and the caregiver,
     encompassing all household relatives, neighbors, visitors, and even strangers. Language is not always "taught"
     to babies, but is often witnessed and overheard. Rather than quizzing her baby American style, a mother in
     Kaluli society in Papua New Guinea is more likely to sit her baby on her lap facing outward, talking "for" the
     baby in conversations with siblings (Ochs and Schieffelin [1984] 2001). In West Africa, babies spend large parts
     of the day wrapped on the backs of their mothers where face-to-face interaction with her is impossible. But
     they overhear the talk around them all day long, and people frequently engage their attention in brief
     interactions. In the field of language socialization, researchers go beyond the various stages of language
     learning to focus on the social contexts in which language is acquired. As social contexts shape the way
     children learn language, language itself becomes a means of learning about sociocultural life.

     Whether facing their caregivers or facing out to the social world around them, babies in all cultures learn to be
     proficient in their languages. And yet, in American culture, the notion persists that language proficiency relies
     on very precise forms of interaction between caregiver and baby, the American model of motherese. Every
     culture has specific ideas about language, how it is acquired, how it varies across social groups, how it changes
     over time, etc. These ideas are termed language ideologies. Some of these ideas, like the notion that babies
     have a special "window" of opportunity for learning language, are supported by linguistic research. Others,
     however, are challenged by ethnographic and cross-cultural research.

     Speech Communities and Code Switching
     A ten-year-old girl described one of her stuffed animals as "derpy." Here is a snippet of her conversation with
     her mother:

     Thisbe: Look at his face. He's so derpy.
     Jennifer: Derpy? I don't know that word. What does it mean?
     Thisbe: Like, kind of stupid. Kind of dumb.
     Jennifer: Oh, ok. Like Clover [our dog], when she fell off the couch. Was that derpy?
     Thisbe: No, that's not derpy! It's like ... Mom, I just can't explain it to you. You just have to know.

     All speakers of a particular language form a hypothetical community, sharing a common grammar and
     vocabulary, as well as a set of understandings about how language is used in different situations. Within this
     large group are smaller groups of speakers who use the common language in special ways unique to that
     group. Anthropologists use the term speech community to describe such a group (Muehlmann 2014). Speech
     communities often have distinctive vocabularies, grammatical forms, and intonation patterns. Using these
     features appropriately, members of the speech community demonstrate their membership in the group.

The concept of speech community was originally used to describe the distribution of dialects in a language. A
dialect is a form of language specific to a particular region. For instance, in the Philadelphia metropolitan
area, it's common for local people to pronounce the word "water" as "woohder," as if it nearly rhymes with the
word "order." It's also common to use the phrase "yooz" for the second-person plural (as in, "Yooz better drink
some woohder!"). Linguists William Labov, Sharon Ash, and Charles Boberg famously mapped out these
dialectical differences in different regions of the United States (2006). Over time, a dialect can accumulate
such unique linguistic features that it develops into a separate language. Indeed, the distinction between a
well-developed dialect and a language is largely political. Nation-states may downplay regional differences as
mere dialects in order to maintain linguistic unity, while separatist political movements may champion their
way of speaking as an entirely different language in order to justify their demands for independence.

particular way it is spoken varies from region to region. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC

Other researchers have focused on the speech communities of ethnic groups and immigrants. Researchers use
the term vernacular to describe dialects that are not necessarily regional but associated with specific social
categories, such as groups based on ethnicity, age, or gender. Anthropological research on African American
Vernacular English (AAE), Chicano English, and Native American English have all shown how these
vernaculars shape distinctive forms of storytelling, arguing, and criticism (Chun and Lo 2015). Rather than
seeing ethnic vernaculars as "incorrect" forms of English, researchers demonstrate how vernaculars like AAE
are highly structured linguistic systems with regular grammatical patterns and innovative vocabularies (Labov
1972a). In formal settings like American classrooms and courtrooms, these alternative ways of using English
are too often stigmatized as lazy, unintelligent, or just plain wrong. Believing their own English to be the
"correct" form, authority figures often forbid the use of alternative vernaculars of English and refuse to engage
in any effort to understand those forms.

More recent research on vernaculars has explored how speakers maneuver among the styles of language they
encounter in their daily lives, engaging in various languages, dialects, vernaculars, and other elements of style.
We all use a variety of linguistic styles, and many speak more than one language. Addressing different
audiences, U.S. President Barack Obama used linguistic strategies to "Whiten," "Blacken," "Americanize," and
"Christianize" his public identity, thus subverting racial stereotypes and indicating his membership in a
diversity of communities (Alim and Smitherman 2012). In parts of the world that were previously colonized by
Europeans, European languages have been maintained as the formal language of government and education
even as most people speak local languages in their everyday interactions with kin, neighbors, merchants, and
other community members. In these postcolonial contexts, people tack back and forth between various styles
196  6 · Language and Communication

     of their local languages as well as shifting between the local language and the European one. Such strategic
     maneuvering among linguistic styles, called code-switching, is done by people in many difference contexts.

     For many people, the style of language spoken in elite settings such as schools and government institutions
     has the effect of disempowering and marginalizing them. Linguistic anthropologists examine how vernaculars
     associated with elite and professional groups become a means of in-group solidarity and out-group exclusion.
     Anthropologist and lawyer Elizabeth Mertz (2007) conducted participant observation in first-year classes at
     several American law schools, looking at how law students are taught to "think like a lawyer." Using a version of
     the Socratic method, law professors teach their students to set aside the moral and emotional elements of
     cases to view them purely as texts subject to abstract, professional analysis. The ability to master the linguistic
     maneuvering and arcane vocabulary of this form of analysis becomes a prerequisite for becoming a lawyer.
     The American justice system is thus dominated by people who are trained to set aside humanistic concerns in
     favor of textual authority and manipulation. Mertz's study shows how people are socialized by language
     throughout their lives, not just in childhood. And it alerts us to the way that language can be used to elevate the
     learned perspectives of elites, dismissing the moral and emotional perspectives of others.

     6.4 Performativity and Ritual

     LEARNING OUTCOMES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       · Provide examples of the performative function of speech acts.
       · Describe how ritual language can be performative.
       · Identify the informal ways that people "talk back" to formal speech.

     The Performativity of Language: Speaking as Action

     Consider the following pairs of sentences. What are the differences between the two sentences in each case?

     1. Boris and Natasha are married.
     2. Boris and Natasha, I now pronounce you husband and wife.

     1. Natasha: Boris lost his job.
     2. Natasha: Boris, you're fired!

     1. Boris: Natasha, I ate the last pickle.
     2. Boris: Natasha, I apologize for eating the last pickle.

     In all the above pairs, the first sentence is a report about an event. The second sentence makes an event
     happen. In the sentences about the pickle, the second sentence does not make the pickle disappear, but it does
     create an apology for that action, hopefully altering the consequences of the pickle-eating. In the previous
     section, we explored how we use language to think and reason about the world around us. This is an essential
     function of language, but it is not the only one. We also use language to do things--that is, to perform actions in
     the world.

     Way back in the 1930s, Bronislaw Malinowski explored how people use language in culturally specific ways to
     play an active part in their societies (Duranti 2012). Malinowski described how the people of the Trobriand
     Islands used magical language to compel the growth of yams, bananas, taro, and palms in their carefully
     cultivated gardens. Magical spells, like all ritual language, aim at making something happen through the
     special manipulation of public speech. We see the same use of language in other ritual settings like marriages
     and naming ceremonies. The plot of many a Hollywood romantic comedy hinges on the moment the partners
     say "I do" and the officiant pronounces them married. In American marriage ceremonies, it is clear that ritual
     language is the tool that marries people--not the rings, or the pageantry, or the blessings of family and friends,
     or any other aspect of the ritual.

     In his influential book How to Do Things with Words (1962), philosopher of language J.L. Austin coined a term
     for action-oriented language: performatives. The most obvious performatives use phrases like "I pronounce,"
     "I order," "I promise," "I warn," or "I appoint." Sentences that begin with these phrases are explicitly uttered
     with the intention of doing something through the act of speaking. As he dug deeper into the performative

6.4 · Performativity and Ritual                                                                                    197

function of language, however, Austin realized that performatives are not so much a separate category of
utterances but an aspect of most of the things we say. Even when people are making a simple descriptive
statement, they are saying it for a reason. The power of speech to make things happen is called
performativity. Consider the following sentences:

The exam is next week.
The dog is pawing on the door.

The above sentences are statements about an event or situation. However, if a professor announces to the
class, "The exam is next week," this is not merely an observation, but a warning--a cue to students to study in
preparation for the upcoming exam. And if someone tells their roommate, "The dog is pawing on the door,"
they are essentially telling that person to let the dog out.

Like metaphor, performativity is one of those aspects of language that permeates everyday speech. Once you
learn about it, you recognize performativity in just about everything you say. Spend a few hours paying
attention to each utterance as you go about your activities. You'll find that you rarely use language to merely
describe what's going on. You speak in order to generate a response or result, even when you just say "Hi."

The Performativity of Ritual Language

Just as Malinowski studied the special language used in garden magic among the Trobrianders, many
contemporary linguistic anthropologists study the role of performative language in various ritual settings. In a
recent article, Patience Epps and Danilo Paiva Ramos examine the performance of incantations among the
Indigenous Hup community of the northwest Amazon (Epps and Ramos 2020). An incantation is a patterned
set of phrases or sentences used to compel a magical result. Among the Hup, incantations are used by elders
for protection, healing, and causing harm. While Epps and Ramos were conducting fieldwork in the area, Hup
elders expressed concerns that the young men in the village were not learning the repertoire of important
incantations properly, thus endangering the health and safety of the community. The elders invited Epps and
Ramos to write down their incantations for healing and protection in order to preserve them for future
generations. Epps and Ramos documented and analyzed these incantations in consultation with Hup elders.

In the article, Epps and Ramos analyze an incantation used by the Hup to protect travelers on paths through
the rain forest. This incantation is recited by an elder before a group of Hup people embark on a journey. After
providing the original text and its English translation, Epps and Ramos describe the incantation's structure
and poetic features, including the use of metaphor and repetition of phrases. As a whole, the incantation lists
various dangers and helpful entities and enacts certain magical practices through the speech itself. At the
beginning of the incantation, the elder states that he is enclosing the entire path in a protective "canoe," much
as a traveler on a river would ride in a canoe. This canoe is named after a particular snake, the mussurana
snake (Clelia clelia), a constrictor snake that eats other snakes and is immune to their venom. Thus, the
incantation is creating a metaphorical shield of protection around the travelers, making them safe from
venomous snakebites. In the second section of the incantation, the elder lists all classes and subtypes of
snakes that might be encountered in the rain forest, asserting a kind of taxonomic mastery over the snakes.
Summoning the snakes one by one, he tells of lining them up, sitting them down, and feeding them sticky coca
and tobacco. The snakes then sit quietly, their jaws stuck together by the sticky substance so that they are
unable to bite anyone. The incantation goes on to deal with several other malevolent entities and engage with
beneficial entities to help the travelers in their journey.

Informal Back-Talk: Teasing, Grumbling, and Gossip

Linguistic anthropologists most frequently rely on long periods of fieldwork, living in the communities they
study and witnessing and even participating in ritual events where performative language is deployed. Such
events include protection and healing magic, but also naming ceremonies, puberty rites, weddings, funerals,
and other rituals that mark the passage of persons from one social status to another. Anthropologists term
such rituals "rites of passage" (discussed in detail in Anthropology of Food). At such ritual events, elders or
religious specialists are called upon to perform the ritual language necessary to publicly move persons from
the previous category to the new one.

Naming ceremonies are a great example of the power of performative language in rites of passage. In many
198  6 · Language and Communication

     West African societies, a baby is not considered a true person until they have been publicly named by an elder
     or religious official in a naming ceremony performed a certain number of days after the baby is born. Extended
     family and friends attend the ceremony as markers of their relationship to the baby. Guests bring gifts such as
     rice and cloth for the baby, and they are rewarded for their attendance with prepared food and kola nuts.

     During his fieldwork in southeastern Senegal, linguistic anthropologist Nicholas Sweet witnessed the naming
     ceremony for a baby in a Pular-speaking village (2019). When the family were gathered in the compound of the
     baby's father, the imam rose, faced east, gave the blessings of the prophet, and then performed the naming of
     the baby girl (in Arabic, English translation below):

     In the name of God, the gracious and the compassionate
     O Allah, send blessings on our master Muhammad
     O Allah, send blessings on our master Muhammad
     O Allah, send blessings on our master Muhammad
     The name of the child has come here, her mother and her father have named her Aissatou
     The name of the child has come here, her mother and her father have named her Aissatou
     This is what was written on the tablet of Allah
     May God grant her blessings

     While carefully recording the formal performative language so important to this naming ceremony, Sweet was
     also attuned to the more informal kinds of language that surrounded the main action. For instance, just before
     the imam's performance, some friends of the family were gathered around the baby, remarking on her beauty.
     As a way of showing their admiration, some of the men joked and teased one another about the prospect of
     marrying her someday. Other relatives teased the baby's parents with demands for kola nuts and other food.
     As dramatically performative as the official naming was, this informal language was also performative,
     providing a way for guests to socially configure their various relationships to the new person in their
     community.

     Someone important had been left out of the ceremony--the great-aunt of the baby, also named Aissatou. As the
     baby was her namesake, Auntie Aissatou had been invited and should have been a featured guest at the
     ceremony. But when the time came to perform the ceremony, she had not arrived yet, and so they went on
     without her. Afterward, as guests were making their way home, they crossed paths with Auntie Aissatou, who
     was just then on her way to the event. Realizing that the naming had already been performed, she complained
     that she had been waiting for someone to fetch her and bring her to the ceremony. Auntie Aissatou was angry
     that she had missed the ceremony as well as the gifts distributed afterward.

     Wrapping a scarf around her head in imitation of an imam, Auntie Aissatou continued on to the compound of
     the baby's father. Striding ceremoniously into the compound, she addressed a number of elders still gathered
     there. In a parody of the official naming performance, she faced east, delivered the blessings of the prophet,
     and then announced:

     The name of the child has come here. It is Buubu Nooge (Trash Owl).

     The audience of relatives erupted in laughter but also protest, interrupting Auntie Aissatou to correct her with
     the baby's true given name. But Auntie Aissatou persisted, saying over and over again that the baby's name had
     come and it was "Trash Owl."

     Why Trash Owl? In this community, it is believed that witches turn themselves into owls when they fly through
     the night. "Trash" seemed to refer to the joke gifts of garbage (broken flip-flops, an old sock) in a small gourd
     that Auntie Aissatou presented in lieu of the usual baby gifts of food, cloth, and soap.

     In the days following the naming ceremony, the teasing name for the baby became a running joke in the
     community, especially among people who had not been invited to the ceremony but felt that they should have
     been. In order to quash the teasing nickname, the baby's family was compelled to make a number of visits
     around the community with appeasing gifts of kola in an effort to get everyone to recognize the baby's proper
     name. Once Auntie Aissatou and the others had received their visits and kola, they abandoned the name Trash
     Owl, recognizing the baby as Aissatou, the namesake of Auntie Aissatou.

This incident illustrates the power of parody and gossip to steal performative power from the authoritative
realm of formal speech, giving excluded and marginalized people a way to "talk back" to authority. There are
many ways of doing this. Often, audiences to formal speech will deliberately misunderstand or creatively
interpret the proclamations of authority figures.

6.5 Language and Power

LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Explain how language can operate as a gendered form of power.
  · Identify how racial categories and bias are expressed through linguistic practices.
  · Describe strategies used by communities to revive their dormant languages.

Gender and Language

In 2018, the word "mansplaining" was added to the Merriam-Webster dictionary. The word is defined as "what
occurs when a man talks condescendingly to someone (especially a woman) about something he has
incomplete knowledge of, with the mistaken assumption that he knows more about it than the person he's
talking to does" ("Words We're Watching" 2018).

The word was inspired by an article written in 2008 by the feminist blogger Rebecca Solnit. In the article "Men
Explain Things to Me," Solnit described an incident at a party in which she mentioned to a man that she had
recently written a book about a particular photographer. Immediately, the man interrupted to inform her about
a very important book that just came out about that same photographer, a book he had read about in The New
York Times. After the man had described the book in great detail, Solnit's friend finally intervened to say that
the book he was talking about was, in fact, written by Solnit. In the wake of Solnit's article, other women writers
described similar experiences in their workplaces, schools, and relationships, and the whole phenomenon
came to be called "mansplaining."

FIGURE 6.13 Rebecca Solnit, the author of the article "Men Explain Things to Me". The term "mansplaining" has
become a well discussed topic in the years since she introduced the term. (credit: "Rebecca Solnit" by Charles
Kremenak/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 2.5)

Have you ever witnessed mansplaining? Have you ever mansplained to someone? Embedded in the very term
is a notion about gender and language. The idea is that men and women have different styles of speech, styles
that reflect and reinforce inequality between genders.

In recent years, many writers have pushed back against the term "mansplaining," arguing that all men do not
always speak this way to all women. Some argue that many men are much more respectful and sensitive to the
200  6 · Language and Communication

     dynamics of power in their conversations with women. Some argue that privileged White women tend to speak
     in a mansplaining way to male waiters and salespersons or to people of color more generally. Others suggest
     that older people speak in a condescending way to younger people, or vice versa.

     Have you ever become annoyed with a friend or relative who repeatedly interrupts you? Have you ever noticed
     how some people tend to end their sentences with rising intonation, making everything they say sound like a
     question? How about a person who ignores what you say but then rephrases your idea and takes credit for it?
     Many people associate these ways of speaking with gender, the way men speak or the way women speak. As
     noted in the discussion of language acquisition, every culture has ideas about how language operates, called
     language ideologies. The idea that American men and American women have distinctive styles of speech is a
     language ideology. Whether it is true or not is a question for linguistic research, but this idea has become a
     widespread way of thinking about gender, power, and language in American culture.

     In the 1970s, linguists inspired by the women's movement turned their attention to the way gender shapes
     different patterns of speech. In her influential book Language and Woman's Place (1975), Robin Lakoff argues
     that women and men are socialized to speak in distinctive ways that empower men and subordinate women.
     Lakoff describes women's speech as uncertain, excessively polite, and full of hedges, emotional language,
     euphemism, and tag questions ("Don't you think?"). Other linguistic researchers have found that men tend to
     interrupt women far more than vice versa, even when the women speaking are doctors and the men are their
     patients (Zimmerman and West 1975, West 1998).

     Building on this research, Deborah Tannen generalized beyond speech patterns to describe two entirely
     different communicative subcultures for American men and American women (1990). When men and women
     speak to one another, Tannen argues, they are speaking cross-culturally, deploying different motivations and
     expectations for talk. Men engage in conversation to assert their status in a social hierarchy, while women are
     more interested in building solidarity through social connection. Men authoritatively report information to
     their interlocutors, while women engage in conversational rapport with their interlocutors. In popular media,
     differences in the speech styles of men and women are frequently linked to purported differences in specific
     parts of male and female brains, such the corpus callosum, the amygdala, and the hippocampus. In this way,
     gendered patterns of speaking are naturalized as biological.

     Like the pushback against the term "mansplaining," researchers have begun to challenge the view that women
     and men are embedded in different linguistic subcultures with different patterns of speech, motivation, and
     interpretation. Psychologist Janet Hyde conducted a meta-analysis of hundreds of quantitative studies to see if
     widespread notions about gender and language were actually borne out by linguistic data (2005). Along with
     notions of power, Hyde was interested in testing the idea that women are chattier and more deferential than
     men. Focusing on studies of children, Hyde found that boys and girls exhibited no differences at all in reading
     comprehension, verbal reasoning, and vocabulary. The tendency for boys to interrupt or speak assertively was
     only very slightly higher than for girls. The girls' tendency toward self-disclosure and cooperation with their
     conversation partners was only slightly higher than for boys. The only significant differences Hyde found were
     in smiling and correct spelling (girls did more of both).

     How do we reconcile research demonstrating differences in the way men and women talk with data that
     suggests very little difference in the speech patterns of girls and boys? One could argue that children have not
     been entirely socialized into their assigned gender category. Perhaps the discrepancy suggests that gendered
     ways of speaking are cultural, not biological, and that, for children, the most intense period of socialization is
     yet to come in adolescence.

     Moreover, ethnographic research by linguistic anthropologists shows that patterns of speech associated with
     men and women are culturally relative. Reversing the American stereotypes, anthropologists working in
     Madagascar and New Guinea have found that women are expected to speak in a more confrontational and
     argumentative style, while men are associated with more cooperative, euphemistic, and ceremonial speech
     (Keenan [Ochs] 1974, Kulick 1992, both cited in Ahearn 2017).

     So both quantitative and ethnographic research overturn the notion that women and men are biologically
     engineered to use language in different ways. That leaves us with the conclusion that any differences in the
     ways men and women talk are entirely cultural. Literary scholar Judith Butler argues that gender identities are

not biological but are performed through language and other cultural practices, particularly those centered on
the body (1988). So when men and women speak in certain ways, they are socially performing their gender
identities, whether consciously or unconsciously. Moreover, through their linguistic performances, people
enact their own versions of gender in complicated ways that transcend the neat dichotomy of male and female.
You probably have a language ideology that tells you how men and women speak in your culture, but do you
always speak in the style associated with your assigned gender category? Nobody does. And some people
rarely do. As these contradictory performances build up over time, the very notion of gender can change.

        PROFILES IN ANTHROPOLOGY

Kira Hall
1962-

Area of Anthropology: Kira Hall's (https://openstax.org/r/colorado) work is situated at the intersection of
sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology. In graduate school, she studied with Robin Lakoff in the
linguistics department at the University of California-Berkeley, earning her PhD there in 1995. For her
dissertation, she examined the linguistic strategies of Hindi-speaking hijras in Banaras, India. Hijras are
members of a third-gender group in many Indian communities. Most hijras were raised as boys and later
adopted the intersex behaviors and language of the hijra identity. Hall analyzed how hijras navigated aspects
of gender embedded in Hindi, such as certain verbs and adjectives that are marked as feminine or masculine.
She showed how hijras alternate between these gendered forms, code-switching as a reflection of their own
ambiguous identities. She explored how hijras use obscene forms of language to shame people into giving
them money. She showed how they had developed their own secret language as a way of communicating with
one another, signaling their identity to others, and excluding non-hijras from understanding their
conversations.

Accomplishments in the Field: Reflecting her work at the boundaries of linguistics and anthropology, Hall has
held academic positions in the anthropology department at Yale University and the linguistics department of
Stanford University. Currently, she is professor of linguistics at the University of Colorado at Boulder, with a
joint appointment in the anthropology department. She is also director of the Program in Culture, Language,
and Social Practice at UC-Boulder. Since 2019, she has served as the president of the Society for Linguistic
Anthropology of the American Anthropological Association.

Importance of Their Work: Hall's work highlights how language operates within hierarchies of gender,
sexuality, and socioeconomic class. In addition to her work on hijras, she has published articles on language
and sociality in autism, female mass hysteria in upstate New York, and Donald Trump's use of gesture and
derisive humor in the 2016 Republican Party primaries.

Race and Ethnicity

On many government forms, people are asked to identify their "race." Forms in the United States often include
five categories: Black, White, Asian, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific
Islander. The category "Hispanic or Latino" is often listed as an ethnicity rather than a race. On the 2020 U.S.
Census, people were presented with 14 racial categories to choose from: White, Black or African American,
American Indian or Alaska Native, Chinese, Filipino, Asian Indian, Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese, Other Asian,
Native Hawai'ian, Samoan, Chamorro, and Other Pacific Islander. Again, "Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish" was
listed as a question of "origin." Even with so many options, many Americans still could not find a category that
represented their racial or ethnic identity.

As you'll remember from earlier chapters in this text, race is not biological. There is no accurate way to divide
up the gradual spectrum of human biological variation, meaning that biological categories of race are entirely
imaginary. However, we also know that social categories of race are very powerful tools of discrimination,
subordination, solidarity, and affirmative action. Earlier in this chapter, we studied how sets of categories, "folk
taxonomies," are embedded in language. We saw how different cultures divide up the natural world differently.

     Likewise, race and ethnicity are folk taxonomies, embedded in language and organizing the social world into a
     neat set of groups. These categories are real insofar as they have shaped the structure of our society,
     advantaging some groups and disadvantaging others. And they are real insofar as they shape our thoughts and
     actions and even our subconscious habits and tendencies.

     Like gender, race and ethnicity are performed in language. We use language in conscious and unconscious
     ways to express racial and ethnic belonging as well as exclusion. Take the use of Spanish catchphrases by
     Americans who do not speak Spanish. Many Americans intend to be jokey and fun by using Spanish phrases
     such as "hasta la vista!" and "no problemo" as well as deliberately incorrect ones such as "buenos nachos" and
     "hasta la bye bye!" Anthropologist Jane Hill found that middle-class, college-educated White Americans were
     most likely (among other Americans) to use this "mock Spanish" (2008). People who use these phrases
     consider them harmless and even respectful, while Spanish speakers are often insulted by the association of
     Spanish with silliness. Hill argues that such phrases are only funny because they covertly draw from
     stereotypes of Spanish speakers as foolish, lazy, and inept.

     Similar arguments about cultural appropriation and stereotyping can be made about the use of Black
     vernacular speech by White Americans. In the United States, a variety of English called African American
     English (AAE), or African American Vernacular English, is spoken by many people in predominantly Black
     communities. With the widespread popularity of Black culture, many White Americans have picked up phrases
     and grammatical features of AAE while knowing very little about the vernacular and the people who speak it as
     their primary language. To many Americans, AAE is just imperfect English (it is not, as we'll see in a moment).
     So what are White people signaling when they say things like "chillin'," "lit," "on fleek," "aa'ight" (for "alright"),
     "ima" (for "I'm going to") and "Yasss, Queen!" Does the use of this language convey respect for the communities
     associated with Black vernacular English? Or does it demean and subordinate Black Americans who speak
     AAE?

     People who use mock Spanish and mock AAE typically do not mean to insult anyone. The problem is not one of
     intent, but of context. In American culture, most middle-class White people speak forms of English considered
     standard or mainstream (Lippi-Green 2012). In fact, Standard American English (SAE) is historically based on
     the language of Anglo American immigrants. The adoption of White Anglo-English has always been considered
     critical to successful assimilation by minority and immigrant groups. Success at complete assimilation is often
     measured by the ability to speak SAE without an accent. But SAE is not speaking "without an accent." SAE is an
     accent--the accent of White people whose ancestors emigrated from the British Isles.

     SAE is the dominant language of American public spaces, including schools, workplaces, government, and
     media. People who speak SAE without effort or accent can speak freely in these spaces, knowing that their
     language will be understood and respected. Americans whose primary language is Spanish or AAE often
     struggle to be understood and taken seriously in American public life. Given this context, it can seem
     disrespectful for White Americans to appropriate Spanish and AAE as tools of humor while denigrating and
     marginalizing the actual speakers of these languages.

     The issue is further complicated by the widespread and persistent notion among White Americans (and many
     Black Americans too) that AAE is not a language at all, but merely a hodgepodge of slang and bad grammar.
     This view is simply wrong, another language ideology that has no basis in fact. AAE is a rule-governed form of
     English with its own regular system of sounds, grammar, and vocabulary (Labov 1972b). For historical reasons,
     AAE shares many features with the English spoken by White southerners in the United States as well as
     working-class Cockney English from London (Ahearn 2017). Rooted in historical experiences of slavery and
     segregation, Black Americans have developed their own distinctive set of innovative linguistic features to
     supplement the more basic structure of American English. Consider the following three sentences:

     He is angry.
     He angry.
     He be angry.

     The first sentence is SAE, and the second and third are AAE alternatives. In SAE, this conjugation of the verb
     "to be" describes a situation happening in the present. But the SAE present tense of "to be" is a bit vague, as it
     can mean "right now, this very minute" or a more ongoing situation, perhaps describing a person who is

frequently or enduringly angry. AAE helpfully distinguishes between these two possibilities. "He angry" means
angry "right now," whereas "He be angry" indicates a more ongoing situation. In linguistic terminology, the
second example is called "copula deletion" and the third is called "the habitual be." Both are used in regular
ways to indicate the difference between momentary and enduring conditions.

AAE is governed by many more rules and features that provide its speakers with expressive possibilities not
available to speakers of SAE. In other words, AAE is not only a rule-bound vernacular; it's a more developed
and complex form of English. Linguists have been trying to convey this message to the American public since
the 1970s (Labov 1972a). Read more about AAE at the Anti-Racism Daily website (https://openstax.org/r/Anti-
Racism).

Rather than recognizing the innovative contributions of vernaculars like AAE, language policy in the United
States stigmatizes non-SAE vernaculars as "bad English" spoken by uneducated and unintelligent people.
Linguist John Baugh calls this "linguistic profiling" (2003). With colleagues Thomas Purnell and William
Idsardi, Baugh (1999) compared the response of California landlords to apartment inquiries spoken in SAE,
AAE, and Chicano-American English (CAE). In Woodside, California, landlords responded to SAE inquiries 70.1
percent of the time. Inquiries in AAE received responses only 21.8 percent of the time and CAE inquiries only
28.7 percent of the time. Research in American schools and courtrooms corroborates the discriminatory
effects of linguistic profiling on access to housing, education, and justice.

The use of language to discriminate and marginalize is certainly not limited to American English. Elites in
many cultures define their own way of speaking as "correct" and "official," using linguistic practices in public
spaces to disempower other groups based on class, race, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality. How can people
respond to these forms of linguistic marginalization? For many upwardly mobile speakers of "nonstandard"
vernaculars and languages, the process of becoming successful has involved the abandonment of their
primary way of speaking in favor of standard, elite forms of language privileged in public discourses. But there
is another alternative. As speakers of nonstandard vernaculars and languages move into public discourses,
they can hold on to their primary languages, code-switching from context to context. Some language activists
celebrate the genius of their "home" languages and work to nurture and revive them, as we will see in the next
section.

Can speakers of dominant languages contribute to the process of celebrating and revitalizing marginalized
languages? Is it always insulting or racist for speakers of a dominant language to use phrases from another
vernacular or language? Some people think so. Certainly it is harmful to use phrases that reference negative
stereotypes (even indirectly). But what if your limited use of a few phrases can help you communicate with
someone from a different background? What if SAE speakers started quoting Spanish or AAE in ways that
highlight positive aspects of those speech communities? What if White people started learning AAE in order to
publicize the genius and complexity of this American vernacular? What if you learn another language or
vernacular in order to subvert the forces of cultural segregation in your own society? There are no easy
answers to such questions.

Endangered Languages: Repression and Revival
In 1993, a Wampanoag (https://openstax.org/r/tribalpedia) woman living on a reservation in Cape Cod,
Massachusetts, had a mysterious dream, recurring on three consecutive nights (Feldman 2001). In the dream,
a circle of Wampanoag were singing in a language she did not understand. When she woke, words of the
language stuck with her, and she longed to find out what they meant. Were these words of Wôpanâak, the
language of her ancestors? Wôpanâak had died out in the mid-1800s.

The woman was Jessie Little Doe Baird, a social worker and mother of five. Haunted by those words, she began
reading through documents from the 1600s written in Wôpanâak, including letters, deeds to property, and the
earliest translation of the Bible printed in the Western hemisphere (Sukiennik 2001). Though frustrated in her
efforts to find the meaning of her dream words, she developed a passion for the language of her ancestors and
began working with local Wampanoag communities to reclaim their common language of Wôpanâak.
Community response was enthusiastic. Committed to the project, Baird went to MIT to study linguistics,
earning a master's degree. Based on her survey of Wôpanâak documents, she wrote a dictionary and began
teaching Wampanoag students to speak the language (https://openstax.org/r/Women_of_the_Century).
204  6 · Language and Communication

     By learning their ancestral language, Baird and her students found themselves reconnecting with Wampanoag
     culture in unexpected ways. The grammar of Wôpanâak, for instance, puts the speaker at the end of the
     sentence rather than the beginning. Whereas English speakers would say "I see you," Wôpanâak speakers
     would say something like "You are seen by me." Baird suggests that this word order highlights the value of the
     community over the individual, putting awareness of the other ahead of the self. Wôpanâak displays
     alternative logic in the formulation of nouns as well. For instance, in English, animal names reveal little or
     nothing at all about the animal. The words "cat," "mouse," and "ant" are based on arbitrary sounds that convey
     no information about their referents. In Wôpanâak, however, animal names frequently contain syllables that
     refer to the animal's size, movement, and behavior. The word for "ant," for instance, incorporates syllables
     communicating that the animal moves about, does not walk on two legs, and puts things away.

     By now, you know that forms of cognition and culture are embedded in language. The languages of the world
     encode diverse experiences of time, space, life, death, color, emotions, and more. A language serves as a form
     of oral documentation of the surrounding environment, a survey of the flora, fauna, topography, and climate of
     an area. Forms of cultural wisdom are preserved in the stories and proverbs of a language. History is recorded
     in epic tales and legends. Language can be essential to maintaining cultural identity, affirming the common
     history and values of a people while providing them with a distinctive way of communicating with one another.

     Among the seven thousand languages spoken in the world today, roughly 40 percent of them are in danger of
     dying out in the next hundred years. A language is considered dead when it is no longer spoken by any living
     person. Wôpanâak was once considered a dead language. Some linguists argue that no language should ever
     really be considered "dead," however, and prefer the terms "dormant" or "sleeping." So long as there are
     written or audio records of a language, it can come to life again, a process called language revitalization.
     Returning to a language that has become dormant or endangered, community members can develop strategic
     programs to spread, nurture, and modernize the language, ensuring it has a future for generations to come.

     Languages generally become endangered or dormant through processes of colonialism and imperialism. In
     North America, as Native Americans were forcibly removed from their lands and confined to reservations in
     the 1800s, they were compelled to send their children to boarding schools where they were forbidden to speak
     their Native languages or practice their Native cultures. As foreign settlers seized lands in Australia, New
     Zealand, and Hawaii, they established similar schools, aimed at assimilating Indigenous children by stamping
     out their language and culture. Elsewhere, more gradual processes of endangerment can occur when a new
     language offers opportunities for employment and trade only available to speakers of that language. Parents
     may encourage their children to learn the new language in order to take advantage of these opportunities, and
     children may come to reject their own language as a backward language of old people.

     Many, many languages have risen from dead or comatose states, among them Cornish, Hawaiian, Hebrew,
     Scots-Gaelic, the Ainu language of Japan, the Indigenous Australian language of Barngarla, the Indigenous
     New Zealand language of the Mori people, and the Native American languages of the Navaho and Blackfoot
     peoples. Often, as with Wôpanâak, the impetus for language revival comes from energetic community
     members who feel the loss of their language as a threat to their cultural survival. These concerned people
     create programs to document the language and teach it to children and adults. They establish contexts where
     the language is spoken routinely and exclusively. Sometimes they work with linguists to develop these
     programs.

     The most successful of these revitalization strategies are immersion schools and master-apprentice programs.
     In the early 1980s, Mori language activists developed full-immersion preschools, called Te Khanga Reo, or
     "language nests" (King 2018). In these nests, very young children are taught language and culture by Mori
     elders--grandmothers and grandfathers in the community. Native Hawaiians have developed a similar
     program of language nests, called Pnana Leo. Early on, some parents worried that children in immersion
     schools would not learn the dominant national language well enough to be successful in later life, but research
     has shown that such children do just as well or better in later classroom performance and standardized
     testing. Many language revitalization projects combine early immersion with later bilingual education (Hinton
     2011, 2018). The Navaho Immersion School in Arizona provides immersion education for the first three years
     of schooling and then introduces English as the medium of instruction through grade seven. From grades eight
     to twelve, children are taught in Navaho half the time and English the other half.

One of the challenges of school-based revitalization programs is finding enough adults sufficiently proficient
in the language to teach it to children. Among the strategies of language revitalization that target adult learners
is the master-apprentice approach. The original Master-Apprentice Language Learning Program was founded
in California by the Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival (Hinton 2018). The strategy has
since spread all over the world. In these programs, a proficient speaker and a motivated learner spend 20
hours a week together, using the target language plus gestures and other nonverbal communication to engage
in various activities.

When successful, language revitalization can empower individuals and energize communities. Learning their
heritage language, people come to understand the distinctive genius and complexity of their culture while
preserving a crucial means of transmitting that culture across generations.

        MINI-FIELDWORK ACTIVITY

Dispute Analysis

Choose a friend, relative, or acquaintance with whom you might disagree on a particular issue. Suggested
issues might include musical taste, what makes a good restaurant, how to behave on a date, the best form of
physical exercise, or anything else you feel comfortable talking about but might disagree on. Ask the person if
they would consent to being recorded for an anonymous fieldwork exercise. If so, record a 5-to-10-minute
conversation with that person in which you discuss the issue. Then, review the conversation. What seem to be
the goals of the two interlocutors? What is the pattern of turn taking? What truth or knowledge claims are
made by each speaker, and what are the bases of those claims? How is authority constructed and challenged?
How does each one respond to the assertions of the other? How does the conversation turn out in the end?

INTRODUCTION If you are in college, someone has probably asked you the question, "So, what you want to do
after you graduate?" Are they asking about the hobbies you would like to pursue? Are they asking about the
vacation spots you would like to visit, the sporting events you would like to attend? No, of course not. When
people ask about your plans postgraduation, they are asking about work. After you graduate, you will be faced
with a similar question: "What do you do in life?" or "What do you do for a living?" It is one of the first things
people ask when they meet someone new.
What do people mean when they ask what someone does for a living? Certainly, they are wondering what kind
of work that person does in order to meet basic needs for food, clothing, and shelter. But they are wondering
212  7 · Work, Life, and Value: Economic Anthropology

     more than just that. If someone answers, "I'm a circus clown," or "I'm a tax accountant," what does that reveal?
     Only where their paycheck comes from? Or does it also give some idea about where they live, what they eat,
     how they spend their days? Does it hint at what is important to that person? Of course, it can be misleading to
     generalize. But the way a person makes a living does often say something about that person's way of life.

     In some cases, the question of what a person does for a living is not just an individual matter but one for the
     whole society. In some societies, most people meet their basic needs by doing roughly the same thing. And
     even in societies where different people play different roles, there is a fundamental process for making and
     distributing things that people need and want. Economists and anthropologists agree that this is the most
     basic definition of an economy: the central way in which societies meet basic material needs and wants. More
     specifically, an economy is a system for making, circulating, and using things, including material goods,
     services, and information. Economic systems are shaped by ideas about the meaning and value of objects,
     actions, and people. In many economic systems, some groups gain control over the work and leisure of others,
     structuring relations of inequality that operate through techniques of discipline (in the realm of work) and
     persuasion (in the realm of consumption).

     Like nosy strangers at a cocktail party, anthropologists always want to know what people do for a living.
     Archaeologists are curious about how people in the past developed strategies for making a living in response
     to different environmental conditions and sociocultural pressures. Physical anthropologists are interested in
     how human biology evolved alongside ways of using the environment to meet basic needs. Cultural
     anthropologists study the social and cultural implications of different ways of making a living. And linguistic
     anthropologists focus on the roles of language, classification, and metaphor in shaping different strategies for
     making a living.

     This chapter takes a close look at the primary ways in which humans interact and have interacted with the
     environment to meet their basic needs, in the past and in the present day. This area of study is called economic
     anthropology.

     7.1 Economies: Two Ways to Study Them

     LEARNING OUTCOMES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       · Distinguish between economic anthropology and the discipline of economics.
       · Describe the universalist and normative approaches to studying economic issues.
       · Understand the importance of diversity, holism, environmentalism, and cultural relativism to economic
           anthropology.
       · Explain how economic anthropology foregrounds social groups and power relations.

     Maybe you've had a course on economics or read a book by an economist. There are many good ones. A
     favorite of the author of this chapter, Jennifer Hasty, is Capital in the Twenty-First Century, by the French
     economist Thomas Piketty. It is an unusual book for a contemporary economist to have written. In fact, it's
     almost anthropological.

     Most economics research is not very anthropological. Recall the three commitments of anthropology--in short,
     diversity, holism, and environmentalism. Across the four fields, anthropologists also value cultural relativism
     and reaching for an insider's point of view. When an anthropologist considers how societies, groups, and
     individuals make a living, they incorporate these commitments and values. Take a look at a few of the articles
     featured in the January 2021 issue of Economic Anthropology:

       · "Religious Networks and Small Businesses in Senegal"
       · "Honesty and Economy on a Highway: Entanglements of Gifts, Money, and Affection in the Narratives of

           Ukrainian Sex Workers"
       · "Gendering Human Capital Development in Western Alaska"
       · "`No trabajaré pa' ellos': Entrepreneurship as a Form of State Resistance in Havana, Cuba"

     Note the diversity of cultural contexts (the West African country of Senegal, the eastern European country of
     Ukraine, the North American state of Alaska, and the Central American island country of Cuba). Other articles

in this same issue focus on economic issues in Kentucky, Spain, Italy, China, and Colombia. The titles also
demonstrate an interest in linking ways of making a living to other aspects of society, such as religion, gender,
and political resistance. All are based on long-term fieldwork aimed at understanding the multiple
perspectives of local peoples and groups. Note also terms such as gendering and resistance, indicating an
anthropological interest in social groups and power relations.

Perhaps most importantly, the point of these articles is not to evaluate economic practices as better or worse
compared to an ideal. Rather, economic anthropologists analyze the cultural and historical features that shape
economic practices in different cultural contexts. As for environmentalism, this issue also features a
discussion by five anthropologists on the topic of what economic anthropology contributes to the
understanding of climate change. In this one issue, all of the central elements of anthropology are on full
display.

How is this approach different from the one taken by the discipline of economics? Compare Economic
Anthropology with a premier economics journal, the American Economic Review (AER). The January 2021
issue of AER features such articles as the following:

  · "Going Negative at the Zero Lower Bound: The Effects of Negative Nominal Interest Rates"
  · "The Distributional Consequences of Public School Choice"
  · "Politically Feasible Reforms of Nonlinear Tax Systems"
  · "Lack of Selection and Limits to Delegation: Firm Dynamics in Developing Countries"
  · "Job Seekers' Perceptions and Employment Prospects: Heterogeneity, Duration Dependence, and Bias"

The first thing you might notice in this list is the lack of any cultural context, with the one exception being the
vague reference to "developing countries." School choice where? Whose tax systems? Which job seekers?
Although some of these articles do specify the context in the article text, that detail is not considered a
sufficiently important part of the analysis to warrant inclusion in the title. This suggests that mainstream
economic analysis assumes that history and culture do not play a very strong role in economic issues such as
school choice, tax systems, and job seeking.

Economists tend toward universalism, which assumes that economic processes operate in much the same
way all over the world. In fact, a central concern of economics is to discover the universal principles that
govern economies anywhere and everywhere. Implicit in most economic analysis is the idea that most realms
of society work like markets, responding to universal forces of supply and demand. Moreover, economists view
people as self-interested, rational actors situated within the various market-driven realms of society.
Economists use statistics rather than fieldwork to evaluate these market-driven activities, sometimes
searching for best policies to encourage economic growth or discourage inequality. Most of the articles in the
January 2021 issue of the AER focus squarely on the economic realm, tracing relationships between factors
within this realm rather than reaching beyond it, as anthropologists tend to do.

And finally, in the January 2021 issue of the AER, there is no mention of environmental issues.

This comparison is not intended to denigrate the discipline of economics but rather to show the difference in
how anthropology frames economic issues. Anthropologists take a human-centered approach to economic
issues, describing what people think and do as they make a living and how their practices change over time.
Economists take a market-centered approach, describing how market mechanisms shape different areas of
human life and how those processes change over time.

7.2 Modes of Subsistence

LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Define modes of subsistence.
  · Describe the general elements of all modes of subsistence.
  · List the four main modes of subsistence humans have used to make a living.
  · Understand how each society has a predominant mode of subsistence but may also practice strategies from
      other modes.
214  7 · Work, Life, and Value: Economic Anthropology

     Anthropologists have a term for the way that people interact with their environments in order to make a living:
     mode of subsistence. There are four main modes of subsistence that have been used throughout human
     history: gathering-hunting, pastoralism, plant cultivation, and industrialism/post-industrialism. Each of these
     modes incorporates distinctive strategies for producing, exchanging, and consuming the things that people
     need to survive. At the most fundamental level are the basic necessities of food, clothing, shelter, and health.
     Modes of subsistence provide solutions to meet these needs by generating materials from the environment
     and developing techniques of labor and forms of technology to process those materials. Beyond these very
     important functions, modes of subsistence also organize society to get the necessary work done. Societies
     develop roles, groups, and institutions to divide up the workload of producing things. Modes of subsistence
     also entail specific ways of trading and circulating things within and beyond local groups. And finally, modes of
     subsistence emphasize certain ideals and values.

     This chapter will examine the four basic modes of subsistence one by one, including their development and a
     detailed ethnographic example of each. While each mode of subsistence is explored separately, it is important
     to recognize that most societies have a predominant mode of subsistence that incorporates various practices
     from other modes. The chapter also discusses the contemporary predicaments faced by many peoples
     practicing the first three strategies and why one might want to protect and support those economic lifeways.

     7.3 Gathering and Hunting

     LEARNING OUTCOMES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       · Define the subsistence strategy of hunting and gathering, also known as gathering-hunting.
       · Identify and distinguish gathering-hunting groups in prehistory and contemporary societies.
       · Articulate how gathering-hunting promotes certain other cultural forms.
       · Overturn assumptions about the supposed "hard life" of gathering-hunting groups.
       · Recognize the challenges facing most gathering-hunting groups today.

     Imagine that you were stripped of all possessions and transported to a grassland environment along with 30 or
     so other people. How would you begin to make a living? How would you find food and shelter? How would you
     keep your body comfortable and healthy? Throughout the millions of years of hominin evolution, those living
     in such environments practiced a strategy known as gathering-hunting. Some peoples still practice this
     flexible and congenial way of life. In gathering and hunting societies, people rely on the natural resources
     readily available in their environment. They gather fruits, nuts, berries, and roots and collect honey from wild
     bees. They hunt and trap wild animals, and they fish in rivers and lakes. Many gathering-hunting groups also
     engage in limited ways in other modes of subsistence, which will be examined later in the chapter, but their
     main way of making a living is through gathering and hunting.

     You might be surprised to see the word gathering appear before hunting in describing this subsistence
     strategy. The word order reflects a key debate about this subsistence strategy. Some researchers object to
     hunting and gathering because it privileges hunting as the most important activity of such groups. Early
     interest in these groups focused on the hunting activities of men as the most prestigious and valuable
     subsistence practices. In fact, gathering--done by both women and men--provides the vast majority of calories
     in the diets of such groups. This chapter will refer to this subsistence strategy as gathering-hunting and the
     people who practice it as gatherer-hunters.

     The Hadza: Gathering-Hunting as a Subsistence Strategy

     The Hadza of northern Tanzania are a resilient example of the way of life of gathering-hunting peoples as well
     as the contemporary challenges facing such groups. Like most gathering-hunting peoples, the Hadza
     traditionally lived in seminomadic groups of 20 to 30 people, called bands. About one-third of contemporary
     Hadza still practice this way of life. Hadza bands settle temporarily to gather and hunt the resources of a
     particular area, then move on to other areas in seasonal migrations. Sometimes, groups agglomerate into
     camps of several hundred to take advantage of seasonal foods such as berries.

     On most days, both men and women venture out into the savanna to gather food. Men seek out meat, honey,

7.3 · Gathering and Hunting                                                                                      215

and baobab fruit, while women gather tubers, berries, and greens. When work is assigned based on a person's
sex, anthropologists call this a sexual division of labor. In Hadza society, men and women do specialize in
obtaining different foods, but the division is not hard and fast; sometimes men pick berries, and sometimes
women gather honey.

FIGURE 7.2 Women of the Hazda cooking and socializing. The Hazda practice a traditional gathering-hunting
lifestyle. (credit: "Day 5 - Time with the Hadza tribe" by sueomstead/flickr, CC BY 2.0)

Women go out gathering in small groups, picking fruits by hand and using digging sticks to bring up edible
roots. They carry foods in grass baskets and leather pouches. People feed themselves throughout the day and
bring home foods to share with the whole band in the evenings.

Hadza men often hunt in pairs at dawn and dusk, using bows and arrows coupled with expert tracking skills.
They use animal ligaments for bowstrings and craft their arrows from wood and guinea fowl feathers. They use
the sap of the desert rose plant to poison their arrow tips. Back when the area was teeming with large animals,
hunters brought down zebras, giraffes, and buffalo. As the big game have diminished, they more often target
antelope, monkeys, and warthogs.

The Hadza have forged a mutually beneficial human-animal relationship to obtain honey, a highly valued food
that contributes 10 to 20 percent of the calories they consume. Hadza men whistle or strike trees to summon a
honeyguide, a gray-brown bird that eats beeswax. Hearing this summons, the bird calls back to the honey
hunter in a chattering response. Using this call-and-response, the honeyguide leads the hunter to a beehive.
Hunters use smoke to calm the bees while they cut into the hive to harvest the honeycomb. After eating some
of the honey on the spot, hunters then leave wax for the birds. Some honey is also brought back to camp to
share with other members of the band.

     FIGURE 7.3 Hadza men have forged a mutually beneficial relationship with this bird, known as a honeyguide. The

     honeycomb for the bird. (credit: "Lesser Honeyguide, Indicator minor, at Pilanesberg National Park, South Africa" by
     Derek Keats/flickr, CC BY 2.0)

     Like most gathering-hunting peoples, the Hadza are highly egalitarian, meaning that all people are considered
     equal and all resources are shared equally. Gathered foods brought back to the camp, including meat, are
     shared among all members of the band. Gathering-hunting groups deplore stinginess as the worst human
     fault, and people who refuse to share are met with gossip, ridicule, and even ostracism. Decisions are made
     through public discussions leading to group consensus. No person has any sort of leadership role. Rather,
     people with experience in certain areas of social knowledge provide their expertise as needed. In-group
     fighting is not common, but it does occur, sometimes leading to personal violence and even a split in the band
     if the conflict cannot be resolved. Violent conflict between groups is very rare among gatherer-hunters.

     The Sociocultural Complex of Gathering and Hunting

     Anthropologists have identified features of Hadza society as distinctive to gathering-hunting groups found all
     over the world. Groups such as the Martu and Pintupi in Australia, the Cuiva and Pumé in South America, the
     Paliyan and Kattunayakan in Asia, and the Inuit and Shoshone in North America have all constructed similar
     lifeways based on gathering and hunting (Lee 2018). The social features of this way of life include mobility,
     sexual division of labor, egalitarianism, and vast knowledge of their environments.
     The most common feature of gatherer-hunters is mobility. Such groups typically move in seasonal cycles over
     broad territories, regularly meeting up with other groups at specific spots such as water sources and patches of
     ripe vegetation. Bands tend to confine their subsistence activities to their own territories, but if faced with a
     scarcity of resources, they will commonly ask other groups for permission to gather and hunt in neighboring
     territories. These requests are facilitated by cross-band friendships and marriages that develop when bands
     camp together at certain times of the year. As a result, such requests are nearly always approved.
     The second feature common to gatherer-hunter societies is the sexual division of labor. Often, men do most or
     all of the hunting, though recent archaeological evidence suggests that some women also hunted in the past.
     Both women and men gather, but they often gather different things, and women bring home the majority of
     gathered foods. The relative equality of women in gatherer-hunter societies is linked to their primary role in
     supplying calories to the gatherer-hunter diet. Hunting is a prestige activity, however, giving prominence to
     men who are particularly successful hunters.

FIGURE 7.4 A Hadza man returns from a successful hunt. Like other gatherer-hunter societies, the Hadza utilize a
sexual division of labor, with women doing the bulk of the gathering and men doing most of the hunting. (credit:
"Success" by Anja Pietsch/flickr, CC BY 2.0)

The third feature of gatherer-hunters is a strong tendency toward egalitarianism. As they are so often on the
move, gatherer-hunters do not typically own many material possessions, and those they have are circulated
through the band on the basis of need. All gathered and hunted foods are shared among all members of the
band. Generosity is praised and admired. People are considered equal and are actively discouraged from
valuing themselves above others. Greed and excessive pride are stigmatized and punished with gossip and
criticism. People who fight or refuse to share can be ostracized from the band.

These are broad generalities. The gatherer-hunter mode of subsistence commonly coordinates with these
sociocultural features, but some groups do provide exceptions. In particularly productive environments,
gatherer-hunters can settle down in one place for periods of time. The year-round availability of fish allows
gatherer-hunter groups in coastal or riverine areas to form permanent or semipermanent settlements. Diet
and labor patterns also vary. Closer to the equator, gatherer-hunter groups rely more on gathering because
plants are plentiful year-round. Farther from the equator, in cooler climates, vegetation is scarce in winter, and
gatherer-hunters rely more on hunting. Degrees of inequality and conflict also vary somewhat, often in
association with the availability of resources. Situations of scarcity often generate social conflict. While one can
describe a general mode of subsistence, it is important to acknowledge the diversity of strategies and features
within this mode.

All gatherer-hunters, however, absolutely must possess deep knowledge of the plants, animals, and sources of
water in their environments. Many gatherer-hunters can identify over a hundred sources of plant and animal
foods in their environments, along with detailed information about where and when they can find each type.
Often, they rely on a few staple foods that are readily available year-round. When the Dobe Ju/'hoansi of the
Kalahari Desert cannot find other foods, they count on mongongo nuts, a highly nutritious, drought-resistant
food. Eating 300 mongongo nuts (a hefty serving) supplies 1,200 calories and 56 grams of protein. At certain
times of the year, mongongo nuts constitute nearly half of the diet of the Dobe Ju/'hoansi.

Contemporary Challenges to Gathering and Hunting Societies

Originally, all Hadza lived as foragers. In the early 20th century, the British colonial government attempted to
convert them to farming and Christianity, but the Hadza successfully resisted. Since the 1950s, however,
farmers and herders have claimed their territory, making the Hadza squatters on land they have occupied for
millennia. The plants they rely on for food have been clear-cut to make way for the onion and sweet potato
crops planted by farming groups. Hadza watering holes have been appropriated for irrigation. The Tanzanian
government has responded with yet another attempt to settle the Hadza, building villages on their lands and
218  7 · Work, Life, and Value: Economic Anthropology

     attempting to convert them to farming. About two-thirds of all Hadza people now live part-time in these
     villages, where they receive donations of food from the government. They live in poverty on the land stolen
     from them by their farming and herding neighbors, who discriminate against them as troublesome primitives.
     Many Hadza now farm for part of the year and then leave their villages to engage in gathering-hunting for
     several months.

     Over the past few years, however, the Hadza have won several victories in their struggle to regain control over
     their lands. In 2007, the local government leased 6,500 square kilometers of Hadza land to the royal family of
     the United Arab Emirates for use as a "personal safari playground." Removed from the land and confined to a
     government reservation, the Hadza protested, and some resisters were imprisoned. Their campaign against
     the deal was supported by a coalition of local and international groups. The controversy garnered attention in
     the global news media, and the government eventually rescinded the deal. In 2011, the Hadza asserted a claim
     to 57,000 hectares of land, and the Tanzanian government consented, granting them title to this land. It was
     the first time the Tanzanian government had ever recognized the land rights of gathering-hunting peoples.

     Like the Hadza, all contemporary gathering and hunting groups face economic and political pressures that
     threaten their way of life. Herders and farmers encroach on their territories, leasing or purchasing their lands
     and then forcibly evicting the original inhabitants. Local and national governments attempt to settle such
     groups in permanent villages in order to establish their own rule of law, collect taxes, provide education and
     medical care, and assimilate them as citizens. Often, gathering-hunting groups agree to settle and then, after a
     while, abandon the villages established for them and escape to their lands to resume a gathering-hunting
     lifestyle. Many Hadza say they love living close to nature, making their own material culture, and working and
     resting at will, always on the move.

     The Original Affluent Society: Comparing Ancient and Contemporary Foragers

     In agricultural and industrial societies, people often assume that gathering-hunting peoples must live a hard
     life, oppressed by the struggle to find enough food and plagued by malnutrition and poor health.
     Archaeologists and cultural anthropologists who have studied gathering and hunting groups have found
     otherwise. Researchers have discovered that gatherer-hunters have stronger bones, lower blood pressure, and
     less heart disease than neighboring farmers, likely due to the amount of walking they do and the abundance of
     fruits, nuts, and vegetables in their diets (American Heart Association 2012; University of Cambridge 2014). In
     his ethnographic work among the Dobe Ju/'hoansi, anthropologist Richard Lee found that they worked on
     average three to four days a week obtaining food and spent the rest of their time socializing and enjoying life.
     He described the Dobe Ju/'hoansi as fit, healthy, and free of nutritional deficits (1993). Indeed, some Hadza
     have remarked that the notion of famine is unknown to their culture. While Harvard economist John Kenneth
     Galbraith has referred to the wealthy industrial economy of the United States as "the affluent society,"
     anthropologist Marshall Sahlins describes the gathering and hunting lifestyle as "the original affluent society."

     For some 95 percent of evolutionary history, humans and human ancestors relied on gathering and hunting to
     make a living. In evolutionary terms, it is only very recently that humans have established other modes of
     subsistence. Farming was invented around 12,000 years ago, far too recently to have shaped humans'
     biological evolution very much. By contrast, hominins were practicing gathering and hunting for more than
     two million years. If humans have evolved to practice any lifestyle, it would be gathering-hunting. This
     suggests that humans' brains and bodies might be best suited to the lifestyle described by ethnographers who
     study gathering-hunting groups: long walks in nature; a diet of mostly fruits, nuts, and vegetables; and plenty
     of leisure time to relax and talk. Maybe humanity's ancestors were as robust and happy in their way of life as
     many contemporary foragers. Maybe.

     The problem with this sort of thinking is that people today really don't know what life was like for humanity's
     gathering-hunting ancestors. The archaeological record of fossils and artifacts can reveal much about the diet
     and diseases of early hominins, but they tell very little about early social structures and cultural values. Some
     anthropologists have looked to contemporary gathering and hunting groups to understand the way of life of
     humanity's ancestors. Maybe they, like contemporary gatherer-hunter peoples, lived in egalitarian bands with
     group decision-making and a flexible division of labor based on gender, valuing sharing and deploring
     stinginess. Certainly, they must have had impressive knowledge of the resources and dangers in their

environments.

And yet it is a mistake to view the way of life of contemporary gathering-hunting societies as examples of the
way of life of humans' evolutionary ancestors. Groups such as the Hadza are not frozen in time, practicing a
static lifeway of the deep past, but rather constantly changing and innovating, blending new ideas and
practices with older ones just as farmers, herders, and industrialists do. Most contemporary gathering-hunting
groups have lived side by side with farming and herding groups for centuries, often trading with those groups
and even experimenting with their subsistence methods from time to time. Most gatherer-hunters have been
forced to relocate to less advantageous lands due to the encroachment of these herders and farmers. The
culture of many gatherer-hunter groups has been shaped by their incorporation as marginalized minorities in
larger nation-states such as Tanzania. As the way of life of contemporary gatherer-hunters has changed so
dramatically just in the past century, it's difficult to draw firm conclusions about human evolutionary history
based on their example.

7.4 Pastoralism

LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Describe the process of animal domestication.
  · List the array of practices associated with the subsistence strategy of pastoralism.
  · Identify the cultural features associated with the herding way of life.
  · Provide a detailed example of a pastoralist society.
  · Discuss the challenges facing contemporary pastoralist societies.

In many gathering and hunting societies, bands follow herds of wild game as they move in seasonal
migrations. Researchers speculate that such hunting practices may have led to the development of a new
subsistence pattern around 10,000 to 12,000 years ago. Relying on their expert knowledge of the behavior and
biology of game animals, hunters might have begun to control the movement of wild herds, steering the
animals to territories that might be especially rich in grazing resources or conducive to certain hunting
strategies. These new practices may have been a response to the diminishing of key game species due to
overhunting, prompting hunters to devise strategies to enhance the animals' diet and reproduction.

This human-animal relationship may have deepened over time as people discovered the nutritional resources
available from live animals, such as milk and blood. Rather than killing an animal for meat, early herders
figured out how to benefit from live animals and guide their reproduction to enlarge the herds. They began to
selectively breed the healthiest and heartiest animals in their herds. They learned how to process animal
products such as milk, hides, and hooves for use as food, textiles, and tools, and some used dung to fuel their
fires. This process is called animal domestication. Humans in different environments domesticated a wide
range of prey animals, including sheep, goats, cattle, water buffalo, yaks, pigs, reindeer, llamas, and alpacas.

Pastoralism is the mode of subsistence associated with the care and use of domesticated herd animals.
Pastoralism shares many features with gathering-hunting, in particular the practice of ranging over a broad
territory in seasonal cycles. Indeed, as they move with their herds to optimal grazing lands, many pastoral
peoples gather fruits and nuts or occasionally hunt small game. Unlike gathering and hunting, however,
herding promotes a sense of ownership over resources, as families develop close relationships with specific
herds. Rather than sharing resources as foragers do, pastoralists consider their herds to be family property.
Herds associated with a family are passed down to subsequent generations, most frequently from fathers to
sons.

Archaeologists believe that pastoralism was developed around the same time as farming. In many regions, the
two subsistence strategies are practiced by neighboring groups in symbiotic relations of trade. Often, a group
will combine pastoralism with farming. Where rain is plentiful and soils are rich for cultivation, farming is
used to take advantage of these resources. Pastoralism is utilized in areas with more marginal soils or
unpredictable rainfall, conditions not optimal for farming but able to support herd animals if they are moved
regularly to newly grown pastures and freshwater sources. Pastoralists who don't farm usually trade meat,
milk, and other animal products for the grains and vegetables grown by neighboring farmers. Most
220  7 · Work, Life, and Value: Economic Anthropology

     contemporary pastoralists find it necessary to supplement their diet of animal products with the vitamins and
     carbohydrates in cultivated plant foods and are able to do so through small farming and trade.

     The Bedouin: Flexible Pastoralism

     Across the dry grasslands of Arabia and northern Africa live about three million Arab peoples collectively
     known as the Bedouin. Before the 20th century, Bedouin peoples made their living primarily by herding
     camels, sheep, goats, and cattle. Many still do, although they often cultivate crops or work as wage laborers as
     well. Among those Bedouin still devoted to herding, most specialize in one or two herd animals particularly
     suited to the climate and available pastures in their environment. In areas around Jordan, Syria, and Iraq,
     sheep and goats are preferred, while cattle are kept by Bedouin groups in southern Arabia and Sudan. In very
     dry regions such as the Sahara and the Arabian Deserts, Bedouin groups herd camels, hardy animals with
     scant need for water. Camels are valued as transport but also for their high-quality milk and tasty meat. Camel
     herding, though a prized tradition, is becoming increasingly rare among Bedouin. Bedouin supplement their
     camels' diet with feed, and many have been forced to sell off their camels as the price of feed rises. Since the
     1960s, trucks and cars have replaced camels as a means of transportation for the Bedouin, sometimes used to
     bring food and water to herds in arid regions.

     FIGURE 7.5 A herd of goats relaxes at a Bedouin camp near Jericho, in what is now the West Bank. Bedouin
     peoples rely on herding animals - such as camels, sheep, cattle, and goats - for meat, milk, and fiber. (credit:
     "Bedouin Goats 1557" by James Emery/flickr, CC BY 2.0)
     Bedouin pastoralists have traditionally lived in small camps that are moved as frequently as needed to find
     fresh pastures for their herds, sometimes as often as every few days. This form of herding is called nomadism.
     Each camp consists of several tents, each one housing an extended family. Typically, a tent might house a
     married couple with their children and one or two siblings of the husband. Within the camp, several tents
     might house people who are related to each other, as sons marry and establish their own tents. For instance, a
     camp could comprise 70 to 100 people, including the families of several brothers, each tent housing the family
     of a brother, a son, or an elder. Often, the families of the camp move together during the summer months, then
     converge with other groups in larger camps during the winter months. Camps usually consist of 3 to 15 tents.

FIGURE 7.6 A Bedouin tent in Jordan. Tents can be quickly constructed and easily transported, making them the
perfect home for those practicing a lifestyle that requires frequent movement. (credit: "Bedouin Camp" by young
shanahan/flickr, CC BY 2.0)
Instead of ranging freely, other Bedouin have traditionally moved their herds between two permanent
settlements, one for the summer months and the other for winter. This pattern of pastoralism is known as
transhumance. In societies that practice this form of subsistence today, young children and the elderly often
remain in permanent camps year-round, benefiting from government health care and schools. Some Bedouin
use transhumance to combine herding with small farming. For instance, some Egyptian Bedouin plant barley
in the fall and then move with their herds into the desert, leaving behind a few people to tend to the crops. In
the summer, the mobile group returns to harvest the crops, and the entire group spends the summer together.
Stone houses have replaced tents in many permanent camps. Both tents and houses are rectangular, divided
into two or three rooms. One area is for women, with a kitchen and storeroom. One area is primarily for men,
where guests and relatives are entertained. Sometimes, a third area is devoted to the care of sick or young
animals.
Like gatherer-hunters, pastoralists divide work according to a sexual division of labor. For the Bedouin, that
division is determined by the types of animals herded by the group. When both large and small animals are
kept, men take responsibility for larger animals, such as camels and cattle. Women herd, feed, and milk
smaller animals, such as goats and sheep. But when only small animals are herded by a group, men usually do
the herding, while women do the feeding and milking. Where sheep are kept, women spin the wool into yarn,
then weave it into strips used to make tents.

FIGURE 7.7 A Bedouin woman working at a loom. Spinning and weaving are tasks typically assigned to women in
222  7 · Work, Life, and Value: Economic Anthropology

     Bedouin societies. (credit: "Weaving Demonstration" by Alan Kotok/flickr, CC BY 2.0)

     Unlike foragers, pastoralists strongly value private property, primarily in the form of their herds. The wealth of
     a family is judged by the size of their herds. Bedouin sons and daughters both inherit herd animals from their
     fathers, though sons receive more than daughters. Because women are barred from caring for large animals, if
     a woman inherits camels, she usually entrusts them to a brother or cousin. All property is shared among
     members of the family.

     Bedouin who live in desert regions have extensive knowledge of their challenging environment. They have a
     large vocabulary for describing different kinds of sand and analyzing dune shapes and other changes in their
     surroundings (Eastep). Men often go on long drives through the desert, scouting out good grazing spots or
     looking for rabbits to hunt. Arabian Bedouin are expert trackers, able to judge the age and physical condition of
     a camel from its tracks as well as when the track was laid and the weight of the animal's burden.

     The Sociocultural Complex of Pastoralism

     As with gathering-hunting, the subsistence mode of pastoralism is coordinated with particular sociocultural
     features. First and foremost, these are cultures that revolve around herd animals. All aspects of culture are
     shaped by a preoccupation with herds. The size of a family's herds is a measure of wealth and social status.
     Animals are used for meat, milk, blood, cloth, and leather. Animals are gifted to cement social relationships
     such as marriage and slaughtered to commemorate special occasions or the visit of an honored guest. Animals
     are passed down from fathers to children, establishing the social position and durability of families. Many
     pastoralist societies have vibrant traditions of music and oral poetry celebrating their animals and their
     herding lifestyle.

     A second feature of pastoral societies is mobility. When herding is the primary livelihood, the group must
     constantly be on the move. Many agricultural societies also keep domestic animals, but in these cases, the
     people and their animals stay put on the farm, as crops are the fundamental means of survival. Therefore,
     farmers tend to have many fewer animals than herders. With larger herds feeding from what are often
     marginal lands, pastoralists must drive their animals to fresh pastures on a regular basis, often in seasonal
     cycles over large rangelands. The mobile life of herding groups is structured by various strategies of nomadism
     and transhumance, as with Bedouin groups. Mobility discourages the accumulation of private property other
     than herd animals, further enhancing the value of animals to herding groups.

     Third, pastoralists rely on a division of labor based on gender and age. And the workload is heavy. Those living
     in pastoralist societies must herd animals to good pasture, provide them with water, search for new pastures,
     protect animals from predators, care for sick and weak animals, process animal products such as meat and
     milk, and produce or obtain all the other elements of material culture necessary for daily life (Bollig 2018).
     Day-to-day herding is often carried out by boys, while older men take on more complex tasks such as providing
     water from hard-to-access wells and hunting down predators (Homewood 2018). Older men also manage
     herds, buying and selling animals to optimize ratios of male to female, old to young. And men settle arguments
     and make family decisions about resources and security. Women are frequently responsible for milking
     animals, processing milk products such as cheese and yogurt, and selling those products in local markets.
     Women and girls make tents and mats, set up and break down camps, gather firewood and wild foods, and do
     the cooking. Women also care for sick animals and people, maintaining the store of knowledge about available
     plant medicines.

     The fourth feature of herding societies is a vast store of knowledge about animals and the environment.
     Pastoralists have developed an intimate understanding of the vegetation and water sources necessary for their
     herds as well as medicinal and edible plants available in different zones of their rangelands. They have deep
     insight into the anatomy and behavior of their herd animals. They know the qualities associated with different
     species and how to mix species by gender and age to maintain the availability of animal products such as milk,
     meat, and wool. Previously, scholars thought that pastoralism was destructive to the environment because of
     overgrazing. In recent decades, however, studies have demonstrated that herding groups strategically rotate
     their herds across their rangelands to control the impact on the environment, creating a sustainable way of
     life.

Contemporary Challenges to Pastoralism

Like many pastoralists, the Bedouin require large tracts of land to continually provide fresh grazing for their
herds. Families are associated with defined territories and rarely go beyond them. The nation-states that
encompass Bedouin territories do not recognize their right to ownership, however, and consider those lands
state-owned. Eager to control this land, governments have asserted various policies to settle the Bedouin,
providing schools and health clinics in order to lure them away from their nomadic pastoral lifestyle.

In Egypt, for instance, the government has seized desirable coastal areas from Bedouin groups and sold the
land to investors who want to build hotels for the tourism industry. In 1999, the Egyptian army bulldozed a
tourist campground run by local Bedouin in order to clear the way for a hotel. The Tourism Development
Authority claimed that the Bedouin had only recently lived on the coastal lands and so did not have any right to
remain there. In Israel, the government often destroys Bedouin camps and villages in order to make way for
settlements and military zones. In November 2020, Israeli soldiers demolished Bedouin structures in the
occupied West Bank. Tens of thousands of Bedouin have been displaced by such demolitions and banished
from their grazing territories.

Pressured by government regulations and military interventions, many Bedouin now live settled lives in
villages and cities across North Africa and the Middle East. Many combine sedentary herding with small
farming. Some work as taxi drivers or managers of cafés or campgrounds. Some have become wealthy by
investing in the tourist economy and other ventures. Many speak nostalgically of their nomadic way of life and
sometimes venture out into the desert again to pasture their herds.

enforcement. Tens of thousands of Bedouin have been displaced by the nation-states that now encompass Bedouin
territory. (credit: Eman/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)

The predicament of the Bedouin is shared by many contemporary pastoralists. Climate change has made
rainfall increasingly unpredictable, threatening the sustainability of grazing herds on marginal lands.
Governments and global investors are eager to gain control over land in order to cultivate crops or create
tourist attractions and conservation zones (Homewood 2018). Some governments have sought to formalize
land ownership among pastoralist groups, creating a competition among groups and individuals to gain title to
collective rangelands (Galaty 2015). In some places, such as Botswana, elite groups of herders have seized
control over land, making life difficult for small herders.

Some nomadic pastoral groups, such as the Wodaabe of West Africa, have cultivated their distinctive cultural
practices as forms of heritage to be protected by human rights organizations or otherwise marketed to tourists.
Welcoming researchers and filmmakers to study their unique dances, the Wodaabe have been the subject of
over 17 documentary films. Spectacular images of the elaborate dress, costume, and face paint of Wodaabe
224  7 · Work, Life, and Value: Economic Anthropology

     dancers have been featured on the cover of National Geographic, Elle magazine, a World Bank brochure, and
     several CD and album covers (Kratz 2018). Some Wodaabe groups perform their ceremonies for audiences of
     European tourists. In their geerewol and yaake dances, groups of young men compete to be selected as the
     most beautiful dancers by the young women judges. While such involvement in tourism can provide income to
     impoverished pastoral groups, many anthropologists worry about the commodification of culture and the
     exploitation of marginal groups for privileged Western audiences.

     Some question the future viability of pastoralism as a way of life, suggesting that it might give way to more
     sedentary forms of ranching. But the transition to ranching would require huge investments of labor and
     money in necessities such as fencing, feed supplements, veterinary care, permanent wells, trucks, mobile
     phones, and even airplanes. If herding is practiced in harmony with the environment without these costly
     inputs, pastoralism may continue to provide a sustainable way of life.

     7.5 Plant Cultivation: Horticulture and Agriculture

     LEARNING OUTCOMES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       · Identify and distinguish horticulture and agriculture as distinct subsistence strategies of plant cultivation.
       · Describe the cultural forms associated with horticulture and agriculture.
       · Trace the connection between the development of agriculture and the development of villages, towns, and
           cities.

     Many thousands of years ago, one of humanity's ancestors might have spied a sprout emerging from a refuse
     pile of pits, nuts, and seeds. Perhaps it was a lightbulb moment: "Hmm, I wonder if I could do that on
     purpose...." Or maybe it was somebody who dug up a plant and moved it closer to camp: "Genius! Now I don't
     have to walk so far!" Somehow, people discovered that they need not rely on the whims of nature to provide
     them with plants; rather, they could grow the plants they wanted in places more convenient to them. This basic
     manipulation of nature is called cultivation, and gather-hunters were experimenting with it for thousands of
     years before the development of farming.

     The real revolution happened when people began to design their whole way of life around the sowing, tending,
     and harvesting of plant crops, depending primarily on those crops as sources of food. By planting the seeds of
     the most desirable plants, humans began to alter the features of those plants over generations of sowing and
     harvesting. This process of plant domestication first took hold around 10,000 to 12,000 years ago, possibly
     spurred by the warming climate after the last ice age. As plants became bigger, tastier, more nutritious, and
     easier to grow, larger groups of people could be supported by permanent gardens with no need to migrate.
     Eventually, some people didn't have to farm at all and could specialize in crafts such as pottery, metalwork,
     basketry, and textiles. Markets emerged as farmers, herders, and craftspeople became entwined in symbiotic
     relations of trade. Villages grew into towns and cities and, eventually, regional empires. This might all seems
     like a great leap forward in human development, and indeed it was a big transformation, but farming came
     with its share of drawbacks as well.

     Archaeologists used to believe that agriculture was separately invented in three primary regions of the world:
     the Fertile Crescent of the Middle East (11,000 years ago), northern China (9,000 years ago), and Mesoamerica
     (8,000 years ago). Each of these regions featured the domestication of grains as carbohydrate sources. These
     grains were combined with lentils and beans as sources of protein, along with meat obtained through trade
     with neighboring pastoral groups. In the Middle East, wheat, barley, peas, and lentils were cultivated. In China,
     millet, rice, and beans were grown. It is now known that farming was independently invented in many other
     regions as well (Bellwood 2019). In addition to the three already mentioned, plants were domesticated in sub-
     Saharan Africa, India, New Guinea, South America, and the eastern woodlands of North America.

     Two Methods of Cultivation: Extensive Horticulture and Intensive Agriculture

     The first form of farming that humans developed is known as extensive horticulture. Before a plot of land can
     be cultivated for the first time, the trees and vegetation must be cleared away, an arduous task usually done by
     men. Sometimes, a strategy called slash and burn is used, which involves cutting down the trees and shrubs

     Access for free at openstax.org
7.5 · Plant Cultivation: Horticulture and Agriculture                                                                  225

and burning the rest to the ground, then tilling the ash into the soil as fertilizer. Using digging sticks and hoes,
horticultural farmers cultivate the top layer of soil before they sow. As seedlings sprout, they water them and
feed them with natural fertilizers such as animal dung, and they weed the gardens regularly.

Horticultural societies plant not just one crop but many. They have learned that certain plants are
"friends"--that is, they enhance one another's growth--and so they plant these crops side by side. This is
practice is known as intercropping. For instance, in Mesoamerica, squash, corn, and beans were planted
closely together in flat-topped mounds, a combination known as the "three sisters." Several corn plants were
planted first, in the center of the mound. Once the corn seedlings were well established, squash and beans
were planted at their base. As they grew, the corn plants provided stalks for the vining bean plants to climb.
The bean plants contributed nitrogen to the soil, fertilizing the other two plants. The squash plants spread
across the ground, blocking weeds and protecting the root systems of all three. Typically, societies practicing
extensive horticulture have vast knowledge of such sustainable farming methods. These techniques are
natural ways to optimize the health and yield of each plant while providing a variable and balanced diet
throughout the year.

FIGURE 7.9 In a "three sisters" plot, corn, squash and beans are grown together. Each plant benefits the other.

Incorporating organic methods of fertilization and pest control, horticulture is a sustainable form of farming.
Over time, however, this method does deplete the nutrients in the top layer of soil. After a certain number of
seasons growing crops on a particular plot, it becomes necessary to let that plot lie fallow. When horticultural
farmers let a plot lie fallow, they stop cultivating it and let the grasses and brush grow in naturally, which
promotes the accumulation of fresh nutrients in the soil. Plots can be left to lie fallow for as little as one season
or as many as 20. While one plot regenerates, the farmer moves on to clear, till, and sow another plot for
cultivation. Horticulturalists often have several plots of land in various stages of fallow and cultivation. This
method of rotating crops over various plots of land is called extensive or shifting cultivation, as it involves
multiple plots over large areas. Horticulture farmers usually have a variety of plots with distinctive soils and
climate features, and they tailor specific farming strategies, including crop species, fertilizers, watering
methods, and farming-fallow cycles, for each one.

Often in horticultural societies, land is not owned as private property but held in trust by family heads or
village leaders who allocate plots of land to individuals. People have the right to use the land assigned to them
but not to own or sell it, a practice known as usufruct rights. These rights to use certain plots are passed down
through families, via either the father or the mother. When newcomers move into an area, they may approach
the leader to ask for plots of land to farm. In many African societies, it is also common for people to loan out
their plots to one another in gestures of friendship and mutual aid.
226  7 · Work, Life, and Value: Economic Anthropology

     Extensive horticulture typically provides enough resources to support extended-family households, perhaps
     with a bit left over to sell in local markets. This amount left over after the needs of the family are met is called
     surplus. The modest surplus of horticulturalists is sometimes accumulated by families or village leaders in
     silos or other structures, held in safekeeping for community use in the lean months before the next crops can
     be harvested. Horticulture does not usually generate enough surplus to support groups of people who do not
     farm. Craftspeople, religious specialists, and group leaders must all carry on farming alongside these other
     important activities.

     Extensive horticulture provides a good way to cultivate crops on land that is not particularly rich with
     nutrients. Tropical climates tend to have such soils due to the lack of winter dormancy. In temperate zones (23
     to 66 degrees latitude), vegetation dies off in the autumn, depositing dead matter into the soil, which then
     decomposes into a rich substance called humus (hyoo-mus). Humus is essentially built-in fertilizer, feeding
     new plants as they grow in spring and summer. Because vegetation does not ever die off in tropical areas,
     tropical soils do not accumulate humus to the extent that temperate soils do. With less humus, it is more
     advantageous to use a plot of land a few times, then let the natural vegetation grow back. Slashing and burning
     regrowth is a way for tropical farmers to mimic the natural die-off of vegetation in temperate climates.

     In climates with warm and cold seasons, the layer of humus-rich soil is much denser and thicker than in
     tropical regions. In these areas, it is advantageous to dig deeper to prepare soils for sowing, distributing the
     layer of humus into a thicker layer of soil to serve as a reservoir of nutrients for the new plants.

     The seasonal deposit of nutrients in the soil also happens in areas surrounding large rivers that flood and
     recede in a yearly cycle. Along the Nile in North Africa and between the Tigris and Euphrates in the Middle
     East, ancient farmers were able to use the same soils over and over again as the rivers helpfully dumped
     organic matter onto their farmlands every year. Riverine farmers learned to control flows of water, creating
     systems of irrigation to continually water their crops. Sumerian farmers in the Mesopotamian crescent
     between the Tigris and Euphrates were the first to use the plow, using oxen to pull large blades through their
     garden plots. Plowing makes the soil even richer for planting.

     The use of a plow, the development of irrigation systems, and the continuous cultivation of the same plots are
     part of a way of farming called intensive agriculture. A good way to remember the difference between
     extensive and intensive cultivation is to think about how extensive farming involves farming multiple plots
     over extensive territory, while intensive farming involves applying intensive methods to the same plots over
     and over again. Intensive agriculture generates much greater yields than horticulture, supporting far larger
     populations. Greater yields mean greater surplus, which means that societies practicing intensive agriculture
     generate groups of people who don't need to farm, such as specialists in craft production, trade, religion, and

government.

Farmers who practice intensive agriculture focus on a small number of crops, frequently grains or legumes.
They use the surplus generated from intensive methods to trade for other foods, tools, and material goods to
meet the needs of their households.

Most people use the word agriculture to mean plant cultivation of any kind. For anthropologists, however,
agriculture is just one form of plant cultivation--the kind involving intensive methods such as plows, draft
animals, irrigation systems, and repeated use of plots. This chapter uses the term plant cultivation to refer to
both extensive horticulture and intensive agriculture. References to specific types of cultivation use the terms
extensive horticulture and intensive agriculture.

The Kayapó: Flexible Horticulture

In the eastern Amazonian rainforest, beside the Xingu River, live a group of people known by their neighbors
as the Kayapó. Mixing slash-and-burn horticulture with gathering and hunting and some animal
domestication, the Kayapó have created an ingenious and flexible way of life that carefully cultivates the
resources of the rainforest, savanna, and intermediate zones (Posey 2002).

Like most farming societies, the Kayapó rely on a small set of staple carbohydrate crops, including sweet
potato, manioc, maize, and taro. Every three to five years, they clear new plots for their gardens, leaving the old
plots fallow. Rather than passively letting the old plots regenerate, however, the Kayapó plant fruit trees,
medicinal plants, and other desirable vegetation that keep the plots productive throughout the fallow period.
They also transplant edible and medicinal plants alongside the paths that serve as transit routes throughout
their territory. The Kayapó venture out on these paths in gathering-and-hunting expeditions that supplement
their farming endeavors during part of the year. Women gather fruits, nuts, and berries, and men hunt
armadillos, deer, anteaters, and wild pigs. Like the Hadza, the Kayapó regularly harvest honey, the sweet treat
of the forest. Another delicacy is the tortoise, slaughtered in large numbers for special festivals. The Kayapó
also fish with bows and arrows as well as nets and plant-based poison. Sometimes, women stay in the village
while men go hunting or fishing.

Because they farm, the Kayapó live in villages for most of the year. Extended-family houses are situated in a
circle surrounding a central public space with a men's house in the center. Social activities are coordinated by
groups based on gender, age, and extended family. Most villages have two men's societies, each one associated
with a women's society. When a boy becomes a man, he chooses which society he wants to join, usually that of
his intended father-in-law. After he marries, his wife joins the women's society associated with her husband's
group. Each society has its own leader and meeting place.

     Kayapó life is organized according to seasons. Planting is done in the "low water" season, and farming
     continues until harvest. After this, wild fruits ripen, attracting game for the hunting season, the "high water"
     time. This is followed by a period of leisure, family activities, and increased fishing. Then, a new year begins.
     Kayapó culture marks these seasons with a calendar of ceremonies. Festivals celebrate the farming and
     hunting seasons, and specific rituals are performed to promote the success of these subsistence methods.

     The Kayapó are deeply knowledgeable about their environment and work diligently to cultivate the diversity of
     flora and fauna in the various ecological zones of their territory. In addition to an impressive store of general
     knowledge, each village has individuals with expertise in soils, plants, animals, and medicines. The Kayapó
     identify many different micro-zones within the continuum between forest and savanna, associating each zone
     with a distinct set of interrelated plants, animals, and soil types. They attract certain species of game for
     hunting by sowing specific plants in specific areas. For farming, they use ground cover such as plants, logs,
     leaves, straw, and bark to adjust the moisture, shade, and temperature of soils. They fertilize certain crops with
     the ash of specific plants, making use of the vegetation cleared and weeded in farming. They meticulously
     design their gardens in concentric circles to provide optimal light and water to each species of plant, and they
     practice complex forms of intercropping of plants that benefit one another. For instance, several plants are
     considered "banana neighbors," good to plant next to bananas. Among these is a plant called "child-want-not,"
     a plant used by Kayapó women to regulate fertility.

     In open areas, the Kayapó create small areas of special diversity called apêtê, or "forest islands." To create an
     apêtê, they first spread a layer of organic matter, such as termite nests, then sow seeds and transplants of
     useful trees and plants in the mound of nutrient-rich soil. As the plants grow, the Kayapó cut down the highest
     trees in the center to provide more light throughout the apêtê. The result is a store of medicinal and edible
     plants as well as a nice, shady place to rest in the middle of an open field. Sometimes, apêtê include vines that
     produce potable water, providing a sort of drinking fountain for people as they travel about the territory.

     The nurturing of plant biodiversity is important to the practice of medicine among the Kayapó. They identify
     and cultivate hundreds of plants used to treat specific ailments such as diarrhea, scorpion stings, and
     snakebites. They organize their knowledge of both illnesses and plants in complex classificatory schemes. The
     Kayapó identify 50 separate types of diarrhea and treat each one with a specific plant medicine.

     The Kayapó are also masters of zoology. They study the anatomy and behavior of the animals in their
     environment and use that knowledge for hunting and farming. For instance, when a garden is infested with
     leaf-cutting ants, Kayapó farmers deliberately plant nests of smelly ants around the plot. The pheromones of
     the smelly ants scare away the destructive leaf-cutting ants. Smelly ants can also be crushed and inhaled as a
     medicine to clear the sinuses.

     The Kayapó keep many pets, including birds, snakes, spiders, and various mammals. One survey found more
     than 60 species of animal kept as pets in one village alone! Children are encouraged to observe the behavior of
     their pets to learn as much as possible.

The Kayapó have developed a vast store of knowledge about their surroundings, and they use that knowledge
to promote plant and animal biodiversity and nurture their environment. Some anthropologists suggest that
industrialized societies could learn much about environmental management and ecological sustainability
from horticultural groups such as the Kayapó.

The Sociocultural Complex of Plant Cultivation

As with the Kayapó, horticulture is often combined with gathering and hunting and even pastoralism to form a
flexible, sustainable, and highly successful subsistence strategy. Many societies practicing intensive
agriculture also forage and keep animals on the side, although they spend much less time gathering and
hunting. As they come to rely more and more on their crops, farming peoples settle down to form permanent
villages. Frequently, as with the Kayapó, those villages consist of extended-family houses with a central area
for public meetings. Most villages consist of several extended families, each with its own family leader or set of
elders. As agricultural methods intensify, it becomes necessary for families to cooperate in the development of
irrigation schemes, trade networks, and the allocation and protection of land. Forms of community leadership
and group decision-making emerge to organize these activities. Those political forms will be discussed in the
next chapter.

Plant cultivation requires a lot of work, substantially more than gathering-hunting. Clearing small trees and
brush for new garden plots is backbreaking work, followed by the physical challenges of tilling, sowing,
watering, weeding, controlling pests, and (hopefully) harvesting. Throughout the year, crops must be either
processed for market or household meals or made into something useful. Tools such as hoes, scythes, and
plows must be bought or made and constantly maintained. Where used, plows and draft animals require daily
care. In order to get all of this work done, agricultural societies rely on the labor of extended families, with
chores divvied up by gender and age.

Often, men are responsible for clearing land, while women do the sowing as well as the daily work of weeding
and watering. Children help with garden chores, often charged with carrying water or scaring away the birds
and small mammals that scavenge crops. Men make and maintain tools and also tend to draft animals, while
women process materials for home consumption, such as food and craft items. Women make pottery, baskets,
clothing, and shoes (until this work is taken over by craftspeople). Girls are put to work as babysitters, taking
care of younger children while their parents work at other tasks. Typically, men assume positions of power in
the public realm as leaders of extended families and villages, but women often represent their interests in
their own groups with their own leadership, as in Kayapó society.

The gendered arrangement of work and power is highly variable. In some societies, men take charge of
230  7 · Work, Life, and Value: Economic Anthropology

     marketing crops, while in others, women take on this role. Frequently, as cultivation intensifies with the
     growing of large cash crops such as wheat and rice, men market the cash crops while women sell the
     vegetables from their gardens.

     The work of plant cultivation is structured by the yearly cycle of the changing seasons. Frequently, the social
     life of plant-cultivating societies is organized into a similar annual calendar, with festivals, ceremonies, and
     rituals marking various stages in the process of cultivation. For instance, "garden magic," such as the
     recitation of spells, is often an integral part of preparing garden plots for the growing season. Magical spells
     and blessings provide a means of encouraging good weather and healthy plants and help manage the anxieties
     of communities that are heavily dependent on the success of their crops. Harvest time is frequently marked by
     a large festival, with feasting, the performance of special songs and dances, and the commemoration of gods
     and ancestors.

     Successful plant cultivation requires a great deal of knowledge about plant and animal biology, soil
     composition, geology, and weather patterns (see Edington 2017 for a wonderful overview). Many cultivators
     have a deep understanding of the relationship between soil and seed. Sukuma farmers in Tanzania identify six
     types of soil, five good for planting a specific crop--rice, corn, sorghum, two kinds of groundnut--and a sixth
     soil type only good for grazing cattle. Peruvian potato farmers have knowledge of 35 different potato varieties
     and are able to match each one to the soil type and environmental conditions most conducive to a healthy
     harvest. Cultivators rely on environmental indicators to let them know optimal times for planting and
     harvesting. They watch for the flowering and fruiting of wild plants, migratory movements of birds, and
     changing patterns of stars in the night sky. Many farmers in India look for the blossoming of yellow flowers on
     the laburnum trees to indicate the imminent arrival of the monsoons. Others rely on the pied crested cuckoo,
     which arrives just ahead of the monsoon rains.

     Farming societies have various techniques for managing weeds and garden pests. Some weeds are welcome as
     sources of food and materials for crafts such as baskets. Animals attracted to growing crops are frequently
     hunted as supplementary sources of protein. Grasshoppers and locusts can be fried into crispy treats, and
     larger animals such as rodents can be trapped and eaten as meat. Many cultivators use specific plants to repel
     weeds and pests. Traditional Chinese farmers used the root bark of the thunder god vine to keep caterpillars
     and aphids away from their crops. Other plants, such as neem and mint, are used to protect harvested produce
     from being eaten by insects.

     This vast knowledge of the natural world is undergirded by a value system that emphasizes environmental
     conservation and protection. Often, environmental knowledge is entwined with supernatural beliefs and
     cultural values and preserved in songs, stories, legends, and ritual practices. Ancient religious texts often
     function as records of environmental knowledge and values as well as supernatural beliefs and practices. In
     ancient India, for example, Hindu texts such as the Vedas commanded that humans should live in harmony
     with nature rather than exploiting it (Jain 2019). Certain trees and plants with particular value to humans were
     revered and associated with supernatural beings. The Vedas called for the protection of those trees and plants
     and assigned penalties for cutting them down. Typically, the cultures of plant cultivators promote reverence
     for nature and compel people to practice sustainable forms of farming that protect the soil and preserve
     biodiversity.

     As mentioned earlier, intensive agriculture produces a much larger surplus than horticultural methods. As
     agricultural surpluses and human populations both grew, villages expanded into towns, which evolved into
     cities. Emerging about 7,000 ago, the city of Uruk, located in what is now Iraq, was the first large urban center
     in Mesopotamia and possibly the world (Nardo 2007; Wallenfels and Sasson 2000). At its peak population, it
     housed 50,000 to 80,000 people, with more living in the surrounding metropolitan area. Surrounding peoples
     practiced agriculture and herding and traded their surplus in the city markets. Within the city, a class of
     craftspeople supported themselves without doing any farming, prominent among them cloth makers and
     metalworkers. Uruk peoples traded widely with groups throughout Mesopotamia and what is now western
     Iran. The accumulation of wealth in the city supported the building of great temples and city walls by a class of
     construction workers (Pittman 2019). Such public buildings are called monumental architecture. Cuneiform
     writing was invented as a method of accounting, used to keep track of trade and inventory. Coordinating this
     complex economy was a centralized government headed by a king.

Like Uruk in Mesopotamia, the early cities of Abydos in Egypt, Harappa in the Indus Valley, and Anyang in
China all emerged close to waterways, locations where intensive agriculture stimulated increases in
population (Rizvi 2007). Cities provided sites for craft specialization, the organization of regional trade, the
building of monumental architecture, the development of writing, and the centralization of power. With its
large stone plaza, pyramids, and ball courts, the Zapotec city of Monte Albán emerged as an administrative
capital in Mesoamerica around 4,000 years ago. With its own plaza and pyramids, the site of Caral in present-
day Peru developed into a city around the same time as Monte Albán. Built on a base of agricultural surplus, all
of these cities demonstrate urban planning, heterogeneous populations, regional trade, and monumental
architecture.

Contemporary Challenges of Farming Societies

Communities relying primarily on extensive horticulture or intensive agriculture are generally able to meet
their own subsistence needs. However, with the development of cities into regional empires, many cultivators
became incorporated into larger structures of trade and government. Under pressure from these structures,
farmers past and present were and are obliged to sell their surplus for cash in order to pay taxes and purchase
agricultural inputs such as seed and fertilizer. As cities and states grow, they exert pressure on cultivators to
produce ever higher yields to support greater populations and more elaborate state projects. As cultivators
become incorporated into demanding states, they become a class of peasants. A peasant is a farmer with a
small plot of land incorporated into a larger regional economy. Nearly all contemporary cultivators are part of
a peasant class in their nation-states (Sillitoe 2018). Peasants are often marginalized and disadvantaged,
reliant on economic and political structures they cannot control, and exploited by urban elites. Many farmers
now make up a rural underclass.

Extensive horticulturalists such as the Kayapó require large areas of land in order to allow their fallow plots to
regenerate before reusing them. Over the past 30 years, cattle ranchers, loggers, and miners have moved into
Kayapó territory. Unlike the Kayapó, ranchers and loggers practice ecologically damaging methods, leaving
large areas of barren wasteland in their wake. Early on, some Kayapó communities accommodated iron and
gold mining operations, signing contracts that granted mining companies permission to operate in exchange
for a small percentage of profits. However, mining practices polluted the rivers that the Kayapó rely on for
drinking, bathing, and fishing. With the emergence of gold rush towns and the flood of foreigners into the area,
the Kayapó began to see unwelcome changes in their communities, such as increases in disease and
problematic alcohol use. Many Kayapó turned against outsiders, attacking loggers and miners to force them off
of Kayapó land. As a further problem, the Brazilian government has proposed a series of large hydroelectric
dams on Kayapó rivers to generate power in the Amazonian hinterlands. These dams would flood Kayapó
territory, displacing more than 20,000 people. Recognizing these projects as threats to their culture and way of
life, the Kayapó have joined with other Amazonian Indigenous groups in dramatic protests attracting global
attention and support (Turner and Fajans-Turner 2006). The rock star Sting attended one such protest and
later founded the Rainforest Foundation Fund to support the efforts of the Kayapó to protect their land.

     You may have heard this story before--the story of Indigenous peoples who come to be surrounded and
     dominated by extractive capitalists and state officials. In their relations with Indigenous peoples practicing
     gathering-hunting, pastoralism, and horticulture, states often argue that such people are resisting inevitable
     progress. Indeed, American world history textbooks often represent the emergence of cities, the expansion of
     trade, and the creation of bureaucratic states as steps in the triumphal march of progress, key achievements in
     the development of civilization.

     But progress for whom? The more that is learned about life in nonindustrial, noncapitalist societies, the more
     questions are raised about these notions of progress.

     7.6 Exchange, Value, and Consumption

     LEARNING OUTCOMES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       · Outline four types of exchange.
       · Define the concept of reciprocity.
       · Define the concepts of money and market exchange.
       · Describe how money expresses conflicted notions of morality.

     Before moving ahead to discuss the last of the four major subsistence methods, it's worth reviewing the ways in
     which goods circulate in societies in accordance with each mode of subsistence. The four subsistence
     strategies are defined primarily by their techniques of production--that is, the way people use materials from
     their environments to make the things they need, such as food, clothing, shelter, and medicines. Previous
     sections have described how each production strategy entails its own distinctive methods of allocating those
     needful things to individuals and groups within the community. This section details the various methods of
     circulating things through social groups.

     Most societies rely on one primary strategy for making a living, though they very often combine it with one or
     more others in flexible ways over time. If key foods become impossible to find, gatherer-hunters may take up
     farming for a few seasons. Many herding groups regularly hunt and sometimes plant crops along their
     nomadic routes, returning the next season to harvest the crops. Many farmers also keep domesticated animals.
     So it is with modes of exchange. Most societies practice not just one strategy but a combination of many,
     dominated by the form of exchange that dovetails with the main subsistence strategy.

Forms of Exchange

Recall the importance of egalitarian sharing in gatherer-hunter societies. When hunters return to camp
bearing large game, they divide it equally among members of the band. When gatherers bring back loads of
nuts or fruit, they hand them out freely to anyone who is hungry. Everyone is expected and required to share
with everyone else. Generalized reciprocity is the anthropological term to describe how people share things
with no regard for their value or interest in compensation. This form of exchange doesn't look like exchange at
all; it looks much more like altruism. But when rigorously practiced by a group, with social sanctions used to
punish laziness and stinginess, the result of generalized reciprocity over time is more or less the equal
exchange of goods among all members of the group.

Outside of gathering-hunting societies, generalized reciprocity is also common in many close relationships,
such as family relationships and friendships. When you're staying in your parents' house, does it occur to you
to pay them when you grab a soft drink from the fridge? If a friend wants to borrow a pair of boots, do you
charge them a rental fee? Probably not. However, the logic of exchange changes as the intensity of the
relationship decreases and value of the object increases. Your parents might give you a car if you needed one,
but you would not expect a friend to do so without some sort of compensation.

In gathering-hunting and horticultural societies, another form of reciprocal exchange is common among
individuals. Among the Dobe Ju/'hoansi and other San groups in southern Africa, people develop relationships
with one another based on a gift-giving practice called hxaro (Barnard 2018). The relationship begins when
one person asks another person, often someone in another band, to give them a particular item, such as a
digging stick or a cooking pot. This request may be rejected or accepted. If accepted, the two enter into an
ongoing relationship of exchange, which may last forever or be broken off at some future point. After an
unspecified period of time, the receiver makes a return gift, often of somewhat of equal or slightly greater
value. The value of the items is never discussed; nor is the time between episodes of gift giving. All is made to
seem natural and spontaneous. This form of exchange is known as balanced reciprocity. These relationships
come with many advantages--for instance, the right to hunt and gather in the band of your hxaro partner. For
this reason, many people maintain as many as 10 to 12 ongoing hxaro relationships. The main point of
balanced reciprocity is not to gain resources and opportunities. Rather, the whole point of these serial
exchanges of things is to establish and affirm relationships among people. Some degree of unspoken
calculation is involved in choosing gifts that affirm and intensify the relationship over time, with givers slowly
raising the value of gifts to deepen the relationship. These special relationships based on reciprocal gift giving
are found in many other horticultural and agricultural societies as well.

While such gift-giving relationships seem to be governed by a sense of mutual goodwill, a more fierce and
competitive form of balanced reciprocity developed among the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest
coast of Canada and the United States (High 2018). Among groups such as the Haida, Kwakiutl, and Tlingit,
chiefs sponsored great feasts called potlatches to commemorate births, weddings, deaths, and other important
events. At these potlatch feasts, the chief of the host community would present an abundance of gifts to the
chief of an invited community. Such gifts included blankets, animal skins, copper plaques, and preserved food.
Sometimes, these items were deliberately burned in spectacles of extravagant waste. By foisting this
abundance of gifts upon a guest chief, the host chief demonstrated their wealth and power and levied a
challenge to the guest chief to counter with an even more lavish feast and greater trove of gifts. Power among
neighboring communities was established and reinforced through this competitive feasting, not by acquiring
wealth but by giving it away. More recent interpretations of potlatch suggest that such ceremonies not only
operated as forms of reciprocity but also helped distribute specific goods found in one community to
surrounding areas where those goods might be impossible to find.
234  7 · Work, Life, and Value: Economic Anthropology

     was demonstrated not by what they acquired but by what they gave away. (credit: Edward S. Curtis/Wikimedia
     Commons, Public Domain)

     The role of extended-family leaders in the practice of potlatch is an example of the tendency for leaders to gain
     control of community wealth and use it for distribution as well as prestige. This practice is particularly
     pronounced in agricultural societies that have chiefs, such as the peoples of the Hawaiian Islands in the
     precolonial era. Before contact with Europeans, the Hawaiian Islands were ruled by a multilevel system of
     chiefs who controlled land, natural resources, and trade. Commoners were required to pay tribute to their
     chiefs in the form of labor, food, and other products. For farmers, this meant that a portion of their agricultural
     surplus was relayed to local chiefs. These local chiefs then relayed a portion of the tribute they received to
     regional chiefs, and so on up the pyramid to the great chief. This tribute supported government at each level,
     including royal courts, political advisers, priests, military strategists, guards, and entertainers. In this way,
     political leaders became centers of the concentration of wealth, which was then used to provide communities
     with the benefits of government, such as social order, conflict resolution, military protection, trade
     coordination, and the construction of public works such as fishponds, water channels, and temples. In this
     hierarchical system, tribute flowed up to elites, while government goods and services flowed down to
     commoners. This two-way flow is called redistribution, and it's a very common feature of chiefdoms, as will be
     discussed in the next chapter. Tribute was used by leaders to finance monument building, warfare, trade, and
     ceremonial feasting as well as the chief's own lavish regalia and large retinue of assistants, bureaucrats, and
     servants.

     Redistribution is practiced in all state societies. Consider the roads in your neighborhood, the postal service,
     the public schools, the libraries, government-funded scientific research, the courts, the prisons, the police--all
     are paid for by taxation, the form of redistribution conducted by states. While some see taxation as a predatory
     fee extracted by unproductive elites, taxation makes possible the social order, the economy, and the well-being
     of state citizens. It's important to recognize that redistribution is not a way for individuals to purchase goods
     and services from the state but rather a system of allocating resources for the well-being of society as a whole.

     Read this first-hand experience of the author of this chapter, Jennifer Hasty,

          Imagine that you go to take a shower and discover that you're out of soap. How can you solve this
          problem? Gift exchange? A government program? Surely not. In contemporary Western society, forms
          of reciprocity and redistribution have become increasingly sidelined by the other main form of
          economic exchange: markets. A market is an institution that makes it possible for buyers and sellers
          of goods to meet for the purposes of exchange. In the most concrete sense, a market is an actual place.
          If you need a bar of soap (or shampoo, or a towel, or a bathtub), you go the market and buy one. In fact,
          I never pack soap when I travel to Ghana, as one of the first thing I do when I get there is head for the
          nearest market.

West African markets are noisy, vibrant places full of shrewd women traders with their neat stacks
and haphazard heaps of colorful goods. At big markets such as Makola and Kaneshie, you can find
almost anything you might want, from large appliances to clothes, school supplies, fresh spices, and
produce. The air is infused with the shifting aromas of fried plantain, "stinky" fish, and freshly baked
bofrot, a kind of Ghanaian doughnut. Music blasts from radios posted at kiosks here and there. Mobile
vendors ply the crowded paths, their goods carefully draped on their bodies or stacked on their heads.
Customers from all walks of life browse the rows upon rows of seated vendors, everyone chatting and
socializing, buyers and sellers haggling the price of goods. Early on, I learned that the value of a
product is not fixed but contingent on many factors, such as time of day, amount of stock, and the
perceived identity of the buyer. Just buying a few bars of soap can be a complex social interaction
combined with a rich sensory experience.

     More recently, Western-style grocery stores have opened up in Ghana. In contrast to the intense
     sensory experience of markets, these stores are quiet and, to me, a bit underwhelming. A small
     number of shoppers silently push their carts up and down the aisles, avoiding eye contact with one
     another. At checkout, a bored clerk rings up your items and informs you of the total. It does not matter
     who you are--rich or poor, the total is the same. This is a routinized, predictable experience. In the
     United States, automatic checkout is becoming increasingly common in stores, eliminating the off
     chance that you might have any sort of meaningful human contact in the course of your market
     transaction. With online purchasing, the market is no longer a place at all but a virtual site on a
     computer screen that absolutely precludes any possibility of direct human interaction. Consumers
     have responded to the desocialization of online market relations by embracing the highly expressive
     and interactive realm of consumer reviews. And even in the brick-and-mortar shops, people resist the
     boring antisocial regimen of modern shopping by talking on their cell phones, enjoying food samples,
     and looking for romantic partners.

     All of these forms of exchange can be found in contemporary capitalist societies. Generalized
     reciprocity is practiced among family members and very, very close friends. Balanced reciprocity is
     the unspoken logic guiding most exchanges among friends and acquaintances. If you ask your
     neighbor to collect your mail while you're out of town, you might expect your neighbor to ask you for a
     similar favor in the future. Recently, while I was out of town for a week, I asked the parents of my
     daughter's school friend if they could take her to and from school. They kindly obliged. A month later, I
     had to leave town again for a week. In that intervening month, I had been unable to reciprocate for the
     favor of shuttling my child around, so I hesitated to ask those same parents to do it again. Instead, I
     hired someone, the friend of a friend but a stranger to me.

Among strangers, market exchange is the most common form of transaction. In capitalist societies, market
236  7 · Work, Life, and Value: Economic Anthropology

     exchange is the default setting; if all else fails, pay for it. Market transactions are quick and easy, and the
     participants walk away relatively unencumbered by future obligation. If this is the advantage of market
     exchange, it can also be a big disadvantage. Without the relations of mutuality and trust established by forms
     of reciprocity, the participants in market exchange are motivated by the desire to get more than they give. A
     society dominated by market exchange is therefore dominated by the logic of self-interest and greed rather
     than cooperation and social well-being.

     Money

     In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, many shops witnessed a scarcity of hard currency, prompting them to
     put up signs requesting people to use credit or debit cards or mobile payment apps to make purchases. This
     episode is part of a larger shift over the past several decades away from coins and bills and toward more
     abstract forms of payment such as chip cards and "fintech," the mobile debit apps accessed through
     smartphones. And even more abstractly, now there are even virtual currencies such as bitcoin and other
     cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is a currency generated by a computer dedicated to solving complex mathematical
     problems. How is that even money?

     What is money? In the formulation of classical philosophy, money is defined by three functions: it serves as a
     medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value. Imagine that two friends from neighboring groups,
     one a pastoralist group and the other a horticultural group, meet in town. The pastoralist has a freshly
     slaughtered goat slung over their shoulder. The horticulturalist is carrying a small sack of vegetables. They
     decide they'd like to trade. The farmer wants all of the meat, but the herder wants only a small portion of the
     vegetables. Each person wants the trade to be equal; that is, they both want to give and receive the same value.
     How can they conduct this transaction? How do they know the value of the things they want to trade?

     It seems natural to imagine these two trader friends attempting to negotiate some sort of barter. The swapping
     of goods on the spot, however, was never a dominant form of exchange in any culture in the past. Instead,
     many anthropologists argue that precapitalist peoples relied more on gift exchange, redistribution, and debt to
     circulate goods through society. So it's more likely that the pastoralist would make a good-faith gift of the whole
     goat to their gardening friend, knowing that both would remember the gardener's obligation to return the favor
     with more vegetables (or something else of fairly equal value) in the future. If this seems complicated, it
     probably was. Individuals would have been involved in many such relationships simultaneously - whole
     communities of people all mutually entwined in relations of credit and debt.

     The other possible solution is money. If these two traders live in a society that uses some arbitrary other thing
     to enumerate value, they would know that all of the meat has the value of 50 units (or shekels, cowrie shells,
     tally sticks, bones, animal skins, brass rods, gold coins, bank notes, or any one of the myriad other objects used
     as money in the past). A small portion of vegetables might have the value of only 10 units. If these two have
     come with their wallets, they can use money to make two separate transactions for items of different value
     rather than trying to negotiate one swap. They can make the exchanges and walk away without entanglement.

There are two kinds of money, general purpose and special purpose. The transaction described above is an
example of general-purpose money--that is, money that can be exchanged for a wide variety of goods and
services. Dollars, euros, pesos, yen, and bitcoin are all forms of general-purpose money. General-purpose
money is portable, divisible, and easily available. Special-purpose money is currency that is used to purchase
one particular kind of thing. In some pastoral societies of West African, cattle have been used as forms of
bridewealth, or the payment made by a groom to the family of his prospective bride. The Tinputz people of
Papua New Guinea had two forms of special-purpose money, strings of flying fox teeth and strings of shell
disks. These were used for marriages and other socially important occasions. Special-purpose money is
generally more difficult to obtain, transport, and/or measure precisely. In American society, many grocery
stores now offer special-use "points" for loyal shoppers that can be used to buy gas at particular gas stations.
Credit card companies, airlines, and other businesses offer similar forms of special-purpose points. Such
special-use currency illustrates the arbitrary nature of money.

7.7 Industrialism and Postmodernity

LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Define industrialism and describe how it developed.
  · Articulate the cultural forms associated with industrialism.
  · Describe how the development of industrialism instigated the establishment of colonial empires and the global
      economic system.
  · Evaluate the long-term effects of colonial subjugation on postcolonial economies and societies.
  · Define the concepts of modernity and alternative modernity.

All of the modes of subsistence previously discussed rely on human labor applied directly to environmental
resources to produce relatively small batches of food, tools, and other goods. In the past 10,000 years,
gathering-hunting, pastoralism, and agriculture all existed side by side, and most groups dabbled in more than
one of these modes.

In these systems, most work is conducted by extended-family groups in the context of the household, whether
settled or mobile. These family groups regulate their own work cycles and determine how goods are produced
and distributed based on their own needs and strategies. In the 1700s in Britain, a new way of producing goods
began to develop, slowly at first and then growing exponentially to sweep the globe. That mode of subsistence
is industrialism: the use of wage labor, machines, and chemical processes to mass-produce commodities.
Taking hold first in Europe, this mode of subsistence drew sets of people away from their households into
factories where they performed repetitive forms of labor in return for regular wages. In the factory setting,
workers have very little control over their own work cycles and no claim whatsoever on the goods they
produce.

As a mode of subsistence, industrialism drew from and transformed other modes of production, such as
pastoralism and agriculture. Industrialism did not supersede other modes but rather used them as sources of
raw materials and labor. Gatherer-hunters, with no surplus to supply industry, are deemed useless to
industrialism. Gatherer-hunter groups are thus marginalized by contemporary states, often being confined to
reservations where their way of life is difficult or impossible to practice.

Cloth, Factories, and Slavery: The Rise of Industrialism

In the early 1700s, small-scale sheepherders were producing raw wool throughout the British countryside. As
large-scale cloth manufacturing was limited in England at the time, traders exported much of that raw wool to
European countries such as the Netherlands, where it was processed into cloth. A general rule in economics is
that selling raw materials is not nearly as profitable as processing them into commodities to sell to consumers.
Envious of European textile processing, British manufacturers sought to greatly expand local processing of
British wool into cloth for export. As British manufacturers bought more and more wool, the price of wool
238  7 · Work, Life, and Value: Economic Anthropology

     skyrocketed. Large British landholders began to evict small-scale peasants from their land so that they could
     expand their own sheep herds to take advantage of the rising price of wool.

     FIGURE 7.17 Industrial weaving was often done by young women. Working long hours in a textile factory was a
     very difference experience from the weaving that these women's mothers and grandmothers may have done at
     home. (credit: "The Bobbin Girl" by National Park Service/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)

     Landless people flooded into British cities looking for work around the same time that manufacturers were
     looking for a cheap source of wage labor to process wool into cloth in the new factories. The drive to increase
     productivity while lowering production costs prompted several key technological innovations, such as the
     large-scale use of water mills and, later, the steam engine to power these factories. Moreover, new techniques
     for managing the labor force emerged, such as the clock-regulated workday and sets of work rules known as
     shop-floor discipline. The twin forces of technological innovation and labor management (some would call it
     exploitation) stimulated similar shifts toward mass production of cotton cloth, pottery, and metals.

     By the mid-1800s, the entire economy of England was completely transformed, now dominated by the mass
     production of commodities in factories for export all over the world. This model of industrial manufacturing of
     mass commodities spread across western Europe, reshaping urban national economies in the Netherlands,
     Germany, France, and beyond.

     Soon, these burgeoning industries had outgrown local supplies of raw materials for their factories and started
     looking for additional sources of cotton, sugar, tea, tobacco, and other materials that could be processed into
     commodities. One solution was found in the expansion of the African slave trade in the 1700s and the use of
     enslaved persons on plantations in the New World to produce raw materials to supply the factories in England.

     That is a lot of history, and this is an anthropology textbook, but it is important to know why European
     societies shifted to industrial production in the 1700s. It was not because it provided a better way of life for the
     majority of people but because it generated stupendous profits for classes of large landowners, factory owners,
     and transnational traders. For peasants kicked off their land and forced to live in squalor in urban slums,
     working 14-hour days under the harsh discipline of the shop steward, this was not progress. For enslaved
     persons abducted from their homes and shipped to a foreign land, worked to death under threat of the lash,
     this was not progress. For a class of European consumers eager for fancy new clothes and tasty new foods,

7.7 · Industrialism and Postmodernity                                                                             239

perhaps it seemed like progress.

In fact, the modern industry of advertising was invented during this time to tell people that it was progress.
Advertising was necessary to stimulate the consumption of all the mass-produced commodities created by
European manufacturers. From a holistic perspective, the notions of progress and development that emerged
in 19th-century Europe went hand in hand with the demands of the industrial economy, providing rationales
for the new forms of conflict and domination.

Colonialism and Global Capitalism

A second reason for providing the brief history lesson in the last section is to show how the development of the
industrial economy in Europe generated the global system of capitalism that exists today. After the European
slave trade was abolished in the early 19th century, Europeans expanded their control over African, Asian, and
New World territories, cultivating new sources of such raw materials as peanuts, cocoa, and palm oil to develop
even more lucrative European industries. This expansion of control took the form of colonialism, the political
domination of another country in the interest of economic exploitation.

From the 1500s to the 1900s, European countries strove to dominate much of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East
as well as North, Central and South America. Different techniques of rule were practiced at different times and
places, but all colonialism involved a set of key features, including violent rule by a European government, the
extraction of raw materials, forced labor, taxation, the spread of Christian missions, the denigration of local
cultures, the introduction of diseases, and increased local conflict. While their motivations were primarily
economic, European colonizers claimed to be inspired by a "civilizing mission"--the idea that European
domination was necessary to bring the benefits of progress, such as hospitals and schools. For colonized
peoples, the hardships and injustices of colonial rule far outweighed the meager benefits offered to some
groups.

around the globe, with just a few isolated areas that have remained free of European influence or control.

Economically, the whole purpose of colonialism was to design a system for extracting raw materials to support
the industrial economies of Europe. Therefore, European countries such as Britain, France, and Germany
sought out sources of valuable minerals for the mining industry as well as good land for growing crops that
European manufacturers could process into commodities. In Africa, many fertile regions were seized and sold
to White settlers to establish plantations for growing tea, cotton, and other cash crops. The African peoples
who lived there were relocated to less fertile lands and forced to work on the White plantations in order to
survive. In places where White people found it hard to live (e.g., places with widespread tropical diseases such
as malaria), colonial governments recruited African farmers to grow cash crops such as coffee and cocoa.
Colonial subjects were taxed by colonial governments in order to force them to work in mines and on
plantations or grow cash crops for export. African businesspeople were edged out of international trade, and
240  7 · Work, Life, and Value: Economic Anthropology

     industrial development was curtailed in the colonies to protect European industry.

     Most colonized countries became independent in the mid-20th century. Economically speaking, however,
     colonial domination never quite ended for the vast majority of postcolonial countries. The economies of most
     African countries are still dominated by a few mining and cash crop exports. As the global prices of such raw
     materials fluctuate widely from year to year, postcolonial governments find it hard to budget and plan ahead.
     Moreover, the actual value of raw material exports erodes over time, forcing countries to export more and more
     just to maintain their economies, making real economic growth and development almost impossible.

     In response to this dilemma, many postcolonial countries, including India, have adopted ambitious schemes to
     industrialize their economies in order to get out of the colonial economic trap. Currently, the government of
     Ghana is pursuing a renewed effort at industrialization, hoping to add value to cash crops such as pineapples
     and groundnuts and provide jobs to Ghanaians by manufacturing commodities of higher value for local use
     and export. The One District, One Factory initiative aims to establish a new factory in each of Ghana's 216
     government districts.

     Modernity, the Sociocultural Complex of Industrial Societies

     What happens when a country industrializes? Anthropologists have been interested in how processes of
     industrialism have unfolded in non-European contexts such as India, China, Brazil, and Mexico. Wherever this
     transformation occurs, certain other sociocultural conditions tend to follow. Social scientists refer to the
     complex of features that accompanies industrialization as modernity.

     While anchored by a set of commonalities, modernity takes different forms in different contexts. There is no
     one modernity but rather a whole spectrum of modernities that develop as societies industrialize in different
     ways. Some, such as China and Mexico, focus on strategic industrial zones. Some, such as Ghana, seek to
     establish factories evenly throughout the country. Moreover, societies accommodate the changes of
     industrialism using their own cultural institutions, practices, and belief systems, informed by their own
     historical experiences. Some versions of modernity emphasize individualism and allow for vast amounts of
     inequality among people in different social categories. Other versions of modernity emphasize community
     well-being and equality. Some scholars use the term alternative modernity to describe versions of modernity
     that have developed outside of Europe.

     Nevertheless, industrialism does entail a set of sociocultural forces that interact with local cultural features to
     produce these distinctive versions of modernity. The first of these forces is urbanization. As with the evicted
     peasants in 18th-century Britain, people are pushed or pulled into urban centers to find jobs when factories
     are established. Rural farmers must rely on unpredictable factors such as weather and volatile market prices
     for their goods. And those who grow cash crops usually find they have to sell more and more just to maintain
     their standard of living. These challenges have made farming unattractive to many young people, prompting
     them to seek better lives in urban areas. As societies industrialize, the pull toward urban areas becomes
     greater, and trading towns grow into industrial cities, which grow into metropolitan regions.

     The second notable feature of industrial society is regimented wage labor. In the other modes of subsistence,
     people are obligated to work to survive, but they maintain control over the conditions of their work, such as
     when they start and end their workday, when they take breaks, what tasks they perform that day, how they
     perform those tasks, and how much they produce in a given day. In the factory setting, the nature of work
     changes profoundly.

FIGURE 7.19 Punching the time clock. Regimented wage labor is a defining feature of industrial societies. (credit:
"Detroit, Michigan (Vicinity). Chrysler Corporation Dodge Truck Plant. War Workers `Punching In' for Their Job of
Helping to `Punch' the Axis" by Arthur S. Siegel/Library of Congress)

Factory workers are required to begin work at a certain time and continue until the official end of the workday.
Many are made to "clock in" and "clock out" by inserting a card into a machine that records their starting and
ending times. The work performed in factories often involves repetitive motions and procedures rather than
the varied work of other subsistence modes. Regimented labor is supervised by managers, who determine
work conditions and procedures and enforce predetermined levels of productivity. If a worker does not
conform to these expectations, they can be fired. Even as many industrialized societies have shifted to services
as the basis of their economies, they have retained the fundamental structure of regimented wage labor for the
vast majority of shop and office workers. It is remarkable that societies purporting to value personal "freedom"
require most people to work under such authoritarian conditions.

A third feature of industrialism is the grouping of people into social classes. In other modes of subsistence,
society is structured primarily by family groups, gender groups, age sets, and regional associations. In
industrial societies, extended-family systems tend to be increasingly challenged and sometimes replaced by
much more mobile nuclear families. Social identity is increasingly reckoned according to occupation. In non-
Western contexts, class often combines with ethnic and religious identities to create complex cultural forms of

inequality and conflict. Inequality among social classes is discussed in Social Inequalities.

A fourth feature of industrial societies is an increase in commodity consumption. People of all classes in
industrial societies buy, consume, and own an extraordinary amount of stuff. This is necessary, of course,
because industrialized capitalist economies produce so much stuff. Food retailers throw away more than 45
billion tons of unsold food products every year. Many clothing companies shred or burn the clothes they
cannot sell. Marketing and advertising have evolved to stimulate increased consumption by attaching specific
meanings to commodities. Often, ads portray commodities such as perfumes or cars as powerful objects that
possess the ability to transform their users. This association of commodities with magical powers is called
commodity fetishism. People are encouraged to think that owning or consuming certain commodities makes
them beautiful or enviable or gives them membership in a more powerful social class.

In fact, commodities do not really have the power to transform people. Commodities are inert. Rather, it is
people who have power--the power to transform materials into commodities. Moreover, there is a difference
between consuming the same things that powerful people consume and actually being a powerful person.
Nevertheless, people in industrial and postindustrial societies often experience a sense of power and control
through shopping, perhaps because those experiences are denied to them in the workplace. Rather than
242  7 · Work, Life, and Value: Economic Anthropology

     thinking about the consequences of industrialism, such as work discipline, inequality, and environmental
     damage, people in societies dominated by consumerism are invited to view the world as an endless array of
     exotic and empowering commodities on offer to the modern citizen.

     Finally, as suggested by their patterns of commodity consumption, people in industrial societies often place a
     high value on individualism. Increasingly in industrial and postindustrial societies, people develop identities
     based on their personal tastes, attributes, experiences, and goals rather than those of their surrounding
     families or other social groups to which they belong. Rather than living with family, many people in US society
     live alone for years or even decades. On the one hand, this development provides people with opportunities to
     choose their own paths in life, to explore new identities and ways of living. On the other hand, individuals are
     increasingly expected to rely on themselves rather than cultivating relations of mutuality and reciprocity with
     others. In societies that emphasize self-reliance, people often face material and emotional hardship alone.
     Feeling isolated and cut off from social relationships, many experience a sense of alienation.

     Postindustrialism and Postmodernity

     In the 1970s, the economies of the United States, Japan, and many western European countries began to shift
     from a base of manufacturing to a base of services and information. Seeking to maximize profits, large
     manufacturers moved their factories to poorer countries with cheaper labor, weaker environmental
     regulations, and lower overall operation costs. Therefore, industrialization increased in places such as China
     and Brazil just as the United States and other countries became postindustrial. As production is moved to
     other parts of the globe, consumption also becomes increasingly global, with large companies seeking to sell
     their goods to ever larger markets. Increasingly global processes of production and consumption are referred
     to by the term globalization, a key feature of national economies since the late 1970s.

     Social theorists such as David Harvey and Frederic Jameson have suggested that this economic shift has
     generated a cultural shift from modernity to postmodernity. The essential structures of work, consumption,
     leisure, and social life are not radically reshaped but rather intensified in the shift from industrial to
     postindustrial society. Work discipline becomes more rigorous, trade becomes more global, and technology
     becomes more pervasive and intrusive.

     In postindustrial societies, professional, educated elites work in the services and information industries, such
     as health care, data processing, finance, and technology. These are typically secure jobs with benefits such as
     health insurance, paid sick leave, and retirement funds--but the market for such jobs is increasingly
     competitive, making them increasingly demanding. Easier to find are working-class jobs in retail,
     transportation, customer service, and other lower-paying service industries. The class of workers previously
     employed in manufacturing now competes for these less attractive jobs, which offer few or no benefits. Many
     turn to the "gig economy," working as drivers, house cleaners, and handypeople--jobs that provide freedom
     from regimented work discipline in exchange for unstable compensation and no benefits. Inequality increases
     between those with secure, elite jobs and the vast majority of workers with more insecure employment.
     Theorists of postmodernity argue that these changes in the conditions of work create a pervasive sense of
     anxiety and precarity among all classes of postindustrial workers. Precarity is physical and psychological
     harm caused by lack of secure income. Increasing precarity and inequality are linked to rising sociocultural
     polarization and the resurgence of ethnic, religious, and nationalist identities.

     In both work and leisure, technologies penetrate deeper into the everyday lives of people living in postmodern
     societies. New media forms shape their social identities and relationships. Through these new forms of
     technology and media, people in postmodern societies are constantly bombarded with new information, new
     products, and new demands, giving people the sense of time speeding up. Moreover, flows of information,
     goods, and people across the globe create a sense of a shrinking world. David Harvey refers to these changes in
     our sense of time and space as time-space compression.

        PROFILES IN ANTHROPOLOGY

David Graeber
1961-2020

                  FIGURE 7.20 David Graeber (credit: Guido van Nispen/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 2.0)

Personal History: David Rolfe Graeber was born in New York and grew up in a working-class family steeped in
radical politics. While in junior high school, he became fascinated by Mayan hieroglyphics and translated
many glyphs that had only partially been translated before (Cain 2020). He sent his translations to a Mayan
scholar, who was so impressed that he helped Graeber get a scholarship to a prestigious prep school in
Massachusetts.

Area of Anthropology: Graeber studied anthropology as an undergraduate at SUNY Purchase and then earned
his PhD in anthropology at the University of Chicago. For his dissertation fieldwork, he lived in Betafo, a rural
community in Madagascar. He observed that people in Betafo lived beyond the reach of official government,
without police or taxation. They had developed their own methods of governing themselves through
community consensus. This experience profoundly shaped Graeber's sense of political possibility. Throughout
his life, he advocated for direct democracy as the most fair and logical way to organize society.

In 1998, Graeber became an anthropology professor at Yale University and began engaging in political
activism, which included protesting the World Economic Forum and the International Monetary Fund. Despite
his impressive academic accomplishments, Yale decided not to renew Graeber's contract in 2005. He believed
the decision was largely due to his radical politics. He subsequently landed a job at Goldsmiths' College,
University of London, and then at the London School of Economics.

Accomplishments in the Field: In his widely acclaimed book Debt: the First 5,000 Years, Graeber (2014)
describes debt as a central mechanism for creating and maintaining inequality in ancient and modern
societies. Examining the first recorded debt systems, in the Sumerian civilization of 3500 BCE, he found that
large numbers of farmers became indebted, forcing them to pawn their children to work off their debt. The
increasing enslavement of people in this system led to widespread social unrest. Sumerian kings responded by
244  7 · Work, Life, and Value: Economic Anthropology

     periodically canceling all debts. Also practiced in ancient Israel, this periodic cancellation of debt came to be
     called the Law of Jubilee.

     Widespread indebtedness in American society has also led to increasing precarity and social unrest, resulting
     in protest movements such as Occupy Wall Street. Graeber called for the reintroduction of the Jubilee, in
     particular a cancellation of student loan debt and predatory mortgages.

     Examining the world of modern work, Graeber argued that most white-collar jobs are pointless and
     meaningless, calling them "bullshit jobs." In his book Bullshit Jobs: A Theory, published in 2018, he describes
     how technological advances and increased bureaucracy have led people to work longer hours in pursuit of
     greater productivity in order to generate profits for shareholders. Much of what white-collar workers produce,
     however, is useless, bureaucratic make-work that makes the lives of other people more difficult. Such workers
     include telemarketers, insurance analysts, corporate lawyers, lobbyists, and investment CEOs. Knowing their
     work to be unnecessary, even damaging, people in these jobs suffer moral and spiritual damage from the
     regimented futility of their daily lives.

     Importance of His Work: David Graeber was one of the most innovative economic thinkers of modern times.
     He forged new ways of thinking about the basic elements of modern economic life, such as work, bureaucracy,
     debt, and exchange. As a political activist, he participated in social movements working for greater equality,
     better working conditions, and environmental sustainability. He was a founding member of Occupy Wall
     Street, the 2011 protest movement against economic inequality.

     While on holiday in Venice with his new wife, David Graeber died suddenly (Hart 2020). He was 59.

     Environmental Impacts of Industrial and Postindustrial Societies

     Industrialism has taken a heavy toll on the environments where it has become a primary mode of subsistence.
     The burning of fossil fuels to power factories causes air pollution, particularly the buildup of carbon dioxide
     and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This has triggered global climate change. Where factories are
     built next to water sources, local water supplies can become contaminated with dangerous chemicals. Toxic
     chemicals such as lead can leach into soils, contaminating crops. The clearing of land for mining, logging,
     ranching, and cash crops leads to habitat loss, causing dramatic reductions in plant and animal biodiversity.
     Much of this environmental degradation occurs in poorer countries and poor regions of postindustri al
     countries.

     As discussed in this chapter, anthropologists in all of the four fields are interested in how people make a living
     by engaging with their environments, creating systems of production and exchange. Anthropologists also
     study how such systems create forms of meaning and value as people study, classify, and experiment with the
     plants, animals, soils, and climate features of their surroundings. With its deep-seated interest in the
     interdependence of humans and nature, anthropology has been quick to respond to the environmental threats
     generated by unsustainable modes of subsistence, such as fossil-fuel-driven industrialism and postindustrial
     hyperconsumption.

     Practicing "climate ethnography," many cultural anthropologists have described how previous modes of
     subsistence have become impossible due to climate change, particularly in "climate sensitive" parts of the
     world such as deserts and areas at or near sea level (Crate 2011). Contributions to a 2016 book, Anthropology
     and Climate Change, detail the profound sociocultural effects of climate change in places such as Siberia,
     Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Papua New Guinea, the Amazon, Peru, Australia, and Alaska (Crate and Nuttall 2016).
     Anthropologist Jerry Jacka (2016) reports how extreme climate fluctuations are causing droughts, floods, and
     frosts that threaten local subsistence strategies in Papua New Guinea. In heavily affected areas, horticulture
     becomes impossible, and people are forced to migrate, sometimes leaving the sick and the elderly behind to
     die. In areas where people continue to farm, invasive weeds and insects have taken over, destroying crops and
     firewood. Unpredictable rainfall and flooding cause frequent food shortages when crops fail. Local peoples
     have responded with a set of strategies to mitigate these changes, such as switching crop species, but
     horticulture remains a threatened way of life in New Guinea. Similarly, anthropologist Susan Crate's (2016)
     work in Siberia shows how cattle keeping is becoming increasingly difficult due to flooded rangelands,

unpredictable rainfall, and other unstable climate factors. More and more Siberian young people are
abandoning their parents' way of life and moving to cities in search of wage work.

In this chapter, we have surveyed the four main ways of making a living that people have used throughout
human history. These four modes of subsistence did not occur in a neat evolutionary sequence, each new one
outmoding and replacing the one before. Rather, new strategies were adopted as primary modes of subsistence
by some groups and supplementary methods by others. Many groups have experimented with different modes
of subsistence, combining them in various ways over time. People change their subsistence strategies in
response to population pressures, forced migrations, the spread of new technologies, trade opportunities, and,
most recently, global climate change.

There is a notable difference between the first three strategies discussed in this chapter and the very last one.
Industrialism and postindustrialism are strategies that encompass the world, drawing all other modes of
subsistence into the pressures and opportunities of the global capitalist market. As states and corporations
seek to gain control over land and natural resources, the modes of subsistence that rely on these resources are
threatened. Many people are forced to abandon gathering-hunting, pastoralism, and plant cultivation and the
whole ways of life associated with those ways of making a living.

There is one more important difference between all previous modes of subsistence and the mode of
industrialism/postindustrialism. Gathering-hunting, pastoralism, and plant cultivation are very often (though
not always) practiced in ways that sustain and protect the environment. Despite efforts at environmental
reform, industrialism and postindustrialism are still practiced in ways that harm and deplete the environment.
Perhaps people who practice ecologically smart ways of making a living have lessons to teach those who don't.
Losing these smart ways of making a living would be a cultural tragedy as well as an environmental disaster.

        MINI-FIELDWORK ACTIVITY

Unstructured Interview

Unstructured interviews are a qualitative research method used for research in social sciences and sometimes
for interviews for jobs and college entrance. Unstructured interviews are free flowing and are more
spontaneous than a planned interview. The goal of this less structured type of interview is to have the
interviewee relate information in a more open and neutral environment. Use an unstructured interview
method to interview a person about their job. While the interview will be unstructured some light preparation
should be done. Think about these questions as you plan your interview.

How did the person acquire that job? By choice, convenience, or necessity? Is the job temporary or permanent,
and why? What are the challenges of the job? Are there risks or dangers? What are the rewarding features?
Does the person get bored? How would the person describe the people they work among? How would they
describe their relations with the boss? Are there aspects of unfairness or inequality in the workplace? Does the
job allow the person to express creativity? Is the job personally satisfying? Does the person feel free or unfree
on the job? What might your interview indicate about work in your society?

Reflect on the interview. Was the conversation more relaxed? Did you feel you were able to get sufficient
information from your subject? What differences were there in this style of interview from a more formal
interview process? How might the information you got be different?

INTRODUCTION What's going on in the world? In your country? In your community? Visit any news site or
pick up any newspaper, and look at the top stories. The most prominent news of the day usually involves one or
more of the following: the actions of leaders, social decision-making, legal issues, social protest, and forms of
social violence. These are all elements of the sociocultural dynamics of power--more commonly referred to as
politics.
The actors in this global drama are most often nation-states, or more specifically, the people and groups
representing nation-states. Britain is leaving the European Union. Russia is wracked with protests again Putin.
Myanmar has been taken over by a military coup. When people think about what's going on in the world, they
252  8 · Authority, Decisions, and Power: Political Anthropology

     often think about actions of or within nation-states. Our very notion of the world is primarily structured by the
     nation-state form. Just look at any globe.

     Because of this state-centric focus, it is tempting to think that politics essentially refers to the internal and
     external dynamics of nation-states. Anthropologists, with their attention to human history and sociocultural
     diversity, recognize that the nation-state is one system among many used by humans to make collective
     decisions and maintain social order. Over the past 200,000 years, modern humans have developed a wide
     variety of political systems for managing power in coordination with the other elements of society. The nation-
     state is a relative newcomer among political forms, dating back only a few hundred years. Much more common
     in human history are decision-making systems based on extended families and positions of formal leadership
     associated with those family systems.

     The field of political anthropology was originally established with the goal of categorizing the diversity of
     political systems found all over the world. Initially, anthropologists identified one fundamental difference
     among political systems--whether or not they have a centralized leader or leaders. Building on this distinction,
     anthropologists have explored how certain subsistence patterns coordinate with specific political systems.

     Anthropologists studying colonialism have described the global spread of the nation-state form as it
     dominated, incorporated, and sometimes eliminated other political systems. Though the nation-state political
     form now governs most societies, alternative forms of leadership and decision-making still exert a great deal of
     influence, either directly or indirectly. In some places, these alternative forms continue to exist, although they
     are marginalized by the power of the state. In other places, the alternative political structures have been
     destroyed, but the values associated with them persevere in the hearts and minds of contemporary peoples.

     8.1 Colonialism and the Categorization of Political Systems

     LEARNING OUTCOMES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       · Trace the colonial origins of political anthropology.
       · Identify European misconceptions about non-Western political organization.
       · Discuss the importance of the book African Political Systems.
       · Distinguish between acephalous and centralized political organization.
       · Describe the association between modes of subsistence and political organization.
       · Identify and briefly define Max Weber's three types of authority.

     As discussed in Work, Life, Value: Economic Anthropology, many European countries began developing formal
     colonial rule over other parts of the world in the late 1800s. Their main motivation was to secure the raw
     materials they needed to fuel their own growing industrial economies. As they began to establish their own
     governments in colonized societies, European administrators were highly influenced by ethnocentric
     stereotypes of non-Western peoples. Typically, they assumed that non-Western societies either were ruled by
     overbearing tyrants or were chaotic anarchies with no political organization whatsoever.

     The establishment of colonial rule provided the administrative context for anthropologists to study non-
     Western societies in countries under European domination. As cultural anthropologists conducted research in
     African colonies during the early part of the 20th century, they made the surprising discovery that European
     assumptions about African political organization were completely misguided. In 1940, British anthropologists
     Meyer Fortes and E. E. Evans-Pritchard published a particularly important collection of essays written by a
     variety of anthropologists with ethnographic experience in societies all over Africa. This book, African Political
     Systems, completely invalidated the idea that Indigenous African politics were either oppressive or chaotic.
     The eight chapters all demonstrated that African societies were meticulously organized systems with well-
     defined institutions for political representation and collaborative decision-making.

     In their overview of the chapters, Fortes and Evans-Pritchard make a primary distinction between centralized
     political systems, which feature rulers such as chiefs, and acephalous (meaning "headless") societies, where
     power is exerted through families or village meetings rather than formal political office. Africa featured a
     broad array of both centralized and acephalous forms of political organization, each one an effective means of

maintaining social order. In an effort to demonstrate the cohesion and stability of precolonial political forms,
Fortes and Evans-Pritchard applied a structural-functionalist perspective to show how the various elements of
each society fit together in a durable whole, reproduced through social action over time.

With the resurgence of evolutionary social theory in the 1960s and 1970s, anthropologist Elman Service drew
from previous typologies to propose four main forms of social organization, each with its own political system.
His four main categories of social organization are band, tribe, chiefdom, and state, and they are linked to the
subsistence patterns discussed in Work, Life, Value: Economic Anthropology (Service 1962). Gathering and
hunting is associated with bands. Horticulture gives rise to tribal societies. Chiefdoms are developed on the
basis of agricultural surplus. And states rely on multiple modes of subsistence as well as military conquest and
extensive regional trade, leading to the development of multiethnic territories. Critical of the timeless
representations of structural functionalism, neo-evolutionists such as Service were interested in
understanding how societies moved from one category to the next in an evolutionary sequence.

Contemporary political anthropologists are much more interested in history than evolution; that is, they
emphasize the importance of the past while rejecting the notion that all societies can be classified according to
stages in an evolutionary scheme of development from simple to complex. Anthropologists are similarly
critical of the structural-functional approach that represents non-Western societies as timeless and
unchanging. More often, political anthropologists explore the particular histories of political practices and
institutions in the societies they study, emphasizing the equivalent political sophistication and unique
historical trajectory of each society.

While based on fieldwork, political anthropology is also informed by models of political structure devised by
sociologists. Sociologist Max Weber defined politics as the exercise of power (or at least the attempt to exercise
power). Power is the ability to influence people and/or shape social processes and social structures. In many
acephalous societies, power is spread widely among members of a society, while in centralized societies,
power is concentrated in one or more sociocultural roles. These roles are called positions of authority. Weber
defined three types of authority: traditional, charismatic, and rational-legal (Weber 1946). Priests and family
elders exercise traditional authority, based on religious expertise or position in family structures. Charismatic
authority is power exercised through personal qualities such as skilled oratory, extraordinary abilities, or
social charm. Such power is persuasive, meaning it is based on the ability to convince others rather than force
them to obey. Rational-legal authority is power that is defined by a legal role in society, such as prime minister
or president. Once elected or assigned to a rational-legal position, a person exercises the authority vested in
that position. Such power is coercive--that is, based on the legal ability to force people to obey.

In the next two sections, we'll take a look at the four main types of social organization described by Service,
along with the political forms associated with each. The first two, bands and tribes, correspond with the
category of acephalous societies noted by Fortes and Evans-Pritchard. The last two, chiefdoms and states, are
forms of social organization featuring centralized leadership. Throughout this chapter, we will consider the
features of each idealized category, mindful that the diversity of political organization in the world is more of a
spectrum than a set of discrete categories. At one end of the spectrum, power is more widely shared among all
members of a community, while at the other end, power is more centralized and formalized in bureaucratic
institutions. Moreover, while each society is fundamentally structured by a particular model of political
organization, most societies feature a variety of forms of authority, representation, and decision-making that
intersect and interact with the dominant form--and sometimes contradict and undermine it. While
archaeologists often consider how one form of sociopolitical order might develop into another, cultural
anthropologists are typically careful to avoid simplistic typologies of cultural evolution.

In this chapter, we'll take a modified approach between those two positions by detailing the categories of
political organization and discussing common paths of social change from one system to another. However, it's
important to emphasize that societies develop not along one single evolutionary path but through complex and
often unpredictable processes of historical change.

     8.2 Acephalous Societies: Bands and Tribes

     LEARNING OUTCOMES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       · Define the category of acephalous societies.
       · Identify three types of acephalous political organization.
       · Describe leadership in band societies.
       · Outline the organization of lineage orders.
       · Explain why many anthropologists avoid the use of the word tribe.
       · Define the roles of leopard-skin chiefs and big men.
       · Explain how age-grade systems complement lineage organization.
       · Describe the village democracy of precolonial Igbo society.

     Any group without an official leader is acephalous. When you go out with a group of friends, how do you make
     decisions about where to go, how to get there, and who will pay for what? Probably someone makes a
     suggestion, people chime in with their own ideas, and you discuss things as a group and reach an informal
     consensus. This is what many small groups do.

     Until the early 20th century, many Europeans believed that all humans were essentially selfish and would
     relentlessly pursue their own personal interests without the moralizing forces of civilization to force them to
     be more cooperative. They assumed that any non-Western society without formal leadership and codified laws
     would necessarily be a chaotic free-for-all of greed, coercion, and violence. Anthropologists discovered
     otherwise. Just as you and your friends easily make decisions without electing a leader or writing down rules,
     people who live in small communities do just fine without formal leadership and law.

     In such communities, power is not concentrated in any formal position of leadership but rather diffused
     throughout society. Elders or people with experience in certain areas may give valuable advice, but they do not
     have the power to enforce their judgments. Their authority is based on persuasive power--that is, their ability
     to convince others and build group consensus. Certainly in any group there will be some people who want to
     exert power or force their own ideas on others, but without a formal mechanism allowing such people to
     enforce their will, others can generally ignore or evade them. The result is a mostly cooperative social order
     rather than chaos and strife.

     Fortes and Evans-Pritchard described three types of acephalous societies. The first corresponds to what we
     have called band societies, or gatherer-hunters living in small groups of 20 to 30 people. As we learned when
     we discussed the Hadza in Chapter 7, Work. Life, Value: Economic Anthropology, such groups are strongly
     egalitarian, stressing equality, cooperation, and sharing. People make decisions through discussion and
     consensus. Those with knowledge and experience in particular areas may exert influence in those areas, but
     there are no formal positions of leadership.

     Social groups often face decisions regarding their mode of subsistence. As just one example, nomadic
     gatherer-hunter groups must decide where to camp and how long to stay there before moving on. Frank
     Marlowe, an anthropologist who studies the Hadza, describes how men sometimes suggest that it's time to
     move on, but the group won't move "until the women are good and ready" (Marlowe 2010, 40). As the primary
     gatherers, women are best able to gauge whether food resources have been depleted in the area. When they
     have to walk too far to gather food, they agree that it's time to move camp. On a daily basis, women going out in
     gathering groups must decide where to go and which resources to target, making such decisions through a
     quick conversation.

     Most people known someone in their family or group of friends who likes to tell others the best way to do
     things, and perhaps even wants to get their own way all of the time. This is the case in many small groups.
     Among the Hadza, if someone tries to tell other people what to do, the others just ignore that person. If the
     problem persists, people might just move to another camp to get away from the bossy person. Government
     officials and missionaries who try to tell the Hadza what to do are often met with the same general tendency to
     ignore or avoid potential authority figures.

8.2 · Acephalous Societies: Bands and Tribes                                                                       255

While band societies have no political structure whatsoever, a second type of acephalous society relies on
extended family structures and/or councils to organize leadership, decision-making, and conflict resolution.
Elman Service (1962) referred to these as tribal societies. Service's "tribal" form of social organization is
associated with modes of subsistence such as pastoralism and horticulture, in which extended families control
certain resources such as animals or land. Such communities are typically larger than bands, living in groups
ranging from a few hundred to several thousand people.

A cautionary note about the words tribe and tribal. Too often, the adjective tribal is used to describe seemingly
irrational group loyalties and conflicts, particularly in non-Western societies. Western journalists sometimes
attempt to explain civil wars and guerrilla resistance in non-Western parts of the world in terms of "ancient
tribal hatred" among various groups. The word tribe carries connotations of primitive lifeways and collective
groupthink. In fact, many contemporary conflicts that are attributed to "tribal" animosity occur between
groups that got along just fine before the colonial period of European domination. In Rwanda, for instance, the
horticultural Hutu and pastoral Tutsi were engaged in cooperative relations and symbiotic forms of trade in
precolonial times. Under a divide-and-rule strategy of colonial domination, the Belgians privileged the Tutsi
with educational opportunities and jobs in colonial administration, which created resentment among the
mostly agrarian Hutu. In this competitive context, group identities became fixed and rigid. The 1994 genocide
in Rwanda is largely a result of these colonial processes fostering division, bias, and competition among these
two groups.

Because the word has been so often misused, some anthropologists have replaced the term tribe with the term
ethnic group to describe large collectivities based on a sense of common ancestry and shared culture. Many
anthropology texts do continue to use the term tribal to refer to a specific form of sociopolitical organization
based on extended family groups. Many Indigenous groups also use the term to refer to their social groups. It's
one thing for people in a group to use the term tribe to refer to their own social group and quite another to use
the word to describe a whole category of social organization. Service's term tribal was never a unified category
anyway, as it refers to communities with a great diversity of forms of political organization. Some rely
primarily on extended family structures to provide authority and processes of decision-making, while others
rely on special groups or councils and still others use both.

As you will learn in Chapter 11, Forming Family through Kinship, a lineage is a group of people related by a
common ancestor through either the maternal or the paternal line. In lineage orders, communities consist of
two or more lineage groups, each one with an elder or group of elders that plays a prominent role in
establishing consensus and settling disputes within the lineage. Such leaders do not occupy formal positions of
leadership, but rather exercise informal authority through their accumulated knowledge and their ability to
persuade members of the lineage to follow their instructions. Like band societies, lineage orders tend to be
fairly egalitarian.

Some lineage societies, such as the Nuer of South Sudan, are segmentary lineages. These consist of family
units called minimal lineages, which are encompassed by larger groups called maximal lineages, which are
subsumed by even larger groups called clans. Minimal lineages are groups that trace descent from a common
great-grandfather. In disputes between minimal lineages, people can recruit allies from the larger groups of
kin, though there are no leaders in these larger groups. In this way, the Nuer mobilize their interlocking kin
networks to maintain group cohesion and settle conflicts.

In his ethnographic work, E. E. Evans-Pritchard (1940) describes the Nuer as both fiercely independent and
strongly egalitarian. Rather than accumulating wealth, people shared with others in their kin groups. However,
fighting was very common. Since there were no formal methods of settling conflicts, people responded to
offenses and disputes by fighting with clubs or spears. When someone was killed (which was not uncommon),
the perpetrator would seek out the assistance of a special mediator called a leopard-skin chief, so named
because they wore leopard skins to indicate their role. These mediators were not really chiefs at all, as their
positions were informal and they had no power to coerce anyone or enforce their judgments. Leopard-skin
chiefs were outside the lineages of the disputing parties and therefore respected as neutral parties. Their role
was to negotiate a settlement between the perpetrator and the victim's family in order to avoid retaliation and
an escalation of violence. Typically, compensation took the form of cattle paid out to the victim's family over a
period of several years.
256  8 · Authority, Decisions, and Power: Political Anthropology

     FIGURE 8.2 Nuer people in 1906. Nuer culture has been described as both fiercely independent and strongly
     egalitarian. When conflicts grew intense, people consulted a "leopard-skin chief" to mediate between fighting
     parties. (credit: "Nuer People, 1906" by National Geographic/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)

     Another informal position of leadership, common to lineage-order societies in Melanesia and New Guinea, is
     the role of the big man. Although lineage orders are generally egalitarian, a man can distinguish himself
     through the accumulation of wealth, public acts of generosity, and the performance of verbal skills. Like
     leopard-skin chiefs, big men do not hold formal office and have no official power to enforce their will. Their
     power is persuasive, not coercive. By sponsoring feasts and helping young men pay bride wealth, big men
     attract loyal followers who respect their authority and follow their commands. Big men settle disputes within
     communities and represent local peoples in their dealings with outsiders. Though the accumulation of wealth
     and prestige is necessary to become a big man, far more important is the equitable distribution of wealth and
     service to the community. Greed and selfishness are abhorred. Anthropologist Leopold Pospisil (1963)
     described an incident among the Kapauku of New Guinea in which a man who refused to share resources with
     the less fortunate in his community was punished by death.

     In some acephalous societies, communities are fundamentally organized through a system of age-related
     groups called age sets. An age set is a group of similarly aged people in a community who share a common
     social status with permitted roles, activities, and responsibilities. An array of age sets may be organized into a
     hierarchical age grade system, dividing members of the community into children, youths, adults, and elders
     (the term age set refers to the group, while the term age grade refers to the level in the hierarchy). Most often,
     age sets are gendered, with female and male versions of the same grade. In adolescence, males and females of
     similar ages are summoned at different times for initiation into the age set of their teenage years, either young
     men or young women. Strong lifelong bonds are formed through age sets, creating solidarities that cross
     lineage and clan boundaries in a community.

     The Shavante (or Xavante) of central Brazil have eight age sets, spaced approximately five years apart (Flowers
     1994; Maybury-Lewis 1967). Children are not formally in an age set but constitute an undifferentiated group of
     socially immature beings. Boys between the ages of 7 and 12 leave their family household and go to live in a
     bachelor's hut. After about five years, the set of boys is initiated into the age set of young warriors through a
     complex set of rituals that takes about a year to complete. In the lower age sets, senior men teach young men
     the important skills of hunting, singing, and performing public ceremonies. Initiated men of all age sets attend
     councils every evening where community matters are discussed and debated. Girls have their own age sets
     and initiation rituals. When a woman has her first child, for instance, she is awarded her formal adult name in
     a public ceremony and thereby enters the adult women's age set.

     In addition to bands and lineage orders, a third and more atypical form of acephalous political organization is
     village democracy. Western students are often taught that democracy was invented in the ancient Greek city-
     state of Athens. Considering themselves heirs to the classical political tradition, Europeans who established

8.3 · Centralized Societies: Chiefdoms and States                                                                   257

colonial rule over African territories typically thought that they were bringing more enlightened ways of
governing to African societies. But the Igbo of eastern Nigeria were already practicing a highly effective form of
homegrown democracy before the arrival of the British. Indeed, many anthropologists reject the notion that
democracy was invented by the Greeks. Lacking formal rulers, most acephalous societies practice forms of
discussion and consensus-building that resemble democratic systems. In fact, the egalitarian and highly
participatory form of democracy in such societies might be considered far more democratic than the form of
representational democracy in large, Western societies, dominated by wealthy campaign donors and powerful
lobbyists.

In precolonial Igbo villages, an array of social groups provided arenas for public discussion and the
representation of different interests and perspectives (Isichei 1978, 71-75). Each group met frequently for
discussion of current issues. A nuclear family formed a group headed by the father, and each lineage formed a
larger group headed by a lineage elder. Women and men each had their own groups, and people were further
divided into gendered age grades of people of roughly the same age. In some villages, there was even a group of
very old women who inspected the town to maintain sanitation. At the highest level was a group of town elders
comprising the leaders of other groups. After consulting on a particular issue, the elders would summon a
general town meeting attended by everyone in the community. At this meeting, anyone could stand up and
voice their opinion. Good contributions were cheered and applauded, while frivolous ones were jeered and
dismissed by the audience of townspeople. The goal of group discussion at all levels was to reach consensus.
With no formal positions, leaders had no coercive power. The role of group leaders was to chair discussion and
facilitate the process of reaching consensus.

Anthropologists have described similar systems of decision-making through public councils in many societies
all over the world, even in communities within chiefdoms or states. Anthropologists Audrey Richards and
Adam Kuper formed a research group to compare and contrast forms of decision-making in councils, resulting
in their book Councils in Action (1971). While in acephalous societies, councils are the main arena of public
decision-making, councils play a more advisory role in societies with centralized authority.

8.3 Centralized Societies: Chiefdoms and States

LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Describe how lineage orders may develop into chiefdoms.
  · Evaluate the economic, religious, and militaristic aspects of chiefdoms.
  · Identify practices of popular representation in chiefdoms.
  · Provide two detailed examples of chiefdoms.
  · Explain integrative and conflict pressures of state formation.
  · Enumerate the features of state societies.
  · Describe social inequality in state societies.
  · Define ideology and hegemony and explain their importance in state societies.

As mentioned in the last section, lineage orders are commonly associated with horticultural and pastoral
societies, as well as societies that practice some combination of the two. Recall from Work, Life, Value:
Economic Anthropology that such societies produce little beyond what they consume locally; they don't
produce substantial surplus. If conditions are favorable, some such societies may intensify their farming
methods with the development of irrigation systems, terracing, or use of the plow. The organization of labor
and resources necessary to develop terracing and systems of irrigation fosters stronger forms of community
authority. These intensive methods generate agricultural surplus, which allows some members of the
community to specialize in craft production as well as in forms of religious and political leadership.
Agricultural surplus can also be traded with other communities in regional networks. These factors promote
the local accumulation of wealth.

The process of agricultural intensification often results in the centralization of power. Big men or lineage
elders acquire the authority to command the labor of others and control the storage and distribution of
agricultural surplus. They take on the role of organizing regional trade. They oversee the construction of
258  8 · Authority, Decisions, and Power: Political Anthropology

     infrastructure such as roads and irrigation systems. They organize groups of local young people to protect the
     community. They perform important community rituals to ensure agricultural productivity and community
     prosperity. Over time, such leaders may seek to hand down their leadership roles to their own kin in
     subsequent generations. As leadership becomes inherited, one lineage in a community may emerge as a royal
     lineage.

     Chiefdoms

     Anthropologists refer to those with formal, inherited positions of community leadership as chiefs. Over time, a
     chief can expand their dominion to incorporate several towns and villages into a small chiefdom. Chiefs may
     form political alliances with other regional chiefs in large pyramidal systems consisting of various levels of
     village chiefs and regional chiefs, with one very powerful chief at the top. When a chiefdom expands to
     encompass multiple ethnic groups in a regional empire, the leader is referred to as a king.

     Chiefdoms are a very common form of political organization, found in historical and contemporary societies
     all over the world. Archaeologists and cultural anthropologists have discovered chiefdoms in Africa, Oceania,
     the Middle East, Europe, East and Southeast Asia, and North, Central, and South America. While there is
     considerable diversity in the way these various systems of chieftaincy operate, anthropologists have identified
     a set of elements common to many of them. The fusing of multiple forms of power is the defining feature of
     chiefdoms, common to all of them. Economic, political, religious, and military power are all concentrated in
     the position of the chief.

     In Mesopotamia, the cities of Sumer were initially ruled by religious priests who represented local gods and
     oversaw work on common lands. Over time, priests began to share their power with secular governors who
     maintained law and order, managed the economy, and led military campaigns. Eventually, religious and civil
     power became fused in the office of the lugal. As lugals solidified their power, they began passing down their
     office to their sons, establishing dynasties.

     Central to the power of a chief is control over economic resources such as land, agricultural surplus, and trade.
     Chiefs often hold land in public trust, determining who may farm where and also allocating farmland to
     newcomers. They have their own farming plots, commanding regular public labor to work on them. Farmers
     are obliged to channel a portion of their surplus to the chief, who holds it in storage facilities for public feasts
     or distribution to those in need. Chiefs regulate local trade and negotiate regional trade networks to benefit
     their own communities. They control the production and distribution of certain prestige goods, such as royal
     textiles and ornaments made of jade, gold, copper, or shell.

Imperial Chiefdoms: Hawaii and Asante

military fortifications. (credit: Tyfferz Y/flickr, CC BY 2.0)

Chiefdoms developed throughout the Polynesian Pacific, including the peoples of Hawaii, Tahiti, Samoa, and
Tonga and the Maori of New Zealand. In Hawaii, chieftaincy developed from the intensive cultivation of taro
using systems of irrigation and terracing (Earle 2011). Hawaiian chiefs controlled the distribution of land,
giving out subsistence plots in return for labor in their own gardens. They used accumulated wealth and
communal labor to build roads, garden terraces, fish ponds, and military fortifications. Their power was
reinforced by a belief system that identified chiefs as god figures responsible for agricultural prosperity and
social welfare. Chiefs conducted important annual religious rituals to ensure the success of crops. They
commanded public labor to build and refurbish shrines for the worship of local gods, personal gods, and high
gods such as Lono. Military forces were recruited and commanded by chiefs who used them to defend their
chiefdoms and expand their territories.

Militarism is another common feature of chiefdoms throughout the world. While the power of leaders in
acephalous societies depends on their ability to persuade others to do what they say, chiefs have coercive
power to force people to carry out their commands. The powerful West African chiefdom of Asante was
originally founded in 1700 as a military confederation of chiefs who united to defeat the neighboring Denkyira.
Under the Asantehene (the king), the top chiefs commanded different divisions of the military, including the
scouts, the advance guard, the main body, the right and left wings, and the rear guard. As commander in chief,
the Asantehene coordinated these divisions into a highly effective military machine that conquered a region
larger than present-day Ghana. Subduing neighboring groups enabled the Asantehene to collect tribute in the
form of agricultural surplus, trade goods, and slaves.

Also common to many chiefdoms is the promotion of moral and religious ideology that supports the legitimacy
of their rule. Like Hawaiian chiefs, Asante chiefs were considered to be embodied links to the realm of the
supernatural, and they conducted rituals and ceremonies for the benefit of the community. Every 40 days,
Asante chiefs led processions to present ritual gifts of food and drink to the ancestors and ask for their
blessings to ensure the fertility of the land and the well-being of the people. Although they wielded great power,
260  8 · Authority, Decisions, and Power: Political Anthropology

     Asante chiefs were bound by a morality that compelled them to use resources such as land and gold for the
     good of the people rather than for private benefit.

     Europeans who colonized African societies often assumed that African chiefs were cruel despots who used
     violence and exploitation to enrich themselves and oppress their subjects. On the contrary, research by
     historians and anthropologists has revealed that many African chiefdoms were highly moralized political
     systems that incorporated checks and balances on the rule of the chief.

     Among the Akans (the larger cultural group that includes the Asante), there were several avenues for popular
     representation and critique as well as a procedure for getting rid of inept and corrupt chiefs. At the advisory
     level, the chief was guided by a council of elders as well as the queen mother, often his aunt, mother, or sister.
     The young men of the community formed a group called asafo that had as one of its many purposes the
     responsibility to represent popular opinion to the chief and his advisors. If the people wished to depose their
     chief, they could communicate their wishes to the young men, who then conveyed the message to the queen
     mother, who would then advise the chief to mend his ways. If he didn't, the young men could seize him, touch
     his feet to the ground (thus ritually defiling him), shoot off a gun, and declare him deposed. At that point, the
     queen mother would meet with the elders to nominate a new chief. In Akan societies, it was far easier to
     depose a bad chief than it is to impeach a bad president in the US political system.

     States

     Starting around 5,000 years ago, a new form of political organization emerged independently in many parts of
     the world, including Mesopotamia, China, Egypt, India, Mesoamerica, and South America. As some societies in
     these areas became more populous and hierarchical, their leaders developed modes of governance that
     combined forms of economic extraction such as taxation and tribute with mechanisms of social control such
     as law and policing. These governments used public revenues to build infrastructure and monuments. They
     developed extensive bureaucracies to interpret and enforce laws and maintain social order. Large military
     forces defended and expanded control over territory, resulting in multiethnic empires. The government

asserted a monopoly on the use of violence, meaning that only the government was allowed to use extreme
forms of violence to control or punish anyone. Societies with this form of political organization are called state
societies (Brumfiel 2001).

Many of the features of states mentioned above are common to the political organization of chiefdoms, and
indeed states have generally emerged from the increasing centralization of political power in large chiefdoms.
This concentration of power happens gradually over time, stimulated by a variety of pressures, some very
general and universal and others more particular to the context of specific societies. Population growth and
increasing social stratification are among the more general pressures, while the militaristic threats of specific
neighboring societies and the particular opportunities of regional trade affect societies in different ways.
Attempting to explain the rise of the state, theorists emphasize two sets of forces that propel the process:
integrative pressures and conflict pressures.

Integrative pressures arise from the need for greater coordination in order to satisfy the needs of a growing
population. As the population increases, agricultural production must also be increased to meet subsistence
needs and for trade. Leaders are compelled to organize more complex irrigation systems and forms of
landscape management, such as terracing and raised fields. These complex systems are built and maintained
using public resources and labor. Increasing trade also exerts an integrative force, as leaders strive to
maximize the wealth of their societies by stimulating production of agricultural and craft goods and
establishing local markets and regional trade opportunities. As agriculture and trade become more complex,
power becomes more centralized in order to manage the necessary conditions and infrastructure for
economic growth.

Conflict pressures arise from the need to manage both internal and external threats to the power of leaders
and the integrity of their societies. Some theorists argue that political power becomes increasingly centralized
as a leader builds a large military force and wages long-term warfare to defend and expand territory.
Conquering neighboring societies allows leaders to command regular tribute. In addition to conquest, military
forces provide leaders with large cadres of loyal, well-armed supporters. Other theorists argue that internal
tensions are just as pivotal to the centralization of power. State societies are built upon a system of social
stratification; that is, they feature class and caste systems with unequal access to wealth and power. With the
emergence of a class of privileged elites governing over urban craft workers and rural peasantry, leaders face
new forms of inequality and potential conflict. Systems of law and ideology are developed to command the
cooperation of disadvantaged groups.

Archaic States: The Aztecs

In the 14th century, the Aztec state of Mesoamerica arose from a combination of integrative and conflict
pressures. Migrants to the area, the Mexica (as they called themselves) first worked as mercenaries for other
regional powers, then established their own city of Tenochtitlan on an island in the middle of Lake Texcoco
(Peters-Golden 2002). As newcomers, the Mexica were keen to build up the military might necessary to defend
their new settlement. They joined forces with two neighboring states to defeat the regional superpower and
establish a "Triple Alliance" of three city-states, which they came to dominate. To strengthen their position,
they also sought to generate wealth through agricultural surplus, craft manufacture, and trade. At the height of
its power in the 15th century, the Aztec state comprised some 50 individual city-states, each with its own ruler
who served the Aztec king. The Aztec empire spanned most of present-day central and southern Mexico.
262  8 · Authority, Decisions, and Power: Political Anthropology

     FIGURE 8.5 A rendering of Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztec empire, by artist Diego Rivera. Tenochtitlan was a

     Domain)

     The Aztec state was constructed on a foundation of intensive agriculture, particularly the cultivation of maize.
     Beans, squash, chiles, cotton, cacao, and other produce also contributed to subsistence and trade. Farmers
     used a variety of cultivation methods, the most intensive being chinampas agriculture. Chinampas are
     rectangular plots constructed out of layers of mud and vegetation piled up in a shallow part of a lake and
     secured with anchoring poles. Using this cultivation method, farmers produced a hefty surplus, which was
     heavily taxed by the state. This surplus fed urban classes of craftspeople, warriors, bureaucrats, and nobles.
     Farmers formed the class of commoners who lived outside the urban centers of government and trade. They
     lived in mud houses roofed with thatch and wore simple clothes with cloaks that were required by law to end
     above the knee.

     The agricultural base was diversified by urban classes of craft manufacturers, including weavers, sculptors,
     goldsmiths, and feather workers. Many of these products were not for general use but reserved for rulers and
     nobles, giving these craftspeople a class distinction above agricultural commoners. These craftspeople were
     organized into guilds and lived in exclusive neighborhoods near the nobles they served. Also included in the
     urban classes were merchants who traveled throughout central Mexico, trading Aztec goods within and beyond
     the empire.

     The Aztecs were a highly militant society, valuing perpetual warfare as a political and religious necessity. All
     young men were expected to serve in the military, waging wars of conquest to collect tribute and captives. A
     class of warrior elites enjoyed high social status, living among other elite classes in major urban centers. This
     class was divided into two groups, the Eagle and Jaguar cults.

     At the top level of this highly stratified society were nobles who could trace their ancestry back to the first
     Aztec rulers. Only nobles could live in two-story stone houses and wear headbands, gold armbands, and jewels
     in their lips, ears, and noses. Nobles owned land and monopolized positions in government and religion. Each
     city-state was governed by a noble ruler, considered a representative of the gods, who collected tribute from
     commoners, organized military campaigns, sponsored public feasts, and settled disputes. Government
     consisted of the city-state ruler and their advisors, a bureaucracy for collecting tribute, a justice system of high
     and lesser courts, and the lesser rulers of provinces and towns.

     At the very bottom of the class system were serfs and enslaved people, who were commoners who had gotten
     into debt and/or been sold into slavery. People who fell on hard times economically could sell themselves or
     their kin into servitude.

     Through the coordinated labor of these classes, the Aztecs built a sprawling empire of tributary provinces all

channeling wealth to the core of three city-states, headed by Tenochtitlan. The largest city in the Americas at
the time, Tenochtitlan was a professionally planned symmetrical city with well-maintained roads, canals,
gardens, and markets. The center of the city was dominated by around 45 large stone buildings, including
temples, pyramids, and palaces. The ruler's palace had 100 rooms, each with its own bathroom. The city had a
zoo, an aquarium, and botanical gardens. Life was congenial and luxurious for nobles who lived in such a
beautiful and culturally stimulating environment.

Life was not so great for the vast majority of commoners, serfs, and slaves who toiled long hours on the land,
struggling to pay the tribute and taxes that supported the very luxuries that were denied to them. Why did they
do it?

Every state has a set of institutions for maintaining social order, such as law, courts, police, and military forces.
The Aztecs had a complex legal system that banned drunkenness, adultery, and homicide, among other
crimes. Even more important for the cohesion of social classes were laws that banned any behavior above
one's own social class. Commoners who wore elite forms of dress, built elaborate houses, or tried to obtain
private property could be punished by death. Under these conditions, people tended to accept the social class
they were born into rather than struggle to change their class status or the hierarchical system of classes as a
whole.

Even more powerful than state law was a set of ideas and practices threaded throughout the daily lives of Aztec
peoples at all levels of society. The official religion of the Aztecs emphasized the importance of continual
sacrifice in order to keep the world functioning. In the Aztec origin myth, the gods sacrificed themselves to
generate the world, offering up their own blood to put the sun in motion. This act of sacrifice put humans
forever in debt to the gods, with continual rituals of human sacrifice required to appease them. Without blood
sacrifice, the world would end. Priests conducted ritual sacrifices of men, women, and children throughout the
year. Many victims were warriors captured in constant battles with neighboring states. Conquered provinces
were required to provide a continuous supply of victims to fuel the ritual calendar.

Ideology and Hegemony

People are often shocked to learn about the prevalence of human sacrifice in Aztec society. We might wonder,
how could people go along with such routine public violence conducted by representatives of the state? How
did they not protest?

Every society develops a set of dominant ideas that frame the existing social order as the way things should be.
These ideas form a narrative about the way the world works and the roles of different groups in promoting
social harmony and collective prosperity. Typically, a society has many competing ideas about the way the
world works, each one reflecting the perspectives and experiences of a particular group. The worldview of a
particular group or class in society is called an ideology. Literary theorist Terry Eagleton (1991) describes
ideology as an intertwined set of ideas, values, and symbols that can be either conscious or unconscious. When
an ideology transcends one group to become the dominant way nearly all people in a society think about social
reality, it becomes hegemony. Hegemony is a strategic set of "common sense" ideas that support the social
order.

As a form of sociopolitical organization, the state requires the vast majority of citizens to lead lives of hard
labor and sacrifice in order to support classes of artisans and nobles who live in great cities full of bustling
trade, luxurious goods, and monumental architecture. Tearing the heart from a victim on a public altar may
seem shocking, but the logic of sacrifice serves as a metaphor for the bodily sacrifice of commoners required
to endure lives of hardship to support the well-being of the state. To manage the inequality of classes and
ensure the cooperation of all groups, the Aztecs came to embrace the hegemonic notion that sacrifice was
necessary to ensure the very existence of the world.

The wealth of all state societies, past and present, rests on the hardship of manual laborers at the bottom of the
social hierarchy. The dominant ideas of any state are ways of justifying the inequality inherent to all states.
These ideas are highly variable. Some societies emphasize religious ideologies of self-sacrifice or the dangers
of eternal damnation. Others celebrate economic ideologies of economic growth and consumerism. In
American society, for instance, some believe it is necessary to keep the minimum wage of workers very low in
264  8 · Authority, Decisions, and Power: Political Anthropology

     order to protect economic growth, an idea not so far removed from notions of bodily sacrifice. In recent
     decades, the American system has offset these low wages by supplying working-class people with a vast array
     of cheap consumer goods. The relentless stream of advertising pervading social life continuously reiterates the
     consumerist mantras of affordability and satisfaction. Ironically, however, those goods are cheap because
     American manufacturers have relocated their factories to parts of the world where they can pay workers even
     less than they would pay Americans. The dominant ideology of consumerism draws attention away from the
     conditions of work and production and toward the ideals of choice and leisure.

     As both Aztec and American societies demonstrate, the economic and political systems of state societies are
     deeply entwined, and this relationship is often reflected in the dominant ideas of a society. Political economy
     is the study of the way political and economic realms frequently reinforce and sometimes contradict one
     another over time.

     8.4 Modern Nation-States

     LEARNING OUTCOMES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       · Distinguish nation from state and describe how the two are linked in modern nation-states.
       · Define the concept of imagined communities.
       · Identify the importance of colonialism in shaping postcolonial nation-states.
       · Describe the field of postcolonial studies.
       · Explain the fragility of postcolonial states.
       · Provide two examples of the consequences of globalization for national identities and politics.

     Before 1400 or so, the world was a variegated array of empires, kingdoms, and chiefdoms with their tributary
     societies, loosely linked by trade with acephalous societies at the peripheries. The contemporary globe is an
     economically integrated order fundamentally organized into nation-states. How did this happen?

     The nation-state is a hyphenated concept joining two entities, the state and the nation. As discussed earlier,
     the state is an institution exercising centralized rule over a territory. States have bureaucracies that make,
     interpret, and enforce law. States collect taxes and use them to build infrastructure and public works. States
     organize and regulate the economy. States maintain monopoly on the use of force through the military and the
     police. Because states tend to be militant and expansionist, they also tend to form multiethnic empires,
     dominated by one ruling group. Ancient empires did not attempt to absorb their tributary societies into one
     common ethnicity or peoplehood. Ancient states were defined by territory and bureaucracy alone, with no
     effort to achieve cultural uniformity.

     The nation is a much more idealistic and cultural notion. A nation is a sense of cultural belonging or
     "peoplehood." A cousin of the word native, the term nation refers to the original inhabitants of a territory,
     those who were born there. Nations often claim a common language as a sign of group membership. Nations
     tell a common origin story about where they came from, and they ritually commemorate that story in a ritual
     calendar of feasts and holidays. Nations claim a common destiny, a special future or sacred duty assigned to
     them by God. And finally, nations promote certain social norms and values, evaluating individuals and groups
     according to those ideals. The concept of nation is close to the old-fashioned notion of culture as communal
     and unchanging. A nation-state is a state with a common culture, in some cases a dominant ethnicity.

     Political scientist Benedict Anderson (1983) argues that all modern states deliberately cultivate this sense of
     peoplehood for those living in the state. They draw from a large repertoire of methods to summon the loyalty of
     their citizens and reinforce the legitimacy of the state system. Through practices both within and beyond the
     government, state societies encourage their citizens to imagine themselves as part of a larger community of
     like-minded people in a harmonious society bound by a common history and common destiny. Government
     promotes national identity through practices such as elections, censuses, taxes, schools, and the dramas of law
     making, interpretation, and enforcement. Modern states rely on meaningful public rituals and symbols, such
     as flags, anthems, pledges of allegiance, national holidays, historical monuments, and national museums.
     Outside of government, the mass news media highlights the importance of the daily actions of the state,
     providing continual coverage that fixes the attention of citizens on the state as the central power in society.

As a citizen of a nation-state, you will never know all of the members of your national community. Such
communities are far too large to generate organic social groups based on face-to-face interaction. Without all
of the practices and rituals listed above, you might not even consider yourself a member of the larger political
community at all. Because of this, Benedict Anderson refers to nations as imagined communities. By
imagined, Anderson is not arguing that such communities are simply imaginary or not real, but rather that
national identity is a powerful sense of unity that is strategically constructed by the state and mass media.

The nation-states of western Europe grew out of an assemblage of kingdoms and territories, some of them
once incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire. From the 15th to the 19th century, the states of Europe slowly
emerged, one by one, as the various European powers entered into peace agreements that established
international borders and sovereignty over territories. In general, the wars and treaties of political elites meant
very little to the common farmers and traders living in these territories. Among English commoners, for
instance, their sense of community was not much affected by the continually changing map of territories that
constituted the state of England. What did make a difference for European commoners was the development of
the printing press around 1440.

The printing press targeted a growing population of literate commoners. Driven by the capitalist profit motive,
printers sought to reach the widest possible audience. Thus, they printed their books, pamphlets, and
newspapers in local languages rather than in Latin, which was the pan-European language of elites and the
Catholic Church. For each emerging nation-state, mass media helped standardize a diversity of dialects into
one common language that could be used to spread common messages and carry out common practices such
as schooling, law, political campaigns, and government bureaucracy.

FIGURE 8.6 Depiction of the printing process using an early press. The printing press made available ideas and
news to common people in their own language, helping to cement nation-state identities. (credit: Daniel Nikolaus
Chodowiecki/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)

Of course, the printing press did not singlehandedly create the modern nation-states of Europe. Around the
same time that the press began churning out mass discourse, a rising class of capitalist merchants was gaining
economic power, hoping to displace forms of political leadership associated with the church and the feudal
monarchies. The felicitous coincidence of class motivation and printing technology combined to propel the
development of European nation-states.

For Max Weber, the nation-state is associated with the complete formalization of rational-bureaucratic
power--that is, power concentrated in bureaucratic institutions with legal authorities. The legal and political
systems of nation-state bureaucracies often purport to be based on rules and procedures rather than social
status or identities. For instance, in the American system, the ability to vote is based on legal citizenship, not
social class, gender, or ethnic identity. However, legal and political bureaucracies reserve the power to
266  8 · Authority, Decisions, and Power: Political Anthropology

     determine who is and who is not a citizen as well as procedures for voter registration and voting in elections.
     Through these procedures, certain categories of people can be barred or discouraged from voting, resulting in
     racial or ethnic bias. If people of color are less likely to have state-sponsored photo identification (such as a
     driver's license), then laws requiring such ID to vote may constitute forms of racial discrimination.

     French philosopher Michel Foucault (1978, 2007) describes such power to define and control populations of
     citizens as biopower. A special form of power exercised in modern states, biopower includes ways of regulating
     the bodies of citizens, such as practices associated with birth, death, sexuality, wellness, illness, work, and
     leisure. The ability to count and categorize the inhabitants of a state is a form of biopower. The ability to
     confine people who have certain illnesses or bodily conditions or have engaged in certain behaviors is a form
     of biopower. When you walk through a body scanner in an airport security station, you are experiencing a form
     of biopower. While Weber focused on specific institutions in which power is concentrated, Foucault describes
     biopower as a diffuse form of social control, widely practiced by citizens both within and outside state
     bureaucracies. In American society, people routinely carry state-sponsored identification on their bodies (in a
     pocket or purse) wherever they go. The information on this identity card links to bureaucratic files associated
     with a person's citizenship status, criminal history, voter registration, and many other data sets. Bureaucratic
     power is thereby melded to bodies of modern citizens.

     Colonial and Postcolonial States

     Outside of Europe, a similar array of kingdoms, chiefdoms, lineage orders, and village democracies patterned
     much of the rest of the world. Recall that ancient state societies had emerged at various times in Mesopotamia,
     Egypt, China, India, and Central and South America. Kingdoms were prevalent forms of centralized rule on
     most continents as well. All around these highly centralized societies were smaller chiefdoms and acephalous
     communities.

     The continent of Africa, for instance, featured large, centralized states and kingdoms such as Egypt in the
     north; Aksum, Zimbabwe, and Swahili in the east; Luba and Kongo in central Africa; and a multitude of
     kingdoms across West Africa, including the great trade-based empires of Ghana, Mali, and Songhai (Monroe
     2013). As noted in the discussion of acephalous societies, communities outside of these great kingdoms and
     states were politically organized, with forms of leadership, decision-making, and dispute settlement that
     maintained social order.

     British historian Basil Davidson (1992) has argued that African societies such as the Asante and Zulu were
     proto-states, or states in formation, at the time of European colonization. Between 1400 and 1900--the time
     frame during which European nation-states were emerging--many African societies were undergoing similar
     developments as militant kingdoms consolidated large territories of empire. Based on intensive agriculture
     and extensive trade networks across the continent (and beyond), such highly centralized societies had state
     bureaucracies, multiethnic populations, systems of law, and monumental architecture. They also had
     dominant ideologies that emphasized the accumulation and appropriate distribution of wealth. In other words,
     many African societies were state societies well on their way to becoming modern nation-states.

FIGURE 8.7 Precolonial states and empires in Africa. Note how different these are from the way Africa is divided
into nations today. (credit: "African civilizations map pre-colonial," by Jeff Israel/Wikimedia Commons, GNU Free

Instead, colonialism happened. As we learned in Work, Life, Value: Economic Anthropology, the growth of
industrial capitalism prompted the major European powers to seek access to raw materials and markets for
their finished goods. Many set their sights on the mineral wealth and agricultural potential of Africa. European
representatives met in Berlin in 1884-1885 to negotiate their territorial interests on the African continent.
Laying out a map of the continent, they drew boundaries around the areas they hoped to control, though they
knew very little about the land or peoples in much of those areas. They agreed that they could maintain
exclusive claim on those areas only if they established government administrations to rule over the people who
lived there.

By the early 20th century, Europeans had established colonial government over nearly all societies in Africa,
subordinating local African political systems under European rule. As the whole point of colonialism was to
secure resources to fuel European colonies, the colonial states established by Europeans were authoritarian,
militaristic, and extractive. They invaded African territories and slaughtered Africans who would not submit to
European rule. They forced Africans to work on colonial projects such as mines and roads. They made Africans
pay taxes to fund the colonial enterprise. And they designed and controlled African economies to channel
268  8 · Authority, Decisions, and Power: Political Anthropology

     profits to European merchants and manufacturers. Oddly, as European nation-states pulled away from direct
     control over their own economies, European colonial states exerted complete control over colonial economies.
     Moreover, as European nation-states became increasingly participatory and democratic, European colonial
     states were managed in ways that were repressive, authoritarian, and openly violent.

     Because of colonial rule, the two forces that contributed to the rise of the modern nation-state in Europe--a
     wealthy capitalist class and the printing press--were prevented from playing the same role in African societies.
     Africans were deliberately sidelined from the import-export trade and were not allowed to start factories,
     preventing a class of wealthy capitalists from developing under colonial rule. Instead, colonial rule established
     a two-tiered system of governance in the colonies consisting of a militant authoritarian state apparatus
     governing over local African political systems, including proto-states, chiefdoms, lineage orders, and a few
     scattered band societies. In places where there were chiefs, colonial officials used those chiefs to carry out
     colonial policies, often against the wishes and interests of the chiefs' own people. In places where there were
     no chiefs, colonial authorities often forced Africans to pick one to perform those duties. In some colonies,
     African political institutions were banned altogether.

     Anthropologists working on political issues in previously colonized states (such as most African ones) often
     combine historical and contemporary research to understand the intersection of local and foreign influences
     that make up this complex picture. In one form or another, colonial processes shaped the development of
     political systems in Africa, the Middle East, South and Southeast Asia, the Caribbean, the Americas, and
     eastern Europe. The interdisciplinary field of postcolonial studies emerged in the 1970s, combining history,
     anthropology, political science, and area studies in an effort to understand the diversity, complexity, and
     legacy of colonialism throughout the world.

     "Fragile" States and "Failed" States: The Legacies of Colonialism

     The study of African politics provides an excellent example of the weaving of local culture and colonial history
     in the making of contemporary postcolonial societies. Journalists and political scientists frequently lament the
     political instability of African states and their susceptibility to popular unrest, ethnic conflicts, coups, and
     corrupt leadership. Some refer to African states as fragile states or failed states. A fragile state is a government
     that cannot adequately perform the essential functions of a state, such as maintaining law and order, building
     basic infrastructure such as roads and bridges, guaranteeing basic amenities such as electricity and clean
     water, and defending its citizens against violence. Such a state is fragile because it is susceptible to popular
     uprising, coups, civil war, and foreign invasion. A failed state is a state that can no longer perform any state
     functions at all.

     Many anthropologists are critical of this simplistic and ahistorical way of stigmatizing non-Western
     governments. Rather than viewing the world as a set of discrete states in isolation, anthropologists pay
     attention to historical processes of interaction among states that have shaped global patterns of inequality.
     Examining the notions of state fragility and state failure through a critical lens, anthropologist note how some
     states have become more powerful while others have struggled to meet the needs of their peoples.

     At various times over the past 30 years, many African states have qualified as fragile or failed, including
     Somalia, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Côte d'Ivoire, Mali, Zimbabwe, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Since
     2005, the Fragile States Index has ranked all states in the United Nations according to a set of key political,
     economic, and social indicators. Among the top 50 "most fragile" states in the 2020 index, all but two have
     experienced some form of colonial rule, and 35 of the top 50 most fragile states are African states. For more
     information on fragile states see Fragile States Index (https://openstax.org/r/fragilestatesindex).

     Why do so many African states face such deep-seated problems? How did colonialism contribute to the current
     fragility of postcolonial states?

     As an example, take the postcolonial West African state of Ghana. What can an anthropological approach tell
     us about contemporary politics in Ghana? Most African countries won independence in the middle of the 20th
     century. Once free from colonial domination, new classes of African political elites won control over the
     colonial apparatus of the state, including its colonial institutions and boundaries and its bureaucratic rule over
     African chiefdoms and acephalous societies. In other words, at independence, the structure of the state as it

had existed under colonialism remained essentially unchanged. The new leaders of these African states faced
the near-impossible challenge of politically and economically restructuring their states while holding together
the diverse groups existing within colonial boundaries, groups frequently pitted against one another under
colonial rule. As an additional stress, finances were limited and unpredictable.

Leaders such as Kwame Nkrumah, the first prime minister and, later, the first president of Ghana, sought to
reform the state to make it serve the interests of Africans. He started schools and hospitals and built roads,
bridges, and dams in an effort to do all the things a state should do to command the loyalty of its citizens. He
used symbols of chiefdom to promote his own political power, even though he was not a chief or even from a
royal lineage. His administration reduced the regional power of chiefs in an effort to enhance the centralized
power of the state. Nkrumah was wildly popular at first, but over time, economic and regional factors
challenged his rule. Some cocoa farmers felt they were being exploited to fund grand projects benefiting urban
elites. Facing widespread criticism, Nkrumah became increasingly autocratic, throwing political opponents in
prison.

In 1966, nine years after declaring Ghanaian independence from the British, Kwame Nkrumah was
overthrown by a military coup that accused him of corruption and political repression. Over the next 15 years,
Ghana endured four more military coups and two (brief) elected governments, an exceptionally long string of
political instability. Each military coup justified its takeover by claiming the previous regime had been
massively corrupt--and each one eventually became the target of the same accusations of corruption.

Political instability, popular unrest, military coups, corruption--a similar narrative describes the political
development of many other African states. The commonality of political crisis in Africa has prompted many
journalists and policy experts to wonder what is wrong with African states. What is the underlying problem?
Postcolonial studies suggest that we must think both culturally and historically to understand how postcolonial
societies function. Postcolonial states are very often fragile states not because they are doing something wrong
but largely because of the legacies of colonialism.

In many African societies, colonialism tainted precolonial political systems while also constructing a
repressive, authoritarian state. Recall our earlier discussion of checks and balances in the system of
chieftaincy practiced by the Akans. Akan chiefs were expected to act in the interests of their people or else face
the consequences. If a community became unhappy with their chief, the asafo could eventually depose the
chief by force. Though asafo had many civic duties, the term itself literally means "war people," referring to
270  8 · Authority, Decisions, and Power: Political Anthropology

     their role in defense and in deposing bad chiefs.

     British colonial rule put Akan chiefs in a contradictory position. Forced to act as agents of colonial rule, chiefs
     were ordered to collect colonial taxes, supply teams of forced labor, and enforce unpopular colonial laws. At the
     same time, chiefs were presented with new economic opportunities in the colonial system--such as selling off
     land and pocketing the money--that further undermined their commitment to the welfare of their own people.
     As their positions became increasingly conflicted, some chiefs succumbed to the temptations of
     embezzlement, extortion, and authoritarianism.

     Fed up with these corrupt chiefs, many asafo groups took action. In the 1920s, a spate of asafo uprisings
     deposed unpopular chiefs throughout the southern part of the colony. Fearing the consequences of African
     popular protest, British colonial officials quickly suppressed the asafo uprisings and forbid the asafo from any
     further action against their chiefs. So, to be clear, British colonialism corrupted the institution of African
     chieftaincy and then forbade the exercise of African protest against that corruption.

     Now jump ahead to that long period of political instability in Ghana in the latter half of the 20th century.
     Ghanaian anthropologist Maxwell Owusu (1989) argues that this colonial history of corruption and protest has
     shaped postcolonial politics in Ghana. Just as the pressures of colonialism undermined and tainted the Akan
     chieftaincy, the near-impossible mission of the postcolonial state undermined and tainted the Ghanaian
     presidency. Just as asafo groups were motivated by allegations of corruption to rise up and depose their chiefs,
     the Ghanaian military rose up time and time again to depose Ghanaian leaders accused of corruption.

     Nation-States and Globalization

     In the latter part of the 20th century, increasing global flows of trade, people, technologies, communication,
     and ideas all coalesced in a strong but uneven wave of globalization rippling across the globe. To be clear, the
     world has always been integrated by such flows, but advanced technologies combined with the profit drive of
     corporate capitalism forced a sudden acceleration of these processes roughly from the late 1970s into the
     2000s.

     As people, objects, and messages began to travel across national boundaries with increasing frequency and
     speed, many scholars argued that nation-states would lose their relevance as structures of economic and
     political order for their populations. Some scholars thought that globalization would result in the erasure of
     cultural and national differences, replacing global diversity with a uniform culture based on American
     corporate capitalism and consumerism. Would globalization result in the "McDonaldization" of the world?

     As global researchers with a powerful toolkit of cross-cultural methods, anthropologists were uniquely poised
     to address this question. In short, the answer was an emphatic "No!" Rather than diminishing the importance
     of local structures and identities, globalization has transformed and enhanced them. Consider the increasing
     popularity of global travel. Why would anyone go anywhere if things were the same wherever you went? Many
     nation-states invest heavily in their distinctive cultures, monuments, and environmental features in order to
     attract global travelers keen to experience something new and different.

     Consider another strong force of globalization, the increasing tendency for large corporate manufacturers
     based in the United States to relocate their factories to poorer countries where labor is cheaper and
     environmental regulation may be weaker. Initially, this technique undermined the power of nation-states and
     local communities to challenge corporate practices. Over time, however, the resulting loss of well-paid
     working-class jobs in the United States has generated a great deal of political controversy. This loss of working-
     class jobs has resulted in rising levels of inequality in American society. Some politicians call for the American
     government to create incentives and regulations to keep American jobs within American borders. Ironically,
     then, globalization may provoke citizens to enhance the power of their nation-states.

     In poorer countries, globalization has resulted in increased environmental damage as globalized industries
     take advantage of looser regulations. Industrial pollution and the dumping of hazardous waste by global
     corporations pose serious threats to the health of local communities in many non-Western countries.
     Responding to these threats, local peoples turn to their governments to enact environmental protections.
     Moreover, the forces of globalization have created a strong network of transnational resistance to
     environmentally destructive practices with organizations such as the Global Alliance on Health and Pollution

8.4 · Modern Nation-States                                                                                             271

(GAHP) and the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP).

In the wake of Benedict Anderson's (1983) formulation of nation-states as imagined communities, many
anthropologists have considered how globalization creates transnational forms of imagined community
alongside the nation. Cultural anthropologist Arjun Appadurai (1996) argues that globalization freed popular
imagination from the constraints of the nation, creating multiple realms of imagined community cross-cutting
national borders. Appadurai postulates five dimensions of global flows, constructing realms of activity and
imagination: ethnicity, technology, finance, media, and ideology. The global environmental movement, for
instance, constitutes a transnational imagined community based on ideas of environmental sustainability.
Through media and communication technologies, people all over the world join in the discussions and
activities of this imagined community.

Appadurai has also pointed to the darker consequences of globalization for national and transnational politics.
While globalization might seem to be associated with free flows and flexibility, the forces of transnationalism
have also resulted in a proliferation of forms of political violence, especially violence against ethnic, racial, and
religious minority groups (2006). With increasing global flows, many communities are subject to increased
cultural mixing and pressures for change. With rising immigration, for instance, national communities may be
forced to reformulate notions of common language, practices, and values. While some citizens of a national
community may embrace a more cosmopolitan and multicultural identity, others may experience a sense of
insecurity and threat to their way of life. This insecurity is particularly keen among those working-class and
poor groups that suffer from the increased inequality brought about by globalization. Appadurai describes how
cultural and economic insecurity can provoke majority ethnic and racial groups to acts of violence against
minority groups in their national communities. Seeking an elusive and imaginary national "purity," dominant
groups seek to reassert their power over political, economic, and cultural institutions. Anti-immigrant politics
in the United States and anti-American politics in some non-Western countries are both dangerous and
sometimes violent responses to the common forces of globalization.

        PROFILES IN ANTHROPOLOGY

Laura Nader
1930-

FIGURE 8.9 Laura Nader (right) engaged in conversation. (credit: "Moët Hennessy · Financial Times Club Dinner"

"What was proven in the last election is that the United States is not an electoral democracy, by which I mean
the two parties' stranglehold on power has made it impossible for other voices to be heard." --Laura Nader (in
Nkrumah 2005)
272  8 · Authority, Decisions, and Power: Political Anthropology

     Personal History: Born and raised in Winsted, Connecticut, Laura Nader grew up in a family with strong
     commitments to community and public service. Her mother, Rose, was a politically minded schoolteacher who
     frequently wrote letters to the editor of the local newspaper. Her father, Nathra, owned a restaurant where local
     people met to talk about community and political issues. Laura's parents challenged her and her siblings to
     debate political issues and develop their own opinions.

     Area of Anthropology: Nader earned a BA in Latin American studies from Wells College (Aurora, New York)
     and then went on to study anthropology at Harvard, earning a PhD from Radcliffe College in 1961. Nader's
     areas of interest include politics and law, in particular how the legal-political system operates as a form of
     social control.

     Accomplishments in the Field: For her dissertation, Nader studied local courts in the Zapotec village of Talea
     in southwestern Mexico (1990). She discovered that the legal system in Talea was shaped by a strong emphasis
     on harmony rather than conviction and punishment. When conflicts arose, the courts brought people together
     face to face to engage in discussions aimed at reaching reconciliation and balanced solutions. Rather than
     focusing on blame and criminality, the legal process sought to restore community solidarity and consensus in
     the wake of the rift. Nader traced this "harmony ideology" to the context of colonial conquest by the Spanish,
     showing how missionaries and colonial administrators emphasized the moral value of harmony in order to
     dominate and pacify Indigenous peoples. She argued that local peoples in villages such as Talea have
     appropriated harmony ideology to their own ends, adopting methods of conflict resolution in order to prevent
     outside authorities from interfering in their affairs.

     Bringing the lessons of her research back home to the American legal system, Nader argued that harmony
     ideology operates as a strong force against Americans seeking justice against large corporations. Though the
     American system is focused much more on blame and conviction, large corporations are able to evade the
     consequences of wrongful actions by using sophisticated legal procedures and forcing monetary settlements.
     Many such settlements include stipulations preventing people from publicly talking about the controversy,
     essentially purchasing the silence of complainants. Though governed by harmony ideology, the goal of such
     legal processes is not the restoration of good relations among community members but rather the forcing of
     capitulation and silence on complainants. Nader's comparative work on the law in Talea and the United States
     is vividly portrayed in the ethnographic film Little Injustices (1981).

     Importance of Their Work: In 1960, Nader was the first woman hired for a tenure-track anthropology
     position at the University of California, Berkeley. From 1984 to 2010, she taught an innovative and popular
     course called Controlling Processes, exploring dominant ideologies and techniques of power in complex
     industrialized societies such as the United States (the author of this chapter took this course at Berkeley in
     1990). Nader's own research identifies controlling processes that shape law and justice in many societies,
     exploring how citizens participate and challenge these hegemonic legal processes. Throughout her career, she
     has worked to make legal anthropology a force for justice reaching beyond the scholarly arena into public life.
     She has been a visiting professor in law schools at Yale, Stanford, and Harvard.

     Politics includes all activities associated with governing a society. Thus far, we've focused on the institutions
     and practices of government. But politics happens both inside and outside the realm of government. In fact,

8.5 · Resistance, Revolution, and Social Movements                                                                 273

what happens outside of government may be even more important to understanding how a society is ruled.
Outside of government, people respond to social and political conditions with commentary, critique, and social
action. They form groups to express their views and demand social change. These groups are called social
movements.

FIGURE 8.10 Arab Spring protest in Tunisia. This widespread social movement spread throughout the Arab world
in the early 2010s, voicing popular demands for greater participation in government and a more equitable
distribution of wealth. (credit: "Tunisian Revolution -Jan20 DSC_5305" by Chris Belsten/flickr, CC BY 2.0)

In the early 2010s, a series of protests spread across the Arab world from Tunisia to Libya, Egypt, Yemen,
Syria, Iraq, and many other countries (Blakemore 2019). Through marches, demonstrations, and armed
rebellions, people called for an end to oppressive governments and poor living conditions in their countries.
Fueled by the expansion of social media, this large and diverse pro-democracy social movement came to be
called the Arab Spring. At the heart of the movement were demands for more participation in government (a
political demand) and a more equitable distribution of wealth (an economic demand).

There are many different kinds of social movements. Some social movements express resistance to current
social conditions. When groups gather to protest the outcome of an election or the passing of a law, they show
their disagreement with government actions without necessarily suggesting specific action or redress. Other
social movements campaign for specific reforms. In response to police shootings, for instance, protesters
might call for changes in the training and routine practices of police in their communities. More ambitious still
are social movements calling for revolution. A revolution occurs when a social movement successfully
changes the structure of the political system--whether through peaceful actions or violence.

Many social movements are rooted in political economy; that is, they work to change political and economic
conditions and the relationship between those two realms. In democratic societies, political parties are social
movements that have transformed into formalized political institutions. Political parties play a routine,
conventional role in democratic societies. For instance, in American society, the Democratic Party consistently
argues that the government should play a role in organizing and regulating the economy, while the Republican
Party consistently argues that government should avoid economic interference. Political parties are fully
integrated into the political system of democratic societies, structuring elections, lawmaking, government
policy, and even the judicial process.

Political parties may fail to represent the views of some groups--or even majority opinion. In the U.S. Congress,
the views of a very wealthy minority of Americans exert a strong influence over the laws that are passed.
Political scientist Martin Gilens (2012) conducted public opinion research among groups of poor, middle-class,
and wealthy Americans and then compared the views of these three groups to the policy actions of
government. Gilens found that when poor people and rich people disagree on an issue, government policy
nearly always supports the views of the wealthy. This effect is largely due to the role of money in American
274  8 · Authority, Decisions, and Power: Political Anthropology

     politics, with the wealthy actively seeking to influence government policy through lobbying and campaign
     contributions.

     So what can people do when the formal mechanisms of democracy fail to represent their views? The vast
     majority of social movements are less like political parties and more like the Arab Spring; that is, most social
     movements are informal groups engaging in activities outside of the formal realm of political activity. Social
     movements often originate in a particular incident or string of incidents, such as mass shootings, sexual
     assaults, police violence, or environmental disasters. When people feel that the truth of such incidents is
     hidden, obscured, or misrepresented by government officials and media, they may find dramatic ways to
     publicize the truth and demand remediating action. French philosopher Michel Foucault (2001) used the term
     parrhesia to describe how people are morally inspired to engage in risky public speech in order to speak truth
     to power.

     In the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, many Americans became worried about the role of the
     financial sector in creating economic inequality and instability. In September 2011, a group of protesters met
     in Zuccotti Park in Manhattan to protest rising inequality and corporate influence over American politics. Over
     time, this movement, known as Occupy Wall Street, spread to cities throughout the United States and then the
     world, and members of the movement articulated a platform of sociopolitical goals that included a more
     balanced distribution of wealth, better jobs and working conditions, regulation of banks, bankruptcy
     protection for student loan debt, and a freeze on home foreclosures. Protesters set up a participatory
     community in the park, organizing a form of self-governance through working groups and democratic
     consensus. Some protesters camped on-site in tents, while others visited the park each day. In November
     2011, police in riot gear forcibly removed protesters from Zuccotti Park, arresting some 200 people in a single
     day.

     In many countries, extractive industries such as mining and logging produce forms of environmental damage
     that threaten the health and livelihoods of local peoples. When governments fail to intervene, farmers often
     join with urban activists to form coalitions aimed at environmental reform. Anthropologist Fabiana Li (2015)
     has explored the emergence of protest against multinational mining corporations in Peru. In 2004, 10,000
     peasants gathered to protest a mining operation that would have leveled the mountain of Cerro Quilish. While
     company officials viewed the mountain as an obstacle to the extraction of minerals, urban activists and
     peasant leaders described it in sentient and supernatural terms, as a sacred place of spirits. Li also studies the
     response of mining officials to popular demands for accountability. When local people protest against the
     degradation and pollution of their lands, corporations often respond with technical fixes that are presented as
     fair solutions. For instance, when blood tests revealed high levels of lead in children living near a Peruvian
     mining operation, the mining company responded with a program to bus those children to a distant
     kindergarten, thus reducing the number of hours of daily exposure to mining pollution.

     Many Indigenous peoples encompassed by contemporary nation-states engage in social movements to gain
     formal political recognition and to protect their lands and cultures. Work, Life, Value: Economic Anthropology
     discussed efforts by the Hadza, the Bedouin, and the Kayapo to protect their lifeways by forming coalitions
     with global allies and engaging in sustained public protest. As discussed in Chapter 6, Language and
     Communication, Indigenous groups such as the Wampanoag and the Maori have formed social movements
     around the revitalization of language and culture. In 2016, a group of Standing Rock Sioux and other Native
     Americans began campaigning to protect Native lands and cultures from the damaging effects of a proposed
     oil pipeline, the Dakota Access Pipeline. Running under waterways and across Native territories, the pipeline
     threatened the water supply of Native peoples as well as many sites, archaeological and otherwise, considered
     sacred by Native groups. Thousands of Native Americans and environmentalists gathered in multiple camps to
     protest the building of the pipeline over several months. Despite the protests, the Trump administration
     allowed the construction of the pipeline to begin in 2017. In January 2021, however, a US Appeals court
     vacated the Army Corps of Engineers' construction permit and called for extensive environmental review of
     the project.

As the examples above illustrate, most social movements combine protests against specific conditions with
more general agendas involving justice, equality, democracy, and political economy. When the power of money
overwhelms the formal political institutions of a democratic society, social movements provide an alternative
means of political expression and potential influence.

INTRODUCTION As a student, have you ever experienced social inequalities, whether based around your
race, gender, sexuality, class, or abilities? In this chapter you'll see definitions and examples of the ways
social inequalities affect individuals and societies. Over the history of anthropology, the ways we identify and
define social inequalities has constantly evolved. The ways social inequalities are experienced has also
evolved. This chapter will provide an overview of the important concepts and levels of social inequalities, and
then an examination of the experiences of individuals within groups and societies. From this, you can
develop a framework for understanding the inequality in your own communities.

     LEARNING OUTCOMES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       · Differentiate between systematic and systemic inequities.
       · Discuss theories of social inequality and anthropology's past of upholding social inequalities.
       · Describe the connections between power, agency, and resistance.

     Social Stratification

     Division of labor, in and of itself, is not hierarchical, but when different values are assigned to different types of
     labor and some positions or people have power over others, this creates a hierarchy. A hierarchy is a type of
     social organization in which certain people or roles are given more power and prestige than others. As
     discussed in Economic Anthropology, there are various possible divisions of labor depending on a group's
     mode of production. Many gatherer-hunter groups experience a social structure described as egalitarian, in
     which the diverse roles in a system of production are all given the same decision-making power and accorded
     the same respect among the group. In such societies, power is usually afforded by age grades, with the elders
     holding the most power.

     Conversely, when there are differences in status or power between various roles, social stratification results.
     Social stratification is the hierarchical organization of different groups of people, whether based on racial
     category, socioeconomic status, kinship, religion, birth order, or gender. In horticultural societies, this
     stratification can be linked to charismatic leaders or leaders whose power is culturally imbued at birth. State
     societies, and specifically market economies, are considered the most stratified, meaning they have the
     highest resource inequities. Whether in the Inca Empire of the 1300s or the contemporary United States, a
     complex system of social hierarchy and social inequality accompanies state-level societies.

     Levels of Inequality

     FIGURE 9.2 This graphic depicts various levels of social inequalities. Social inequalities are often seen as separate
     phenomena, but they are frequently interconnected, existing in many different interactions between people and

institutions. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

Although it is important to understand the ways in which societies control resource accumulation, it is also
important to study the phenomena and experiences of inequality in one's own culture. This section will
examine how individuals experience different levels of social inequalities. In contemporary societies,
experiences of social inequalities often have roots in systems of capitalism, colonialism, racism, and sexism,
which all include a perceived superiority of one group over another.

Interpersonal inequalities, which are power imbalances that are rooted in personal biases, occur every day,
reifying and naturalizing inequalities that exist at institutional and systemic levels. Institutional inequalities
stem from the policies and practices of organizations (educational institutions, government, companies) that
perpetuate oppression. Institutional inequalities exist outside of the day-to-day interactions that people
experience, are often unseen, and feel like the status quo. Structural inequalities exist at a level above
personal interactions and institutions because they are based on the accumulated effects of institutional
decisions across society and history. This type of inequality is pervasive, global, and especially difficult to
disrupt. Structural inequalities can reaffirm individual biases, creating a self-reinforcing cycle. Finally,
systemic inequalities are the confluence of interpersonal, institutional, and structural inequalities; these are
often portrayed by "isms" such as racism, classism, and sexism.

Inequality refers to the unequal distribution of resources. Most people learn about inequality at a young age
when they are exposed to people from different socioeconomic classes in places such as schools, places of
worship, or social organizations. They recognize that some people have more resources at their disposal,
whether through inborn talents or social connections. Such people may wear more expensive clothing, drive
more expensive cars, and even have more opportunities than others. Social inequalities are based on
individual people's backgrounds and how their opportunities in life have been affected by racism, sexism,
classism, and other forms of oppression. In this context, oppression is defined as unjust exercises of power
that may be overt or covert and are often used to control or inflict harm on entire groups of people. Inequity,
on the other hand, refers to the unequal distribution of resources due to an unjust power imbalance. It is a type
of inequality caused by this unequal distribution, often as a result of injustices against historically excluded
groups of people. In the United States, inequity is seen today in areas such as the banking industry, access to
voting, and the housing market, where minority groups continue to face challenges related to fairness and
equitable distribution of resources. Social inequalities lead to inequity when the groups in charge of
distribution allocate resources in ways that further oppress marginalized groups.

FIGURE 9.3 This visual representation shows the difference between equality, or providing the same resources to

     everyone even when needs differ, and equity, or providing resources according to people's needs. In a truly just
     society (the third panel), all individuals can be treated equally with no additional accommodations. (attribution:
     Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

     You may have seen images on social media trying to explain the difference between inequality and
     inequity--or, on the flip side, equality and equity. One problem with such images, as Sarah Willen, Colleen
     Walsh, and Abigail Fisher Williamson (2021) p oint out, is that because they depict individuals, audiences may
     interpret these images as calling for localized or individual solutions rather than systemic changes.
     Oppression and inequity most often are not interpersonal but exist on a structural level of economics, politics,
     and socialization that normalizes their presence.

     In order to understand the differences between inequality and inequity, systematic oppression and systemic
     oppression, it is important to know that the word system has two different definitions. A system can refer to a
     formula for methodically attaining a goal, such as a system someone creates to study vocabulary before a
     foreign language exam. The term systematic oppression derives from this meaning; it is the intentional
     mistreatment of certain groups. On the other hand, the term system can also mean a combination of parts to
     form a complex whole, such as the organs in an organism. This definition is the root of the term systemic
     oppression, which describes how political, economic, and social inequalities are normalized and perpetuated.
     Many scholars have determined that systemic oppression is permanently ingrained in US laws, government,
     and society, with the result that it is both unseen and subconsciously upheld daily.

     When discussing inequality and inequity, it is also important to understand power, which, in its simplest
     sense, is the ability to exert control, authority, or influence over others. Individuals with more power have more
     agency, or capability to act and make decisions. Agency should not be confused with free will because an
     individual's agency is often heavily shaped by social characteristics such as race, gender, and class. Along with
     social inequalities, this chapter will discuss power, agency, and how the two are conceptualized by
     anthropologists through various perspectives and theoretical frameworks.

     Classic Theories of Social Inequality

     The remainder of this chapter will examine social inequalities in detail. It will cover racism, classism, and
     sexism along with some common paradigms and theoretical frameworks that explain systems of inequality
     and power.

     According to philosopher Thomas Kuhn, paradigms are worldviews that often define a scientific discipline
     during a specific time period. In The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962), K uhn argues that paradigms
     can shift when a dominant paradigm cannot explain newly discovered phenomena under which normal
     science operates. Each of the theories that follow was based on a paradigm shift in the social sciences of its
     time period. The frameworks that anthropologists use to understand power imbalances have been built on the
     critiques of many of the initial anthropological explanations for power imbalances and social inequalities.

     Social Darwinism and Unilinear Cultural Evolution
     Social Darwinism played an important role in the colonialist attitudes of the 19th and 20th centuries. Charles
     Darwin's theory of evolution, discussed in detail in Biological Evolution and Early Human Evidence, speaks of
     how traits beneficial to the procreation of a species are passed down, creating changes over time that lead to
     the evolution of species on Earth. In his Principles of Biology (1864-1867), so cial scientist Herbert Spencer
     applies the principles of evolution to human societies, combining his concept of the "survival of the fittest"
     with French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's views that acquired characteristics can be passed down.
     Spencer argues that characteristics such as a tendency to work hard and achieve success are passed down
     from generation to generation, as are traits such as weaknesses and laziness, thus attributing ongoing social
     inequalities to biological differences.

     Social Darwinists of the 19th and 20th centuries utilized Spencer's survival theory (under Darwin's name) to
     argue that competition for resources meant that "weak" human individuals should die out so that "stronger"
     traits could be passed down to the next generation. Social Darwinists claimed that any group that conquered
     another was better fit to survive and that those who were conquered would benefit from the civilizing influence
     of more powerful nations.

Although popular among certain social scientists, social Darwinism was not a term often used in anthropology.
Anthropologists instead turned to the theory of unilinear cultural evolution (UCE), made famous by
anthropologists E. B. Tylor and Lewis H. Morgan in the 19th century. UCE, which was based on comparing and
contrasting different cultures, theorized that societies progressed in a linear fashion, from the lowest level of
savagery through barbarism to civilization. Social Darwinism and UCE upheld social inequalities because
these theories argued that the defining features of civilization were social hierarchy and inequality. They were
the basis for White Europeans' claims that their culture held more power, had more value, and allowed them to
exert military power over lands that were not their own.

Functionalism
Functionalism is a theory attributed to French sociologist Emile Durkheim in the early 20th century. In
anthropology, the best-known of the functionalists are Bronislaw Malinowski and A. R. Radcliffe Brown, who
examined the purpose that certain cultural characteristics serve in the order of society. For functionalists,
egalitarian societies have certain rituals or beliefs that maintain equality, while in stratified societies, the
hierarchy of roles maintains order when conflict arises. The function of social stratification, then, is to give
power to those who are most equipped to lead, or to motivate those with talents to achieve positions of power
and create wealth for the larger society. A functionalist view understands social inequalities as a reflection of
people's varying levels of benefit to the group.

Later theorists criticized functionalism for its use of research that was ahistorical, meaning that it did not
acknowledge the specific historical experiences of a group and thus attempted to understand societies without
taking into consideration their connections to other cultures. For instance, functionalists largely ignored the
impacts of colonialism on small, seemingly isolated populations, arguing instead that social
stratification--and, consequently, global political inequalities--was an unyielding and inevitable part of the
process of becoming a "complex society."

Conflict Theory
Conflict theory, created by the late 19th-century political philosopher Karl Marx, offers a more pessimistic
view. Marx argued that hierarchy is not a means of keeping society balanced but rather the main source of
conflict among humans. He and Friedrich Engels originally conceptualized two classes of capitalism in terms
of ownership. The bourgeoisie, descended from powerful families, were the owners of the means of
production, while the proletariat were those who sold their labor and lived off a wage. The powerless majority,
the proletariat, were far removed from the decision makers and power holders, who had separated the
proletariat from their own skills through industrialization and mechanization. In this view, the conflict
between those with wealth and the means of production and those without is the basis of all social conflict.

As more social scientists grappled with differences in class and wage, they began to critique conflict theory
more. W. E. B. Du Bois ([1940] 1984), an American sociologist working in the early 20th century, added wage
and race theories to the classic examination of class conflict. He questioned whether there was a relationship
between one's knowledge in a trade and one's wages and subsequently concluded that the worth of labor was
determined solely by capitalists (the bourgeoisie). Du Bois further observed that class distinctions were
forming among Black groups in Philadelphia, mostly unnoticed by White people, who continued to generalize
them as one monolithic group. His critique was that conflict theory did not take race into account as both an
area wherein class differences occur and another area that can cause conflict (and detract from issues of class
and wage). Du Bois's pioneering ethnographic studies at the turn of the 20th century were among the earliest
scientific research on Black Americans' lived experience of race and racism in the United States. His influence
on and relationship with anthropologist Franz Boas were significant factors in Boas's own disavowal of race as
a determinant of the value and worth of diverse cultures. Du Bois's work remains relevant in the present day as
anthropology continues to address its own historical roots in colonialism.

     Critical Race Theory
     Critical race theory (CRT), developed by legal scholars in the 1980s, asserts that much of the inequity
     experienced by oppressed people in the United States can be understood through the critical lens of race. CRT
     states that racism is endemic, or regularly found in the laws, policies, and institutions of the United States.
     Thus, people who are socialized in American institutions often do not see the ways in which racism plays out in
     their daily lives. Notions of color blindness and meritocracy uphold the idea that racism either does not exist
     or is actually related to class, socioeconomics, or other factors. Color blindness is the idea that people "don't
     see color," meaning that they are unaware of the ways in which someone may experience the world because of
     the color of their skin. A meritocracy is a system in which people succeed entirely through their own hard
     work; thus, someone who believes in the notion of meritocracy overlooks any structural or racial inequities
     that may keep individuals from accessing the resources necessary for success (Delgado and Stefancic 2013). In
     the United States, these two concepts are often used together to blame poor (especially poor Black) individuals
     and families for their own misfortunes instead of looking to structural causes of poverty and income
     inequality. The term welfare queen is often used by politicians and the media to refer to a specific (Black or
     minority) demographic, even though statistically, White women are the most common recipients of
     government benefits. One way to challenge everyday endemic racism is to utilize counter-storytelling. These
     stories counteract the socialized assumptions that keep people of color marginalized. For instance, counter-
     stories are important in challenging the power of stereotypes such as the "welfare queen."

     Critical race theory has become a hotly debated topic among politicians in the United States. CRT is often
     misunderstood by critics, who see it as a one-sided examination of (particularly American) history and society
     because CRT examines society through the lens of power and oppression. It often focuses on which groups
     benefit from cultural changes, including such things as civil rights legislation, essential to a democracy's
     guarantee of equal opportunity and protection under the law. In anthropology, CRT is an important tool for
     examining both modern institutions and the experiences of individuals in the United States, especially in
     regard to social inequalities. As just one example, CRT can shed light on the decisions made by those in power
     when redrawing the boundaries of voting districts. These decisions are often made with the goal of cementing

a majority for a particular political party while diluting the voting power of citizens who don't typically belong
that party, a practice known as gerrymandering. It is important for social scientists to consider the potential
role of race and racism in making these decisions. If race and/or racism were found to be a factor, then these
political decisions would be considered an example of systemic oppression.

Power

More contemporary frameworks of social inequalities include an understanding of power. This section dives
into the concepts and frameworks used in studying power. To recap, power is the ability to exert control,
authority, or influence over others; agency, which comes from power, is the capability to act and make
decisions. Power can be conceptualized as both subtle and coercive; in some contexts, it's obvious who has
power and how it's utilized, but in other contexts, there are power imbalances that are allowed in everyday life.
The point of this section is to contemplate why people allow certain power imbalances to exist while
challenging others. Often, people allow power imbalances that they benefit from and resist imbalances that
they do not benefit from. To better understand this, it is useful to discuss various concepts related to power,
including hegemony, the state apparatus, biopolitics, and necropolitics.

Hegemony
Antonio Gramsci, famous for his writings on philosophy, political theory, sociology, linguistics, and history,
came up with the concept of hegemony while imprisoned by the Fascist Italian government. A founding
member of the Communist Party of Italy, he was arrested by Benito Mussolini's Fascist regime for provoking
class hatred and civil war and was sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment. In The Prison Notebooks,
composed of 33 notebooks written during his imprisonment, Gramsci writes about power using the notion of
hegemony. Hegemony describes how people with power keep their power through the subtle dissemination of
certain values and beliefs. Hegemony relies on the maintenance of a "groups'' authority and various
mechanisms through which those in marginalized groups accept the leadership of another group's authority.
These mechanisms include cultural institutions such as education, religion, family, and common practices of
everyday life. When a paradigm is so dominant that no one questions it, it becomes hegemonic. For instance,
the idea that the United States is a democracy, even though many Americans are disenfranchised from voting
and several presidential candidates have won the popular vote but lost the election, could be considered a
hegemonic paradigm.

The State Apparatus
French Marxist philosopher Louis Pierre Althusser is known for his writings about ideologies of exploitation.
Asking how those who are exploited continue to remain exploited, Althusser developed the concept of the state
apparatus. The state apparatus consists of two intertwined but distinct sets of institutions, the repressive state
apparatus and the ideological state apparatus, which function together to maintain state order and control.
Repressive state apparatuses include institutions through which the ruling class enforces its control, such as
the government, administrators, the army, the police, the courts, and prisons. These institutions are repressive
because they function by violence or force. Althusser argues that the state also consists of ideological state
apparatuses, which include distinct and specialized institutions such as religious institutions, public and
private education systems, legal systems, political parties, communication systems (radio, newspapers,
television), family, and culture (literature, arts, and sports). Ideological state apparatuses, although they
include different institutions that are dominated by ruling class ideologies, are also sites where the ideologies
of exploited classes can grow. Therefore, ideological state apparatuses can be places of class struggle and
social change.

Biopolitics
French philosopher Michel Foucault conceptualized power through biopolitics, which refers to the ways
populations are divided and categorized as a means of control, often by the state. This categorization and
division--in terms of race, religion, or citizenship status, for instance--seeks to further marginalize certain
groups and increase the power of the state. Biopolitics can be understood as the use of power to control a
population through surveillance, which Foucault refers to as biopower in his book The History of Sexuality
([1978] 1990). An example of biopower in action is government control of immigrants, especially
undocumented migrants. In his ethnography Pathogenic Policing: Immigration Enforcement and Health in the
288  9 · Social Inequalities

     US South (2019), me dical and legal anthropologist Nolan Kline describes immigrant policing as a form of
     biopower that attempts to control and govern immigrants through tactics based on fear, making
     undocumented immigrants fearful as they go about the normal activities of their daily lives, with many afraid
     to even seek health services when necessary.

     Necropolitics
     Cameroonian philosopher and political theorist Joseph-Achille Mbembe, known as Achille Mbembe, writes
     about power through the idea of necropolitics (the power of death). Necropolitics, an extension of Foucault's
     biopolitics, explores the government's power to decide how certain categories of people live and whose deaths
     are more acceptable. Mbembe describes this as a power to decide "who matters and who does not, who is
     disposable and who is not" (2003, 27). The p ower to determine a life's worth resides within both political
     systems and the decisions that policy makers are tasked with. It has, quite literally, life-or-death
     consequences, from who has access to life-saving medical technology to who is most policed and most likely to
     end up in jail.

     The Black Lives Matter social justice movement is a response to an understanding that modern necropolitics
     in the United States treats Black people as disposable. The Black Lives Matter movement has grown beyond the
     United States in response to other nations' state policies that are seen as treating people of color as not worthy
     of protection or care.

     Agency

     Agency, or the ability to act and make decisions, has become an important concept in anthropology because it
     helps make sense of how powerful institutions interact with individuals.

     With the theory of agency and structuration, British sociologist Anthony Giddens paved the way for the growth
     of theories on how humans interact with systems. Systems are the powerful, overarching beliefs through
     which the world is organized, which influence the ways in which individuals interact with their world.
     Although they most often go unnoticed and unquestioned, systems influence the decisions humans make. In
     terms of social inequality, in systems with unequal access to resources, the ability to decide or the options that
     one can choose between differ depending on diverse variables. The more power people have, the more choices
     they may be presented with, and the more they can mold and shape the systems in which they live through
     their decisions.

     French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu attempted to explain how societal structures are upheld and changed by
     processes generated by individuals. The idea of habitus, or the ingrained habits and dispositions that are
     socialized into people from birth depending on their status in society, is used to explain how individuals
     uphold cultural systems such as capitalism, class, racism, or patriarchal values. Habitus is understood both to
     imbue people with certain skill sets and perspectives according to their life experiences and to make possible
     social change because it understands systems as generative instead of static. For instance, the modern
     capitalist system has not always existed as know it is today. Many smaller decisions, practices, and
     consequences have formed and reformed capitalism, reflecting diverse interests over time.

     Resistance

     In their attempts to better understand power and agency, Marxist and feminist anthropologists in the 1980s
     and 1990s wrote a number of ethnographies about the relationship between resistance and the systems that
     create social inequalities and oppression. Resistance, at the basic level, refers to the act of challenging power
     and domination. Power is nearly always resisted in both overt and subtle ways, but the difference is often
     reflected in how much agency individuals have in resisting systems of domination and oppression. This
     section uses the example of Palestine to explore ways in which Palestinians are resisting power.

     The creation of the state of Israel in 1948 dispossessed the Palestinians who were indigenous to the land.
     Between 400 and 600 Palestinian villages were destroyed, and between 700,000 and 750,000 Palestinians
     were exiled from the portion of Palestine that became Israel.

While Israelis celebrate achieving independence in 1948, Palestinians refer to this period of displacement of
hundreds of thousands from their homes as the Nakba, which translates from Arabic as "disaster" or
"catastrophe." The Nakba is ongoing in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT), which includes the West
Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza, where the occupation by Israel is illegal according to international laws. The
Nakba is also ongoing for members of the Palestinian diaspora (the dispersion of a people from their original
home) around the world who do not have the right to return.

Palestinians living in the West Bank and East Jerusalem live under a system of checkpoints, military
occupation, and segregation from Jewish settlers. Palestinians in Gaza are living in an open-air prison with
extremely limited access to clean water, inconsistent electricity, and no freedom of movement (Erakat and
Azzeh 2016). Despite this level of oppression, Palestinians in different parts of the OPT and the Palestinian
diaspora still have agency, and they use this agency in different ways to resist Israeli oppression and the
devaluation of the Palestinian experience. While political and social movements are critically important for
combating injustice and oppression, there are also Palestinians and Israelis working together to create cultural
bridges between the communities. One example of this is the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra.

Founded in 1999 by pianist and conductor Daniel Barenboim, who was born in Argentina and moved to Israel
as a child, and Palestinian scholar and activist Edward Said, the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra
(https://openstax.org/r/west-eastern-divan) is a group of Israeli, Arab, and Palestinian musicians who work to
290  9 · Social Inequalities

     promote equality and understanding across sociopolitical divides. The orchestra travels and performs
     internationally as an "orchestra against ignorance," founded on the idea that when musicians come together to
     create music, they must work in harmony and respect each other. Not only intended to forge strong bonds
     among the musicians, the orchestra also serves to highlight the importance of respecting cultural differences
     and of recognizing a common humanity within the Middle East as a whole. Barenboim states emphatically
     (https://openstax.org/r/classical-musicandopera) that the orchestra's purpose is not to make peace but to
     create the conditions for peace. Ethnocentrism underlies oppression, and model initiatives such as the West-
     Eastern Divan Orchestra serve as reminders of the importance of tolerance and respect as deterrents against
     oppression.

     LEARNING OUTCOMES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       · Explain the meanings of the terms racism, Whiteness, and White supremacy.
       · Differentiate between economic, social, and cultural capital in relation to class or social mobility.
       · Explain the relationship between capitalism and social inequalities.
       · Describe gender relations, patriarchy, and oppression.

     Many introductory anthropological texts will examine how types of social stratification align with modes of
     production. This text has something of a different focus, critically considering what it means for some lives to
     matter more or less than others. This section looks at how modern modes of production create systems of
     social inequalities such as racism, classism, and sexism.

     Race and Racism

     Racism is best understood as power intertwined with racial prejudice. Racism can be perpetuated through
     interpersonal, institutional, and systemic practices. Anthropologists Alan Goodman, Yolanda Moses, and
     Joseph Jones define racism in Race: Are We So Different? (2020) as the use of race to establish and justify a
     social hierarchy and system of power that privileges and advances certain individuals or groups of people,
     usually at the expense of others. Many individuals understand interpersonal examples of racism, but what are
     institutional or systemic forms of racism? To explore this question, this section will discuss the history of race
     and its social construction.

     What Is Anthropology? discussed the fact that race is a social construct. Where did the social construct of race
     originate? Johann Blumenbach, a German physician and anthropologist, was influential in establishing

9.2 · Systems of Inequality                                                                                       291

existing racial categories. Working in the field of craniometry, a now debunked pseudoscience that studied
human head shape and brain size, Blumenbach proposed five racial categories to divide humans in the late
1700s: "Caucasian" for White people, "Mongolian" for Asians, "Malayan" for Brown people, "Ethiopian" for
Black people, and "American" for Indigenous people of the Americas (Goodman, Moses, and Jones 2020, 30).

Blumenbach intentionally made these categories hierarchical and put White people at the top of this hierarchy.
In many ways, the remnants of this hierarchy still exist today. For instance, have you ever seen the term
Caucasian on a form asking about race? Why does this term still exist? Many other labels from the
classifications Blumenbach created have been challenged, but Caucasian is still used in both scientific and
popular usage. Anthropologist Carol Mukhopadhyay (2008) argues that this term's continued usage conveys a
false scientific authority of Whiteness.

Black anthropologists, including Williams S. Willis Jr. (1972) and others, have pointed out many racist
undertones throughout anthropology's history of studying the "other." Anthropology began as the practice of
White anthropologists studying the non-White other, which was rooted in an inherently unequal perspective.
The White anthropologists' beliefs were considered the "norm," and people they studied were considered
outside of the norm. In contrast, many of the first Black anthropologists trained in the United States were
involved in activism, advocacy, public service, and social justice. These Black pioneers in anthropology were
committed to fighting racism and instigating social change, focuses that were reflected in their scholarship
and how they approached anthropology (Harrison and Harrison 1999). In "Reflections on Anthropology and
the Black Experience," St. Clair Drake, discussing why some Black scholars became anthropologists, said, "A
few of us chose careers in anthropology forty to forty-five years ago because we believed the discipline had
relevance to the liberation of black people from the devastating consequences of over four centuries of white
racism" (1978, 86).

In 1941, anthropologists Allison Davis, Burleigh Gardner, and Mary Gardner argued that the United States had
a racial caste system. Caste is a system of social inequality based on an individual's circumstances of birth,
wherein people are not allowed to move out of the social group into which they are born. Davis, Gardner, and
Gardner observe that racism is a powerful force in American society that produces inequitable social relations
that seem permanent but vary regionally and are subject to change over time. They argue that political, social,
and economic structures all maintain that caste system, often in violent and coercive ways (Davis, Gardner,
and Gardner 1941).

A number of scholars have also examined White racial identity; these "Whiteness studies" show that the racial
category of White has been defined in different ways throughout US history. For instance, certain ethnicities in
American history were not originally considered White but became included in the White identity over time.
Whiteness is usually based on the maintenance or pursuit of power and proximity to power. Historian Nell
Irvin Painter's book The History of White People (2010) provides a detailed history of European civilization,
race, and the frequent worshipping of Whiteness and explains that the concept of one White race is a recent
invention.

White privilege is conceptualized as the ways in which White people have been given advantages at the
expense of other populations. In Peggy McIntosh's classic article "White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible
Knapsack" (1989), she compares White privilege to an invisible weightless knapsack that comes with special
provisions or advantages. According to McIntosh (who identifies as White), these advantages--or even just lack
of obstacles--include not having to think about one's race all the time, knowing that one will probably be
represented wherever they go, and not worrying about having to speak for all the people of one's racial group,
among many other examples. Thus, White privilege is the experience of one's Whiteness as the standard.

White privilege is often linked to the cultural concept of White supremacy, which is the idea that White people
are a superior race and should dominate society at the expense of other, historically oppressed groups. People
often think of White supremacy as extremist behavior, but White supremacy can actually be seen in many
examples of systemic social inequalities. Ideologies of the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis are examples of overt
White supremacy that many people acknowledge as being racist. However, there are many covert examples of
White supremacy that are problematic and racist but are overlooked.

     The concept of White supremacy is a contentious one in modern media and politics. You may have come
     across an image like the one in Figure 9.7 explaining different types of White supremacy. Although the
     examples in the diagram labeled "Overt" can be agreed on as socially unacceptable by most people in
     American society, the examples in the "Covert" section are often explained on an individual level instead of as
     a symptom of racism. For instance, the school-to-prison pipeline can often be explained as the consequence of
     individuals who do not obey the rules instead of a consequence of underfunded schools and racist policies.
     The avoidance of talking about race, or racial refusal, can be understood as a silent form of racism.

Birth (2019), writes that not acknowledging race in certain contexts can perpetuate inequalities. For her study
of Black women who give birth to premature infants, Davis interviewed Black mothers and their partners;
NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) staff, including nurses and doctors; birth workers; and March of Dimes
administrators. In her research, Davis found that many doctors refused to discuss race and consequently
ignored how racism is connected to disparities in health, premature birth, and medical treatment. Instead,
discussions of premature birth disparities centered on class, despite the fact that Davis interviewed
professional Black women who were college educated. Davis argues that racial disparities and medical racism
perpetuated by systemic and structural racism cannot be addressed in healthcare settings if healthcare
workers do not discuss race. This racial refusal has a historical precedence in the United States, where history
and how that history has affected people's lives is routinely omitted (Davis 2019, 88).

Finally, microaggressions are everyday instances of racism, homophobia, sexism, ableism, and other isms
that are observed in the world as thinly veiled insults directed toward individuals from historically excluded
groups. People who commit microaggressions might not even be aware they are committing them.
Microaggressions include verbal and nonverbal snubs and insults that communicate hostile, derogatory, or
negative messages to individuals based solely on their identification with a marginalized group. For example,
one of the coauthors of this chapter, Saira Mehmood, identifies as a Muslim woman of South Asian descent,
born in New Orleans. Saira is often asked, "Where are you from?" When she answers, "New Orleans," the next
question is often "Where are you really from?" This type of microaggression denies Saira's agency as an
American.

Class

Class refers to a group of people with the same socioeconomic status and proximity to power. In a class-based
system, status stems from wealth and one's proximity to the power that wealth builds. Economically, class
systems are most often associated with the capitalist mode of production. People in the United States often
think of the term middle class when considering class systems.

Capitalism--the economic mode of production based around markets, ownership of land and resources, and
wage labor--has produced classes that are grounded in the acceptance of the idea that earned wealth or status
is the basis for social hierarchy within a nation. In capitalist nations, a person's status in society directly relates
to the amount of money they have acquired or the position they have achieved in their career. Class-based
systems often emphasize social inequalities because of the hegemonic idea that relation to capital determines
a person's value in society. For instance, Bill Gates is looked up to for his status as a billionaire, while those who
work in fast food are often seen as not deserving of a living wage. This system of inequality, especially in the
United States, is tied to the idea of meritocracy, with those at the top of the class system assumed to have
worked hardest or to be most deserving of high-level positions and those at the bottom assumed to be
personally at fault for their lack of wealth.

Capitalism includes the concept of social mobility, or the ability of an individual to move up into higher and
thus more powerful classes merely by working hard. Social mobility is the basis for the "American Dream," the
idea that poor Americans can attain a higher class. On the other hand, anthropologist Katherine S. Newman
has done decades of research on downward social mobility, or the ongoing loss of capital and ensuing loss of
social status. Newman (1999) found that in the last decades of the 20th century, divorce, emigration, company
downsizing, and technological advancement left many middle-class individuals struggling to maintain their
class (also see Gans 2009). Furthermore, the 2008 recession and the economic crash experienced due to the
COVID-19 pandemic led to downward social mobility for millions.

In addition to class, the United States also uses the concept of "collar." White-collar jobs are assumed to require
higher education, involve less manual labor, and pay more, while blue-collar jobs are considered less skilled,
more manual, and lower paying. However, Forbes magazine found that there are many "blue collar" jobs (e.g.,
plumbers and electricians) that have higher earnings than many "white collar" jobs (such as entry- or mid-
level finance), yet they carry lower status within US social hierarchy. What distinguishes white-collar from
blue-collar jobs if it isn't just about how much money they make? German social scientist Max Weber argued
that there were considerably more than two classes that determined the social inequalities and conflicts
among people in capitalist societies. In his seminal essay "The Distribution of Power with the Community:
294  9 · Social Inequalities

     Classes, Stände, Parties" (2010), originally published in German in 1921, Weber argues that there are multiple,
     overlapping systems from which to gain power and links social stratification to three components:
     socioeconomic status, prestige, and political party connections.

     Power, in capitalist and class societies, often stems from capital, which is wealth in the form of money or other
     assets. Economic capital is monetary but is not the only form of capital. French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu
     distinguished between various forms of capital: economic, social, cultural, and symbolic. Bourdieu defined
     social capital as the nonmonetary resources people use to gain social status, such as mutual acquaintances,
     shared cultural knowledge, or shared experiences. Social capital can also determine one's power. Cultural
     capital refers to the competencies, skills, and qualifications that people acquire that create cultural authority;
     in an institutionalized form, this takes the form of educational attainment. Symbolic capital, or the resources
     available to an individual because of honor, prestige, or recognition, is tied to economic, social, and cultural
     capital. For instance, successful athletes often have symbolic capital, and this type of capital can increase their
     social capital and economic capital with endorsements from corporations and other opportunities. However,
     athletes can also lose their symbolic capital when a scandal or controversy involving them is uncovered,
     resulting in them losing their endorsements and contracts, which in turn affects their economic and social
     capital.

     A good example of how individuals utilize social capital in the United States is the networking that exists in
     top-tier schools. In Pedigree: How Elite Students Get Elite Jobs (2016), sociologist Lauren Rivera utilizes
     participant observation to show how top-tier investment banks, consulting firms, and law firms decide who
     gets hired and who doesn't, drawing on analysis of social and cultural capital in the American class system.
     Often, interviewers from elite firms use the phrase "not a good fit" when deciding not to hire someone in order
     to skirt around potential accusations of discriminatory intent. Riviera concludes that if a candidate is not from
     a top-tier school, the only way for them to get hired by such a firm is to have some other social capital
     connection vouch for their abilities.

     When those with symbolic capital use their power against those with less power in order to change their
     actions, they are exercising symbolic violence. Symbolic violence is a type of nonphysical violence manifested
     in power differentials between social groups (e.g., upper class and lower class). For Bourdieu, symbolic
     violence reinforces ideologies that legitimize and naturalize the status quo. In many instances, symbolic
     violence reinforces social inequalities. This is perhaps most evident in the language used when referring to
     other groups. During the long history of migrations toward the US-Mexico border, symbolic violence has been
     used linguistically by English speakers to refer to migrants in terms that alienate them and set them outside of
     a common human identity. Labels such as "illegals," "illegal aliens," and "undocumented workers" are applied
     across cultures, defining families and individuals by a single dimension. Linguistic slurs are especially
     associated with symbolic violence. When human beings are represented in such simple and stark terms, it can
     become more socially acceptable to oppress them and see them as undeserving of empathy and respect.

     Capitalism and class systems can also be analyzed in terms of race. Initially popularized by political science
     and Black studies scholar Cedric J. Robinson in Black Marxism: The Making of the Black Radical Tradition
     (1983), racial capitalism is the process through which the key aspects of capitalism (credit/debit, production/
     surplus, capitalist/worker, developed/underdeveloped, etc.) become articulated through existing relations of
     racial inequalities. In Robinson's framework, capitalism is racial not because of some conspiracy to divide
     workers or to justify slavery but because racialism had already spread through Western feudal society when
     capitalism developed. Racial capitalism can clearly be seen in the slave trade and colonialism. Scholar Saidiya
     Hartman states that slavery still "persists as an issue in the political life of black America . . . because black
     lives are still imperiled and devalued by a racial calculus and a political arithmetic that were entrenched
     centuries ago." Hartman describes this as "the afterlife of slavery--skewed life chances, limited access to
     health and education, premature death, incarceration, and impoverishment" (2007, 6). Slavery was a
     racialized system of capitalism, one that continues to exploit others to the present day.

     Class systems emphasize social inequalities because for some people to have money and power, those
     individuals must exploit and oppress other groups. Capitalism and class societies are often supported by the
     ideas that those with power earned that power and those without it have individual moral failings instead of
     acknowledging that the structure of capitalism, which necessitates a working class, generates inequalities.

Gender and Patriarchy

Although there is a detailed exploration of gender, patriarchy, and power in Gender and Sexuality, this chapter
will discuss how gender is tied to social inequalities. Anthropologists have studied how gender relations play a
big part in experiences of inequality. Gender relations can interact with various other powerful cultural
institutions to further oppress individuals.

An important concept to grasp when seeking to understand gender and power is patriarchy, a system of social
inequality based on gender in which power is assumed to be in the hands of men and characteristics
associated with femininity are less valued. Patriarchy is related to male lineages and contexts in which men
hold more political, social, and economic power or prestige. Recently, the claim that patriarchy remains a
powerful force has been challenged by some social commentators, who argue that this system of oppression
does not exist in modern society and that women and men experience equal opportunities in terms of
employment, rights, and salary. Many anthropologists and other social scientists challenge this claim, pointing
out ways in which patriarchy still impacts women's lives.

Many anthropologists have made connections between gender and patriarchy, poverty, and race. In her
fieldwork in the poor, mostly Black midwestern suburb of "Meadow View," sociologist Sharon Hicks-Bartlett
(2000) observed a particular type of oppression experienced by local women. Women living in poverty were
relied upon and expected to keep their families together. Hicks-Bartlett described women tasked with
managing low-wage, part-time work in a place where public systems of care and assistance, or even buses,
were largely unavailable.

The interpersonal and even internalized forces of patriarchy and power can also make women "compete to
lose," meaning they will deliberately not succeed at some things in order to gain social capital among their
peers. For instance, anthropologist Signithia Fordham, (2013) who spent two years studying the interactions of
Black teenage girls in a predominantly White high school (which she aptly named "Underground Railroad High
School"), found that the girls in this middle-class high school downplayed their achievements in order to fit in
with peer groups and friends. Academic success was sometimes experienced as a social hindrance for those
whose goals were family and children.

        PROFILES IN ANTHROPOLOGY

Dr. William S. Willis Jr.
1921-1983

Personal History: Dr. William S. Willis Jr. (https://openstax.org/r/william-shedrick-willis) was a Black
intellectual, anthropologist, historian, and anti-racist scholar of the 20th century. He was born in Waco, Texas,
but his family moved to Dallas because of threats from the Waco Ku Klux Klan. After graduating from Howard
University as a history major, Willis volunteered for service with the US Coast Guard. Eventually, he began his
graduate studies in anthropology at Columbia University, drawn to the program by the scientific anti-racism of
the Boasian tradition.

Area of Anthropology: As a graduate student, Willis wanted to study Black culture and Black relations at home
and abroad, but he was not able to do so because of the dominance of the study of Native Americans in
American anthropology at the time. Nevertheless, Willis remained convinced of the importance of the
historical approach in anthropology and of studying cultural change through time, considerations that were
largely ignored by other theoretical frameworks popular in anthropology at the time.

Importance of His Work: Willis became the first Black faculty member at Southern Methodist University
(SMU). While he was popular as a professor in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at SMU, he faced
numerous hurdles. He received the least pay and has said that he felt like he was the "workhorse of the
department" (quoted in Harrison and Harrison 1999, 253), teaching the greatest number of new courses.
Despite being promoted to associate professor with tenure, Willis resigned from SMU in 1972, citing the covert
and overt racism he experienced in the anthropology department.
296  9 · Social Inequalities

     His 1972 article "Skeletons in the Anthropological Closet," published in Reinventing Anthropology, declared
     that anthropology's claim of being the "science of man" was delusional and asserted that anthropology's
     virtual silence on the domination and exploitation of people of color at home and abroad, living outside the
     boundaries of White societies, was not consistent with the field's tradition of scientific anti-racism. Willis
     argued that anthropology was organized around the needs of White people and that most White
     anthropologists did not see people of color as real human beings.

     9.3 Intersections of Inequality

     LEARNING OUTCOMES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       · Explain and give examples of intersectionality.
       · Discuss how accumulated wealth creates systems of social inequality.
       · Give examples of the ways that governing bodies can negatively impact the lived experiences of individuals.
       · Explain caste systems as a type of intersection of political, economic, and racial inequalities.
       · Explain implicit mentalities around poverty, wealth, and equity disparities.

     Intersectionality

     When thinking about social inequalities, it is useful to conceptualize race alongside other characteristics.
     Intersectionality is the observation that one's class, race, sexuality, age, and ability can all define and
     complicate experiences. The concept of intersectionality can be traced back to pre-Civil War America, when
     Sojourner Truth made her "Ain't I a Woman" speech in 1851 at the Ohio Women's Convention in Akron, Ohio,
     addressing the exclusion of Black women from the fight for women's rights. However, the term
     intersectionality was officially coined by critical race theorist and legal scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw (1989) in
     the context of discussing Black feminism. Crenshaw argued that the experience of being a Black woman could
     not be understood in independent terms of either being Black or being a woman; instead, it needed to include
     interactions between the identities, which often reinforce one another. Intersectionality discredits the notion
     that one single aspect of identity--race, for example--can capture the multidimensional nature of people's
     experiences of oppression. In other words, intersectionality emphasizes the ways in which identities
     pertaining to features such as race, gender, and class interact to impact people's lives.

     Anthropologist Faye Harrison, coeditor of African-American Pioneers in Anthropology (1999), has done
     extensive work on intersectionality. She argues that "race is always lived in class- and gender-specific ways"
     (Harrison 1995, 63). For instance, the lived experience of a woman of color will be different from that of a
     White woman. Even though they both experience oppression from patriarchal systems, a woman of color has
     the added intersection of race, impacted by her identity as a woman.

     Much of the work on intersectionality has come out of a critique of the original feminist movement, which
     sometimes generalized women's experiences as monolithic (Hill Collins 2000; A. Y. Davis 1981; McCall 2005;
     Sacks 1989). Feminist and women's studies scholar Chandra Mohanty (1984) criticized the White-middle-
     class-based approach of previous feminist authors, arguing not only that women of color don't need White
     women to save them but that their experiences are vastly different. By incorporating race with gender and
     class, feminist scholars have illustrated how experiences of race are dynamic.

     In the collection of studies of race, class, and gender that occurred around the turn of the 21st century,
     anthropologist Leith Mullings (2002) developed the concept of the Sojourner syndrome to capture the
     interlocking ways in which race, class, gender, and resistance to oppression shape Black women's bodies and
     biology. The Sojourner syndrome emphasizes that race, class, and gender are not necessarily multiplied to
     mean more oppression, but they change the ways people experience oppression. In the Harlem Birthright
     Project, funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to study racial disparities in health,
     Mullings uses the Sojourner syndrome to argue that Black women, because of intersecting structural
     inequalities, are forced to do more work than either their White female or Black male counterparts, which
     increases their stress levels and negatively impacts their health.

Another way intersectional identities can compound oppression is captured by the term misogynoir. Misogyny
is the socialized prejudice against women and feminine characteristics. Misogynoir, a term coined by queer
Black feminist Moya Bailey, describes the anti-Black racist misogyny that Black women specifically
experience. Misogynoir is the intersection of the systems of sexism and racism experienced by Black women.
More recently, Bailey has written about Black women's digital resistance to misogynoir on YouTube, Facebook,
and other online platforms (2021).

In addition to creating challenges to the status quo, intersectionality can also inspire creative opportunities for
new perspectives and new role models. On January 20, 2021, former senator Kamala Harris was inaugurated
as the 49th vice president of the United States. Not only is she the first female vice president and the highest-
ranking female official in US history, but her ethnic and racial background makes her the first Black American
and the first Asian American person to hold this office. When she broke these "glass ceilings" (barriers to
promotion that often affect women and members of minority groups), she was celebrated as a role model for
many. There is even an unofficial Twitter fan group that calls itself "The #Khive Movement
(https://openstax.org/r/khive-kamala-haris)" as well as other pro-Harris groups inspired by her example (e.g.,

Mamas for Momala). Her supporters frequently cite her background as an inspiring triumph that allows for

new voices representing diverse groups in our society.

Overall, the Biden administration has pledged to have "the most diverse cabinet in American history" (see the
"Biden Diversity Tracker (https://openstax.org/r/biden-diversity-tracker)"). On October 28, 2021, President Joe
Biden appointed Sara Minkara (https://openstax.org/r/get-to-know-sara) as the US special advisor on
international disability rights. In this foreign policy role, Minkara, who lost her eyesight at the age of seven, will
promote and protect the rights of people with disabilities, again representing diverse voices of historically
underrepresented groups.

     Personal History: Yolanda Moses was born in Washington, DC, but spent most of her childhood in Southern
     California. An active participant in the civil rights movement in the 1960s, she was inspired to pursue a
     doctoral program in anthropology after meeting Margaret Mead.

     Area of Anthropology: Dr. Moses is currently professor of anthropology and associate vice chancellor for
     diversity, excellence, and equity at the University of California, Riverside. Her research focuses on the origins
     of social inequalities, relying on both comparative ethnographic and survey methods. She has examined
     gender and class disparities in the Caribbean, East Africa, and the United States. Dr. Moses's most recent
     research has focused on issues of diversity and change in universities and colleges in the United States, India,
     Europe, and South Africa.

     Accomplishments in the Field: Dr. Moses has served as president of the American Anthropological
     Association (1995-1997), the City University of New York's City College of New York (1993-1999), and the
     American Association for Higher Education (2000-2003). She received the Donna Shavlik Award for
     leadership and mentoring of women from the American Council on Education in 2007 and the Franz Boas
     Award for Exemplary Service to Anthropology from the American Anthropological Association in 2015.

     Importance of Her Work: Dr. Moses has received numerous grants from the Ford Foundation, the National
     Science Foundation, and the National Endowment of the Humanities. These grants have been awarded for
     projects examining the experiences of faculty who are women of color, questions of leadership and diversity in
     higher education, and, more broadly, race and human variation. She is a coauthor of Race: Are We So
     Different? and was influential in the RACE Project, a national public education project on race and human
     variation sponsored by the American Anthropological Association.

     Global Inequalities

     Anthropologists, along with other social scientists, recognize that all social systems and structures have
     developed through a multitude of decisions made by people with social, political, and economic power as well
     as through the daily interactions and imaginations of individuals. The current world system is the result of an
     amalgamation of events and historical forces that led humanity, step by step, to the world as it is today. Social
     systems and social structures are constructed and governed by the people who live within them; they are not
     ahistorical, and they are not unchanging. Capitalism is an economic system, but it is also the result of the ways
     in which people and groups interact with each other and with the natural world. Presidents elected by slim

margins, compromises that benefited one political party over the other, and responses to natural disasters and
other events, some of which may have seemed inconsequential at the time, all played a role in creating the
current reality. Structures exist and order the world, but they do not exist outside of it.

When talking about the effect of capitalism, it is important to recognize the ways in which these systems of
inequality can intersect to both benefit the powerful and exploit the poor. Wealth inequalities and capital
accumulation have deeply impacted and continued to impact cultures around the world, leaving almost none
untouched. There are two broad forces that shape this movement of economic capital. One of those forces,
which encourages further and further accumulation of wealth within a single family, is intergenerational
wealth. Intergenerational wealth is wealth that is passed down through generations, accumulating interest
over many years. This money is typically invested to increase its value rather than circulated in the economy,
further impacting wealth inequalities. The other force that has affected global wealth inequalities is
colonialism. Colonialism is a system through which European (and eventually American) countries exerted
power over areas of the world in order to exploit their natural and human resources. Capitalism relies on the
extraction of resources, laborers to process those resources, and consumers to purchase the finished products.
Colonialism provided all three in the form of a global proletariat (worker) class: a group of people whose labor
is the foundational resource for production. Contemporary scholars recognize colonialism as one of the most
important forces in the current global system of inequality.

cultures before colonization and the arbitrary colonial borders established by European nations. (attribution:

In the middle of the 20th century, many previously colonized countries gained independence. Due to
worldwide economic downturns and ongoing colonial relationships with powerful Western countries, most did
not have the means to develop their infrastructure, political organization, or economic sectors. These
countries were also at a disadvantage as a result of decisions made by European powers at the Berlin
Conference, which split Africa according to the wants of Western colonial powers rather than established
Indigenous territories and spheres of political influence. Part of the ongoing turmoil within Africa stems from
the fact that national boundaries were created with resources in mind, instead of the people who lived there.

What exactly does this have to do with social inequalities, poverty, or wealth? And how do international trade
and development policies affect people without power at local levels? In the simplest terms, international
structures of power affect every part of daily life for those living in poverty, especially people of color, women,
and people living with disabilities. The intersections of political, economic, and social institutions reduce the
number of resources available, leading to profound levels of inequity. Recognizing the long-standing effects of
300  9 · Social Inequalities

     colonialism is vital to understanding the continuing inequities and poverty that are characteristic of so many
     territories that were once colonized.

     To understand international structures of poverty and wealth, it is useful to also examine neocolonialism.
     Neocolonialism refers to the indirect ways in which modern capitalist interests continue to put pressure on
     poor nations through economic, political, or military means in order to further exploit wealth for multinational
     corporations and their allies. Rosemary Hollis, professor of Middle Eastern studies, once argued that Britain
     "went out the door and came back in through the window" (H.C. Foreign Affairs Committee 2013, Ev 20),
     meaning that it gave up its colonial holdings only to influence these nations through other means.

     The main way in which neocolonialism plays out is through economic relief programs. The Global North, a
     term that represents powerful nations along with corporations and intergovernmental groups run by
     individuals from these countries, exerts power through targeted economic relief. The best-known agencies for
     economic relief are the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). These groups, which
     have a lot of money, loan that money to Global South nations, which are exploited and "underdeveloped"
     countries that are experiencing economic or political crises. However, these loans come with many
     stipulations, most of which are called austerity practices. Austerity practices force governments to reduce
     public funding for health and education sectors, thus privatizing health care and education. For countries
     whose citizens are poor, introducing private health and education sectors results in a severe lack of access
     because many individuals cannot pay for these services.

     Structural Violence

     Privatization is also part of global neoliberal economics. Neoliberalism is an economic model that prioritizes
     privatization of public services in order to decrease government spending, based on the idea that free markets
     and supply and demand will lead to economic progress and development. Neoliberal policies have historically
     led to power structures that increase inequity for those who are already marginalized: the poor, women, and
     people of color. When individuals cannot fulfill their basic needs, they experience ongoing harm. Norwegian
     sociologist Johan Galtung calls this experience of intersecting, overlapping structures of discrimination
     (racism, sexism, classism, ageism, etc.) structural violence. Structural violence occurs when social
     institutions or practices reinforce inequalities, preventing certain social groups from obtaining basic needs.
     This can be an intentional or unintentional consequence.

     Anthropologist and physician Paul Farmer's (2003) work in Haiti addresses the connections between
     neoliberal practices and structural violence. Farmer notes that the intersection of gender, race, class, and
     health disparities in Haiti result in specific health challenges for which the political, economic, and social
     systems take little responsibility. In the township of Cange, Haiti, where residents were predominantly
     farmers, a dam funded by the IMF flooded a fertile valley and displaced residents from their fields, forcing
     them to move to the less fertile hillsides or to cities. They were provided with no subsequent public support
     networks, such as schools or hospitals. The amalgamation of these factors--loss of economic resources from
     farming, forced wage labor in the cities, and privatized education and health--resulted in what Farmer
     described as an inherently oppressive way of life. Many of the villagers who moved to Port-au-Prince, the
     capital of Haiti, were forced to rely on wage labor, with some resorting to the sex tourism industry to survive. In
     the 1980s, some of these villagers became infected with HIV. For these Haitians, the displacement from their
     villages, caused by the dam funded by the IMF, was the root cause of their later inability to fulfill basic needs
     and their experience of further suffering. This is a prime example of structural violence.

     By understanding how class systems, poverty, wealth, and economic inequities intersect around the world,
     anthropologists can hope to change international programs that are based on presupposed hierarchies
     between the "first world" and "third world" and between the powerful and exploited classes. Anthropologist
     William S. Willis Jr. firmly states that "anthropologists must give no credence to the vicious theory that poor
     people are responsible for their poverty" (1972, 149). Theories of inequity show that poverty and success are
     most often the result not of individual actions but of the identities that individuals have, the diverse obstacles
     they have experienced, and, in large part, the lottery of their birth. Anthropological examinations of inequity
     must take careful consideration of institutional and structural inequalities while still upholding the ability of
     the individual to be an instigator of broader change. According to Willis, anthropology's goal is to end the

9.4 Studying In: Addressing Inequities within Anthropology

LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Examine the effects of White supremacy in anthropology.
  · Give examples of how anthropologists in other subfields are working against White supremacy and colonialism.
  · Explain what decolonizing anthropology entails.

This section explores how anthropologists have looked within their own discipline to address ways in which
they may be reproducing inequities through their practices and approach. Anthropologist Laura Nader uses
the phrase "studying up" (1972) to call for more research on people and institutions with power. Following
anthropologist Pamela Runestad (2017), this chapter uses the phrase "studying in" to address how
anthropologists have looked at their own practices, training, methodologies, and assumptions and how
anthropology as a discipline may in fact be contributing to inequities for students, practitioners, and the
communities with which anthropologists engage.

Even though the construct of race has roots in anthropology, anthropologist Leith Mullings (2005) argues that
critical studies of race and racism did not originally develop in anthropology. Mullings attributes this to the fact
that anthropologists still do not agree about the role of race and racism within the discipline or how the
categories of race have emerged and persisted in society. In addition, Mullings argues that many cultural
anthropologists have focused on ethnicity, becoming "race avoidant" by not even mentioning race in
ethnographies. Mullings warns that "race avoidant" anthropologists consequently ignore racism (Mullings
2005, 670).

In recent years, anthropologists have looked at the ways in which knowledge production and anthropological
methods are rooted in White supremacy. Within the subfield of archaeology, anthropologists Maria Franklin
and colleagues discuss how "archaeology has been used to justify imperialism, the displacement of Native
Americans and Indigenous peoples from their lands, scientific racism, ethnocentrism, and xenophobic
nationalism" throughout the world (Franklin et al. 2020, 754). However, archaeology does not exist in a
vacuum, and these anthropologists also discuss ways to reimagine archaeology to do anti-racism work,
especially in light of the Black Lives Matter movement. These efforts include encouraging growing numbers of
members of minority groups as academic colleagues and seeking research sites that represent the lived
experiences of minority populations. In 2020, Meredith Poole, a researcher for the Colonial Williamsburg
Foundation in Williamsburg, Virginia, began a project (https://openstax.org/r/williamsburgs-black-
archaeologists) identifying previously unrecognized Black archaeologists and excavators who had worked for
Colonial Williamsburg in the 1930s. Additionally, Colonial Williamsburg archaeologists are currently working
to excavate the First Baptist Church (https://openstax.org/r/first-baptist-church), one of the earliest Black
churches in the United States. Projects such as these are critically important to the academic search for truth.
Not only does this knowledge correct inaccuracies in the historical record, but it also serves to correct the
course of future academic work.

     FIGURE 9.11 In recent years, Colonial Williamsburg has undertaken various projects aimed at highlighting the
     contributions of Black archeologists and the lived experiences of people of color in the American colonial period.

     Archaeologists Kylie Quave and colleagues (2020) have written about the ways in which introductory
     archaeology classes taught in the United States have often been problematic and how those teaching these
     courses are currently using anti-colonial and decolonial theories to revise curricula to promote equity within
     the discipline. Quave and her colleagues found that students taking revised curricula developed more complex
     understandings of the benefits and harms of archeological knowledge production and were better able to
     articulate the inequities in the discipline.

     In April 2021, the Association of Black Anthropologists (ABA), the Society of Black Archaeologists (SBA), and
     the Black in Bioanthropology Collective (BiBA) released a collective statement regarding the possession and
     unethical use of the remains of the children of MOVE and the Africa family. In May 1985, the city of
     Philadelphia dropped two bombs onto the MOVE compound, home of "a revolutionary group of Black people
     opposed to capitalist growth and committed to environmental justice and interspecies harmony" (ABA, SBA,
     and BiBA 2021). The bombs killed 11 MOVE members inside the compound, including five children, and
     destroyed the neighborhood, incinerating at least 61 homes. Two forensic anthropologists, Alan Mann and
     Janet Monge, were hired by Philadelphia officials to identify the remains. In April 2021, various news outlets
     revealed that either Mann or Monge kept the remains two child victims, Tree Africa and Delisha Africa, in their
     personal possession after the investigation, moving them between the University of Pennsylvania and
     Princeton University. In addition, the family of the deceased were never notified of the remains, nor were the
     remains returned to the family. In response, the ABA, SBA, and BiBA supported and republished the demands
     of Mike Africa Jr., who was six years old when the Philadelphia police dropped the bomb on MOVE. The
     collective statement acknowledged the long history of White supremacy and anti-Blackness within the
     discipline and called on White anthropologists to actively work to undo the violence committed against non-
     White communities.

     In Decolonizing Anthropology: Moving Further toward an Anthropology for Liberation (2010), edited by
     anthropologist Faye V. Harrison, the term decolonizing anthropology is used to emphasize the responsibility
     of anthropologists to work for the enhancement and empowerment of those most alienated and dispossessed.
     While decolonization refers to different ideas in different disciplines, the principal goal of the Decolonizing
     Anthropology volume is "to encourage more anthropologists to accept the challenge of working to free the
     study of humankind from the prevailing forces of global inequality and dehumanization and to locate it firmly
     in the complex struggle for genuine transformation" (Harrison 2010, 10). This work to decolonize, transform,
     and liberate anthropology is still happening, and the discipline still has a long way to go in decolonizing each of
     the subfields of anthropology and decolonizing methods and pedagogy to make classroom spaces more

        MINI-FIELDWORK ACTIVITY

American Census Archive Research

Browse through the US Census Bureau website (data.census.gov (https://openstax.org/r/data-census-gov)).
Look at the categories from 1790, when the first US census was taken. Compare them to the 2020 census. How
are these categories different? Who is being counted and how? Who is excluded?
Go one step further and search through two different zip codes. Look at the demographic makeup of each area.
Can you see differences in household income? Education attainment? What if you go to Google Maps? Can you
correlate this information with other causes of inequities? Are there grocery stores in these areas? Bus and
subway stops? What is the population density of the area? Do you know anything of the history of the zip code?
Construct a visual that best explains the differences between the historical and contemporary censuses. Then,
do the same with the two zip codes. Draw conclusions about social inequalities throughout history and in
contemporary times.

10.2 Early Global Movements and Cultural Hybridity

10.4 Inequality along the Margins
INTRODUCTION The word migration is likely to bring to mind a stereotype familiar to American culture:
people voluntarily coming into another country in search of work and other opportunities. Yet this is only one
aspect of the meaning of migration as understood by anthropologists. Migration, put simply, is movement
from one place to another that reestablishes a household, either permanently or temporarily. Examples of
migration include seasonal movements in search of work, temporary movements due to a crisis or local
challenges, transnational movements from one nation to another, and even occasional moves from one
household to another over a lifetime (sometimes referred to as internal versus external migration). Migrants,
by extension, are simply people who move. Other than those relatively few people who are living in the same
house they were born into, we are all migrants of one sort or another. Within this larger category of migrants,
immigrants are individuals who move permanently from one country (where they are referred to as
emigrants) to another country (where they are called immigrants).
312  10 · The Global Impact of Human Migration

     The human species, along with our ancestors, has practiced migration from our earliest origins. It is part of
     who we are. Most living species migrate in some way, but humans move more widely than other species and
     modify the landscape the most through their movements. Human migration impacts the world in innumerable
     ways.

     10.1 Peopling of the World

     LEARNING OUTCOMES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       · Describe the early migration patterns of the genus Homo.
       · Distinguish the primary controversies in the peopling of America theories.
       · Identify major pre-Clovis sites in the United States.

     Early Hominin Migrations

     Human species were migratory from the beginning, moving as small populations of gatherers and hunters
     within eastern and southern Africa. By following game and the availability of seasonal vegetation from place to
     place, these small groups of nomads learned about their landscape, interacted with each other, and met their
     subsistence needs. Their daily needs came through interaction with a changing environment. With the
     emergence of Homo erectus around 1.89 million years BP (before the present), hominins expanded their
     territories and began to exhibit increasing control over their environment and an ability to adapt, evidenced by
     the development of new subsistence systems, including cultivation, pastoralism, and agriculture, and an
     upsurge in migration within Africa and, eventually, into Asia and Europe. This expansion into new
     geographical regions was a hallmark of the later human species.

     There are several theories on possible migratory sequences within and beyond the African continent. One
     possibility is that by 1.75 million years ago, Homo ergaster had begun migrating out of Africa, moving
     northward into Eurasia. Another theory argues that an earlier hominin species, either australopithecine or an
     early as-yet-unknown species of the genus Homo, migrated out of Africa around 2 million years ago, eventually
     evolving into the population of Dmanisi hominins who were settled in eastern Europe by 1.85 million years
     ago, possibly representing another link between H. erectus and H. ergaster. Although settlement dates are
     currently being retested and reexamined for precision (Matsu'ura et al. 2020), it is known that between 1.3 and
     1.6 million years ago, H. erectus settled on Java, an island that is now part of Indonesia. They likely traveled
     there by a land route, as seas were lower during the Pleistocene Ice Age (approximately 2.588 million-11,700
     years ago), allowing for more passage through interior coastal routes. (For more on early human migrations,
     see The Genus Homo Homo and the Emergence of Us.)

     Regardless of the specific time frame and migration pattern, it is well established that there was gene flow
     between various hominin populations, which indicates that there were migration and exchange. With the
     migration of these early hominin populations, cultural practices and improvements in toolmaking spread as
     well. Wherever humans traveled, they carried with them their traditions, intermingling and reproducing both
     physically and culturally.

     Controversies Surrounding the Peopling of the Americas

     Current evidence points to the emergence of the genus Homo in Africa. From these beginnings, human
     populations began moving toward the global north, east, and south in migratory waves. Motivations for these
     migrations included animal movements, overcrowding and resource scarcity, and, likely, curiosity and
     adventure. The movement into the Western Hemisphere, into North and South America, occurred significantly
     later than migrations into Europe and Asia; how much later is a question of enormous controversy today. How
     did the first peoples make their way to the Americas? When did they first arrive, and how did they migrate
     within these vast continents? The available evidence is inconclusive, leaving us with one of the biggest
     enigmas in human evolution. While there is some debate on whether earlier human species migrated into the
     Americas, the evidence we have today points to members of the species Homo sapiens being the earliest
     humans to do so. At this point, there is no evidence of any earlier hominin species in either North or South
     America. The Western Hemisphere was wholly settled by migrants coming from other continents.

There are many theories regarding the first human migration into the Western Hemisphere. Because of
changing global climate conditions and the retreat of glaciers toward the end of the Pleistocene epoch, new
lands opened to migrating animals and the humans who were likely hunting them (Wooller et al. 2018). As
always, because of limited and ambiguous artifact and fossil findings, the primary pieces of evidence are open
to multiple interpretations. Upon examining the range of theories, two primary arguments are apparent. Both
of these arguments are backed by supporting evidence, and both rely on migratory patterns of H. sapiens in
the Americas that have been definitively established. While both migration theories are valid, the question that
remains open to argument is which came first, coastal or interior migration?

  · The interior route, also called the Bering Strait theory, is the best-known and most accepted theory for the
      first human migration into the Americas. The foundation of this theory is the Beringia "land bridge," which
      connected northeast Siberia and what is now Alaska when sea levels were lower due to glacial ice
      formation on the continents. This theory proposes that the earliest human habitants of the Americas
      crossed this marshy land on foot, most likely beginning around 15,000 years ago based on artifacts and
      dating sequences. The Beringia land bridge was alternately exposed and submerged multiple times over
      the earth's history. According to the interior route theory, the earliest humans crossed this marshy land in
      pursuit of migratory herds of mammals and then proceeded to filter southward, splitting into multiple
      groups, some of which penetrated into the interior of North America as they continued to move east and
      south.

      FIGURE 10.2 The interior route theory argues that a northeastern Siberian population of hunters first entered
      the Americas on foot from Beringia following migrating herds, while the coastal route theory argues that the
      earliest migrants followed fish and sea animals by boat along the Pacific coast of the Western Hemisphere.
      Although the precise date for the earliest migrations is debated, it is estimated to be between 15,000 and
      18,000 years ago. (credit: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)

  · The coastal route is also based on the migration of a northeastern Siberian population into the Western
      Hemisphere, but by boat rather than on foot. This theory, sometimes called the kelp highway hypothesis,
      proposes that the earliest migratory populations followed the continental coastline southward, subsisting
      on kelp, fish, shellfish, birds, and sea mammals. Research by archaeologist Jon Erlandson (Erlandson et al.
      2007; Ocean Wise 2017) suggests that migrants may have followed these food sources all along the
      continental shelf, a shallow sea area near the shore. Some believe that they eventually reached as far south
      as Chile, in South America, before breaking into groups and penetrating the interior lands.

Each theory presents its own probabilities and problems in relation to dating sequences and artifacts, and
there were possibly multiple early routes for the peopling the Americas. Scientific research does agree on
some known facts, however. Genetic sequencing shows continuity between the earliest Americans and
populations in northeastern Siberia that indicates the earliest inhabitants of the Americas arrived no more
than 25,000 years ago, making the Americas the most recent continental habitation (outside of Antarctica).
Humans were already inhabiting Australia by the time other humans first arrived in the Americas.
314  10 · The Global Impact of Human Migration

     Archaeological sites in the Americas present fascinating evidence of early human migrations, with the dating
     sequences continually being retested and revised. Based on some of the early archaeological evidence,
     scientists had believed that the first American inhabitants were part of what is known as the Clovis culture,
     identified with a leaf-shaped projectile point used in hunting. As excavations have continued, though, there is
     growing indication of an extensive pre-Clovis culture, evidenced by a pre-Clovis technology based on
     gathering, hunting, and fishing, with dates extending back further than 13,200 years before present. Pre-
     Clovis projectile points are smaller, less standardized, and less worked (flaked), indicating a less advanced tool
     production. Many pre-Clovis sites are located below the Clovis period occupation. As archaeologists have
     continued excavations, the dates for earliest occupation continue to be pushed backward.

     FIGURE 10.3 Clovis points from the Virginia Aquarium and Marine Science Center. Clovis points are long, leaf-
     shaped points that are bifacial, or flaked on both sides. (credit: "Virginia Aquarium & Marine Science Center
     Arrowheads Clovis Point Stone Tools" by C Watts/flickr, CC BY 2.0)
     Why so much debate about the settling of the Americas? There are various reasons for the difficulties in
     establishing settlement dates. The Bering land bridge was periodically exposed and submerged under water
     during periods of glacial growth and retreat. Using core samples obtained by drilling down into the shallow sea
     floor, archaeologists have found evidence of large mammals and even fluted points (hunting tools) in and
     around the Aleutian Islands, through which the land bridge would have crossed. Establishing and cross-
     checking dates, though, has been difficult because most evidence is now submerged. This is a challenge also
     for the coastal route theory, as coastlines have receded since the end of the Pleistocene, and encampments
     would have likely been small, possibly temporary sites. Many sites are likely now submerged offshore (Gruhn
     2020).
     Among the best-known pre-Clovis sites are the following:

       · Monte Verde Site, Chile. This is one of the most studied pre-Clovis sites. An extensive array of artifacts has
           been found at Monte Verde, including hearths, wooden and stone tools, animal bones, and even human
           footprints. The dates assigned to these artifacts, as early as 16,000 BP, put this site within the range of pre-
           Clovis dates seen in North America.

       · Debra L. Friedkin Site, Texas. This pre-Clovis site has a dating sequence of 13,500 to 15,500 BP. A wide
           range of pre-Clovis tools have been found here, including partially flaked tools, blades, and scrapers.

       · Cactus Hill Site, Virginia. A well-document Clovis site has been identified at Cactus Hill, but below this
           level of artifacts, there is evidence of pre-Clovis projectile points. Although controversial, these points have
           possible dating sequences of 18,000-22,000 BP.

FIGURE 10.4 A pre-Clovis archaeological site in Sussex County, Virginia, in the United States (credit: "Nottoway
Archaeological Site Entrance" by Nyttend/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)

Based on this new evidence, scientists now agree that the Americas were first settled by a pre-Clovis
population. How they arrived, when they arrived, what movements they made, and in what order they made
them are major archaeological questions today. What we can conclude is that human populations continued to
migrate after peopling the Americas.

10.2 Early Global Movements and Cultural Hybridity

LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Explain the ways that globalization connects local populations through the phenomena of flows.
  · Describe the roles that colonialism played in shifting populations between colonizing and colonized nations.
  · Distinguish between diaspora, transnationalism, and cultural hybridity.
  · Explain the contemporary forces of postcolonialism and forced migration.

Colonialism and Migration as Global Forces

The global movement that characterizes our current period in history is not preordained. The volatile and
powerful nature of multinational cultural change and economic exploitation associated with this global
movement is connected with specific historical forces. One of the most consequential early global forces was
colonialism, an exploitative relationship between state societies in which one has political dominance over the
other, primarily for economic advantage. Colonialism did not only affect the countries enmeshed in colonial
relationships; it also established world alliances and enduring social, political, and economic changes.

Some scholars date the earliest emergence of colonialism to the city-states of Mesopotamia in western Asia, an
area occupied today by parts of Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Kuwait, and Syria. Evidence indicates that by around 3500
BCE, the northern and southern regions were connected by exploitative trade relationships and intense and
prolonged warfare. US archaeologists Guillermo Algaze and Clemens Reichel (Algaze 2013; Wilford 2007), in
excavations at Uruk in ancient Mesopotamia, have unearthed trade goods that indicate a vast exchange
network involving items such as pottery, jewelry, metalwork, and even wine. There is also a pattern of
destruction and warfare at Uruk and, more recently, at Tell Hamoukar in modern-day Syria, which indicates
the movement of populations as well as trade goods. Tell Hamoukar was a major site of obsidian tool and blade
manufacture as early as 4500 BCE, with raw materials coming from as far away as modern-day Turkey, some
100 miles to the north. At Tell Hamoukar, collapsed walls and a large number of penetrating clay bullets, likely
delivered by slingshots, are some of the oldest known artifacts of organized warfare. The archaeological sites
indicate that there was armed conflict and that groups of people were moving between locations. The patterns
of destruction across these various sites suggest that populations were most likely vying for control over
resources and production sites, similar to conflicts associated with more modern colonialism, which also were
316  10 · The Global Impact of Human Migration

     primarily characterized by a drive for political control based on access to raw materials and resources.

     After these early beginnings, colonialism spread, including the development of European and Mediterranean
     settlements in northern Africa. The Phoenicians, from what is now modern-day Lebanon, established the city
     of Carthage in what is now Tunisia to facilitate and control trade throughout the Mediterranean area. Carthage
     remained an important hub for trade from its founding in the 9th century BCE until it was destroyed by the
     Roman Empire in 146 BCE. In what is now modern-day Egypt, the Macedonian king Alexander the Great
     founded the city of Alexandria in 331 BCE. Alexandria rapidly grew in economic and political influence
     because of its control over Mediterranean trade routes; in the Greek confederation of city-states, only Rome
     was more powerful. As colonizing nations consolidated their political and economic influence, they
     increasingly sought to expand their access to the natural resources and human labor of other societies.
     Colonial occupations were repeatedly marked by violence.

     By the end of the 15th century, when Christopher Columbus began the first of what would be four voyages
     (1492-1504) to the New World, many of the nations of Europe were aggressively seeking new territories,
     establishing what is now called the Age of Discovery (1500s-1700s). During this period, Spain, Portugal, the
     Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany, and Great Britain all funded sea and land voyages to seek out new
     territories in order to expand their global influence. The modern-day European world order of developed and
     developing nations emerged from the colonialism begun during of the Age of Discovery.

     Across the globe, generations of Indigenous peoples contested European colonizers. Often fighting with less
     effective weaponry; having little or no immunity to Old World diseases such as smallpox, measles, typhus, and
     cholera, which decimated their populations; and balancing efforts to defend their homelands and families with
     the desperate need to maintain agricultural production to fend off famines, Indigenous people frequently
     migrated from one area to another, leaving behind land and crops. In the Andean area, forasteros, a group of
     Indigenous peoples, became nomadic to flee oppression. Declaring ownership and control over lands and
     people who had few effective means to challenge them, European nations quickly established colonies
     throughout North and South America, the Caribbean, Africa, and Asia. Politically, most colonies were beset
     with conflict and periodic uprisings, such as the Great Rebellion of Tupac Amaru II from 1780 to 1783 in
     Cuzco, Peru, during which Andean peoples came very close to toppling the Spanish government after almost
     250 years of oppression. During this period, there also emerged new sociocultural institutions and rituals
     blending colonizing and Indigenous cultures as aspects such as food and religious beliefs became entangled
     (Carballo 2020). This blending is referred to as creolization. Culturally, the dismantling of Indigenous
     languages, religions, and other institutions continues to be devastating.

     Late European colonialism of the 18th to the 20th century, sometimes called classic colonialism, was a period
     in which the institutions of control and extraction were standardized, especially in Africa. This period of
     colonialism is characterized by very specific goals, policies, and attitudes. The colonial relationship was
     symbolically depicted as one of benevolence between the "mother country" and the colony, with people such
     as missionaries, colonial advisors, settlers, businesspeople, and teachers all working together to promote
     economic development and Europeanization in the colony. The official justification for these practices was that
     European Christians had a "White man's burden" to spread their civilization worldwide. Beneath this rhetoric,
     however, the goals were power and control. Colonialism was an extractive and exploitative economic venture
     with a social structure designed to dehumanize Indigenous peoples. Raw materials were extracted from the
     colonies using low-paid Indigenous labor and sent to European nations, where they were transformed into
     goods that were then sold back to the colony and its Indigenous peoples at an enormous profit for the
     Europeans. Indigenous cultures were severely damaged or destroyed. Frequently, Indigenous peoples were
     removed from their homelands and settled on reservations or within territories that were of less use to the
     Europeans, freeing up large swaths of land for European immigrants. Many young Indigenous people,
     handpicked for their skills and aptitude, were sent to European countries to be educated and acculturated as
     future leaders in the colonies. The intention of this preparatory system was to disrupt the influence of
     Indigenous cultures and create enduring pro-European institutions within the colonies. It also served to divide
     the Indigenous populations, further weakening them. In other cases, Indigenous peoples were bought, sold,
     and traded as commodities, moving them away from their languages, cultures, and families. From the 16th to
     the 19th century, it is estimated that between 10 and 12 million Africans were enslaved and transported from

Africa to the Americas in the transatlantic slave trade. The massive scale of this forced migration changed the
world ethnically, culturally, linguistically, and economically. Untold millions of Africans died in the
enslavement process, fracturing families, communities, and societies. While the movement and mixing of so
many different peoples resulted in expansive cultural innovation in areas such as languages, foods, religions,
and rituals, the cost of this massive displacement in human lives and human potential was incalculably high,
leaving scars and challenges that continue today.

These policies, of removing peoples from their homelands and of sending young people far from home for
schooling and enculturation, are just two examples of the ways in which colonialism forced people onto new
lands and into new cultures. As colonies grew into empires, with many different nations under the control of a
single European nation--such as Great Britain, which had colonies in places as far apart as Kenya, Australia,
and Canada--there was a global movement of people and cultures across continents.

Colonization also affected those living in European countries, influencing contemporary identities in many
ways. The area of modern-day Poland was partitioned several times by neighboring nation-states and was
colonized by both Germany and Russia during World War II and its aftermath. In this eastern European nation,
the impacts of migration and change continue to affect the way Poland sees itself today. The various
movements of peoples and cultures have left Poland uneasy with its own history and national identity. In her
research on culture-focused museums in Poland, sociocultural anthropologist and curator Erica Lehrer (2020)
studies the contested narratives within the legacies of collecting, categorizing, and displaying objects in
postcolonial countries where prior migrations have changed the nature of national identity.

FIGURE 10.5 The Museum of the History of Polish Jews opened in Warsaw, Poland, in 2005. It focuses on Jewish
history in Poland, with a mission of promoting openness, tolerance, and truth. (credit: "Warszawa - Muzeum Historii
ydów Polskich POLIN" by Fred Romero/flickr, CC BY 2.0)

In its history, Poland has been both the colonizing nation (in regard to neighboring states in eastern Europe)
and the colonized (in regard to its long history as a colony of Russia and its later occupation during World War
II). Depleted by wars, out-migration, territorial shifts, and genocide, Poland's contemporary population is far
more homogeneous by race, class, and religion than it was prior to World War II. Museum depictions of
Poland's culture and national identity have created a host of what Lehrer calls "awkward objects" (2020, 290)
that hark back to earlier, and sometimes darker, historical periods. These include museums objects made by
non-Jewish Poles representing their memory and imagination of Jews in the pre-World War II era, some
depicting ambiguous racial stereotypes, as well as hybrid objects that could have been artifacts of either
Jewish or Catholic communities but are depicted by object origin and associated with only one of those
communities. One example is a collection of children's noisemakers, which were depicted in the museum as
artifacts from a Catholic Polish community without noting that Jewish Polish children would have played with
similar toys at that time. And how should a Polish cultural museum handle darker awkward artifacts, such as
carvings of a gas chamber at Auschwitz? The roles and responsibilities that contemporary societies have in
telling these parts of their history are relevant to museums and cultural institutions around the globe.
318  10 · The Global Impact of Human Migration

     Museums often house artifacts of colonialism. Think about cultural and historical museums that you have
     visited. How did they tell the story of the darker parts of history? Are certain historical periods overlooked or
     underdeveloped?

     Lehrer calls for pluralist contextualization, meaning that museums should not just include the cultural origins
     of the object but also indicate how they were obtained and how they connect with other cultural communities.
     Citing a need for ethical curatorial principles, she says:

           Strategic curatorial approaches can frame objects to function as a source of ethical inspiration and
          empathy, spurring people to acknowledge and address those histories that are unchosen by national
           or communal authorities. . . . Decolonising the museum here is not about restitution. These "awkward
           objects" are most valuable to us curated in ongoing, caring conversation wherever historical injuries
           still resonate, reminding us that we are tied together by our wounds. (307, 311)

     Postcolonialism, Indigenous Identities, and Forced Migration

     Although colonialism as a direct politico-economic policy is usually associated with earlier historical periods,
     it continues to have effects on the world today. The enduring politico-economic relationships established by
     colonialism have left behind concentrations of capital and technology, wealth and privilege in the former
     colonizing countries, mainly in Europe, as well as inequality, racism, and violence in the relationships between
     these nations and their colonies. These aftereffects of colonial relationships are referred to as
     postcolonialism. As independence movements began to take hold in the early 20th century, former colonies
     found themselves depleted of resources and competing against European countries whose growth came from
     their own demise. Today, postcolonialism is a significant topic for anthropologists whose research focuses on
     the effects of colonialism, marginalization, and intersectionality, where race, gender, and class identities come
     together.

     One of the most prominent consequences of colonialism is the inequality between the so-called developed
     countries and the developing or underdeveloped ones. Following World War II and the rise of a new world
     order, many political and economic theories began to distinguish between "first world" countries, which had
     the highest GDPs (gross domestic products) based on the total value of all goods and services produced in a
     country, and those with the lowest GDPs, referred to as "third world" countries. The "second world" tier was
     typically reserved for those countries with a socialist or communist government. In this tiered and hierarchical
     system, the former colonizers were always within the top tier and their former colonies in the lowest ranks.
     Much of this inequality was due to the exploitation of resources and the brain drain migration of Indigenous
     peoples, in which the wealthiest and most educated members of Indigenous societies relocated to the former
     colonizing nation for education and employment, many leaving their homelands permanently. This out-
     migration devastated many Indigenous families and enhanced the productive capacities of richer nations.
     Many former colonizing countries thus continued to exert influence over their former dependencies even after
     independence. This relationship of unequal influence is referred to as neocolonialism.

     Many Indigenous societies are involved in neocolonial relationships (meaning relationships that are
     structured to make one country dependent on another) with the nation-states in which they live, a situation
     sometimes referred to as second colonialism (Gandhi 2001). Indigenous groups continue to be uprooted, and
     sometimes forcibly removed, from their homelands and moved onto reservations, into "model villages," or
     simply into urban areas. This type of forced migration, an involuntary or coerced removal from a people's
     homeland, can result in poverty, alienation, and loss of cultural identity. Native peoples in the United States
     have been subjected to repeated waves of forced migration since the arrival of Europeans. Many societies were
     forced to move multiple times as White settlers pushed them onto more western and less fertile lands. All of
     this forced dislocation has had significant cultural and economic consequences. As Native Americans Richard
     Meyers (Oglala Lakota) and Ernest Weston Jr. (Oglala Sioux) write:

           Tragedies of many kinds are often all too common for many people who reside on our reservation.
           Endemic poverty creates endless problems for community members, from violent dog packs to
           pervasive alcoholism and diabetes. Dismal statistics paint our reservation as the "Third World" right
           here in the United States. The numbers are hard to pin down but always dreary: Unemployment is
           sometimes listed as being as high as 85-95 percent, and more than 90 percent of the population lives

      below the federal poverty line. (Meyers and Weston 2020)

While many Indigenous peoples in Western nations face unique problems of Western historical paralysis, in
which the nation-state extols the virtues of Indigenous people at a specific time in its history with little or no
regard for contemporary Indigenous identities, some Indigenous peoples are adapting their cultural traditions
to urban areas where they have been forced to migrate. In her study of Indigenous Manchineri youth in the
Brazilian state of Acre, Finnish anthropologist Pirjo Virtanen (2006) found a cultural revival of traditional
puberty rituals for young Manchineri adults. The Manchineri are a lowland Amazonian people who
traditionally practiced slash-and-burn cultivation. Over the past century, their access to farmland has become
increasingly limited, leaving them unable to make a living in the forest. Many young Manchineri have migrated
from their traditional homelands to live in urban areas among other lowland Amazonian Indigenous peoples.
These Manchineri sought to strengthen their cultural identity by reviving and adapting certain traditional
rituals, such as the ayahuasca ceremony, in which pubescent boys ingest a hallucinogenic substance as a
spiritual experience, and a menstruation ceremony in which girls are instructed by their elders on their new
status as adults. Few Manchineri remain on their ancestral homelands, and many of these cultural traditions
were in danger of dying out.

In Acre, the urban Manchineri found that being an "Indigenous person" had social value with Westerners who
appreciated traditional Indigenous cultures. Much of this growth in appreciation came as a result of the rapid
decline of Indigenous cultures and populations and the increasing urbanization and alienation of people from
rural environments. The younger generation of Manchineri began to appreciate their traditional cultural roots
and see the value of maintaining their specific cultural identity, rather than being "lumped" into a broad
category of Indigenous persons, while living in an urban environment. By marking themselves as Manchineri,
they were able to leverage a higher social standing. This process of using identity as a way to gain status is an
example of symbolic capital, or the use of nonmonetary resources to gain social prestige.

Maintaining a specific Indigenous identity within Western nation-states is challenging, as the numbers of
Indigenous peoples continue to decline and migration into urban areas creates a mixture of cultures that
frequently results in the loss of traditional identities. Indigenous identity is complex and not monolithic, as
specific cultural groups have distinct identities; no single spokesperson can realistically represent all
Indigenous people. Recently, pan-Indigenous activist movements have developed worldwide to increase the
visibility and strengthen the voices of Indigenous peoples. These global movements of people and ideas make
it possible for Indigenous people to form alliances for change.

Globalization in Motion

As the connections and interactions between communities, states, countries, and continents have intensified,
a global network of linked forces and institutions known as globalization has emerged. Unlike earlier
worldwide movements, globalization tends to be decentered, meaning it is not controlled by any particular
nation-state or cultural group. Emerging from earlier worldwide historical movements pertaining to
exploration, colonialism, and capitalism, globalization has exceeded them with its reach and has created a
worldwide interdependence far more intense and transformative on a global scale than anything ever before
seen in human history. It involves all aspects of our lives (e.g., political, economic, social, and religious), and it
has no center or origin point. Changes and interactions occur within a dynamic and seemingly arbitrary field
of connections among people, ideas, countries, and technologies.

Globalization causes the movement of people, resources, and ideas in various ways. Not only do people migrate
for work and travel, but they also share ideas and technology, resulting in cultures and populations that are no
longer restricted and contained by geographical boundaries. These globalized cultures and networks have
changed the way that anthropologists think about culture. Culture is no longer solely attached to a local place
and community; rather, it is diffuse and possibly widespread, due to the complicating forces of globalization.

One of the early scholars of globalization is Indian American anthropologist Arjun Appadurai. His research is
grounded in the idea of a new global cultural economy that traffics in multiple simultaneous flows of material
goods, ideas, images, and people, reminding us that global movements and transformations affect every one,
whether or not we actually change the nation or community in which we live. Within globalization, local and
global communities are deeply intertwined in fluid and dynamic relationships of mutual influence. These
320  10 · The Global Impact of Human Migration

     interconnections sometimes lead to unpredictable outcomes. Appadurai (1990) identifies five different global
     cultural flows, tagging each with the suffix -scapes to call attention to the fluidity and multiple ways of viewing
     these flows:

       · Ethnoscapes: the flow of new ideas and new ways of living created by the ongoing migration of
           people--whether tourists, immigrants, refugees, exiles, guest workers, or other groups--across cultures
           and borders. As just one example, the descendants of the Zainichi Koreans who immigrated to Japan
           following World War II have established Korean schools and a Korean university in Japan.

       · Technoscapes: the worldwide movement of technology, both equipment and information, as well as the
           multinational origins and manufacturing process of technology along a global assembly line. One example
           is an iPhone, which has component parts and a manufacturing process that involves many different
           places.

       · Financescapes: the movement of money and capital through currency markets, national stock exchanges,
           and commodity speculations. The funds of even the most local investors are intermingled and invested on
           the global market.

       · Mediascapes: the various types of media representations that influence the way we experience our world.
           These are "image-centered, narrative-based . . . strips of reality" (Appadurai 1990, 299) diffused through
           digital media, magazines, television, and film, introducing characters and plots across cultural settings
           and meanings.

       · Ideoscapes: the flow and interaction of ideas and ideologies. Appadurai describes ideoscapes as
           "terminological kaleidoscopes" (1990, 301) in which words and ideas carrying political and ideological
           meanings are trafficked across cultures. In this process, their meanings become increasingly amorphous
           and obscured. One example is the political change that resulted from a reawakening of democratic
           movements in the Middle East in the 2010s, inspiring the Arab Spring, a series of anti-government
           protests and rebellions. Anti-government protests in Tunisia spilled over into Egypt, Libya, Yemen, Syria,
           and Bahrain, toppling government leaders and triggering social violence.

     Appadurai speaks of these -scapes as primary agencies and intersections within the global cultural economy;
     in other words, each of these -scapes creates change through interactions with others. In this fluid exchange of
     ideas, material goods, and persons, the -scapes interact, overlap, and contradict one another as cultures
     themselves come to be commodities produced and consumed by the global community.

There are multiple perspectives for understanding globalization. It can be interpreted as an imperial force in
which certain countries and cultures have dominance over others, with their images, capital, and ideas
predominating in the global marketplace. Indian anthropologist Sekh Mondal aptly says, "The people earlier
had been the creators and creatures of culture, but today the corporate bodies and media have emerged as the
creators and carriers of cultural attributes" (2007, 94). Globalization can also be viewed as an open-access
community in which governments and corporations have lost the ability to control and isolate populations,
ultimately allowing for more cultural diversity and equality. Globalization today transforms virtually
everything about anthropology--its subject matter, the locales for research, its understanding of the concept of
culture, and the goals that anthropologists bring to their work. Within this context of great change,
anthropology is uniquely capable of making sense of this new global community and its rapidly shifting beliefs
and behaviors.

Diaspora, Transnationalism, and Cultural Hybridity

Migration impacts individuals and cultures in diverse ways. It prompts the dissemination and diffusion of
cultural ideas and artifacts from one cultural context to another, the development of new cultural forms and
practices, and hybridity, in which cultures intermingle in unpredictable ways. Cultural hybridity refers to the
exchange and innovation of ideas and artifacts between cultures as a product of migration and globalization. It
is a commingling of different cultural elements resulting from the interactions of people and their ideas. While
individuals and small groups convey their cultures as they migrate, the movement and dispersal of large
ethnic groups can bring about far more rapid structural changes. This large-scale movement, which might be
caused by warfare, institutionalized violence, or opportunities (most commonly education and employment),
is called diaspora. Related to diaspora is transnationalism, the construction of social, economic, and political
networks that originate in one country and then cross or transcend nation-state boundaries. While diaspora
and transnationalism can both be related to large-scale migration, transnationalism also refers to the cultural
and political projects of a nation-state as it spreads globally (Kearney 1995). One example of this is
transnational corporations, which are anchored in one country with satellites and subsidiaries in others.

Diasporic communities typically have a sense of identity that has been shaped or transformed by the migration
experience. They are characterized by cultural hybridity and often take these new cultural forms with them
into their new homelands, generating cultural revival. The African diaspora resulting from the transatlantic
slave trade brought a wide array of cultural elements to the United States, including new foods (such as okra
and yams), new instruments and musical forms (such as the drums, the banjo, and the development of African
slave spirituals), and new language (words such as jazz, gumbo, and tilapia). Besides the common experience
of being formed through migration, diasporic communities share other characteristics. These include a
collective memory about the ancestral homeland; a social connection to the country of origin, typically through
family still living there; a strong identity as a distinct group; and fictive kinship with diasporic members in
other countries ("Migration Data Relevant" 2021). Diasporic communities are inherently political (Werbner
2001), as their movements connect nation-states in a variety of ways--economically, socially, religiously, and
politically. Some of the best-known diasporas are the African diaspora that was driven by the transatlantic
slave trade from the 15th to the 19th century, the Irish diaspora during Ireland's Great Famine of the
mid-1800s, and the Jewish diaspora, which began under the Roman Empire and continued through the
establishment of Israel as a Jewish homeland in 1948. Today, India is the source of the largest diaspora in
history, with some 18 million Indians living outside of their country of origin. These mass movements, which
are becoming more common as a result of globalization, affect cultures worldwide.

     American anthropologist and South Asian scholar Ritty Lukose has done fieldwork in India and in U.S.
     immigrant communities exploring diaspora and postcolonial identities. In her research with Indian diasporic
     communities in the United States (2007), she focused on ways in which education could better connect with
     immigrant families, thus strengthening both. The percentage of children in the United States population who
     are immigrant children, defined as those who have at least one foreign-born parent, increased by 51 percent
     between 1994 and 2017 (Child Trends 2018). Immigrant families constitute a significant portion of the
     population within American schools today. Based on her research, Lukose argues that there needs to be a
     realignment in American education that better acknowledges immigrant identities. As an example of the
     urgency of this need, she cites the 2005-2006 California textbook controversy, in which the Hindu American
     Foundation (HAF) sued the California State Board of Education for using sixth-grade social studies textbooks
     that contained what the HAF and many Indian parents deemed to be biased and discriminatory views of
     Hinduism. Lukose advises that instead of presenting the migrant experience as fractured between voluntary
     and involuntary immigrants or focusing on conflict between immigrants and other minorities (such as racial
     minorities), American educational pedagogy, curricula, and practices should present identity formation itself
     as one of the richest experiences of being a citizen. An educational approach that emphasizes immigrant
     identity, not as a hybrid of pieces and parts, but as a legitimate and practical way of functioning within a
     globalized world could better prepare all students in the United States for a future in which we focus on what
     links us together rather than what divides us.

     10.3 Peasantry and Urbanization

     LEARNING OUTCOMES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       · Explain how industrialization and internal migration are connected to the creation of a peasant class.
       · Articulate the characteristics of peasantry from an anthropological perspective.
       · Describe cultural changes associated with internal migration.

     Peasantry in Anthropology

     Peasants, a rural, subsistence-based agricultural class with limited landholdings, are the product of both
     urban development and rural-urban migration. Prior to the emergence of capitalism and the industrial state,
     agriculturalists were the most populous class within state societies. The development of the industrial
     economy prompted an ongoing process of internal migration, the domestic movement of people from rural to
     urban areas for economic opportunities, education, and employment. For many peasants, internal migration
     was used to meet immediate family needs, whether taking agricultural goods to urban markets--which may be
     weekly, monthly, or seasonal--or temporarily moving to work for cash at agricultural tasks for larger farms and
     companies. The coffee, sugar, and fruit industries, for example, absorbed many small, rural agriculturalists
     whose families needed money.

Cultural anthropologist Robert Redfield (1956) was one of the first anthropologists to identify peasants as a
distinct social group, referring to their local identity and culture as a "little tradition" (70), meaning a culture
that is less unified and involves a changing mixture of customs based on oral traditions. He identified the
primary characteristics of peasant cultures as attachment to the land from which they make a living,
dependence on urban areas that control the value of their small surplus, and traditionalism in regard to social
practices. Later studies built on these earlier ideas about peasantry. Eric Wolf (1966) referred to peasant
groups as "closed corporate communities" (86), meaning communities that are more detached from urban
centers and less prone to cultural changes as a result of migration. He also saw them as distinct from farmers
in that they produce a more limited surplus and are involved in more asymmetrical (i.e., exploitative) market
transactions.

Instead of being simple subsistence farmers, peasants are aware of the wider capital markets and are directly
affected by the fluctuating value of their products, even though they have no power over these forces or control
over the profit they earn. Sometimes, frustration over this sense of powerlessness leads to attempts to affect
political change. In 1994, on the same day that the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, came
into effect between the United States, Mexico, and Canada, the Zapatista rebellion broke out in Chiapas,
Mexico. This movement was led by Indigenous peasants who implicitly understood that the treaty, which made
it possible for agricultural products to move among the United States, Mexico, and Canada without tariffs,
meant that they could no longer sell their small agricultural surpluses for a living wage. Now, they would be
competing with giant corporations that were able to flood local markets with cheaper products.

As the reach of globalization continues to expand, connecting local communities ever more tightly with global
forces, some scholars now speak of a post-peasant class. This term is used to refer to rural cultivators who
migrate to urban areas but retain many of the cultural attributes of their ancestral traditions. These might
include a patriarchal family structure, a tendency to favor local traditions over global innovations, or a more
conservative political outlook (see Buzalka 2008).

Internal Migration: Rural-Urban Continuum

Indian anthropologist Tame Ramya (2017) studied the push and pull factors--a phrase used to describe
circumstances and forces that push migrants away from their homeland and pull them toward a new
location--affecting the internal migration of different hill tribes of Kurung Kumey, a district in the state of
Arunachal Pradesh, India, to the foothills region of the neighboring district of Papum Pare. Although there
were several ethnic groups involved in this study, the majority of migrants to Papum Pare are ethnically Nyishi.
The Nyishi, the largest ethnic group in their district, are rural cultivators who raise paddy rice, supplemented
with cucumbers and maize. Traditionally, they practiced polygyny and had large families with many children.
Ramya's study shows that the primary motivation for voluntary internal migration in this region is to access
new economic opportunities, prompting people to move from more peripheral geographical areas to urban
centers. Although the motivation for migration is primarily economic, these relocations result in a series of
cultural changes.

On tribal lands in the hill country of Kurung Kumey, the most common form of subsistence is jhum. This is a
form of slash-and-burn cultivation that requires families to practice a semi-sedentary settlement pattern,
moving occasionally when land resources are depleted. Ramya argues that this experience with periodic
movement makes voluntary migration somewhat less disruptive to their lives. These are people who are
accustomed to occasional relocations. Recent internal migration to the urban area of Papum Pare is motivated
by various factors. A rise in local political instability, increasing intra-ethnic conflicts, and a lack of
employment opportunities for those seeking hard cash "push" many people, particularly young people, to
migrate to the nearby urban area of Papum Pare. People are also "pulled" by a range of employment
opportunities in urban industries that are unavailable in Kurung Kumey, by relatives who have already
migrated, and by increased access to educational and health facilities in the city.
324  10 · The Global Impact of Human Migration

     been deeply affected by migration from rural areas into urban centers. (credit: "Nishi Tribal Man Arunachal Pradesh
     - India" by Diganta Talukdar/flickr, CC BY 2.0)

     As with any form of migration, culture change and adaptation have been a part of the migrant experience of
     the people of Kurung Kumey. Among the migrants, Ramya found a set of specific cultural shifts that are
     common in rural-urban migration across cultures. One is an imbalance of generations, with older family
     members remaining in the rural hills while younger family members migrate to the city. Also evident is a
     change in family structure. Migrants establish urban households consisting of just the nuclear family instead
     of the larger extended family common in rural households, as larger families are now considered too costly to
     house and feed. Also typical of urban-rural migration are myriad changes in regard to food, dress, language,
     and alcohol consumption. Traditional curry is cooked in bamboo tubes in the hills region, but migrants in the
     city no longer use bamboo and do not consume as much boiled food as their rural relatives. Instead, the urban
     diet is marked by fast food and the use of larger quantities of cooking oil. In addition, Ramya found higher
     alcohol consumption and addiction among the migrants. Migrants have also begun to abandon the traditional
     dress that marks them as a tribal and non-urban people and to use their own tribal languages less frequently,
     preferring the more commonly spoken Hindi and official language of English. All of these changes are typical
     as individuals and groups move from rural to urban areas. Internal migration is the primary cause of the
     diminishment of cultural and linguistic diversity worldwide.

Contemporary Types of Migration

Because of emerging global forces of all kinds--social, economic, environmental, and political--there has been
a recent rise in migration within geographical regions and across countries. Four of the most common types of
contemporary migration are listed below. Each derives from different causes and is associated with different
push and pull factors (Woldeab 2019). In some situations, these types of migration may overlap, such as in the
aftermath of a natural disaster.

  · Labor migration is the movement of people for the purpose of employment and/or economic stability. It
      may be an internal migration from one town to another within the same country of origin, or it may
      involve travel across countries in search of opportunities. In 2017, the United Nations International
      Labour Organization estimated that there were 164 million labor migrants worldwide (Global Migration
      Data Analysis Centre 2021).

  · Forced migration or displacement, also called involuntary migration, is migration due to persecution,
      conflict, or violence and involves refugees and those seeking asylum. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR)
      estimated that as of the end of 2019, there were some 79.5 million forced migrants or displaced persons
      worldwide. More than two-thirds (68 percent) of those displaced persons came from just five countries:
      Syria, Venezuela, Afghanistan, South Sudan, and Myanmar (UNHCR 2020). One out of every 108 people
      was displaced in 2018 (UNHCR 2019).

  · Forced labor, human trafficking, and modern slavery are a set of linked terms defined as the
      recruitment, transportation, transfer, and/or harboring of persons by means of threat or use of force or
      coercion for the purpose of exploitation (UN 2020). This includes sexual slavery and forced labor. As of
      2016, some 25 million people were involved in forced labor and some 40.3 million in modern slavery
      worldwide, while an estimated 15.4 million were in forced marriages (https://www.ilo.org/global/topics/
      forced-labour/lang--en/index.htm). While a large proportion of the victims are women, human trafficking
      involves men and children as well. The Counter Trafficking Data Collaborative
      (https://www.ctdatacollaborative.org/) estimates that nearly 80 percent of international human trafficking
      journeys pass through airports and other official border control points.

  · Environmental migration is displacement caused by natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes,
      or droughts. It can be permanent or temporary and is a rapidly growing area of migration due to global
      climate change. In 2018, 17.2 million people were displaced due to environmental conditions; by 2019, the
      number had risen to 24.9 million (https://www.internal-displacement.org/global-report/grid2019/).

Anthropologists who study migration are often involved in multi-sited ethnographic research, exploring not
only migrant populations but their communities of origin as well. Understanding the social and cultural
attributes of communities of origin helps researchers gauge the level and types of adaptation caused by
migration. Also, communities of origin typically remain part of migrants' wider social networks and are vital to
their well-being and success. It is not uncommon for relatives and other members of the migrants' home
communities to follow them to their new settlements and reestablish a sense of community and a set of self-
help networks there. This process of serial migration from the same community of origin is known as chain
migration.

Labor Migration and Migrant Routes

While migration, in its widest sense, is any movement that reestablishes a household, many migratory
patterns are specifically associated with socioeconomic need, mainly shifting employment opportunities.
Labor migration can be permanent or circular. Circular migration is a repeated pattern of movement between
locations, usually mapped to the availability of work. One type of circular migration is seasonal migration,
which is migratory movement that coincides with seasonal labor needs, such as planting, harvesting, service,
and construction work. Some seasonal workers migrate, with or without their families, for temporary, often
low-paid work. Other seasonal workers have long-term relationships with their employers and legal work
permits (also called Employment Authorization Documents, or EADs, in the United States) and will return to
the same work sites year after year, sometimes maintaining a joint household with other families at the work
site. These individuals will often maintain a family household in their country of origin and send home
remittances, or transfers of money from workers to their home countries, usually for their families. Today, one
in nine people worldwide depends on remittances from migrants (Global Migration Data Analysis Centre
326  10 · The Global Impact of Human Migration

     2021).

     Many people migrate in search of work and a better life without legal permits or assurance of employment. The
     migration journey made in search of opportunities can be filled with dangers, hardships, and even death.
     Some regions of the world have well-established migrant trails, which are the routes of most worldwide
     migration. The most congested migration routes are:

       · the eastern Mediterranean route, with a flow of migrants from the Middle East and North Africa to Europe,
           crossing through Turkey;

       · the Mediterranean Sea route, with migration from the Middle East and North Africa to Europe, across the
           Mediterranean Sea;

       · the Southeast Asian route, with migrants primarily moving southward from the Asian mainland into
           Indonesia and Malaysia; and

       · the Central American route, which brings migrants from South and Central America into North America.

     These migrant trails have a huge impact on the social, political, and economic life of all of the countries that
     are a part of the route, bringing both benefits and challenges. Those in the United States are most familiar with
     the Central American route, which begins as far south as South America and extends as far north as Canada.
     The most contested part of the "trail," however, is the portion along the Rio Grande, the river that separates
     Mexico and the United States.

     In his remarkable four-field study of undocumented migrants entering the United States across the border
     with Mexico, The Land of Open Graves (2015), Chicano anthropologist Jason De León reveals a less visible side
     of undocumented migration. He describes a type of cat-and-mouse game between migrants and those
     attempting to stop them, resulting in widespread suffering and high human and financial costs. De León
     conducted a multi-sited ethnography, doing research in various locations in both Mexico and the United States
     and consulting various groups along the migration route, including illegal migrants and border patrol agents
     as well as smuggling groups and drug traffickers.

Personal History: Jason De León is a U.S. anthropologist and Mexican-Filipino American who grew up in
several cities in the United States, including McAllen, Texas, near the U.S.-Mexico border; and Long Beach,
California, where he graduated from Wilson High School. He earned his bachelor's degree in anthropology
from the University of California, Los Angeles and his master's and doctoral degrees from Pennsylvania State
University. His doctoral work focused on ancient tool production and trade in the Valley of Mexico.

Area of Anthropology: Although De León's training includes a specialization in archaeology, his holistic
research approach is four-field, combining archaeology with ethnographic research, physical anthropology
analyses, and linguistic anthropology. His work is multi-disciplinary in nature and multi-sited, involving not
just Mexico and the United States but also numerous other countries of migrant origin. His interests include
undocumented migration, photo-ethnography, and human smuggling. He seeks out the stories not only of
people, such as migrants and their families, smugglers, and border guards, but also of their material
artifacts--the items they bring, wear, and use to survive their dangerous journeys.

Accomplishments in the Field: De León is the executive director of the Undocumented Migration Project
(UMP), a nonprofit organization founded in 2009 that focuses on the long-term anthropological study of
clandestine movements between Latin America and the United States. UMP sponsors an educational exhibit
called Hostile Terrain 94 (HT94), a pop-up participatory art project that displays the handwritten toe tags of
some 3,200 migrants who have died while trying to cross the Sonoran Desert in the southwestern United States
since the mid-1990s, showing the locations where each of the individuals died along their journey. It is a
poignant reminder of the many dangers of migration, both human and environmental.

De León received the prestigious five-year MacArthur Foundation Fellowship (2017-2022) for his work on
undocumented migrants. This award, given for talent, creativity, contribution to one's field, and potential,
328  10 · The Global Impact of Human Migration

     allows scholars to focus on future research in an area of great importance. In addition, De León's 2015 book,
     The Land of the Open Graves: Living and Dying on the Migrant Trail, has received various awards and
     commendations.

     Importance of Their Work: Anthropologists often work in specific places and more geographically bounded
     settings. The research of Jason De León expands our understanding of the lives of those who migrate and the
     various ways that movement ties together people, places, and cultures.

     In his article "On Not Looking Away," digital and multimedia advisor Arran Skinner (2019) reports on the
     tragic deaths of Mexican migrants Óscar Martínez Ramírez and Angie Valeria, his 23-month-old daughter, both
     of whom drowned and washed up on the shores of the Rio Grande. "We are choosing to ignore this evidence [of
     atrocity], to actively look away," Skinner writes. But De León is not looking away. Through his research, he is
     bringing to light the stories of those who migrate in search of hope and better lives. As global movements
     become more common because of political, economic, and environmental challenges, studies such as De
     León's illustrate the growing importance of migration for our species.

     Since 1994, the US Border Patrol has had a policy of "prevention through deterrence" that attempts to prevent
     undocumented migrants from reaching the U.S. border. Legal international entryways in cities such as Tucson,
     Arizona, and El Paso, Texas, were heavily fortified with fencing and additional patrol agents to make
     undocumented crossing exceptionally difficult. As a result, migrant entry points shifted away from urban
     areas and into more hostile terrain, such as the Sonoran Desert region of Arizona. While this has not
     significantly lowered the frequency of these crossings, it has made the journey much more dangerous and far
     less visible to residential populations and humanitarian groups. In addition to the threat of harsh and rugged
     landscapes, there are the dangers of extreme weather, dehydration, bandits, and even wild animals. De León
     concludes, "The Border Patrol has intentionally set the stage so that other actants [agents of deterrence] can do
     most of the brutal work" (61).

     During his study, De León and his team located the body of Maricela Zhagüi Puyas, a woman originally from
     Cuenca, Ecuador. She had left her family, including her children, in Ecuador in order to seek employment in
     the United States, hoping to send money home to them. She was in debt for more than $10,000, most of it to
     the trail guide (called a coyote) who was supposed to guide her on her journey. Such trail guides often extort
     large sums of money from vulnerable migrants and then leave them to make their way alone. Maricela had
     made a journey of more than 5,000 miles from Cuenca, Ecuador, all the way to the Sonoran Desert in Arizona,
     when she died of exhaustion and exposure, technically having reached the United States. In the 14-year period
     between 2000 and 2014, 2,721 migrants were found dead in Arizona's Sonoran Desert, approximately 800 of
     whom remain unidentified today. In 2020, there were an estimated 227 migrant deaths in the Sonoran

graveyard, making it the deadliest year on record for that corridor trail (Snow 2021). De León's work continues
today through a series of pop-up exhibitions and workshops entitled Hostile Terrain 94.

This humanitarian crisis is far from being resolved. In 2020, 400,651 undocumented migrants were
apprehended and expelled by the U.S. Border Patrol (U.S. Customs and Border Protection 2020). Immigrants,
both documented and undocumented, make up a majority of the farmworkers and meatpacking workforce in
the United States today. Once employed, these immigrants, who are frequently separated from their families,
face hazardous working conditions, language barriers, long hours, low pay, and substandard housing. Because
of their legal status, many also struggle with inadequate access to health care and rising discrimination.

Biocultural anthropologist Shedra Snipes and her team (Snipes et al. 2007) conducted focus group interviews
among 69 male and female Mexican immigrant farmworkers in the Yakima Valley of Washington State. They
were particularly interested in the ways the farmworkers defined and experienced stress. Their interviewees
distinguished between physical and mental stressors and cited the most common causes of stress as work,
personal illness, lack of work, family illness, and family stress. Snipes et al. noted that many stressors were
linked by a common theme of inconsistent work and the injusticia (injustice and unfairness) of low pay and
poor working conditions. One farmworker noted, "Sometimes there are many people wanting to work in the
field. You complain about something like not having water, or the bathrooms being dirty, [and] they tell you
right away, `If you don't like it go find a job somewhere else'" (366). Another common theme was the stress of
living in a different culture. Several farmworkers commented that cultural differences, such as language
barriers, communication from schools regarding their children, or complaints from neighbors when they had
rowdy family get-togethers, contributed to their experience of stress. As this example shows, at the
intersection of culture and migration, many factors affect an individual's ability to adapt to new living
conditions.

Refugees Beyond the Nation-State

Refugees are persons who are forced to cross international boundaries to seek residence. Pushed out of their
countries, most commonly because of war, famine, or persecution, they typically arrive under extreme
circumstances with little food, clothing, or material possessions. They are frequently separated from their
relatives and have little chance of finding employment or reestablishing their household. Because of their
status as stateless persons (persons forced to leave their countries) and their inability to procure proper travel
documentation, refugees are protected under the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention, which derives
from Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, passed in1948. The Universal Declaration of
Human Rights establishes an international legal right for people to seek asylum, which is legal protection
extended by one country to citizens of another. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees heads the
UN Refugee Agency, a global organization that directs troops and aid workers to set up refugee camps and
organizes international efforts to ease the suffering of refugees.

     In her ethnographic study of Congolese refugees in the Ugandan capital city of Kampala, cultural
     anthropologist Georgina Ramsay (2016) focuses on the ways in which refugees protect themselves, both
     physically and psychologically, by what they call "avoiding poison." In 2012, there were approximately 50,000
     refugees living in Kampala as a result of ongoing political instability, warfare, and corruption in the
     Democratic Republic of the Congo. Housed initially in a refugee settlement away from urban areas, the group
     of refugees interviewed by Ramsay opted to move to Kampala for greater opportunities and more security, as
     the refugee settlements were troubled by crime and violence. As one informant told Ramsay, "There are bad
     people everywhere in the camp" (115). The government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo allowed
     resettlement in Kampala if the refugees procured a legal permit and a way to make a living independent of
     government funding or humanitarian aid. Given their displacement from their own ethnic communities and
     social networks, refugees faced unreliable social communities, in which their relationships were recently
     formed, as well as fear and the looming threat of having to return to the settlements if they lost their jobs or
     housing arrangements. Many either relied on or supplemented their wages with remittances from relatives
     living elsewhere in an effort to create greater security in the urban environment.

     The "poison" feared by this group of refugees is a symbolic agent administered by "unknown assailants" (113),
     most often sprinkled into the food they prepare, and capable of making them sick both physically and
     psychologically. The administering of this poison is not always intended as a personal attack; rather, the
     refugees believe that their day-to-day life outside of their cultural homelands makes them vulnerable. They
     believe that they are most vulnerable during cooking and eating. In their home communities, cooking and
     eating were normally times of social interaction and sharing, but cooking and eating are now highly privatized
     acts for them. Families eat only with each other, within their own homes, and do not accept any shared food,
     even when they are hungry. The result is an intentional physical distancing from each other and a
     strengthening of family-only social bonds. While this approach clearly weakens the refugees' ability to build a
     large and sustainable self-help community in Kampala, it does afford them a sense of positive control (agency)
     over their day-to-day lives. This sense of social agency over the threat of "poison," giving the refugees an ability
     to control some aspects of their day-to-day lives, is an example of the adaptive nature of culture under very
     challenging circumstances.

     Pandemic as a Global Migration

     People and goods are not the only things that migrate. Along with human migration, there is a host of
     secondary movements that can affect the human population globally. Diseases are a prime example. Diseases
     that may have once been contained in a single region can move, along with their human and animal hosts, into
     new geographic areas, where they can become even more virulent. When diseases spread more than expected
     among a given group of people, they are referred to as epidemics. An outbreak of a disease over a very broad
     area, typically crossing international boundaries, is called a pandemic. Some early pandemics in Europe were
     the plague of Athens in 430 BCE (possibly typhus or typhoid fever or Ebola), the Antonine plague from 165 to
     180 CE (possibly smallpox), and the Black Death from 1347 to 1351 (caused by a bacterium carried by fleas
     and infected rodents). In the Americas, Mexico and Central America suffered from various documented

pandemics, starting with the arrival of the Spanish in Mexico in 1519, which set off a widespread smallpox
outbreak that extended into South America. There have been other pandemics, including the cocoliztli
epidemic from 1545 to 1548, likely a form of enteric fever, and the so-called Spanish flu, first detected in the
United States in 1918 (Alchon 2003; Vågene et al. 2018). The most serious recent pandemic in the United
Stated had been the swine flu pandemic of 2009-2010 ... until 2019-2020.

In the last few months of 2019, the viral coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, known as COVID-19, began a global
migration from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, to every continent of the world. Carried between
geographically distant locations by human hosts traveling for all sorts of reasons--including work, study,
tourism, visitation, and displacement--as well as within towns and communities by people shopping,
attending religious services and schools, or even visiting friends and families, COVID-19 quickly became a
global emergency. First reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) on December 31, 2019, COVID-19
was officially declared a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. Throughout 2020, the disease continued to
spread rapidly, overwhelming medical facilities, ravaging countries' economies, and forcing people to alter the
structures of most social institutions, including schools, churches, weddings, and even funerals. By October
2021, some 248 million people had been infected, including several world leaders, and more than 5 million
people had died from the disease.

The COVID-19 virus spreads through airborne transmission when someone inhales droplets expelled by an
infected person coughing, sneezing, or even exhaling. As with measles and tuberculosis, the only fully effective
form of containment outside of a vaccine and the development of antibodies is quarantine. When the WHO
declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, the most important advice was to limit all unnecessary movements and
gatherings, wear masks, and practice physical distancing. But given the global nature of our lives today, it was
very difficult to halt either the movement of people or the spread of the disease. On January 20, 2020, the first
reported case in the United States was diagnosed in Washington State, in a man in his thirties who had just
returned from Wuhan. By that point, the virus had already spread to Taiwan, Japan, Thailand, and South
Korea. On January 24, the first European cases were reported in France. The disease continued to quickly
spread all over the world, including on international transport, such as cruise and cargo ships. In December
2020, there were several cases reported in Antarctica. Only 14 countries reported no COVID-19 cases as of
April 2021, all except two of them island nations or territories in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans with strict
travel policies: Tuvalu, Tonga, Tokelau, St. Helena, the Pitcairn Islands, Palau, Niue, Nauru, Kiribati, the
Federated States of Micronesia, the Cook Islands, and American Samoa. (The two non-island nations, North
Korea and Turkmenistan, are believed to have unreliable data.) As a result of migration, the disease
transformed peoples' lives everywhere.

But migration can also bring relief from pandemics. The same conveyances that led to the initial spread of the
disease have also brought relief workers, food, medical supplies, and life-saving vaccines to communities
worldwide. In addition, scientists and researchers worked tirelessly in multinational efforts to sequence the
332  10 · The Global Impact of Human Migration

     COVID-19 genome so that vaccine development could proceed rapidly. Globally, several countries developed
     lifesaving vaccines and began working together to disperse them to communities in need. As our world
     becomes increasingly interdependent, it is critical that we understand the important role of migration in so
     many aspects of our survival.

             ETHNOGRAPHIC SKETCHES

     Migration in El Angosto

     Experience of Marjorie Snipes, chapter author

     We often think of rural communities as being separate from global forces, but this is not always true. In El
     Angosto, a small Indigenous community in the northwestern Andes of Argentina, diverse forms of migration,
     dependent on internal and external factors, are part of people's day-to-day lives.

     I conducted fieldwork in El Angosto, Argentina, during the 1990s and early 2000s (Snipes 1996). This small
     highland community is located at about 11,000 feet above sea level and nestled in a rugged river valley along
     the Río Grande de San Juan, the international boundary between Argentina and Bolivia. At that time, the
     community had a population of about 200 people, most practicing agropastoralism, with each family raising
     corn, wheat, alfalfa, and broad beans and tending herds of goats and sheep. In order to provide ample
     pastureland and keep animals away from their gardens, they were transhumant, moving their herds to higher
     altitudes during the spring and summer seasons, away from the primary households with their gardens and
     accompanied by seasonal shepherds. After the herds moved from their winter corrals, families cleaned them
     out and used the manure to fertilize the gardens. Through transhumance, families benefit from this dual
     subsistence system, producing most of their daily food needs.

     Although not dependent on money for their daily food, Angosteños participate in the global economy in
     various ways. Historically, the community is part of a vast Andean trade network that connects small highland
     communities of northern Argentina and southern Bolivia through itinerant trade. Extensive long-distance
     trade networks have been an integral part of Andean life for centuries (see Alberti and Mayer 1974; Murra
     1975). Annually, traders come through El Angosto from the altiplano of Bolivia, a high plains region at an
     average altitude of 12,000 feet above sea level. Because of the harsh climate at that altitude, the Bolivian
     communities rely almost exclusively on herding camelids (llamas and alpacas), having little to no ability to
     raise needed crops. In the springtime each year, Bolivian traders pass through El Angosto with pack animals
     (usually llamas) loaded with wool ropes, bags, and dried camelid meat that they produce during the winter
     months, seeking fresh vegetables for trade.

     Although traders negotiate each transaction based on their particular family's needs, all parties are well aware
     of the current market value of their animal and vegetable products, as families listen daily to radio broadcasts
     on trade. I tried my hand at negotiating with Gumercindo, a young trader from San Antonio de Lipes, Bolivia,
     for a small, handwoven rope. When I asked him the cost of the rope, he looked at me with kind amusement and
     asked me what I offered to exchange. "Pesos!" I said (Bolivian money). He told me the rope was worth 10 pesos
     (approximately $10 at that time) but that he needed corn and wheat and that one arroba (approximately 25
     pounds) of grain was worth around $12. In other words, I would have to pay the higher cost because he would
     need to take the money and try to buy an arroba of grain. Most highlanders are more aware of current trade
     values than even those living in cities.

     Other forms of migration affect life in El Angosto. In order to earn cash for manufactured items, many highland
     families periodically send a family member to work away from the community. The zafra, the annual lowland
     sugarcane harvest, can usually temporarily absorb anyone willing to work, and young people occasionally seek
     out urban employment opportunities, such as domestic service in private households. Migration is an
     enduring part of the fabric of Andean life, binding communities to each other and, ultimately, to each of us.

        MINI-FIELDWORK ACTIVITY

Migration Interviews

For this fieldwork activity, you will compile three ethnographic accounts of migration. Choose three diverse
research participants/key informants to interview about their personal histories of moving, as a child and/or
an adult, from one home location to another. Some may have moved from one country to another, from one city
to another, or even from one house or family to another. Log each of their movements separately, giving the
years and duration of the period spent living there, why they moved, how things shifted in their lives as a result
of the migration, and their feelings and/or emotions about moving. You may choose to add your own account to
this study as well. Once you compile each of the accounts, summarize your findings and compare the accounts
to each other, making conclusions about the impact of migration on your participants' lives.

INTRODUCTION Whom do you consider part of your family? How many mothers do you have? Could you or
would you marry your cousin? Each of these questions asks us to consider how our societies structure kinship.
Families reflect the social and cultural contexts in which they are formed. Through the study of kinship within
our own and other societies, we better understand such things as the connections that individuals have across
generations; how a cultural group manages procreation and childcare; the ways that material assets, power,
and influence are inherited; and the choices an individual has for marriage.

     11.1 What Is Kinship?

     LEARNING OUTCOMES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       · Identify kinship and explain how it is a sociocultural construction.
       · Identify the importance of kinship in anthropology.
       · Restate the important early works in the anthropological study of kinship.
       · Distinguish between terms of reference and terms of address.

     Social scientists commonly refer to social norms and behaviors--for example, as explored in Chapter 1, the
     ways that individuals are assigned to racial categories and what these categories mean about an individual's
     place within that society--as sociocultural constructions. Such norms and behaviors create categories and
     rules according to social criteria (not biological truths) and thus vary across cultures. Kinship is also a
     sociocultural construction, one that creates a network of social and biological relationships between
     individuals. Through kinship systems, humans create meaning by interpreting social and biological
     relationships. Although kinship, like gender and age, is a universal concept in human societies (meaning that
     all societies have some means of defining kinship), the specific "rules" about who is related, and how closely,
     vary widely. Depending on the way kinship is determined, two individuals who would call each other cousins in
     one cultural group may not even consider themselves to be related in another group.

     The common assumptions that kinship is static and created by biological relationships reveal the strength of
     sociocultural constructs in our lives. It is culture--not biology--that defines for us whom our closest relatives
     are. Biology relies on genetics, but kinship is determined by culture. One interesting and very familiar example
     of the sociocultural dimension of kinship is the practice of adoption, through which those who have no
     necessary genetic relationship to one another are considered both legally and culturally to be family. Biological
     relatedness is determined at the genetic level. This form of knowledge is detected through specialized DNA
     testing and typically has little meaning in our day-to-day lives except within legal and economic contexts
     where paternity or maternity may be in question. Otherwise, across history and cultures, including within our
     own society today, family are those we live with, rely on, and love. These individuals, whether or not they have
     a specific genetic relationship to us, are those we refer to using family terms of reference--my mother, my son,
     my aunt.

     The study of kinship is central to anthropology. It provides deep insights into human relationships and
     alliances, including those who can and cannot marry, mechanisms that are used to create families, and even
     the ways social and economic resources are dispersed within a group. One of the earliest studies of kinship
     was completed by Lewis Henry Morgan (1818-1881), an amateur American anthropologist, in the mid-
     nineteenth century. Intrigued by the cultural diversity of the Haudenosaunee living in upstate New York,
     Morgan began to document differences in kinship terminology between cultural groups, based on historical
     accounts and surveys from missionaries working in other geographic locations. In Systems of Consanguinity
     and Affinity of the Human Family (1871), he defined three of the primary kinship systems that we still
     recognize today, identifying each with either descriptive kinship terms, such as "mother's sister's son," or
     classificatory terms, which group diverse relationships under a single term, such as "cousin." Although
     Morgan used different names, today we know these three systems as lineal kinship, bifurcate merging kinship,
     and generational kinship. The publication of his book marked the beginning of kinship studies in
     anthropology.

After Morgan's research, anthropologists began a more methodical examination of kinship. W.H.R. Rivers
(1864-1922) introduced the genealogical method in fieldwork in a 1910 article, "The Genealogical Method in
Anthropological Query." Using a series of basic questions about parents, grandparents, and siblings, Rivers
approached the study of kinship as a systematic inquiry into the social structure of societies, seeking to
understand how different cultures define family and family roles. Although he focused on small-scale
societies, he argued that investigating kinship was a good way of establishing rapport with people and opening
them up to sharing more detailed information about their lives regardless of the size of the society. Today,
ethnographers continue to use a form of the genealogical method, through either face-to-face interviews or
surveys, especially when doing fieldwork in small-scale societies. In this way, the ethnographer seeks to
understand the sociocultural relationships in society and the ways that family affects those relationships.

In the 1920s, British anthropologists Bronislaw Malinowski (1884-1942) and A.R. Radcliffe-Brown
(1881-1955) expanded the understanding of kinship as a social institution by studying the ways that kinship
intersected with other institutions in society, such as inheritance, education, politics, and subsistence.
Malinowski did fieldwork in the Trobriand Islands of Papua New Guinea, a matrilineal society where descent
and inheritance were traced solely through mothers and grandmothers. In his work Argonauts of the Western
Pacific (1922), he examined the functional role of kinship in Trobriand society, exploring how it works with
other social institutions to address basic needs. Expanding kinship exploration beyond its early beginnings as
a study of linguistic terminology only, Malinowski (1930, 19-20) says, "Kinship terminologies . . . are the most
active and the most effective expressions of human relationship, expressions which start in early childhood,
which accompany human intercourse throughout life, which embody all the most personal, passionate, and
intimate sentiments of a man or woman." He saw kinship as a driving force connecting individuals to each
other by means of enduring bonds. A. R. Radcliffe-Brown also focused on kinship as a social institution in his
study The Andaman Islanders (1922), but instead of looking at the function of kinship, Radcliffe-Brown
examined the roles and statuses created for an individual by the practice of kinship.

Through these early studies in kinship, anthropologists began to better understand the diverse ways that
342  11 · Forming Family through Kinship

     cultural groups think about things like family and community. Kinship relationships determine both rights
     and obligations to other people. These connections contribute to the way a society functions and resolve
     problems associated with everyday life. In small-scale societies with low population density, kinship identity
     plays a significant role in most of the life choices an individual will have, while in larger-scale societies, kinship
     plays a smaller and more limited role. In all societies, however, kinship provides guidelines on how to interact
     with certain other individuals and the expectations that are associated with these relationships.

     Cultures call attention to kinship relationships through the way people speak to and refer to one another.
     Anthropologists sort this kinship terminology into two categories: terms of reference and terms of address.
     Terms of reference are the words that are used to describe the relationship between individuals, such as
     "mother," "grandfather," or "father's brother." Terms of address are the terms people use to speak directly to
     their kin, such as "Mom," "Uncle," and "Grandpa." Sometimes the same word is used as reference and address:
     "This is my father" and "Hello, Father." These terms are important because they designate relationships
     between individuals that carry responsibilities and privileges that structure human societies.

     11.2 Defining Family and Household

     LEARNING OUTCOMES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       · Define and contrast family and household.
       · Describe how families differ across cultures.
       · Differentiate between consanguineal and affinal ties.
       · Distinguish between different family types.
       · Understand the roles of fictive kin.

     A family can be defined as two or more people in an adaptable social and economic alliance that involves
     kinship, whether perceived through blood, marriage, or other permanent or semipermanent arrangement. It
     frequently, but not always, involves reproduction and the care of offspring and coresidence within the same
     locale. Families vary greatly across cultures and also adapt to changing social and economic needs. Sometimes
     families aggregate into larger units for short periods to meet challenging needs, such as eldercare, illness, job
     loss, transition between college and career, etc. A household is a group of individuals who live within the same
     residence and share socioeconomic needs associated with production and consumption. A family and a
     household may be the same unit, but they do not have to be. Sometimes families live within larger households,
     where there may be two or more families residing; at other times a family may be physically separated as
     family members migrate to work or study temporarily in other locations.

     Like the concept of kinship, family is a sociocultural construct. Family is defined and recognized differently
     across cultures according to differing social norms. Some cultures consider families to be only those people
     believed to be related to each other, living together, and sharing similar goals, while other cultures define
     family as a disperse set of individuals with an ancestral history. The definition of family that a cultural group
     endorses reflects such things as kinship and the social interpretation of biology, cultural traditions and norms,
     and socioemotional ties. It is commonly scaled from the intimate unit in which children are raised to a larger,
     more amorphous web of relatives.

     Many Western societies perceive family to be a nuclear family of parents and their immediate offspring living
     together in a household. The extended family, on the other hand, is a loose collection of relatives with varying
     degrees of perceived kinship, from those referred to as blood relatives (consanguine) to those who have
     married into the family (affine). Among the Mundurucú in the lowland Amazonia of Brazil, the resident family
     includes only the mother and her preadolescent offspring, while the father resides in the tribal men's house.
     Among the Mosuo of China (also called the Na), women form sexual alliances with men from outside of their
     families to produce offspring, and then remain with their brothers in their own households to raise their
     children. The children are considered to be part of the women's lineage unit and family.

Reading and Using Kinship Charts

Anthropologists graphically illustrate relationships between family members with kinship charts (also called
kinship diagrams). Anyone who has ever used an online genealogy program like Ancestry.com is already
familiar with the ways that family relationships can be depicted. Anthropological charts use EGO as their
starting point. The term EGO identifies the person whose chart is depicted. EGO marks the starting point for
the kinship chart, and relationships are read as alignments between EGO and other individuals. The sum of
kinship relationships identified through EGO is referred to as EGO's kindred. Serving as a map and model, the
kinship chart can be "read" like a text, with its own syntax and grammar identifying each individual within a
society by means of their relatedness to each other.

Kinship charts depict two types of relationships, consanguineal and affinal. A consanguineal tie between
individuals indicates a perceived biological connection (a connection "by blood") and is indicated by a single
line, regardless of whether it is drawn vertically or horizontally. A consanguineal tie is most often considered to
be permanent. An affinal tie depicts a contractual relationship by marriage or mutual agreement and is drawn
as a double line. Such ties usually can be broken, and if they are, a forward slash will be struck though the
double line. There is also a hashed line (----) used for relationships that do not conform completely to type (e.g.,
to indicate adoption or an honorary family member). Hashed double lines are used to distinguish between a
formal marriage and a relationship of cohabitation. The following is the most basic legend of the kinship chart:

relationships of marriage and descent, and individual terms of reference. (attribution: Copyright Rice University,

     Kinship charts can be read both vertically and horizontally. Individuals who share the same horizontal line are
     considered to be in the same cohort or generation, and individuals above and below EGO are in relationships
     of descent, meaning they are believed to be connected by blood or enduring kinship bond across generations.
     Anthropologists use common abbreviations to depict kinship relations across cultures, allowing us to compare
     families: father (FA), mother (MO), brother (BR), sister (SI or Z), aunt (AU), uncle (UN), son (SO), daughter (DA),
     and then compound terms, such as mother's or father's brother (MoBr, FaBr) or mother's or father's sister
     (MoSi, FaSi). Grandparents are usually designated as GrFa and GrMo.

     Figure 11.5 depicts a kinship chart utilizing standard icons and abbreviations. Within this chart, EGO is
     depicted as a part of two different families: the family of orientation, which is the nuclear family unit in which
     EGO was reared and nurtured as a child and adolescent, and the family of procreation, which is the family
     that EGO creates, usually as a result of marriage. Test yourself and see if you can read it.

     FIGURE 11.5 This generic kinship chart shows three generations, with a family of orientation. (credit: "Eskimo
     Kinship Chart" by Fred the Oyster/Wikimedia Commons, CC0)

     As you can see in Figure 11.5, EGO has multiple ties and embeddedness within the kinship network, leading to
     a complex web of rights and obligations. These concurrent ties with more than one family involve descent
     rules (how an individual traces relatedness across generations), residence rules (where an individual will live
     following marriage), and in some societies, even remarriage rules (how marriage will be reinstated following
     the death of a spouse). Each of these will be discussed later in the chapter.

     Family Types across Cultures

     Although family is difficult to categorize because of its diversity, anthropologists have defined four basic family
     types that are duplicated across cultures with minor variations. Each of these types is adapted to the social and
     economic needs of the family unit and is normally associated with particular subsistence strategies. Some
     families change to address immediate needs, such as when elderly parents can no longer live on their own
     independently. Regardless of its type, the family unit is a remarkably adaptive cultural mechanism.

     Nuclear families: Also known as a single-couple family, a nuclear family is composed of one or two parents
     and their immediate offspring. It is the smallest family structure and is often found in societies where
     geographic mobility is valued. The nuclear family is common in small-scale foraging societies (bands) and
     industrial/postindustrial and market societies (states), both settings in which subsistence activities require
     families to relocate with some regularity. Although the model of the American nuclear family consisting of a
     two-parent household with one or more children has become less typical over the last several generations, it

11.2 · Defining Family and Household                                                                              345

continues to be a norm. As of the 2016 census, 69 percent of US children under the age of 18 were living in a
two-parent household, a decrease from 88 percent in 1960.

There are, however, other kinds of nuclear families. In the 2016 US census, 23 percent of children under 18
were living in a female single-headed household (mother), almost triple the number living in female single
households in 1960 (8 percent). There was also an increase in children under 18 living in male single
households (father), from 1 percent in 1960 to 4 percent in 2016 (United States Census Bureau 2016; Kramer
2019). Another growing nuclear family type is same-sex families. These may or may not include children. In
the 2020 census, 14.7 percent of the 1.1 million same-sex couples in the United States had at least one child
under 18 in their household (United States Census Bureau 2020 (https://openstax.org/r/censusgovprograms)).
In cases where the alliance between adults is temporary or informal, these families may be nonconjugal
nuclear families or cohabitation families. (Note: The above terminology related to sex, gender, and family
relationships is consistent with US Census data collection and reporting terminology, and may not reflect the
terminology used by readers.)

Extended families: The extended family can be very complex. It includes two or more family units functioning
as a single integrated family. It may involve three or more generations (e.g., grandparents, parents, and
children), polygamous families with multiple spouses and their offspring, or married siblings living together
with their children, a type of extended family known as joint families. The extended family can be an effective
social and economic unit because it involves multiple adults able to contribute to the household. Extended
families have been most commonly associated with agricultural societies, where a high value is typically
placed on labor and self-subsistence. In the United States today, we commonly see the emergence of the
extended family during times of transition, such as when family members are changing jobs, returning to
school, or recovering from economic hardship. Worldwide, the extended family is the most common type of
family.

FIGURE 11.6 An extended family in Pretoria, South Africa, including several generations. A family functions as a
combined socioeconomic unit, where family members cooperate and support each other within the same
household. (credit: Henry M. Trotter/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)

Blended families: Blended families are families in which there is more than one origin point for the members.
This typically occurs when one or more divorced and/or widowed adults with children remarry, combining two
formerly independent units into a new blended family. Blended families are common in the United States and
in societies in which we find serial monogamy. Although the US census does not collect data specifically on
stepfamilies, in 2009 Pew Research estimated that 16 percent of all American children lived in blended
families.

Fictive Kinship

Some families also include fictive kin, a kinship tie in which individuals are defined as family regardless of
biology. Fictive kinship is based on intentional relationships such as godparenthood or other close social ties.
346  11 · Forming Family through Kinship

     One form of voluntary fictional kinship is a type of godparent relationship called compadrazgo. Originally
     developed as a social institution within the Catholic Church, the godparents of a Catholic child are named
     during the ritual of baptism when the child is an infant. These godparents are selected by the child's parents as
     role models to encourage their child in religious instruction and living a "godly" life. Godparents are most
     frequently chosen from among the child's relatives, thus reinforcing kinship ties. Although godparenthood is
     not formally practiced in every society, families in all societies do cultivate non-blood relationships and close
     friendships.

     The Spanish and Portuguese empires introduced godparenthood into Latin America following the 16th-
     century conquest. The institution was adapted to meet the particular needs of populations suffering from
     disease, warfare, and mass casualties. These social disruptions often left children without parents who were
     able to adequately take care of them. In such a setting, children's godparents shifted from being chosen from
     among relatives to being selected from friends and acquaintances. This use of fictive kin relationships served
     as an extension of family for a child and created new kinship ties between families not previously related. It
     created a contract (Foster 1961) between the godparents (who referred to the child as ahijado/a), the child (who
     referred to their godparents as padrino and madrina), and the parents (who, along with the godparents,
     referred to each other as compadre and comadre), which provided an ever-widening social network.

     FIGURE 11.7 Godparenthood (called compadrazgo in Spanish-speaking societies) is a formal designation and
     acknowledgement of fictive kin. It is commonly associated with Catholic Church rituals such as baptism. Here, an
     infant is photographed with baptismal godparents. (credit: "Godparents and Chris" by Brian Smith/flickr, CC BY 2.0)

     Over time, the practice of compadrazgo adapted to the specific needs of this new cultural setting. A
     symmetrical form developed in which parents choose friends and coworkers of their same socioeconomic
     status to serve as godparents for their children. An asymmetrical form also developed, in which parents
     contract with individuals or couples who are in a higher class or status group to provide opportunities for their
     child. This form functions very similarly to a social security system. Many members of the upper classes see it
     as their Christian duty to sponsor a large number of godchildren within their communities or workplaces.

     In addition, compadrazgo extends beyond religious rituals into secular society, including the practice of
     naming compadres for such things as a child's first haircut or the purchase of a new house. In smaller
     communities, compadrazgo is even practiced as the ritual sponsorship of community buildings or initiatives.
     In 1980 in Ica, Peru, the installation of a new water tower included the designation of compadres.

     Those serving as compadres enjoy an enhancement of social status in Latin America. Over a lifetime,
     individuals typically have a series of new and expanding compadrazgo relationships. People gain new
     compadres through life changes such as marriage, the birth of children, and sometimes even the acquisition of
     expensive material items. While these relationships may change over time--for example, when a child has
     become an adult, the birth compadres may no longer send gifts or offer advice--the relationships themselves
     endure as (fictive) family connections. The respect and acknowledgement of these relationships remains

important to all the individuals involved in the compadrazgo family.

Adoption

Adoption of children is widespread across cultures, sometimes constituted legally, but more often through
informal structures of support and sponsorship. There were an estimated 1.5 million adopted children under
18 in the United States in 2019, about 1 out of every 50 children, and adoption is increasing, especially among
same-sex couples. In 2019, 43.3 percent of children of same-sex couples were adopted or stepchildren.

Across cultures, informal adoption and foster care have long been practiced to strengthen families and provide
opportunities for young people. Anthropological studies in West Africa, Oceania, Latin America, and in
minority communities in North America document the prevalence of these practices, as well as their benefits
and risks. In general, cultures that see social relationships as open and fluid are able to provide a greater range
of opportunities to children. One common form of informal adoption relocates children from rural birth
families to relatives living in urban areas, where they have more opportunities for education, employment, and
career training. Sometimes informal fostering helps to provide caretaking for shorter periods of time. A family
may send an older child to temporarily live with a relative or even a friend who has a new infant or is facing a
family crisis. These relationships may be mutually beneficial, allowing older children to meet new people and
develop a wider network of friends and relatives. Historically, adoptive ties have played a major role in family
security and in creating stronger social ties between families, some of which may provide future educational,
work, and career opportunities.

11.3 Reckoning Kinship across Cultures

LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Describe the importance of kinship in social structure.
  · Distinguish between different kinship systems.
  · Illustrate three forms of kinship.

By defining relationships between individuals, cultural understandings of kinship create kinship systems or
structures within society. This is the institutional aspect of kinship, and it is bigger than the family itself. In
smaller societies with lower populations, kinship plays a major role in all social institutions. In larger societies
with higher populations, kinship places the local and familiar in opposition to a wider, more amorphous
society, where relationships have less and less significance. In effect, kinship frames the way the individual
and family are viewed in relation to the larger society and embodies social values.

Types of Kinship Systems

In his early research, Lewis Henry Morgan distinguished three basic forms of kinship structure commonly
found across cultures. Today, we refer to these kinship forms as lineal, bifurcate merging, and generational
kinship. Each one defines family and relatives a bit differently and so highlights different roles, rights, and
responsibilities for these individuals. This means that depending on the kinship structure used by a society,
EGO will refer to a different set of individuals as kindred and will have a different relationship with those
individuals.

Lineal kinship: Lineal kinship (initially referred to as Eskimo kinship) is a form of kinship reckoning (a way of
mapping EGO to other individuals) that highlights the nuclear family. While kindred in a lineal system is traced
through both EGO's mother and father (a practice called bilateral descent), the kinship terminology clearly
shows that the rights and responsibilities of the nuclear family far exceed those of other kindred. In effect,
lineal kinship, associated frequently with North American and European societies, suggests a very small and
nominal family with little power and influence across other social institutions.
348  11 · Forming Family through Kinship

     FIGURE 11.8 A lineal kinship diagram. Note the distinction of the nuclear family. (credit: "Eskimo Kinship Chart" by
     Fred the Oyster/Wikimedia Commons, CC0)
     On the lineal diagram (Figure 11.8), note the following: each of the members of the nuclear family have specific
     kinship terms, but bilateral kin (through both EGO's mother and father) and collateral kin (EGO's siblings and
     their offspring) are lumped together with similar terms. These relationships are not highlighted by
     individualized terms because there are minimal rights and responsibilities between EGO and kin outside of
     the nuclear family of orientation and procreation.
     Bifurcate merging kinship: Bifurcate merging kinship (initially referred to as Iroquois kinship) highlights a
     larger family of orientation for EGO by merging EGO's parents' same-sex siblings and their offspring into the
     immediate family (creating parallel cousins) and bifurcating, or cutting off, EGO's parents' opposite-sex
     siblings and their offspring (creating cross cousins). Figure 11.9 depicts bifurcate merging kinship with
     unilineal descent (either patrilineal or matrilineal). This means that once descent is introduced into the
     diagram, EGO's relationships, with associated rights and responsibilities, will shift toward either the mother's
     or father's side. This form of kinship reckoning, quite common to tribal societies, is found extensively, and it
     creates a distinction between the family of orientation, which is merged together from various lines, and other
     relatives, who are bifurcated, or cut away.

FIGURE 11.9 A bifurcate merging kinship diagram. Note the distinction between parallel and cross cousins. (credit:
"Iroquois Kinship Chart" by Fred the Oyster/Wikimedia Commons, CC0)

On the bifurcate merging diagram (Figure 11.9), note that the members of the family of orientation share
kinship terms that indicate a close intimacy with EGO. As an example, while EGO knows who his biological
mother is (the woman who gave birth to him), his relationship with his biological mother has the same rights
and responsibilities as his relationship with his mother's sister(s), etc. Notice also that the category of
individuals lumped together as "cousins" under the lineal diagram are here distinguished depending on EGO's
relationship with their parent. EGO's mother's sisters are called "mother" and his father's brothers are called
"father," which means that any of their offspring would be EGO's brothers or sisters. Notice, though, that the
mothers and fathers highlighted outside of EGO's biological parents are married to non-kin members; EGO
does not refer to his mother's sister's husband as father--he is referred to as "mother's husband." Mother's
brothers and father's sisters produce offspring who are bifurcated and lumped as "cousin." Anthropologists
distinguish between parallel cousins (EGO's brothers and sisters through his parents' same-sex siblings) and
cross cousins (EGO's cousins through his parents' opposite-sex siblings). In many tribal societies, EGO would
choose his (or her) marriage partner from among his (or her) cross cousins, thereby merging their children
back into a primary kinship line. In this way, the family unit (the kindred) maintains a stable and significant
presence across generations.

Generational kinship: Generational kinship (initially referred to as Hawaiian kinship) presents a very
different case. Widespread in Polynesia, especially during the times of chiefdom societies, generational
kinship provides a distinction in kinship terms only along gender and generational lines. Generational kinship
has the least complicated kinship terminology of all kinship systems, but the impact of creating a family of
orientation this large and powerful is immediately apparent. In reading this chart, it is obvious that the
intimate family was as large as could be configured and it would have significant sociopolitical impact within
the society.

     Descent

     Kinship structure is highly diverse, and there are many different ways to think about it. Descent is the way that
     families trace their kinship connections and social obligations to each other between generations of ancestors
     and generations to come. It is a primary factor in the delineation of kinship structures. Through descent, the
     individual highlights certain particular relationships with kindred and drops or leaves off other possible
     relationships. Descent ultimately determines such things as inheritance, alliance, and marriage rules. There
     are two common ways that a cultural group can trace descent across generations:
     Unilineal descent: Unilineal descent traces an individual's kinship through a single gendered line, either male
     or female, as a collective social rule for all families within a society. The patrilineal or matrilineal relatives that
     connect to and from EGO form EGO's lineage. This lineage is believed to be a continuous line of descent from
     an original ancestor. Lineages believed to be close in relationship are gathered into clans, a tribal social
     division denoting a group of lineages that have a presumed and symbolic kinship, and eventually into moieties
     (the social division of a tribe into two halves).

       · In patrilineal (or agnatic) descent, the descent of both males and females is traced solely through male
           ancestors. Females hold the patrilineal descent of their fathers, and males pass on the descent through
           their children.

      FIGURE 11.11 A chart illustrating patrilineal descent across several generations. Note that all offspring
      individuals marked in blue are part of their father's descent, but descent only passes through males.
      (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)
In matrilineal (or uterine) descent, the descent of both males and females is traced solely through female
ancestors. Males hold the matrilineal descent of their mothers, and females pass on the descent through their
children.
Cognatic descent: Cognatic descent is a kinship structure that follows descent through both men and women,
although it may vary by family.
  · In ambilineal descent, an individual's kinship is traced through a single gendered line, with each family
     choosing either the mother's or the father's descent line; in societies practicing this type of cognatic
      descent, some families will trace descent through the mother and others through the father. Usually
      families will choose their descent type at marriage based on the different opportunities presented by
      either the mother's or father's family, and they will use this for each of their children. While societies
      practicing ambilineal descent might initially look like those of unilineal descent, they are different. Within
      these societies, families are diverse and do not follow a single type of descent reckoning.
  · In bilateral descent (also referred to as bilineal descent), an individual's kinship is traced through both
      mother's and father's lines. This is the most common form of descent practiced in the United States today.

      FIGURE 11.12 A chart illustrating bilateral descent across several generations. Note that all offspring trace
      their lineage through both mother and father. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0

Why does descent matter? It structures the way the family will be formed (who counts most in decision-
352  11 · Forming Family through Kinship

     making). It determines the choices individuals have in forming their own families. And it directs how material
     and symbolic resources (such as power and influence) will be dispersed across a group of people. As the
     example in the next section shows, descent affects the whole structure of society.

     A Matrilineal Society in the United States

     The Navajo are among the most populous of the Indigenous peoples in the United States, exceeding 325,000
     members. Roughly half live in the Navajo Nation. Covering some 27,000 square miles, the Navajo Nation is an
     autonomous jurisdiction that crosses New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah. Traditionally a matrilineal society, the
     Navajo trace descent and inheritance through their mothers and grandmothers. Such a descent pattern would
     normally lead to the establishment of matrilocal households, with daughters bringing their husbands to live
     with or near their matrilineal kin following marriage.

     In his study of the contemporary Shonto Navajo, however, William Yewdale Adams (1983), an anthropologist
     who spent part of his childhood living on the Navajo reservation, found that this wasn't always the case. While
     matrilocal residence remained the ideal for Navajo families, it was not followed any more frequently than
     patrilocal residence (living with or near the groom's father). Neolocal residence (a separate, independent
     household) was also practiced across the Navajo Nation. While the ideal Navajo family type endured as part of
     their identity, the actual everyday practices of families depended on their particular circumstances and might
     change over the course of their lives. When job opportunities and economic choices necessitated that families
     live in different areas, they adapted. When families became large and less manageable as a socioeconomic
     unit, they might splinter into smaller units, some into nuclear families living alone. However, during major life
     events, such as marriage and childbirth, it is the matrilineal family that will most support the couple by
     providing resources and any needed labor and help. Matrilineal descent also elevates the role of women in
     society, not by excluding men, but by recognizing the vital roles that women play in the establishment of both
     family and society.

                FIGURE 11.13 A contemporary Navajo family (credit: "IMG_1123" by Neeta Lind/flickr, CC BY 2.0)

     Traditionally, the Navajo constructed houses (called hogans) of timber or stone frames covered with earth
     (Haile 1942). There are multiple types of hogans, including a male hogan, which is conically shaped and used
     for more private rituals, and a female hogan, which is circular and large enough to accommodate the whole
     family. Although today most Navajo live in Western-style homes with electricity and running water, many
     families still construct one or more hogans for ritual and ceremony. For families that continue traditional
     Navajo ceremonies, the most common hogan form today is the female hogan. As Adams aptly argues, the
     Navajo are very much like other societies in regard to kinship--while it defines an ideal within Navajo society,
     its primary function is to provide "possibilities and boundaries" around which individuals will construct
     kinship (1983, 412). It adapts to the changing environment and the needs of family.

        PROFILES IN ANTHROPOLOGY

Louise Lamphere
1940-

Personal History: Louise Lamphere (https://openstax.org/r/Louise) is a professor emerita of the University of
New Mexico, where she held the honorary post of Distinguished Professor of Anthropology. Her scholarly
career in anthropology began with bachelor's and master's degrees from Stanford University and a PhD in
anthropology from Harvard University.

Area of Anthropology: Lamphere's research in cultural anthropology extends over many areas of the
discipline, including gender and feminist anthropology, kinship, social inequality, and medical practices and
reform in the United States and across cultures. She has worked extensively with indigenous peoples,
including the Navajo, and in urban contexts. She seeks to understand the intersections between sociocultural
institutions and individuals. A recent focus is social and economic changes emerging from the
deindustrialization of nation-states. Her work has had wide-ranging impact on generations of anthropology
students and scholars.

Accomplishments in the Field: Lamphere's research contributions are extensive (and continue). She served
as the president of the American Anthropological Association from 1999 to 2001, leading the organization
toward public support of policies focused on current themes such as poverty and welfare reform in the United
States (see this letter from Lamphere (https://openstax.org/r/americananthro)). She has received numerous
awards and commendations for her research and service. In 2013 she was awarded the Franz Boas Award for
Exemplary Service to Anthropology from the American Anthropological Association. This award, which is
presented annually, recognizes extraordinary achievements that have served the anthropological profession
and the greater community by applying anthropological knowledge to improve lives. In 2017 Lamphere was
awarded the Bronislaw Malinowski Award by the Society for Applied Anthropology in recognition of her use of
social science to solve the problems of human communities today.

Lamphere's research interests have been important in addressing current needs of human societies, including
gender inequalities, socioeconomic challenges, and issues of migration and adaptation. She has also worked to
address inequalities and discrimination in her own life. In 1968 she was hired as an assistant professor at
Brown University, where she was the only woman on the anthropology faculty. She was denied tenure in 1974,
with the university claiming that her scholarship was "weak." Together with other two other female faculty,
Lamphere put forth a case accusing the university of widespread sexual discrimination. In September 1977,
then Brown University president Howard Swearer entered into a historic consent decree to ensure that women

     Marriage is the formation of a socially recognized union. Depending on the society, it may be a union between
     a man and a woman, between any two adults (regardless of their gender), or between multiple spouses in
     polygamous societies. Marriages are most commonly established to provide a formal structure in which to
     raise and nurture offspring (whether biological or adopted/fostered), but not all marriages involve
     reproduction, and marriage can serve multiple functions. One function is to create alliances between
     individuals, families, and sometimes larger social networks. These alliances may provide political and
     economic advantages. While there are variations of marriage, the institution itself, with a few notable
     exceptions, is universal across cultures.

     Marriage is an effective means of addressing several common challenges within families. It provides a
     structure in which to produce, raise, and nurture offspring. It reduces competition among and between males
     and females. And it creates a stable, long-term socioeconomic household in which the family unit can more
     adequately subsist with shared labor and resources. All societies practice rules of marriage that determine
     what groups an individual should marry into (called endogamy rules) and which groups are considered off
     limits and not appropriate for marriage partners (called exogamy rules). These rules are behavioral norms in a
     society. For example, in the United States, individuals tend to marry within the same generation (endogamy)
     and usually the same linguistic group, but they marry outside of very close kin (exogamy). Those considered to
     be too closely related to marry are prohibited by rules of incest, a relationship defined as too close for sexual
     relations.

     Across all cultures, there is an incest taboo, a cultural norm that prohibits sexual relations between parents
     and their offspring. This taboo sometimes extends to other relations considered too close for sexual
     relationship. In some societies, this taboo may extend to first cousins. In the United States, first-cousin
     marriage laws (https://openstax.org/r/Cousin_marriage_law) vary across states (see "Cousin Marriage Law in
     the United States" for current state laws). French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss argued that incest is the
     original social structure because it naturally separates groups of people into two types--those with whom an
     individual has family ties (so-called biological ties) and those with whom an individual can have sexual
     relations and establish ties.

     Defining marriage can be complex. In the southern Andes of Peru and Bolivia, Indigenous people begin
     marriage with a practice known as servinakuy (with spelling variations). In servinakuy, a man and woman

establish their own independent household with very little formal social acknowledgement and live together
until the birth of their first child, after which they are formally considered to be a fully married couple. Not a
trial marriage and not considered informal cohabitation, servinakuy is, instead, a prolonged marriage process
during which family is created over time. Andean legal scholars argue that these unions should carry with
them the legal rights and protections associated with a formal marriage from the time the couple begins living
together (Ingar 2015).

Like all social institutions, ideas about marriage can adapt and change. Within urban Western societies, the
concept of marriage is undergoing a great deal of change as socioeconomic opportunities shift and new
opportunities open up for women. In Iceland, in 2016, almost 70 percent of children were born outside of a
marriage, usually to committed unmarried couples (Peng 2018). This trend is supported by national social
policies that provide generous parental leave for both married individuals and those within a consensual
union, but the change is also due to the more fluid nature of family today. As norms change in Iceland across
generations, it will be interesting to see if the practiced form of consensual union we see today eventually
comes to be considered a sanctioned form of marriage.

Forms of Marriage

Anthropologists group marriage customs into two primary types: a union of two spouses only (monogamy) or a
union involving more than two spouses (polygamy). Monogamy is the socially sanctioned union of two adults.
In some societies this union is restricted to a man and a woman, and in other societies it can be two adults of
any gender. Monogamy, because it produces an overall smaller family unit, is especially well adapted to
postindustrial societies and cultures where family units are highly mobile (such as nomadic foragers).
Monogamy also includes same-sex marriage. In June 2015, in Obergefell v. Hodges, the US Supreme Court
legalized same-sex marriage in the United States, following earlier legal recognitions in many other Western
countries. Today, same-sex marriage is legal in 30 countries. While the movement to legalize same-sex
marriage has been long and tumultuous in many of these countries, same-sex marriages and unions have
historically played significant roles in both Indigenous and Western societies.

Serial monogamy: Serial monogamy is a form of monogamy in which adults have a series of two-person
monogamous marriages over a lifetime. It is increasingly common in Western societies, but it is also practiced
in some small-scale societies, such as bands. In serial monogamy, divorce and remarriage are common.

Polygamy: Polygamy is the socially sanctioned union of more than two adults at the same time. In polygamous
societies, families usually begin with a two-person marriage between a man and a woman. In some cases, the
marriage will remain as a single couple for a long period of time or for the duration of their lives because of
lack of resources or availability of partners. Adding partners is frequently a sign of status and is considered an
ideal for families in polygamous societies. In some cases, too, polygamy is practiced to address extreme social
stress due to things such as warfare or skewed population distributions caused by famine and high mortality
rates. In her cross-cultural study of polygamy, cultural anthropologist Miriam Zeitzen (2008) noted a great deal
of diversity within polygamy, from de jure unions that are formal, legal contracts (such as is found in Gambia)
to de facto polygamy, which may be just as enduring, stable, and acceptable within a society (such as is found
in Ivory Coast).
356  11 · Forming Family through Kinship

     FIGURE 11.15 In a polygynous marriage, there is one husband and more than one wife. This is the cast of Sister
     Wives, a television series about a polygamous household in the United States. (credit: "Sister Wives Cast on Valder
     Beebe" by Valder Beebe Show/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 3.0)

     There are two principle kinds of polygamy, depending on the partners involved, as multiple men and multiple
     women in a single marriage (called group marriage) is not common. Polygyny, which is the more common
     form of polygamy, is the marriage of one man to more than one woman. There is often marked age asymmetry
     in these relationships, with husbands much older than their wives. In polygynous households, each wife
     commonly lives in her own house with her own biological children, but the family unit cooperates together to
     share resources and provide childcare. The husband usually "visits" his wives in succession and lives in each
     of their homes at various times (or lives apart in his own). It is common, also, for there to be a hierarchy of
     wives based on seniority. Polygyny is found worldwide and offers many benefits. It maximizes the family labor
     force and the shared resources and opportunities available for family members and creates wide kinship
     connections within society. Commonly in polygynous societies, larger families are afforded higher social status
     and they have stronger political and economic alliances.

     Polygyny is prevalent in Thailand today, with as many as one in four Thai men between the ages of 30 and 50
     having a second wife, called a mia noi (minor wife). In her research in Thailand, cultural anthropologist Jiemin
     Bao (2008) studied polygyny among a group of lukchin Thai (Thai of Chinese descent). She found that the
     lukchin practiced polygynous marriages as a joint husband-and-wives economic enterprise, many times
     sending remittances back to family members still living in China. Bao found that husbands frequently seek
     their wives' consent before adding another wife and that the family overall considers polygyny to create
     greater economic opportunities for all family members because multiple wives create a pool of stable laborers
     with individual skill sets. Even so, Bao observed turmoil and conflict even within economically successful
     polygynous families and observed that many marriages were conducted as if they were "cutting a business
     deal" (151). Gender politics of polygynous marriage among the lukchin often left women with few choices
     except to work for her husband's family. Economic success for the family was culturally attributed to the male
     head of household and not his wives.

     A second form of polygamy is polyandry. In polyandry, which is comparatively rare, there is one wife and more
     than one husband. Polyandrous marriages minimize population growth and may occur in societies where
     there is a temporary surfeit of males and scarcity of females or scarcity of resources. In fraternal polyandry,
     brothers marry a single wife. This is the most common in Nepal, where it is practiced by a minority of mainly
     rural families. Fraternal polyandry offers several benefits for societies like Nepal with scarce resources and
     dense population. Where there is extreme scarcity of land acreage, it allows brothers to share an inheritance of
     land instead of dividing it up. It reduces inequality within the household, as the family can thus collectively
     subsist on the land as a family unit. Also, in areas where land is scattered over large distances, it allows
     brothers to take turns living away from home to tend herds of animals or fields and then spending time at
     home with their shared wife. It also minimizes reproduction and population growth in a society where there is

a very dense population (Goldstein 1987), as the wife can carry only one pregnancy at a time.

Postmarital Residence Rules

Following marriage, a couple begins a new family and establishes a shared residence, whether as a separate
family unit or as part of an already established family group. The social rules that determine where a newly
married couple will reside are called postmarital residence rules and are directly related to the descent rules
that operate in the society. These rules may be adapted due to extenuating circumstances such as economic
need or lack of housing. In the United States today, for example, it is increasingly common for newly married
couples to postpone the establishment of a separate household when work, schooling, or children create a
need for familial support.

There are five postmarital residence patterns:

  · Under neolocal residence, a newly married couple establishes an independent household not connected
      to either spouse's family. This pattern of residence is mostly associated with bilateral descent. While this is
      a norm in our own society, during times of economic stress or familial need, couples in the United States
      do occasionally live in the household of one spouse's parents.

  · More common worldwide is patrilocal residence, associated with societies practicing patrilineal descent.
      In patrilocal residence, the newly married couple establishes their new household with or near the
      groom's father or the groom's father's relatives. What this means is that at marriage the groom remains
      within his household and/or family group, while the bride leaves her parents. Their future children will
      belong to the groom's lineage.

  · Matrilocal residence is associated with societies practicing matrilineal descent. In matrilocal residence,
      the newly married couple establishes their new household with or near the bride's mother or the bride's
      mother's relatives. At marriage the bride remains within her household and/or family group, while the
      groom leaves his parents. Their future children will belong to the bride's lineage.

  · Less frequent but also associated with matrilineal descent is avunculocal residence, in which the newly
      married couple resides with or near the groom's mother's brother. In societies that practice avunculocal
      residence, the groom has commonly had a long-term relationship with his maternal uncle, who is part of
      his own mother's matriline. By joining with household of the groom's maternal uncle, the couple is able to
      benefit from both the husband's and the wife's matrilines.

  · Under ambilocal residence, the couple decides which spouse's family to live with or near. Ambilocal
      residence is associated with ambilineal descent. In ambilocal residence, the newly married couple will
      usually have made their decision about which spouse's family to join with prior to their marriage. Their
      future children will then trace descent through that particular line.

Marriage Compensation

In all cultures, marriage is a consequential matter not only to the adults immediately involved, but also to their
families and to the broader community. In societies that practice unilineal descent, the newly married couple
moves away from one family and toward another. This creates a disadvantage for the family that has "lost" a
son or daughter. For example, in a patrilineal society, while the wife will remain a member of her birth lineage
(that of her father), her children and her labor will now be invested mostly in her husband's lineage. As a result,
in societies practicing unilineal descent, there is a marriage compensation from one family to the other for
this perceived loss. Marriage compensation is the transfer of some form of wealth (in money, material goods, or
labor) from one family to another to legitimize the marriage as a creation of a new social and economic
household. It is not seen as payment for a spouse, but as recognition that the marriage and future children are
part of one lineage rather than another (Stone 1998, 77). There are several forms of marriage compensation,
each symbolically marked by specific cultural practices.

Bride wealth: Bride wealth (also called bride price) is the transfer of material and symbolic value from the
groom's to the bride's family. Depending on the cultural group, this may involve transfer of money, cattle,
house goods, jewelry, or even symbolic ritual artifacts. Bride wealth is the most common form of marriage
compensation across cultures. In her study of the Thadou Kukis of northeast India, Burma, and Bangladesh,
Indian sociologist Hoineilhing Sitlhou (2018) explores how bride wealth has changed over time. Historically,
the items exchanged included cows, copper gongs, silver earrings, and ceremonial clothing for the bride's
358  11 · Forming Family through Kinship

     parents. Today, more contemporary items are offered, such as gold jewelry, cars, furniture, appliances, and
     land. One practice that has not changed is paying a portion of the bride wealth prior to the marriage ceremony
     and the remainder at some later point so that the groom remains in respectful debt to the bride's family. In
     other societies, bride wealth must be paid in full before the marriage is considered legitimate. If marriages
     conducted using bride wealth end in divorce, normally the bride wealth (or equivalent value) is returned to the
     groom's family to signify the dissolution of the contract.

     Bride service: Similar to bride wealth, bride service involves a transfer of something of value from the groom's
     to the bride's family, but in this case the arrangement involves the contracted labor of the groom, whether
     before or after the marriage. Future grooms may work for months or years for the bride's family (usually her
     father's household) prior to the marriage, or husbands may work for months or years with the bride's family
     after the marriage. In the first case, the groom completes his service prior to the marriage and then moves with
     the bride back to his family after the marriage. In the second case, the newly married couple remains in
     residence with the bride's family until the service is concluded. The advantage of the second type of service is
     that frequently the wife is living with her mother when her first child (or children) is born. While her children
     are aligned with her husband's family as far as descent (and inheritance), her parents are able to support the
     couple and their first child or children for a period of time.

     The contractual obligations of bride wealth and bride service are not without conflict. In many unilineal
     societies, these obligations create a great deal of strife and conflict that can go on for years. What if the
     marriage is temperamentally difficult? What if the wife is barren or a child dies? What if the husband's family
     suffers economic challenges that create a disparity between what he can offer their family of procreation and
     what the wife's lineage could offer the children? Each of these situations creates conflict. Sometimes these
     conflicts between lineages (because marriage is seen as a contract with the larger family) spill over into the
     larger society and create larger social divisions.

     Dowry: Dowry, a third form of marriage compensation, functions differently than bride wealth and bride price.
     Dowry is a form of material value, such as money, jewelry, house goods, or family heirlooms, that the bride
     brings into her own marriage to provide her with wealth within her husband's lineage. In some societies
     women turn their dowry over to their husbands, but in other societies they retain rights to this wealth as
     married women. Among Nepalese Brahmans, sons inherit land and property equally at the death of the father,
     while women receive a dowry of clothing, jewelry, and household utensils from their own patriline at marriage
     (Stone 1998). They will use this wealth for status within the marriage. In other societies, women create a dual
     inheritance for their own daughters from their dowry, passing their dowry down through their daughters.
     Regardless of how the wealth is used, a woman's most stable route to higher status within a patrilineal society
     is through the birth of her sons. It is sons within the patriline who will bring wives into their father's household
     and increase the size and prominence of the patriline through the birth of their children. In patrilineal
     societies, women with many sons typically carry a higher social status.

While marriage compensation is most commonly associated with patrilineal societies, it is important to note
that almost all marriages represent shared investments of one kind or another. Since marriage is the creation
of a new family, spouses most often bring with them into their marriage their skills, traditions, and social
networks, all of which carry symbolic weight within societies.

Remarriage Obligations

The many rules and corresponding obligations specific to marriage in unilineal societies (such as residence
rules and marriage compensation) are evidence that families and communities invest a great deal in
marriages and the formation of new families. So what happens if a young and newly married spouse dies?
What about the marriage compensation and the new household? In many unilineal societies (most especially
in patrilineal societies), remarriage obligations ensure that in these cases the marriage contract endures.
Remarriage obligations require the widowed spouse to remarry someone from the same lineage in order to
maintain the stability of the family unit.

There are numerous issues that affect when and how remarriage obligations are enacted. The factors that most
affect remarriage obligations are the ages of the spouses and amount of time that has passed since the
marriage occurred, the ages of the offspring and whether there are young children within the family unit, and
the particular marriage contract and value of the marriage compensation. Cultures (and families) determine
how best to enact these rules within their own value systems and based on current need. But the primary
underlying purpose of remarriage obligations is to maintain the alliance that was made between the two
lineages at the time of the marriage. These are intended to be enduring ties that benefit all members of each
lineage.

If the husband dies and there is a surviving wife (now widow), under the levirate remarriage rule she will
marry one of her husband's surviving brothers. While levirate will not be invoked in every case, it is quite
common when there are young children remaining within the immediate family unit. Because levirate is
usually practiced in societies with polygynous families, a married brother taking an additional wife will not
disrupt his existing family, and the new wife and her children will remain within the lineage where the
children were born.

The sororate applies to situations in which the wife dies and there is a surviving widower. Under this
remarriage rule, the deceased wife's lineage must provide a replacement female, preferably the former wife's
sister. If her sisters are already married or there are no sisters available, another female from the same lineage
can be sent as a replacement. Sororate allows young children from the first marriage to remain with their
father in his lineage and also maintain a symbolic and emotional bond with their biological mother's kindred.

Finally, there is also the highly variable practice of ghost marriage, where a marriage is performed between
one or two deceased individuals in order to create an alliance between lineages. Among the Dinka and Nuer of
South Sudan, a ghost marriage is similar to the levirate, with the deceased husband's brother standing in for
him in a ghost marriage. Unlike the levirate itself, any children from this second (ghost) marriage will be
attributed to the deceased husband and not to the brother or the wider lineage itself. Among Chinese
immigrants to Singapore, there are ghost marriage claims in which both spouses may be deceased (Schwartze
2010), continuing a tradition that began generations earlier (Topley 1955).

Arranged Marriages

While all marriages are planned, some are arranged, whether between the spouses involved and/or their
families or through a third party. Today, an interesting adaptation of arranged marriages has developed
involving online websites and hired marriage brokers to help individuals living in different countries find a
suitable spouse from their birth culture. As transnational corporations spread worldwide and individuals
become more highly mobile (even nomadic) for work, finding a spouse who shares the same cultural values
can be difficult. Although there are marriage brokers for many different cultural groups, there is a proliferation
of matchmakers for individuals of Indian nationality or descent. While not all of these sites are reputable, the
explosion of marriage brokering businesses reminds us that marriage is, first and foremost, a cultural
institution.
360  11 · Forming Family through Kinship

     Kinship is an adaptive mechanism across cultures. While kinship systems vary, they each address critical
     elements for a social group. Through families of orientation and procreation and within kinship networks,
     households are created, offspring are produced, and alliances are established.

CHAPTER OUTLINE
12.1 Sex, Gender, and Sexuality in Anthropology
12.2 Performing Gender Categories
12.3 The Power of Gender: Patriarchy and Matriarchy
12.4 Sexuality and Queer Anthropology
INTRODUCTION A friend announces, "My sister just had a baby last night!" Many people will immediately
ask, "Is it a boy or a girl?" Gender is central to the way people think about and interact with others.
Anthropologists are curious about the many ways in which gender shapes impressions and assumptions about
people and why gender is such a primary concern. Gender influences how people think about their own
identities, how they present themselves to others, and how they plan to lead their lives. People's sexual
identities and desires are shaped by gendered notions of themselves and others.
Since the beginning of the discipline, anthropologists have described how cultures construct gender roles and
sexual practices in many different cultural contexts. This chapter will explore the origins of gender and
consider various forms of biological evidence for gender differences. And it will consider how power operates
in cultural constructions of gender and sexuality. Anthropologists have discovered great diversity in human
systems of gender and expressions of sexuality.

     12.1 Sex, Gender, and Sexuality in Anthropology

     LEARNING OUTCOMES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       · Define the concepts of sex and gender and explain the difference between the two concepts.
       · Describe various cultural expressions of sexuality.
       · Identify the difficulties in applying primate research to human gender and sexuality.
       · Critique the "man the hunter" thesis of human evolution.

     For many people, male and female refer to natural categories that neatly divide up the human population.
     Often, people associate these two categories with different abilities and personality traits. Setting aside these
     ideas and assumptions, anthropologists explore aspects of human biology and culture to understand where
     notions of gender come from while documenting the diversity of gender and sexuality in cultures all over the
     world, past and present.

     The Terms: Sex, Gender, and Sexuality

     In the social sciences, the term sex refers to the biological categories of male and female (and potentially other
     categories, as discussed later in this chapter). The sex of a person is determined by an examination of
     biological and anatomical features, including (but not limited to): visible genitalia (e.g., penis, testes, vagina),
     internal sex organs (e.g., ovaries, uterus), secondary sex characteristics (e.g., breasts, facial hair),
     chromosomes (XX for females, XY for males, and other possibilities), reproductive capabilities (including
     menstruation), and the activities of growth hormones, particularly testosterone and estrogen. It may seem as
     though nature divides humans neatly into females and males, but such a long list of distinguishing factors
     results in a great deal of ambiguity and diversity within categories. For instance, hormonal influences can
     produce results different from the ways that people typically develop. Hormonal influences shape the
     development of sex organs over time and can stimulate the emergence of secondary sex characteristics
     associated with the other sex. Clothes on or clothes off, people can have body features associated with one sex
     category and chromosomes associated with another.

     While sex is based on biology, the term gender was developed by social scientists to refer to cultural roles
     based on these biological categories. The cultural roles of gender assign certain behaviors, relationships,
     responsibilities, and rights differently to people of different genders. As elements of culture, gender categories
     are learned rather than inherited or inborn, making childhood an important time for gender enculturation. As
     opposed to the seeming universality of sex categories, the specific content of gender categories is highly
     variable across cultures and subject to change over time.

     The two terms, biological sex and cultural gender, are often distinguished from one another to clarify the
     differences embedded in "nature" versus the differences constructed by "culture." But are biological sex
     categories based on an objective appraisal of nature? Are sex categories universal and durable? Some scholars
     question the biological objectivity of sex and its opposition to the more flexible notion of gender.

Associated with sex and gender, the concept of sexuality refers to erotic thoughts, desires, and practices and
the sociocultural identities associated with them. The complex ways in which people experience their own
bodies and perceive their own gender contribute to the physical behaviors they engage in to achieve pleasure,
intimacy, and/or reproduction. This complex of thoughts, desires, and behaviors constitutes a person's
sexuality.

Some cultures have very strict cultural norms regarding sexual practices, while others are more flexible. Some
cultures confer a distinctive identity on people who practice a particular form of sexuality, while others allow a
person to engage in an array of sexual practices without adopting a distinctive identity associated with those
practices (Nanda 2000). Sexual orientation refers to sociocultural identities associated with specific forms of
sexuality. For instance, in American culture, sex between a woman and a man is conventionalized into the
normative identity of heterosexual. If you are a person who practices that kind of sex (and only that kind), then
most Americans would consider you to be a heterosexual person. If you are a person who engages in sex with
someone of the same sex/gender category, then in American culture, you would be considered a gay person (if
you identify as male) or a lesbian (if you identify as female). So anxious are Americans about these categorical
identities that many young people who have erotic dreams or passing erotic thoughts about a same-sex friend
may worry that they are "really" not heterosexual. As American norms have changed over the past several
decades, some people who have romantic, emotional, or erotic feelings toward people of their own gender and
another gender have adopted the identity of bisexual. People who may have erotic desires about and relations
with others without regard to their biological sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation may consider
themselves to be pansexual. Even more recently, some people who do not engage in sexual thoughts, desires,
or practices of any kind have embraced the identity of asexual. While there are many aspects and
manifestations of sexual orientation, sexual orientation is considered to be a central and durable aspect of a
person's sociocultural identity.

In some cultures, heterosexuality was previously thought to be the most "natural" form of sexuality, a notion
called heteronormativity. This notion has been challenged by research and the growth of the global
LGBTQIA+ movement. In many other cultures, people are allowed or even expected to engage in more than one
form of sexuality without necessarily adopting any specific sexual identity. This is not to say that these other
cultures are consistently more liberal and tolerant of sexual diversity. In many societies, it is acceptable for
people to engage in same-sex practices in certain contexts, but they are still expected to marry someone of the
opposite sex and have children.

Scholars who have studied sexuality in many cultures have also pointed out that a person's gender identity,
sexual orientation, and sexuality tend to change significantly over the life span, responding to different
contexts and relationships. The term queer, originally a pejorative term in American culture for a person who
did not conform to the rigid norms of heterosexuality, has been appropriated by people who do not abide by
370  12 · Gender and Sexuality

     those norms, particularly people who take a more situational and fluid approach to the expression of gender
     and sexuality. Rather than a set of fixed and durable identities, queer gender and sexuality are more fluid,
     constantly emerging, and contingent on multiple factors.

     As complex as sex, gender, and sexuality can be, it is helpful to have a diagram illustrating the possible
     relationships among these factors. Activist Sam Killermann has developed a useful diagram known as "The
     Genderbread Person (https://openstax.org/r/the-binary-gender)," depicting the various aspects of identity,
     attraction, expression, and physical characteristics that combine in the gender/sexuality of whole persons.

     characteristics all contribute to gender and sexuality. (credit: "Genderbread Person v4" by Sam Killermann/

     Evidence from Biological Anthropology

     Given humans' close biological relationship to primates, one might expect to see similar dynamics of sex and
     gender between human and nonhuman primate social groups. Biologists and primatologists have examined
     sex differences in the biology and behavior of both nonhuman and human primates, looking for
     commonalities that might suggest a common biological genesis for sex/gender categories.

     Primate Sex Differences: Biology and Behavior
     In the 1950s, a time when American men were supposed to be breadwinners and American women were
     urged to be housewives and mothers, most primatologists believed that males were the public actors in
     primate social life, while females were passive, marginal figures. Primatologists of the time believed that males
     constantly competed against one another for dominance in a rigid group hierarchy, while females were more
     narrowly interested in raising young (Fedigan and Fedigan 1989). In fact, primatologists described the total
     social organization of primates in terms of male competition. This view went along with Charles Darwin's
     notion that males are forced to compete for the opportunity to mate with females and so, therefore, must be
     assertive and dominant. Females, in Darwin's theory, were shaped by evolution to choose the strongest male to
     mate with and then concern themselves exclusively with nurturing their offspring to adulthood.

     By the 1980s, however, a number of strong studies were showing some very surprising things about primate
     social organization. First, most primate groups are essentially composed of related females, with males as

12.1 · Sex, Gender, and Sexuality in Anthropology                                                                  371

temporary members who often move between groups. The heart of primate society, then, is not a set of
competitive males but a set of closely bonded mothers and their young. Females are not marginal figures but
central actors in most social life. The glue that holds most primate groups together is not male competition but
female kinship and solidarity.

Second, social organization in primates turned out to be incredibly complex, with both males and females
actively strategizing for desirable resources, roles, and relationships. Research on a number of primate species
has demonstrated that females are often sexually assertive and highly competitive. Female primates actively
exercise their preference to mate with certain male "friends" rather than aggressive or dominant males. For
males, friendliness with females may be a much better reproductive strategy than fighting with other males.
Moreover, many primatologists have begun to identify cooperation rather than competition as the central
feature of primate social life while still recognizing competition for resources by both males and females in
their pursuit of survival and reproduction (Fedigan and Fedigan 1989).

What this means, in a nutshell, is that (1) both females and males are competitive, (2) both females and males
are cooperative, and (3) both females and males are central actors in primate social life.

While evidence suggests that in primate groups males and females are equally important to social life, this still
leaves open the question of biological differences and their link to behavioral differences. The anatomy of
primate males and females differs in two main respects. First, of course, adult females can and often do
experience pregnancy and bear offspring. The females of most primate species are often pregnant or nursing
for most of their adult lives and devote more time and resources to care of young than males do (although there
are some notable exceptions, such as certain species of New World monkeys). And some researchers have
noted the tendency of juvenile females to pay more attention to primate babies in the group than do juvenile
males.

Second, male primates tend to be slightly bigger than females, although this difference itself is quite variable.
The size difference between males and females of any species is referred to as sexual dimorphism. Male and
female gibbons are nearly the same size, while male gorillas are nearly twice the size of females. Female
chimpanzees are about 75 percent the size of males. Human females are about 90 percent the size of males,
making human sexual dimorphism closer to gibbons than chimpanzees.

Some researchers suggest that a high level of sexual dimorphism is associated with strong male dominance,
rigid hierarchy, and male competition for mating with females. Certainly these features reinforce one another
in gorilla society. A low level of sexual dimorphism may be associated with long-term monogamy, as with
gibbons. However, anthropologist Adrienne Zihlman cautions against making any firm judgments about the
relationship between biological features such as size and behavioral features such as sexual relations. She
remarks, "There is no simple correlation between anatomy and behavioral expression, within or between
species" (1997, 100). Reviewing research on sex differences in gibbons, chimpanzees, gorillas, and
orangutans, she concludes that each species features a unique "mosaic" of sex differences involving anatomy
and behavior, with no clear commonality that might predict what is "natural" for humans.

     FIGURE 12.4 Bonobo group hug. Bonobos, which share 99% of their DNA with humans, live in female-dominant
     groups that are mostly egalitarian and peaceful. (credit: "JaxZoo_1-5-17-7140" by Rob Bixby/flickr, CC BY 2.0)

     Humans' closest primate relatives are chimpanzees and bonobos, both sharing 99 percent of their DNA with
     humans, and yet each species exhibits very different gender-related behaviors. Bonobos are female-dominant,
     while chimpanzees are male-dominant. Bonobo groups are mostly egalitarian and peaceful, while chimpanzee
     groups are intensely hierarchical, with frequent male aggression between groups. Sexual behavior among
     bonobos is remarkably frequent and extraordinarily variable, with a wide range of same-sex and opposite-sex
     pairings involving various forms of genital contact. Some researchers believe that sexual contact helps build
     social bonds and ease conflicts in bonobo groups. Bonobos have been called the "make love, not war" primate.
     Sexual behavior among chimpanzees is also variable but much more limited to opposite-sex pairings. A female
     in estrus may mate with several males, a pattern called opportunistic mating. Short-term exclusive
     relationships may form, in which a male guards a female to prevent other males from mating with her.
     Consortships also happen, in which a female and a male leave the group for a week or more.

     With such variability between humanity's two closest DNA relatives, it is impossible to use nonhuman primate
     behavior to make assumptions about what is "natural" for human males and females. In fact, with regard to
     gender, the lessons of primatology may be that apes (like humans) are biologically quite flexible and capable of
     many social expressions of gender and sexuality.

     Human Sex Differences: Biology and Behavior
     Just as with primate research, research on human biological sex/gender differences has been considerably
     slanted by the gender bias of the (often male) researchers. Within the Euro-American intellectual tradition,
     scholars in the past have argued that women's biological constitution makes them unfit to vote, go to college,
     compete in the job market, or hold political office. More recently, beliefs about the different cognitive abilities
     of men and women have become widespread. Males are supposedly better at math and spatial relationships,
     while females are better at language skills. Hormonal activities supposedly make males more aggressive and
     females more emotional.

     In her book Myths of Gender, biologist Anne Fausto-Sterling (1992) conducts a massive review of research on
     cognitive and behavioral sex/gender differences in humans. Looking very closely at the data, she finds that the
     vast number of studies show no statistically significant difference whatsoever between the cognitive abilities of
     boys and girls. A minority of studies found very small differences. For instance, among four studies of abstract
     reasoning abilities, one study indicated that females were superior in this skill, one study indicated that males
     were superior, and two studies showed no difference at all. Overall, when differences are found in verbal
     abilities, girls usually come out ahead, but the difference is so small as to be irrelevant to questions of
     education and employment. Likewise, more than half of all studies on spatial abilities find no difference
     between girls and boys. When differences are found, boys come out ahead, but the difference is again very
     small. Looking at the overall variation of skill levels in this area, only about 5 percent of it can be attributed to
     gender. This means that 95 percent of the differences are due to other factors, such as educational

opportunities.

FIGURE 12.5 A girl solving math problems in school. Research has found no statistically significant difference
between the cognitive abilities of boys and girls. (credit: "Uganda_13" by mattlucht/flickr, CC BY 2.0)
Even these tiny differences that may exist in the cognitive talents of different genders are not necessarily
rooted in biological sex differences. Several studies of spatial abilities have shown that boys may initially
perform better on spatial ability tests, but when given time to practice, girls increase their skill levels to
become equal to boys, while boys remain the same. Some researchers reason that styles of play such as sports,
often encouraged more by parents of boys, may build children's spatial skills. Parenting styles, forms of play,
and gender roles--all elements of culture--may shape the data more than biology. Cross-cultural studies also
indicate that culture plays an important role in shaping abilities. A study of the Inuit found no differences at all
in the spatial abilities of boys and girls, while in a study of the Temne of Sierra Leone, boys outperformed the
girls. Inuit girls are generally allowed more freedom and autonomy, while Temne girls are more restricted in
their activities.

FIGURE 12.6 The relative freedom of Inuit girls may enhance their spatial abilities. (credit: "Children in Greenland"

Similar complexities emerge in the analysis of studies on aggression. Fausto-Sterling found that most studies
revealed no clear relationship between testosterone levels and levels of aggression in males. Moreover,
testosterone aggression studies have been riddled with problems such as poor methodology, questionable
definitions of aggression, and an inability to prove whether testosterone provokes aggression or the other way
374  12 · Gender and Sexuality

     around. Where differences in aggression between girls and boys are documented, some researchers have
     concluded that cultural factors may play a strong role in producing those differences. Anthropologist Carol
     Ember studied levels of aggression among boys and girls in a village in Kenya. Overall, the boys exhibited more
     aggressive behavior, but there were exceptions. In families lacking girl children, boys were made to perform
     more "feminine" work such as childcare, housework, and fetching water. Boys who regularly performed those
     tasks exhibited less aggression than other boys--up to 60 percent less for boys who performed a lot of this
     work.

     As with the primate research on sex differences, research on the brains, bodies, and behaviors of male and
     female humans does not seem to suggest that significant behavioral differences are biologically hardwired.
     While researchers have discovered differences in the cognitive talents and social behaviors of males and
     females, those differences are very small and could very well be due to social and cultural factors rather than
     biology. As with bonobos and chimpanzees, humans are biologically quite flexible, allowing for a diverse array
     of forms of gender and sexuality.

     Evidence from Archaeology

     Seeking to understand the origins of human sociocultural formations of gender and sexuality, some
     researchers have turned to the archaeological record. Archaeologists use temporal sequencing, fossil
     evidence, comparison with living communities, and knowledge of the evolutionary process to piece together
     an understanding of the development of gendered and sexual behaviors in the context of human evolution.

     Early theories of gender in human evolutionary history were shaped by the "man the hunter" hypothesis. In
     the 1950s and '60s, many anthropologists believed that hunting constituted the primary means of subsistence
     throughout humans' evolutionary past, up until the domestication of plants and animals around 10,000 years
     ago. As hunting was mainly done by men in contemporary gathering-hunting societies, researchers assumed
     that hunting was naturally and exclusively a male activity throughout prehistory. Women could not hunt, it was
     thought, due to the burdens of pregnancy, nursing, and childcare. It seemed likely that adult women stayed
     together with their children at the home base while men went out in small groups in search of game. In this
     view, tools were invented for hunting and processing meat and were mostly made by men. Dependence on
     meat gave men power and prestige, leading to male dominance over females. Hunting also spurred the
     development of language because communication was necessary to coordinate hunting expeditions. Tools and
     language, in turn, stimulated the development of larger brains. Hunting by men was therefore thought to be
     the central driving force in the evolution of humans' hominid ancestors.

     FIGURE 12.7 A Kali'na man and woman in the Venezuelan savanna on a gathering and hunting trip. The gathering
     typically done by women contributes far more to the diets of contemporary gathering-hunting societies than the

equal. (credit: Pierre Barrère/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)

In the 1970s, researchers from the emerging field of sociobiology drew from the "man the hunter" hypothesis
to claim that certain gender roles and sexual relations evolved to be natural among humans. Sociobiology is a
subfield of biology that attempts to explain human behavior by considering evolutionary processes. In regard
to gender roles, for instance, sociobiologists sought to understand how evolution may have shaped men and
women differently, encouraging gender-specific strategies for survival and reproduction. Many sociobiologists
have argued that men, as hunters, evolved to be strong and aggressive, able to strategize in groups but in fierce
competition to achieve the status of dominant male; in contrast, women were primarily engaged in childcare
and food preparation and therefore evolved to be more nurturing and submissive, focused on attracting the
attentions of men. Dependent on men to supply meat for themselves and their children, women would have
been motivated to ensnare men in long-term monogamous relationships to ensure a constant food supply as
well as protection from other aggressive males. Largely free from the responsibilities of childcare, men would
have been motivated to mate with as many females as possible to ensure the greatest number of descendants.
This view of the natural order of gender relations became very popular and widespread in American society.

Less well-known in American society is the thorough critique of the "man the hunter" hypothesis within
archaeology and throughout the other subfields of anthropology. Around the same time that sociobiologists
were elaborating on their theories of gender, many anthropologists were pushing back against the notion that
hunting was the primary subsistence activity of gathering-hunting societies. As you'll recall from the
discussion of such societies in, Work, Life, and Value: Economic Anthropology, gathering contributes far more
to the diets of contemporary gathering-hunting societies than hunting does. Rather than staying at the home
base, women and children go out gathering in groups several times a week, largely meeting their own
nutritional needs as well as sharing with others. Pregnancy and nursing do not significantly limit the
subsistence activities of women, as they remain active throughout pregnancy and carry infants in slings or on
their hips until the children are able to keep up. While meat is highly valued, it does not make women
dependent on men, and the ability to hunt does not make men dominant over women. In most contemporary
gathering-hunting societies, men and women are fairly equal.

In archaeology, some feminist researchers have countered the "man the hunter" hypothesis with a "woman
the gatherer" hypothesis. These researchers point to fossil evidence suggesting that women's activities were
equally important to survival and development in humans' evolutionary past. These archaeologists note that
the teeth of early hominids indicate that they were omnivorous, eating a wide variety of foods. The very large,
well-worn molars of early hominid skulls indicate an adaptation to a diet of gritty foods such as nuts, seeds,
and fruits with tough peels. Given the centrality of plant foods to the diets of contemporary gathering-hunting
peoples, it seems likely that gathering was also the primary means of food-getting for humans' ancestors
(though, of course, one must be cautious in making such generalizations). If gathering was so crucial, then
quite possibly the ingenuity of early hominids might have been focused not only on making hunting gear but
also on developing tools for gathering, such as digging sticks and stones for breaking open hard shells. As
hominid babies lacked the grasping toes of other apes, it would have been more difficult for them to grasp hold
of their mothers as they were carried out on gathering expeditions. Perhaps, then, an important invention
might have been a baby sling made of animal skins, an object known as a kaross among the San peoples of the
Kalahari in southern Africa. Unfortunately, as digging sticks and baby slings would have been made of organic
materials, the fossil record contains no trace of them. While the stone tools used in hunting are prevalent in
the fossil record, the organic tools used in gathering would have decomposed long ago.

If gathering was the crucial food-getting strategy of hominins or was at least equal in importance to hunting,
then women likely enjoyed considerable social power alongside men. If women were gathering, they probably
contributed to the development of the tools associated with gathering. On the move throughout the local
environment, women likely knew where to find high-quality foods and when such foods were in season. If
women could provide for themselves, they would have been free to become involved in romantic and sexual
relationships on their own terms and to leave such relationships when they wanted. What is known about
gathering in gathering-hunting societies completely overturns assumptions of male dominance embedded in
the "man the hunter" hypothesis.

Beyond "man the hunter" and "woman the gatherer" hypotheses, cultural anthropologists who study
376  12 · Gender and Sexuality

     gathering-hunting groups point out that the gendered division of labor in gathering-hunting societies is more
     flexible than these essentialist theories might suggest. In such societies, men also gather plant foods, and
     women sometimes hunt for honey or kill small game such as lizards and insects. As mentioned in the
     introduction to this textbook, a team of archaeologists led by Randy Haas recently discovered the 9,000-year-
     old bones of a woman buried with projectile points and other hunting implements in the Andes of South
     America (Gibbons 2020). Having reexamined archaeological reports on the burials of 10 other women buried
     with hunting tools, Haas and his team believe they may also have been female hunters.

     FIGURE 12.8 A statue of Diana, Roman goddess of the hunt. Recent archaeological finds of females buried with
     hunting tools suggest that in early human societies, hunting was not an activity solely performed by males. (credit:

     As with evidence from primates and human biology, the archaeological evidence for the origins of human
     gender roles and sexual relations is not definitive. Rather, the main lesson seems to be that humans are
     biologically flexible and culturally variable in their expressions of gender and sexuality.

     LEARNING OUTCOMES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       · Explain how essentialism triggers circular thinking about gender.
       · Describe the performative aspects of gender.
       · Distinguish between public and private social realms and identify the consequences of this distinction for
           gender categories.
       · Give an example of the sociocultural construction of masculinity.
       · Define the concept of intersex.
       · Give a detailed example of a culture with multiple genders.

     So if gender is not a "natural" expression of sex differences, then what is it? Cultural anthropologists explore
     how people's ideas of gender are formed in their minds, bodies, social institutions, and everyday practices.

Nature, Culture, and the Performance of Gender

FIGURE 12.9 The "natural history" of gender, according to this English nursery rhyme, is based on little boys being
composed of "frogs and snails and puppy dog's tails," while little girls consist of "sugar and spice and all that's nice."
(credit: Walter Crane/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)

Gender not only influences how people think about themselves and others; it also influences how they feel
about themselves and others--and how others make them feel. Romantic or sexual passion draws from
gendered identities and reinforces them. In the words sung by Aretha Franklin, "You make me feel like a
natural woman." There is something about gendered identity that can feel deep and real. The sense that some
trait is so profoundly deep and consequential that it creates a common identity for everyone who has that trait
is called essentialism. Gender essentialism is the basis of a lot of circular thinking. When a boy kicks a ball
through the neighbor's window and someone says, "Boys will be boys!"--that's essentialist. You may be familiar
with this little essentialist ditty from Euro-American culture:

      Sugar and spice and everything nice,
      that's what little girls are made of.
      Snips and snails and puppy dog tails,
      that's what little boys are made of.

In this view, gender is what you're "made of"--that is, your biological essence.

And yet, biology and archaeology have shown that gender differences are complicated and illusory. What is a
natural woman . . . or a natural man? Cultural anthropologists find that some cultures consider men and
women to be quite similar, while other cultures emphasize differences between genders. All cultures promote
a distinctive set of ideal norms, values, and behaviors, considering those ideals to be natural and good. In
cultures that consider men and women to be similar, those ideals apply equally to all people. In cultures that
consider men and women to be quite different, one set of ideals applies to men and another set applies to
women. In all cases, the content of those ideals varies enormously across cultures.

Cultural anthropologist Margaret Mead conducted research on gender in several societies in New Guinea. She
confessed that she had initially assumed that gendered behaviors were grounded in biological differences and
would vary only slightly across cultures. In her 1935 book, Sex and Temperament, she describes her surprise
at discovering three cultural groups with vastly different interpretations of gender. Among the Arapesh and
Mundugumor, men and women were considered temperamentally quite similar, with little acknowledgment of
378  12 · Gender and Sexuality

     emotional or behavioral differences between them. The Arapesh valued cooperation and gentleness, expecting
     everyone to show tolerance and support for younger and weaker members of the group. In contrast, among the
     Mundugumor, both men and women were expected to be competitive, aggressive, and violent. Among the
     Tchambuli (or Chambri), however, men and women were assumed to be temperamentally different: men were
     seen to be neurotic and superficial, while women were thought of as relaxed, happy, and powerful. While
     Mead's dramatic findings have been subject to criticism, subsequent analysis and fieldwork by other
     anthropologists have largely substantiated her main conclusions (Lipset 2003).

     Like race, gender involves the cultural interpretation of biological differences. To make things even more
     complicated, the very process of cultural interpretation alters the way those biological differences are
     perceived and experienced. In other words, gender is based on a complex dynamic of culture and nature.
     Gender identities feel more natural than, say, class or religious identities because they involve direct reference
     to one's body. Most people's bodies feel "natural" to them even with the knowledge that culture shapes the way
     individuals experience their bodies. In this way, gender is not so much natural as it is naturalized, or made to
     seem natural.

     In the past three decades, many gender scholars have argued that gender is not so much a set of naturalized
     categories to which people are assigned as it is a set of cultural identities that people perform in their daily
     lives. In her influential book Gender Trouble (1990), philosopher Judith Butler describes gender as a kind of
     relation between categorical norms and individual performances of those norms. In childhood, people are
     presented with the idealized categories of male and female and taught how to enact the category to which they
     have been assigned. For Butler, gender is "an impersonation" because "becoming gendered involves
     impersonating an ideal that nobody actually inhabits" (1992).

     If gender involves both established categories and everyday performances, then it's necessary to pay close
     attention to the idealized norms of gender constructed in a particular cultural context and the various ways in
     which people enact those norms in practice. In Gender and Sexuality in Muslim Cultures (Ozyegin 2015),
     researchers studying Muslim communities in Turkey, Egypt, Pakistan, Syria, and Iran examine the ideals of
     Muslim masculinity and femininity in those contexts, as well as how those ideals are enacted and resisted in
     everyday life. Salih Can Açiksôz describes how the Turkish government provides disabled veterans with access
     to assisted reproductive technologies so that they can father children. The aim of this program is to make them
     feel like "real men" again, renormalizing their masculinity in the context of heterosexual family life. Maria
     Frederika Malmstroöm shows how Muslim women in Cairo strive to achieve the purity and cleanliness
     associated with femininity through such practices as cooking, skin care, and becoming circumcised. The idea
     is that gender is not at all "natural"; you have to work at it every day and make sure you're doing it right. If you
     cannot seem to approximate your gender norm for some reason, then your family members, friends, and even
     the government may step in to help you perform it.

     Women and Feminist Theories of Gender

     Inspired by the women's movement of the 1960s, many female anthropologists in the early 1970s began taking
     a critical look at mainstream American anthropology, noticing how the discipline focused almost exclusively
     on the activities of men--both as researchers and objects of study. In most early and mid-20th-century
     ethnographies, men were represented as the major social actors, and men's activities were assumed to be the
     most important ones. Where were the women, and what were they doing? Calling for an "anthropology of
     women," many feminist anthropologists set out to correct the ethnographic record by focusing more on the
     voices, perspectives, and practices of women in cultures all over the world.

     Examining the roles of women in many cultures, feminist anthropologists began to see some patterns. In
     contexts where women made strong and direct contributions to subsistence, they seemed to enjoy greater
     social status and equality with men. Among gatherer-hunters, for instance, where women's gathering activities
     provided the majority of calories in the overall diet, women held positions of equality. In contexts where
     women were relegated to the home as housekeepers and mothers, they were more subordinate to men and
     were not considered equal actors in sociocultural activities. Agricultural and industrial societies both created
     "public" spheres of work separate from the "private" sphere of the household. Women in these societies were

In capitalist market systems, the domestic work of housewives is uncompensated and virtually invisible.
Cultural anthropologist Michelle Rosaldo (1974) argued that the division of sociocultural life into public and
private spheres resulted in the marginalization of women.

While this early wave of feminist anthropology focused on women, more recently researchers have questioned
the essentialism of this approach. Is gender always the most important factor in determining the status of
women in all cultures? Gender intersects with race, class, ethnicity, age, sexuality, and physical ability to make
the experiences of women diverse and complex, a position called intersectionality. Due to economic
necessity, women of color in American society have more often been forced to work outside the home. In fact,
many privileged White women have been able to hire domestic workers to relieve them of their household
chores--and often those domestic workers have been women of color. For cooks, nannies, and housekeepers,
the private domestic sphere of privileged women constitutes their own public sphere of work, supervised by
the woman of the house. The experiences of people of color complicate the idea that women are subordinated
through their confinement to the private domestic sphere.

Men and Masculinities

While men had been the primary focus of anthropological research up to the 1970s, they had always been
studied as general representatives of their cultures. The establishment of gender studies in anthropology
prompted both male and female anthropologists to view all persons in a culture through the lens of gender.
That is, men began to be seen as not just "people" but people who are socialized and culturally constructed as
men in their societies (Gutmann 1997). In the 1990s, a wave of scholarship emerged probing the identities of
men and the features of masculinity across cultures.

Cultural anthropologist Stanley Brandes (1980) studied how men in Monteros, an Andalusian town in southern
Spain, used folklore to express their ambivalent feelings of desire and hostility toward women. Through their
jokes, pranks, riddles, wordplay, nicknames, and dramas, men in Monteros built camaraderie and constructed
a male-centered ideology of dominance. A good part of each man's day in Monteros was devoted to telling jokes
and playing pranks among other men. Many jokes expressed fears about the sexual power of women, in
380  12 · Gender and Sexuality

     particular the ability of women to seduce and destroy their male victims. Brandes provides a revealing
     example of one such symbolic joke:

           A woman was walking along the streets of Madrid holding a dog in her arms so that it wouldn't get run
           over. She was beautiful, the woman, and a man walking alongside her said, "If only I were that dog,
           there in your arms!" Responded the woman, "I'm taking him to have him castrated. Want to come
           along?" (1980, 105)

     Research on masculinity demonstrates that "male" is not a stand-alone category but is always held in
     opposition to "female," even when women are not present.

     Other studies of masculinity have focused on the construction of masculinity through initiation rites,
     friendships, marriage, and fatherhood. Studying fatherhood among the Aka of central Africa, Barry Hewlett
     (1991) discovered that fathers in these communities are remarkably affectionate, attentive, and involved in the
     care of their children. Among families with young children, fathers spend 47 percent of their day within arm's
     length of their children and frequently hold and care for them, especially in the evenings. Ethnographic
     research suggests that men are not "naturally" awkward or inept at childcare, nor are they less able to forge
     intimate and emotional bonds with their children. Rather, men are socialized to perform specific versions of
     fatherhood as proof of their masculine identities.

     FIGURE 12.11 A child expresses appreciation for his fathers at the National Equality March in 2009. For many
     men, devoted fatherhood plays an important role in shaping masculinity. (credit: "IMG_0789" by MYD Photos/flickr,

     With the inclusion of masculinity, the anthropological study of gender came to be dominated by the opposed
     categories of male and female. Many studies take it as given that people are assigned at birth to one of these
     two categories and remain in their assigned category for a lifetime. A significant number of people in every
     culture, however, are not obviously male or female at birth, and some people do change their gender identities
     from one category to another--or even to an entirely different gender category that is neither male nor female.

     Intersex and the Ambiguities of Identity

     A friend tells you, "My sister just had a baby last night!" You respond, "Is it a boy or a girl?" Your friend replies,

"Well, they don't know. Maybe neither, maybe both."

Based on a detailed analysis of extensive data, Anne Fausto-Sterling (2000) concluded that in about 1.7
percent of births, a baby's sex cannot be completely determined just by glancing at the baby's genitalia. (Note
that due to different or changing considerations of sex determination, you may see different percentages or
other differences in information; this text is using the most widely accepted and adopted research.) Intersex is
an umbrella term for people who have one or more of a range of variations in sex characteristics or
chromosomal patterns that do not fit the typical conceptions of male or female; the prefix inter- means
"between" and refers here to an apparent biological state "between" male and female. There are many causal
factors that can make a person intersex. Genetically, the baby may have a different number of sex
chromosomes. Rather than two X chromosomes (associated with females) or one X and one Y chromosome
(associated with males), babies are sometimes born with an alternative number of sex chromosomes, such as
XO (only one chromosome) or XXY (three chromosomes). In other cases, hormonal activity or even chance
occurrences in the womb can affect the baby's anatomy.

FIGURE 12.12 Chromosomal compositions associated with sex categories. On the far left, the combination of two
X chromosomes is associated with female sex. On the far right, the combination of one X and one Y chromosome is
associated with male sex. In the center, the most common intersex chromosomal combinations are listed. An
embryo lacking an X chromosome is not viable. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0

While it is true that the majority of humans display biological characteristics associated with either one sex or
another, 1.7 percent is not insignificant. If that percentage were applied to the global total of about 140 million
babies born every year, it would mean that that more than two million of these babies could be intersex. On a
more local level, if that percentage were applied to any town of 300,000 people, there could be more than 5,000
intersex people.

Beyond biology, the category of intersex reveals a great deal about the cultural mechanisms of gender.
Intersexuality can be recognized at any point in a person's life, from infancy to well into adulthood. Parents
often discover their child is intersex in a medical context, such as at birth or during a subsequent visit to the
pediatrician. When a doctor explains that a child is intersex, parents may be confused and concerned. Some
doctors who are uncomfortable with biological sex ambiguity may order tests to determine the child's
chromosomal count and hormone levels and take measurements of the child's genitals. They may urge parents
to assign a specific gender to the baby and commit to plans for hormonal treatments and surgical
interventions to affix that assigned gender to the growing child. Doctors are often taught to present the chosen
gender as the "real" underlying sex of the baby, making medical treatment a process of allowing the baby's
"natural" (meaning unambiguous) sex to emerge. This conceptualization of intersex babies as "really" either
male or female contradicts the complex mix of male and female traits presented by most intersex bodies
(Fausto-Sterling 2000).

Fausto-Sterling disagrees with the practice of immediately affixing a sex to intersex babies through medical
382  12 · Gender and Sexuality

     interventions. She argues that gender identity emerges in a complex interplay between biology and culture
     that cannot be assigned or controlled by doctors or parents. In an interview with the New York Times, she
     explained her position:

           The doctors often guess wrong. They might say, "We think this infant should be a female because the
           sexual organ it has is small." Then, they go and remove the penis and the testes. Years later, the kid
           says, "I'm a boy, and that's what I want to be, and I don't want to take estrogen, and by the way, give me
           back my penis."

           I feel we should let the kids tell us what they think is right once they are old enough to know. Till then,
           parents can talk to the kids in a way that gives them permission to be different, they can give the child
           a gender-neutral name, they can do a provisional gender assignment. (Fausto-Sterling 2001)

     Many intersex people support a ban on what they call intersex genital mutilation, or IGM. In an article for
     HuffPost (https://openstax.org/r/an-article-for-huffpost), Latinx intersex author and activist Hida Viloria
     (2017) calls attention to the hundreds of intersex people who have come forward to say that IGM has harmed
     them. The underlying goal of sexual assignment surgery, Viloria points out, is to create bodies capable of
     heterosexual sex. Medical ethicist Kevin Behrens (2020) argues that surgical interventions should only be
     carried out when surgery serves the best medical interests of the child and, in most cases, medical
     intervention should be delayed until the intersex person is old enough to give informed consent. Behrens also
     emphasizes that parents and children have the right to know the truth about an intersex child's diagnosis and
     the possible consequences of any suggested treatment.

     Intersex ambiguity and the rush to hide or eliminate it reveal important lessons about biology and culture. The
     process of determining what an intersex person was "meant to be" often involves a large set of biological
     variables, many of them subject to change over time. Those factors vary not only for intersex people but for
     everyone. Chromosomes alone do not make females and males. Rather, the interactions of genetic factors with
     hormones and environmental forces produce a complex continuum of gender. Instead of a binary of male and
     female separated by a hard boundary, many gender scholars recognize gender as a multidimensional
     spectrum of differences. There is far more biological variation within the cultural categories of male and
     female than between the two. This is not to deny the existence of biological differences but rather to complicate
     the concepts of sex and gender, allowing for the normalcy of ambiguity and the tolerance of variation.

     Multiple Gender and Variant Gender

     Many societies construct additional categories between male and female to accommodate people who do not
     fit into a binary gender system. The term multiple gender indicates a gender system that goes beyond male
     and female, adding one or more categories of variant gender to accommodate more sex/gender diversity. A
     variant gender is an added version of male or female that accommodates those who were not assigned to that
     category at birth but adopt that identity during the course of their lives. A person whose biology, identity, or
     sexual orientation contradicts their assigned sex/gender role can adopt a variant-gender identity. For instance,
     a person might be considered female at birth but later transition to a masculine version of female--what
     anthropologists term female variant.

     Cultural anthropologist Serena Nanda (2000) has studied variant-gender categories in many societies,
     including Native North American societies and peoples in Brazil, India, Polynesia, Thailand, and the
     Philippines. The widespread practice of multiple gender indicates a common cultural need to accommodate
     the complexities of human sex/gender and sexuality. In contrast, European and Euro-American societies have
     inherited a rigid two-gender system that stigmatizes people who do not conform to the gender identity
     assigned to them at birth. Activists pressing for more gender flexibility can be inspired by examples of
     alternative gender in many non-European cultures.

     When Spanish explorers first came to North America, they were astonished to find men in Native American
     societies who dressed as women, did the work of women, and had sexual relationships with men. Later,
     anthropologists who studied Native American groups discovered that some groups, including the Crow and the
     Navajo, had categories of variant male (assigned a male identity at birth but adopting a feminine identity later
     on) and variant female (assigned female at birth but adopting a masculine identity later on). Note that people

in variant categories did not fully transition to the opposite gender but rather took on a masculine or feminine
variant of the sex assigned at birth. Ignoring the Native American terms for variant gender, early European
explorers referred to variant males as berdache, a Portuguese term that indicated a male prostitute--though
that is not what they were at all. In 1990, as Native American LGBTQ people sought to resurrect their heritage
of variant gender, they coined the pan-Indian term two-spirit people, meaning people with both male and
female spirits.

Two-spirit people were highly valued and esteemed in Native cultures. Rather than facing stigma or rejection,
their alternate gender identity was thought to give them special talents and spiritual powers. In many Native
American societies, two-spirit people often became healers and spiritual leaders. They were typically very
successful at performing the work of the opposite gender. Male-variant people were known for their excellent
cooking and needlework, and many female-variant people were great hunters and warriors. Two-spirit people
were also called upon to act as intermediaries between genders, such as in marriage arrangements.

Like gender-nonconforming people in many societies, two-spirit people began to realize their variant
identities in childhood, rejecting the activities associated with their assigned gender. A boy might want to cook
or weave, or a girl might prefer to hunt and play with the boys. If there were not enough boys to hunt, a family
might even encourage a girl to develop a variant identity so that she could help provide meat to the family.
Sometimes, children would experience visions or dreams guiding them to the tools associated with the
opposite gender.

Generally speaking, people of variant gender had sexual relationships with people of the gender opposite their
lived identity. So if a person took on the clothing and work of a woman, they would be expected to have
intimate relationships with men, and people who lived as men would have relationships with women. Neither
two-spirit people nor their opposite-gender partners were considered lesbian or gay.

With European colonization of North America came a much more restrictive system of gender categories and
sexualities. As Euro-Americans expanded into Native American territories, Native Americans were pressured
to assimilate to Euro-American norms. From 1860 to 1978, children were removed from their families and
sent to assimilationist schools, where they were taught that Native cultures were backward and variant
genders were sinful and deviant. By the 1930s, variant-gender practices had largely disappeared. However,
with the rise of the American LGBTQ movement, many Native Americans have rediscovered the more flexible
and tolerant gender system of their ancestors.

12.3 The Power of Gender: Patriarchy and Matriarchy

LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Explain the concept of gender ideology and identify two such ideologies.
  · Discuss how patriarchy is embedded in practices and institutions.
  · Suggest reasons for the absence of matriarchy.
  · Give two examples that complicate views of patriarchal dominance.

In cultural constructions of gender, two or more genders are defined in an overall system that assigns various
forms of behavior and activity to different categories or gendered realms of society. Some of those activities are
considered more important than others, and some of those behaviors are more authoritative and dominant.
Gender is not only a system of differences between the realms of female and male but also a system of power
between those two realms.

Patriarchy: Ideology and Practice

The author of this chapter, Jennifer Hasty, reflects on what she learned about gender ideology while working as
wedding videographer:

     As a side gig to my anthropology job, I ran my own business as a wedding videographer in the
     Philadelphia metropolitan area from 2010 to 2017. While the whole venture was driven by economic
     necessity (I was teaching part-time), the wedding industry turned out to be a fascinating vantage point
384  12 · Gender and Sexuality

     from which to view gender relations in American society. Most weddings were meticulously planned
     by the bride, with the groom deferring to her wishes or staying out of the whole process. Brides who
     were attracted to my artsy, minimalist film aesthetic tended to be middle-class professionals, college
     graduates heading into careers in education, finance, law, or medicine. Many of these weddings were
     grand potlatches of middle-class style and markers of identity.

     Though my brides were well-educated women with professional jobs, when it came to planning their
     "special day," nearly all of them reverted to traditions infused with old-fashioned gender roles. Nearly
     all of them wore a long, white wedding dress, a symbol of virginal purity, although many of them had
     been cohabiting with their grooms (and some already had children with them).

           FIGURE 12.13 A bride being escorted by her father to her wedding ceremony. Weddings reveal a lot about
           a culture's gender ideology. (credit: "Father of the Bride" by stevebrownd50/flickr, CC BY 2.0)

          Nearly all of them insisted on being "given away" by their fathers, even when those fathers had been
          largely absent for some part of their childhood due to divorce. This notion of being a gift, given away to
          the groom, was so powerful that one bride, whose father was not there, declared in her personal vows,
          "I give myself in marriage to you." Grooms and their families did not use this language of human gift
          giving.

     The notion that a woman is passed from the paternalistic domain of her father into the care and supervision of
     her groom reflects a larger gender ideology about the relations between men and women in family life. A
     gender ideology is a coordinated set of ideas about gender categories, relations, behaviors, norms, and ideals.
     These ideas are embedded in the institutions of the family, the economy, politics, religion, and other
     sociocultural spheres. As with racial and class ideologies, people often challenge the explicit terms of a gender
     ideology while actively participating in the institutionalized forms associated with it. Though women have
     made great strides in American public life in past decades, in their weddings, they still enact a gender ideology
     that positions them as dependent objects passed between men in the transaction of marriage. The power of
     gender ideology is that it most frequently operates below the level of consciousness. As you will recall from
     previous discussions of the term, an ideology that becomes naturalized as "common sense" becomes
     hegemonic.

Patriarchy is a widespread gender ideology that positions men as rulers of private and public life. Within the
household, the eldest male is recognized as head of the family, organizing the activities of dependent women
and children and governing their behavior. Family resources such as money and land are controlled by senior
men. Men make decisions; women acquiesce. Beyond the family, men are accorded positions of leadership
throughout society, and women are summoned to play a supportive and enabling role as marginalized
subordinates.

Contemporary forms of patriarchy in American and European contexts are linked to the European
development of capitalism in the 1600s. As economic activities moved out of households and into factories and
offices, the household came to be defined as a private sphere, while the world of economic and political
activities came to be called the public sphere. Women were assigned to the private sphere of family life, where
they were expected to carry out nurturing roles as wives and mothers. Men not only governed the private
sphere but also participated in the competitive and sometimes dangerous public sphere.

Different forms of patriarchy have emerged throughout the world. In India, the development of agriculture and
the rise of the state resulted in the increasing subordination of women in patriarchal social institutions
(Bonvillain 1995). Patriarchal ideology and social structure date back to the Vedic period (1500-800 BCE). In
the Vedic communities of ancient India, men dominated economic and political life, and women were mostly
excluded from these spheres. However, women could exercise some forms of authority as mothers in their
households. Girl children, though not preferred, were generally treated well. Girls and boys both were
educated and participated in religious activities. Female chastity and fidelity were highly valued, but women
could engage in premarital sex without being shunned, and wives could divorce their husbands. Legally,
however, daughters and wives were dependent on the men in their lives, who could make decisions on their
behalf. A woman was not permitted to inherit property unless she was the only child. In the post-Vedic period,
patriarchy was strengthened with the systematic codification of Hindu law. Patriarchy grew even more
domineering, with the cultural spread of child marriage, wife-beating, female infanticide, and the
disfigurement and ritual death of widows. When India came under Muslim rule in the 12th century, Islamic
customs for veiling and secluding women further marginalized women in Hindu and Muslim communities
alike.

Though contemporary India is a country of ethnic and religious diversity, patriarchy has become a dominant
organizational force throughout Indian society. In rural areas, people often live in large extended family
households structured by patrilineal descent. These families consist of a married couple, their sons and sons'
families, and their unmarried daughters. Men are recognized as heads of their households, exercising
authority over their wives and children. The division of labor assigns men to work as farmers and traders,
providing food to the family. Women mainly work in the home but sometimes also help out with agricultural
chores such as weeding and harvesting.

In the 19th century, a reform movement called for the elimination of many patriarchal customs such as child
marriage and sati (the ritual death of widows). Reformers, most of them elite men and women, encouraged the
education of girl children and the legalization of inheritance for women. In response, sati became outlawed,
widows were allowed to remarry, the marriage age was fixed at 12, and women were permitted to divorce,
inherit, and own property. In the latter part of the 20th century, the Indian state passed laws to enhance
women's equality in many areas, including education, inheritance, and employment. Urban women in middle-
and upper-class families have benefited from these reforms. However, in rural areas, many of the patriarchal
customs outlawed by the state continue to be practiced.

Matriarchy: Ideology and (Not) Practice

As the term suggests, matriarchy means rule by senior women. In a matriarchal society, women would
exercise authority throughout social life and control power and wealth. Like patriarchy, matriarchy is a gender
ideology. Unlike patriarchy, however, matriarchy is not embedded in structures and institutions in any culture
in the contemporary world. That is to say, it's just an ideology--not a dominant one, and certainly not
hegemonic.

While societies with patrilineal kinship systems are strongly patriarchal, societies with matrilineal kinship
systems are not matriarchal. This is a common source of confusion. In matrilineal kinship systems, children
386  12 · Gender and Sexuality

     primarily belong to their mother's kin group, and inheritance passes through the maternal line. However, even
     in matrilineal societies, leadership is exercised by the senior men of the family. Instead of a woman's husband,
     it is her brother or mother's brother (her maternal uncle) who makes decisions about family resources and
     disciplines the behavior of family members. Scholars who theorize the existence of ancient matriarchies
     suggest that those societies were not only matrilineal but also dominated by the leadership of women as well as
     the values of fertility and motherhood.

     Nineteenth-century social evolutionists such as Friedrich Engels and J.J. Bachofen postulated that matriarchy
     was the original form of human social organization, later replaced by patriarchy in societies all over the world.
     This notion was revived by feminist scholars in the 1970s, such as archaeologist Marija Gimbutas (1991), who
     postulated that the original matriarchal societies of the European Neolithic were overthrown in the Bronze Age
     by patriarchal invaders on horseback. Gimbutas argued that the Neolithic communities of Europe were
     peaceful, egalitarian, and gynocentric, or woman-centered. They worshipped a mother goddess associated
     with the fertility of women and the earth. High priestesses of this fertility cult were the primary leaders,
     supported by their brothers and a council of women. Warfare was unknown. Then, waves of Indo-European
     pastoralists swept across Europe on horseback, conquering the original matriarchal Europeans and
     establishing their violent, patriarchal order with its worship of male gods and veneration of warfare.

     FIGURE 12.14 The Venus of Willendorf statue, found in southern Austria, is presumed to be about 25,000 years
     old. Some archaeologists speculate that this statue and the many others like it from Paleolithic Europe are symbols
     of a fertility cult or mother goddess. (credit: "A Female Paleolithic Figurine, Venus of Willendorf" by Wellcome
     Collection, CC BY 4.0)

     Many archaeologists disagree with Gimbutas's interpretations of the archaeological record and her refusal to
     consider alternative and more mainstream interpretations of the same evidence by other archaeologists.
     Feminist archaeologist Ruth Tringham remarked that Gimbutas had "mystified the process of interpretation
     and presented her own conclusions as objective fact" (1993, 197). While Gimbutas's work on European
     matriarchy is criticized by scholarly archaeology, her ideas have been embraced and popularized by New Age
     feminists.

     Where are the matriarchies? Why is patriarchy so prevalent while matriarchy is nonexistent? Nobody really
     knows the answers to these questions. Some anthropologists think that pregnancy and childcare marginalized
     women, while men were freer to participate in cultural practices, technologies, and institutions. Others suggest
     that women's reproductive power posed a threat to men. Patriarchy may have been developed as a system of
     subordination and control over the acknowledged power of women.

     In the search for matriarchy, it could be that feminists are looking for the wrong thing. While anthropologists
     have not found societies in which women dominate and control men, there are plenty of cultural examples in

which women and men enjoy relative equality and freedom from sexual oppression and control.

Gender and Power in Everyday Life

Contemporary anthropologists who study gender pay little attention to hypothetical debates about the origins
of patriarchy or the possible existence of ancient matriarchy. Rather, cultural anthropologists are interested in
how people interact with the cultural norms and systematized practices of gender in their societies. Gender is
diffused throughout culture, embedded in systems of kinship, modes of subsistence, political leadership and
participation, law, religion, and medicine. Anthropologists study how people move through these gendered
realms in their everyday lives. They explore how identities and possibilities are shaped by the structures of
gender as well as how people struggle against and sometimes transform gendered expectations.

Cultural anthropologists who study women in patriarchal cultures highlight the diversity of women's
experiences and their various techniques of asserting their interests in difficult circumstances. In her study of
the problem of fistula among women in Niger, Allison Heller (2019) explores how women navigate gendered
realms as they cope with a debilitating reproductive problem. Obstetric fistula is a complication of childbirth
in which tissues separating the bladder from the vagina are ruptured, often resulting in chronic incontinence
(uncontrolled urination). Often the result of prolonged or obstructed labor, fistula disproportionately affects
women in rural and poor communities, who frequently give birth without professional medical assistance. The
incontinence, pain, and reproductive complications of fistula stigmatize many of the women who have this
condition. A host of global aid and relief agencies depict such women as victims of fistula, rejected by their
husbands and ostracized by their communities.

Heller's ethnography complicates this simplistic picture. In her interviews with women affected by fistula,
Heller discovered that family structures and relationships profoundly shape women's experiences of fistula
and the treatments available to them. In social and medical crisis, these women turn to their mothers for
support and advocacy. Mothers may insist that their daughters be brought to the hospital in cases of
complicated labor, thereby preventing or mitigating the severity of fistula. Mothers may also act as
intermediaries between women and their relatives and neighbors, working to reduce the stigma of fistula and
promote sympathy and acceptance.

Heller also found that marriage conditioned a woman's experience of fistula. Whether her marriage was
arranged or a marriage "for love," a woman whose family supported her marriage was more likely to receive
extended family support. Women who had strong relationships with their husbands were far less likely to be
rejected by them after developing fistula.

Heller also followed women into the specialized clinics devoted to fistula care and surgical remediation. In
what seems like a very unfair process, women with mild fistula are often the first to receive surgery, due to the
increased likelihood of positive outcomes. Women with severe fistula may wait for months for their first
surgery and then undergo several often-unsuccessful surgeries. The longer the women waited, the more likely
their support networks were to wear thin or break down.

Contemporary anthropologists of gender study women's experiences of migration, genocide, religious practice,
and media, among many other topics. As mentioned earlier, a growing number of studies also focus on the
social construction of masculinity, exploring how men interact with the gendered expectations of their
sociocultural contexts.

It is tempting to assume that men uniformly benefit from systems of male privilege, with particular benefits
accruing to elite men. Researchers who study masculinity in cross-cultural settings have complicated this
view. Cultural anthropologist Daniel Jordan Smith studied the challenges of enacting masculinity in Igbo
communities of southeast Nigeria. In his book, provocatively titled To Be a Man Is Not a One-Day Job (2017),
Smith demonstrates how gender is not simply ascribed at birth but presented as a lifelong project that men
must constantly work to achieve. The struggle for masculine identity begins in childhood and intensifies in
secondary school as boys learn "to love women and money" (2017, 30). As rural boys are often sent to towns
and cities for schooling, the transition from boyhood to manhood frequently involves mastering strategies of
urban survival, such as finding ways of making money to pay for consumer items that boost their prestige
among peers and enable their romantic relationships. After schooling, a young man is expected to marry and
388  12 · Gender and Sexuality

     become a father as well as fulfill his role in larger extended family structures. In his senior years, a man is
     expected to bury his own father with a spectacular funeral. Men learn these roles largely through their
     relationships with other men who counsel them as friends and mentors.

     Central to the achievement of Nigerian manhood is money. The central markers of adult manhood all require
     substantial resources. Without money, a man cannot pay bride wealth to marry or provide for his children. In
     adulthood, men are expected to accumulate wealth through successful careers and business activities and
     then use their resources to support their families as well as expanding networks of dependents. Elite men who
     achieve these milestones later struggle to build and maintain impressive family houses, send their dependents
     to expensive schools, clothe their wives in fine fashions, and sponsor lavish weddings and funerals.

     As these examples illustrate, the cultural anthropology of gender considers the situations people face as
     gendered persons and how they draw from available resources and relationships to fulfill their roles and
     sometimes challenge gendered expectations.

     12.4 Sexuality and Queer Anthropology

     LEARNING OUTCOMES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       · Explain how sexuality is threaded through the life cycle and various realms of culture.
       · Describe the prevalence of same-sex relationships in heteronormative societies.
       · Define the concept and practices related to ritualized sexuality.
       · Give two examples of transgender roles in heteronormative contexts.

     Intersecting with gender, the anthropological study of sexuality explores the diversity of meanings, practices,
     relationships, and experiences associated with erotic interactions. Since the 1980s, the study of sexuality in
     anthropology has burgeoned into the dynamic subfield of queer anthropology. Anthropologists working in
     this subfield focus on areas of sociocultural activity distinguished from the presumed norms of
     heterosexuality and binary gender identities (Howe 2015).

     Early Anthropological Studies of Sexuality

     Cultural anthropologists have long been fascinated with sexuality. In his ethnography of sexual practices
     among the Trobrianders, Bronislaw Malinowski (1929) identifies sexuality as a central concern threaded
     throughout the sociocultural realms of everyday life. Of central importance to marriage, kinship, and gender
     relations, sexuality also pervades art, religion, medicine, economics, and even politics in Trobriand culture.
     Malinowski charts the sexual life stages of Trobrianders, starting with sexualized games in childhood and
     continuing with adolescent crushes and expeditions by groups of teenage boys or girls to nearby villages in
     search of amorous adventures. He describes the selection of marriage partners and the frequency of
     extramarital sexual relations among men. Throughout his analysis, Malinowski emphasizes that all societies
     must regulate the primal sexual impulse. In this functional view, sexual norms and rules function to maintain
     order and protect the institutions of marriage and kinship.

     Like Malinowski (and writing in the same time period), Margaret Mead plots the sexual life stages of women
     and men in Samoan culture in her most famous book, Coming of Age in Samoa (1928). Unlike Malinowski,
     however, she emphasizes differences between the processes of sexual socialization in Samoa and the United
     States. Focusing on girls and women, Mead argues that Samoan culture had a more relaxed and open attitude
     toward sexuality. Throughout childhood, girls often witnessed the bodily realities of childbirth, menstruation,
     copulation, and death. In adolescence, both boys and girls were expected to experiment with romantic and
     sexual relationships. Free from the repression and strict sexual discipline of Euro-American culture, Samoans
     experienced adolescence as not a time of crisis but rather a golden era of freedom and adventure.

Shaped by the feminist movement, more contemporary approaches to gender roles and sexuality highlight
structures of power in erotic relations between women and men. Over the past few decades, many Americans
have become increasingly concerned about the prevalence of sexual assault on college campuses. Forms of
sexual intimidation and violence can happen in many campus contexts, including offices and classrooms as
well as student events and parties. An online survey conducted by researchers at the University of Oregon
found that students in Greek life (fraternities and sororities) experience nonconsensual sexual contact more
than three times as often as other students (Barnes et al. 2021). Anthropologist Peggy Reeves Sanday (1990)
conducted ethnographic research on fraternity culture, focusing on how some young men in American
fraternities engage in violent assault and criminal coercion against young women. Sanday describes how
fraternity men used their privileged access to alcohol and party venues to lure insecure young women to
parties where they were plied with alcohol, sometimes drugged, and then sexually assaulted by one or more
fraternity members. Sanday argues that fraternity culture is often permeated with forms of verbal and physical
aggression against women. Not confined to fraternities, the problem of sexual assault on campuses across the
United States has prompted many universities to develop consent awareness training sessions, sexual assault
response teams, and survivor support programs.

Same-Sex and Queer Studies

Though they may be provocative and enlightening, anthropological studies of heterosexuality are still focused
on mainstream gender categories and norms. Even more challenging to traditional Western sensibilities are
studies, first emerging in the 1970s and 1980s, that demonstrate the prevalence of same-sex erotic
interactions in cultures all over the world.

A contemporary of Malinowski and Mead, renowned British anthropologist E. E. Evans-Pritchard spent his
early career studying social organization and witchcraft among two different African groups, the Azande and
the Nuer. Later in his career, Evans-Pritchard began thinking about the many stories he had heard in the
course of his years studying African societies, particularly stories describing the prevalence of same-sex erotic
practices in Zande society in precolonial times. In an article on the topic, he describes how unmarried adult
warrior men, unable to marry due to the scarcity of marriageable women and forbidden to engage in adultery
with other men's wives, often took younger men as sexual partners or "wives" (1970). The warrior paid bride
wealth to the parents of the younger man and performed services to the young man's family just as he would
have to the natal family of a female wife. The partners took on the roles of husband and wife, and the younger
men referred to themselves as women. As the Azande did not approve of anal sex, male partners had sex
"between the thighs"--that is, the older man penetrating between the thigh gap of the younger one.
390  12 · Gender and Sexuality

     Like the men, Zande women also commonly engaged in same-sex practices and relationships. In Zande
     culture, men were permitted to have more than one wife (a form of marriage called polygyny, as you will recall
     from Forming Family through Kinship). A husband took turns sleeping with each of his wives. In a family of
     several wives, then, a woman would wind up sleeping alone many nights. If she had married a royal husband
     with several hundred wives, she might have sex with her husband only a few times in her entire married life.
     Zande men and women told Evans-Pritchard that lonely wives would often get together at night, cut a sweet
     potato or manioc root into the shape of a penis, and tie it around the waist of one of the women. With this
     vegetable phallus, they took turns penetrating each other. Women could also formalize a "love-friend"
     relationship in public, widely considered by Zande men to be a cover for same-sex relations. Unlike male-male
     relationships, however, women's same-sex erotic practices were discouraged.

     Sexual practices between senior and junior men have been found in many cultures, sparking controversies
     over questions of consent and child abuse. Studying a New Guinea group he called the "Sambia" (a
     pseudonym), anthropologist Gilbert Herdt (1984) described initiation rituals in which teenage boys were
     expected to fellate older male mentors in order to absorb the male essence that would make them into fully
     socialized men. Herdt termed this practice "ritualized homosexuality," though some have argued with the
     application of Western categories of sexuality to describe such symbolically complex ritual practices.

     While some same-sex practices are ritualized, others are more informal and less public. Some cultures
     construct same-sex practices as a phase associated with adolescent experimentation and tutelage. As in many
     parts of contemporary Africa, girls in boarding schools in Ghana are known to experiment with same-sex
     relationships. In Ghana, it's called supi (possibly short for supervisor or superintendent). In boarding high
     schools, a senior girl might take a junior girl as a special friend (Dankwa 2009; Gyasi-Gyamera and Søgaard
     2020). Some of these bonds are fairly casual. The junior girl runs errands for the senior girl, such as fetching
     water or food. The senior girl provides protection and help to the junior girl (such schools could be full of
     difficulties, including supply shortages and bullying). Some supi relationships can become emotionally and
     physically intense. The two girls often exchange gifts, write each other love letters, and fondle and caress one
     another. They might shower together or share a bed. Supi is not limited to a special category of girls (i.e.,
     identified lesbians) but has been widespread among schoolgirls, nearly all of whom eventually marry men and
     fulfill their conventional roles as wives and mothers.

     In the past two decades, evangelical Christianity in Ghana has branded same-sex relationships as evils to be
     rooted out through ceremonies resembling exorcism. While supi is an ambiguous practice, sometimes
     involving sexuality and sometimes not, it has been stigmatized by evangelicals in Ghana. Christian journalists
     have written stories about wealthy women who snatch away young wives, referring to lesbian relationships as
     supi-supi. Lurid popular films such as Women in Love (1996) and Supi: The Real Woman to Woman (1996)
     both sensationalize and condemn women's same-sex practices, associating them with a secret cult of mermaid
     worship called Mami Wata.

     Many anthropological studies describe same-sex practices in societies that otherwise strongly value
     heterosexual marriage and fertility. In such contexts, sexuality is not so much an identity as it is a ritual, life
     stage, coping technique, or form of pleasure. Though sometimes shielded from public view, same-sex relations
     are seen as complementary to heterosexual relations in some cultural contexts, fully compatible with
     conventional demands for heterosexual marriage and family life. In his research on gender and sexuality in
     Nicaragua, for instance, Roger Lancaster (1992) found that conventionally masculine men could maintain their
     essentially heterosexual identities if they took the "active," penetrative role in same-sex encounters.

     With the progress of the LGBTQIA+ movement originating in the United States and western Europe, people
     around the world who engage in same-sex and transgender practices have formed public identities and
     communities, calling for the acceptance and legal recognition of their relationships. Rather than indulging in
     same-sex pleasures as a substitute for "the real thing" or as something done "on the side," American gay and
     lesbian communities recast their own practices as "the real thing," a set of practices and relationships central
     to their whole way of life. This assertion has profound implications for notions of family and community. If
     heterosexual marriage and reproduction form the foundation of kinship systems based on the idea of
     biological descent, then same-sex relationships suggest new forms of kinship based on networks and shared
     values. In Families We Choose (1991), anthropologist Kath Weston explores how lesbian and gay families in the

        PROFILES IN ANTHROPOLOGY

Esther Newton, 1940-

Personal History: Esther Newton (https://openstax.org/r/esther-newton) was born the child of an unmarried
Protestant mother and an absent Jewish father. After she was born, she and her mother were ostracized from
her mother's genteel upper-class family. Her mother later remarried. Growing up in the gender-rigid,
heteronormative 1940s and 1950s, Esther flouted gender norms at an early age, becoming "an anti-girl, a girl
refusenik" (Newton 2018, 60). She was bullied for her unconventional dress and behavior. As a young woman,
she wore men's clothes, smoked Lucky Strike cigarettes, and dated hyperfeminine lesbian women. Thus,
before she even came out as a lesbian, Newton self-consciously constructed her "butch" identity--"the first
identity that had ever made sense out of my body's situation, the first rendition of gender that ever rang true,
the first look I could ever pull together" (92).

For her undergraduate studies, Newton attended the University of Michigan, where she earned her BA with
distinction in history. In Margaret Mead Made Me Gay (2000), Newton describes her reaction to reading the
work of anthropologist Margaret Mead as a college student. Mead's relativistic portrayal of the flexibility of
gender categories gave Newton consolation and ignited her interest in anthropology. She went to the
University of Chicago to study anthropology at the graduate level with kinship scholar David Schneider.

Area of Anthropology: For her dissertation, Newton conducted fieldwork among men who dressed as women
in the American Midwest. Entitled "The `Drag Queens': A Study in Urban Anthropology" (1968), this
pathbreaking work described the experiences, challenges, and culture of gender-nonconforming American
men in a variety of theatrical and everyday settings. Her research on this topic was later published in her book
Mother Camp: Female Impersonators in America (1972), the first major anthropological study of a gay or
lesbian community in the United States. In spite of its initially lukewarm reception, the book has since become
a classic in LGBTQIA+ studies.

Accomplishments in the Field: Hired in 1971, Newton was a founding faculty member of the State University
392  12 · Gender and Sexuality

     of New York at Purchase, also known as Purchase College. She helped establish the disciplines of anthropology,
     women's studies, and gay/lesbian studies there. Newton taught at Purchase until 2006 and is now a professor
     emerita.

     Importance of Her Work: In her memoir, My Butch Career (https://openstax.org/r/my-butch-career) (2018),
     Newton tells the story of the first half of her life, highlighting the challenges facing her generation of middle-
     class lesbians. She describes the difficulties of pursuing higher education and building a professional career,
     including the impossibility of coming out even as she studied and wrote about lesbian, gay, and gender-
     nonconforming communities in American society in the 1960s.

     Esther Newton's work has been translated into French, Spanish, Hebrew, Polish, and Slovak. She is the subject
     of the documentary film Esther Newton Made Me Gay, currently in production, which has a trailer available to
     view (https://openstax.org/r/esther-newton-trailer). In an interview, Newton commented, "It's been fun being a
     film star" (2019).

     Transgender Studies

     Evans-Pritchard's research on male-male marriage among the precolonial Azande provided an example of
     young men who were socially constructed as women through their wifely role in these marriages. Across the
     continent, in West Africa, women in precolonial Igbo society could be ritually transformed into men and then
     engage in female-female marriages as husbands. In Male Daughters and Female Husbands (1987), Ifi
     Amadiume describes how a father with no sons could make his eldest daughter into an honorary "son" who
     could inherit and carry on the patrilineage. This woman became a "male daughter." If she were married, she
     would return to her natal compound to undergo a ceremony that transferred her into the social category of
     male. She would then wear men's clothes, live in the male section of the compound, perform men's work rather
     than women's, and participate in community life as a man. She could marry women who then became her
     wives (thus becoming a "female husband"). Those wives would have discreet liaisons with men in the area in
     order to bear children, who would belong to the lineage of the female husband.

     It was also possible for Igbo women who became wealthy and powerful in their communities to take a title
     through ritual means that allowed them to take wives of their own, just as male daughters could. Even if she
     were married herself, a powerful woman could have wives to do most or all of her domestic work. Did these
     powerful women have sexual relations with their wives? Anthropologists just don't know. Amadiume describes
     women joking about sex between women in such marriages, but nobody knows how common it might have
     been.

     Building on this earlier research, a fresh area of inquiry has developed in anthropology centered on the
     experiences, identities, and practices of transgender and gender-nonbinary persons and communities.
     Transgender describes a person who transitions from a gender category ascribed at birth to a chosen gender
     identity. Gender nonbinary describes a person who rejects strict male and female gender categories in favor
     of a more flexible and contextual expression of gender. Cultural anthropologists have described a great
     diversity in the expression of trans identities, pointing to the prevalence of transgender practices the world
     over.

     Taking an innovative approach, anthropologist Marcia Ochoa (2014) devised a research project on
     "spectacular femininity" in Venezuela by examining two communities: female beauty pageant contestants and
     transgender sex workers who also hold beauty pageants. Ochoa traces the emergence of the beauty pageant in
     Venezuela and identifies this ritual competition as a carrier of notions of modernity and nationhood. She
     explores the competition of young women, or misses, in the Miss Venezuela pageant as well as the local and
     regional beauty pageants for transformistas, gay Venezuelans who identify as women. The stylized
     performances of transformistas carry over into their displays on Avenida Libertador in central Caracas, the
     neighborhood where they conduct their trade as sex workers. In order to compete in these realms of
     spectacular femininity, both misses and transformistas undergo painful surgical procedures to make their
     bodies conform to an exaggerated ideal of Eurocentric femininity.

Ochoa's work is pathbreaking in its ability to bring together concepts often explored separately or held in
opposition: heterosexuality and non-heterosexuality, gender and sexuality, and cis and trans identities
(cisgender describes gender identity constructed on the sex assigned at birth). By juxtaposing misses and
transformistas, she shows how these seemingly disparate concepts are threaded together in the complex web
of Venezuelan culture.

The End of Gender?

In cultures that are strongly heteronormative with rigid two-gender systems, some people feel restricted in
their gender identities and sexual practices. In many countries, efforts to create more flexibility in the
expression of gender and sexuality have focused on gaining equal rights for and combating discrimination
against women and LGBTQIA+ persons. In the past 50 years, this social movement has achieved great strides
at national and global levels. In 2011, the United Nations Human Rights Council passed a resolution
recognizing LGBTQIA+ rights. The United Nations subsequently urged all countries to pass laws to protect
LGBTQIA+ persons from discrimination, hate crimes, and the criminalization of non-heterosexuality. Same-
sex marriage has now been legalized in 29 countries, including the United States, Canada, Mexico, Taiwan, and
most of western Europe. In many countries, however, same-sex acts and gender nonconformity are still
criminalized, sometimes punishable by death.

Where progress has been made on human rights for LGBTQIA+ persons, these changes have made life much
easier for many people, allowing them to feel secure in their families, their jobs, and their public lives. Some
activists are concerned that such legal reforms do not go far enough, however. Gender and sexuality are not
just legal issues; they are cultural issues as well. The strict heterosexual two-gender scheme common to
European and American cultures is a system infused with patriarchal values, expressed in patriarchal
practices and institutions. That is to say, inequality is built into the heteronormative system of gender. In order
to achieve true freedom and full equality, is it necessary to get rid of categories of gender and sexuality
altogether? Are gender categories inherently oppressive?

Some people think so, arguing that society should transition to more gender-blind forms of language and
social relations. In the United States, a movement is underway to neutralize gender in everyday language.
Whereas masculine pronouns (he/him) were previously the default way of referring to hypothetical persons or
situations where gender is not specified, followed by a movement toward specifying both masculine and
feminine pronouns (he or she/him or her), new conventions call for the use of third-person plural forms (they/
them) as singular pronouns instead, particularly to include people who identify as neither man nor woman.
394  12 · Gender and Sexuality

     For example, instead of saying, "Every person should wash his hands" or "Every person should wash his or her
     hands," one might say, "Every person should wash their hands." (Notably, this is already an accepted feature of
     everyday English that people commonly use without thinking about; if a housemate tells you, "Someone left a
     message for you," you're more likely to respond with "What did they want?" than with "What did he want?" or
     "What did he or she want?") Moreover, a convention is evolving that allows people to specify the pronouns they
     would prefer, either gendered (she/her, he/him) or neutral (they/them, other).

     Will changes in pronoun usage bring about greater freedom and equality in patriarchal societies? Maybe. Many
     languages have gender-free pronouns, such as Twi, a West African language of the Akan peoples in central
     Ghana. However, though matrilineal, the Akans are also patriarchal. And gender is a very fundamental aspect
     of identity in Akan societies, structuring norms of dress, language, behavior, and relationships throughout a
     person's life. In other words, pronouns do not bear much relationship to the organization of gender in culture
     and social institutions. In the United States, the English language pronoun system might change to be gender
     neutral, but women and LGBTQIA+ people will still inhabit those cultural categories. Those categories will not
     just disappear.

     Previous discussions of racial categories have addressed the fact that race is not a set of biological categories
     objectively found in nature. Rather, race, like gender, is socioculturally constructed. Even so, it is naive to
     pretend that race does not exist as a social reality that structures inequality in many societies. As discussed in,
     Social Inequalities, when people try to be "color blind," they ignore the sociocultural reality of race and make it
     more difficult to recognize and remediate racial inequalities. Similarly, the fact that gender is a social
     construct does not mean that people can easily transition to a gender-blind society. Scholars of gender and
     sexuality argue that American society still grants forms of authority and privilege to heterosexual men through
     the cultural norms pervading public and private life. Asserting a "gender blind" perspective may obscure
     forms of inequality and violence that operate through gender and sexuality. Race and gender are both powerful
     sociocultural categories embedded in social practices and institutions. Anthropology encourages recognition
     of the diversity and complexity of those constructed categories alongside acknowledgment of the real histories
     of marginalization and struggle. Perhaps changes in pronoun use are just the beginning of more far-reaching
     changes to come.

             MINI-FIELDWORK ACTIVITY

     Self-Reflection

     Consider your own body. What do you do to your body on a daily or weekly basis? Why? For two
     nonconsecutive days, make careful note of all of the routine practices devoted to your body (including hygiene,
     dress, exercise, etc.). Are these practices shaped by notions of gender? Of sex or sexuality? Do these practices
     shape the way you think of your body as gendered? Do they influence the way you present yourself in social
     situations? Do you think they influence the way others interact with you? Consider how other people respond
     to and interact with your body (or refuse to interact with it). How are these interactions shaped by cultural
     notions of gender and sexuality? Are there notions of power embedded in these bodily practices? Patriarchy?
     Feminism? Heteronormativity?

INTRODUCTION Religion is one of the most complex and pervasive of all sociocultural institutions. It is also
universal. All cultures and societies across time have had beliefs and worldviews that can be classified as
religious in nature, even within political institutions that are areligious or avow atheism. Innovative research
also indicates that primates, most especially the human species, have evolved physically, socially, and
emotionally toward a sense of spirituality and religiosity (see King 2007).

     13.1 What Is Religion?

     LEARNING OUTCOMES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       · Distinguish between religion, spirituality, and worldview.
       · Describe the connections between witchcraft, sorcery, and magic.
       · Identify differences between deities and spirits.
       · Identify shamanism.
       · Describe the institutionalization of religion in state societies.

     Defining Religion, Spirituality, and Worldview

     An anthropological inquiry into religion can easily become muddled and hazy because religion encompasses
     intangible things such as values, ideas, beliefs, and norms. It can be helpful to establish some shared
     signposts. Two researchers whose work has focused on religion offer definitions that point to diverse poles of
     thought about the subject. Frequently, anthropologists bookend their understanding of religion by citing these
     well-known definitions.

     French sociologist Émile Durkheim (1858-1917) utilized an anthropological approach to religion in his study
     of totemism among Indigenous Australian peoples in the early 20th century. In his work The Elementary
     Forms of the Religious Life (1915), he argues that social scientists should begin with what he calls "simple
     religions" in their attempts to understand the structure and function of belief systems in general. His
     definition of religion takes an empirical approach and identifies key elements of a religion: "A religion is a
     unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, that is to say, things set apart and
     forbidden--beliefs and practices which unite into one single moral community called a Church, all those who
     adhere to them" (47). This definition breaks down religion into the components of beliefs, practices, and a
     social organization--what a shared group of people believe and do.

     includes a great variety of human constructs and experiences. (credit: "Easter Sunrise Service 2017" by James S.

     The other signpost used within anthropology to make sense of religion was crafted by American anthropologist
     Clifford Geertz (1926-2006) in his work The Interpretation of Cultures (1973). Geertz's definition takes a very
     different approach: "A religion is: (1) a system of symbols which acts to (2) establish powerful, pervasive, and
     long-lasting moods and motivations in men by (3) formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and
     (4) clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that (5) the moods and motivations seem
     uniquely realistic" (90). Geertz's definition, which is complex and holistic and addresses intangibles such as
     emotions and feelings, presents religion as a different paradigm, or overall model, for how we see systems of

belief. Geertz views religion as an impetus to view and act upon the world in a certain manner. While still
acknowledging that religion is a shared endeavor, Geertz focuses on religion's role as a potent cultural symbol.
Elusive, ambiguous, and hard to define, religion in Geertz's conception is primarily a feeling that motivates and
unites groups of people with shared beliefs. In the next section, we will examine the meanings of symbols and
how they function within cultures, which will deepen your understanding of Geertz's definition. For Geertz,
religion is intensely symbolic.

When anthropologists study religion, it can be helpful to consider both of these definitions because religion
includes such varied human constructs and experiences as social structures, sets of beliefs, a feeling of awe,
and an aura of mystery. While different religious groups and practices sometimes extend beyond what can be
covered by a simple definition, we can broadly define religion as a shared system of beliefs and practices
regarding the interaction of natural and supernatural phenomena. And yet as soon as we ascribe a meaning to
religion, we must distinguish some related concepts, such as spirituality and worldview.

Over the last few years, a growing number of Americans have been choosing to define themselves as spiritual
rather than religious. A 2017 Pew Research Center study found that 27 percent of Americans identify as
"spiritual but not religious," which is 8 percentage points higher than it was in 2012 (Lipka and Gecewicz
2017). There are different factors that can distinguish religion and spirituality, and individuals will define and
use these terms in specific ways; however, in general, while religion usually refers to shared affiliation with a
particular structure or organization, spirituality normally refers to loosely structured beliefs and feelings
about relationships between the natural and supernatural worlds. Spirituality can be very adaptable to
changing circumstances and is often built upon an individual's perception of the surrounding environment.

Many Americans with religious affiliation also use the term spirituality and distinguish it from their religion.
Pew found in 2017 that 48 percent of respondents said they were both religious and spiritual. Pew also found
that 27 percent of people say religion is very important to them (Lipka and Gecewicz 2017).

Another trend pertaining to religion in the United States is the growth of those defining themselves as nones,
or people with no religious affiliation. In a 2014 survey of 35,000 Americans from 50 states, Pew found that
nearly a quarter of Americans assigned themselves to this category (Pew Research Center 2015). The
percentage of adults assigning themselves to the "none" category had grown substantially, from 16 percent in
2007 to 23 percent in 2014; among millennials, the percentage of nones was even higher, at 35 percent (Lipka
2015). In a follow-up survey, participants were asked to identity their major reasons for choosing to be
nonaffiliated; the most common responses pointed to the growing politicization of American churches and a
more critical and questioning stance toward the institutional structure of all religions (Pew Research Center
2018). It is important, however, to point out that nones are not the same as agnostics or atheists. Nones may
hold traditional and/or nontraditional religious beliefs outside of membership in a religious institution.
Agnosticism is the belief that God or the divine is unknowable and therefore skepticism of belief is
appropriate, and atheism is a stance that denies the existence of a god or collection of gods. Nones, agnostics,
and atheists can hold spiritual beliefs, however. When anthropologists study religion, it is very important for
them to define the terms they are using because these terms can have different meanings when used outside
of academic studies. In addition, the meaning of terms may change. As the social and political landscape in a
society changes, it affects all social institutions, including religion.

     Landscape Study, 2014.

     Even those who consider themselves neither spiritual nor religious hold secular, or nonreligious, beliefs that
     structure how they view themselves and the world they live in. The term worldview refers to a person's
     outlook or orientation; it is a learned perspective, which has both individual and collective components, on the
     nature of life itself. Individuals frequently conflate and intermingle their religious and spiritual beliefs and
     their worldviews as they experience change within their lives. When studying religion, anthropologists need to
     remain aware of these various dimensions of belief. The word religion is not always adequate to identify an
     individual's belief systems.

     Like all social institutions, religion evolves within and across time and cultures--even across early human
     species! Adapting to changes in population size and the reality of people's daily lives, religions and religious/
     spiritual practices reflect life on the ground. Interestingly, though, while some institutions (such as economics)
     tend to change radically from one era to another, often because of technological changes, religion tends to be
     more viscous, meaning it tends to change at a much slower pace and mix together various beliefs and
     practices. While religion can be a factor in promoting rapid social change, it more commonly changes slowly
     and retains older features while adding new ones. In effect, religion contains within it many of its earlier
     iterations and can thus be quite complex.

     Witchcraft, Sorcery, and Magic

     People in Western cultures too often think of religion as a belief system associated with a church, temple, or
     mosque, but religion is much more diverse. In the 1960s, anthropologists typically used an evolutionary model
     for religion that associated less structured religious systems with simple societies and more complex forms of
     religion with more complex political systems. Anthropologists noticed that as populations grew, all forms of
     organization--political, economic, social, and religious--became more complex as well. For example, with the
     emergence of tribal societies, religion expanded to become not only a system of healing and connection with
     both animate and inanimate things in the environment but also a mechanism for addressing desire and
     conflict. Witchcraft and sorcery, both forms of magic, are more visible in larger-scale, more complex societies.

     The terms witchcraft and sorcery are variously defined across disciplines and from one researcher to another,
     yet there is some agreement about common elements associated with each. Witchcraft involves the use of
     intangible (not material) means to cause a change in circumstances to another person. It is normally
     associated with practices such as incantations, spells, blessings, and other types of formulaic language that,
     when pronounced, causes a transformation. Sorcery is similar to witchcraft but involves the use of material
     elements to cause a change in circumstances to another person. It is normally associated with such practices
     as magical bundles, love potions, and any specific action that uses another person's personal leavings (such as
     their hair, nails, or even excreta). While some scholars argue that witchcraft and sorcery are "dark," negative,
     antisocial actions that seek to punish others, ethnographic research is filled with examples of more ambiguous
     or even positive uses as well. Cultural anthropologist Alma Gottlieb, who did fieldwork among the Beng people
     of Côte d'Ivoire in Africa, describes how the king that the Beng choose as their leader must always be a witch
     himself, not because of his ability to harm others but because his mystical powers allow him to protect the
     Beng people that he rules (2008). His knowledge and abilities allow him to be a capable ruler.

     Some scholars argue that witchcraft and sorcery may be later developments in religion and not part of the
     earliest rituals because they can be used to express social conflict. What is the relationship between conflict,
     religion, and political organization? Consider what you learned in Social Inequality. As a society's population
     rises, individuals within that society have less familiarity and personal experience with each other and must

instead rely on family reputation or rank as the basis for establishing trust. Also, as social diversity increases,
people find themselves interacting with those who have different behaviors and beliefs from their own.
Frequently, we trust those who are most like ourselves, and diversity can create a sense of mistrust. This sense
of not knowing or understanding the people one lives, works, and trades with creates social stress and forces
people to put themselves into what can feel like risky situations when interacting with one another. In such a
setting, witchcraft and sorcery provide a feeling of security and control over other people. Historically, as
populations increased and sociocultural institutions became larger and more complex, religion evolved to
provide mechanisms such as witchcraft and sorcery that helped individuals establish a sense of social control
over their lives.

Magic is essential to both witchcraft and sorcery, and the principles of magic are part of every religion. The
anthropological study of magic is considered to have begun in the late 19th century with the 1890 publication
of The Golden Bough, by Scottish social anthropologist Sir James G. Frazer. This work, published in several
volumes, details the rituals and beliefs of a diverse range of societies, all collected by Frazer from the accounts
of missionaries and travelers. Frazer was an armchair anthropologist, meaning that he did not practice
fieldwork. In his work, he provided one of the earliest definitions of magic, describing it as "a spurious system
of natural law as well as a fallacious guide of conduct" (Frazer [1922] 1925, 11). A more precise and neutral
definition depicts magic as a supposed system of natural law whose practice causes a transformation to occur.
In the natural world--the world of our senses and the things we hear, see, smell, taste, and touch--we operate
with evidence of observable cause and effect. Magic is a system in which the actions or causes are not always
empirical. Speaking a spell or other magical formula does not provide observable (empirical) effects. For
practitioners of magic, however, this abstract cause and effect is just as consequential and just as true.

Frazer refers to magic as "sympathetic magic" because it is based on the idea of sympathy, or common feeling,
and he argued that there are two principles of sympathetic magic: the law of similarity and the law of
contagion. The law of similarity is the belief that a magician can create a desired change by imitating that
change. This is associated with actions or charms that mimic or look like the effects one desires, such as the
use of an effigy that looks like another person or even the Venus figurine associated with the Upper Paleolithic
period, whose voluptuous female body parts may have been used as part of a fertility ritual. By taking actions
on the stand-in figure, the magician is able to cause an effect on the person believed to be represented by this
figure. The law of contagion is the belief that things that have once been in contact with each other remain
connected always, such as a piece of jewelry owned by someone you love, a locket of hair or baby tooth kept as
a keepsake, or personal leavings to be used in acts of sorcery.

     period, 25,000-12,000 BCE. It is considered a form of magic because the exaggerated female body parts are
     believed to be related to ideas of female fertility and reproduction. (credit: "Venus von Willendorf" by Anagoria/

     This classification of magic broadens our understanding of how magic can be used and how common it is
     across all religions. Prayers and special mortuary artifacts (grave goods) indicate that the concept of magic is
     an innately human practice and not associated solely with tribal societies. In most cultures and across
     religious traditions, people bury or cremate loved ones with meaningful clothing, jewelry, or even a photo.
     These practices and sentimental acts are magical bonds and connections among acts, artifacts, and people.
     Even prayers and shamanic journeying (a form of metaphysical travel) to spirits and deities, practiced in
     almost all religious traditions, are magical contracts within people's belief systems that strengthen
     practitioners' faith. Instead of seeing magic as something outside of religion that diminishes seriousness,
     anthropologists see magic as a profound human act of faith.

     Supernatural Forces and Beings

     As stated earlier, religion typically regards the interaction of natural and supernatural phenomena. Put simply,
     a supernatural force is a figure or energy that does not follow natural law. In other words, it is nonempirical
     and cannot be measured or observed by normal means. Religious practices rely on contact and interaction
     with a wide range of supernatural forces of varying degrees of complexity and specificity.

     In many religious traditions, there are both supernatural deities, or gods who are named and have the ability to
     change human fortunes, and spirits, who are less powerful and not always identified by name. Spirit or spirits
     can be diffuse and perceived as a field of energy or an unnamed force.

     Practitioners of witchcraft and sorcery manipulate a supposed supernatural force that is often referred to by
     the term mana, first identified in Polynesia among the Maori of New Zealand (mana is a Maori word).
     Anthropologists see a similar supposed sacred energy field in many different religious traditions and now use
     this word to refer to that energy force. Mana is an impersonal (unnamed and unidentified) force that can
     adhere for varying periods of time to people or animate and inanimate objects to make them sacred. One
     example is in the biblical story that appears in Mark 5:25-30, in which a woman suffering an illness simply

touches Jesus's cloak and is healed. Jesus asks, "Who touched my clothes?" because he recognizes that some
of this force has passed from him to the woman who was ill in order to heal her. Many Christians see the person
of Jesus as sacred and holy from the time of his baptism by the Holy Spirit. Christian baptism in many
traditions is meant as a duplication or repetition of Christ's baptism.

There are also named and known supernatural deities. A deity is a god or goddess. Most often conceived as
humanlike, gods (male) and goddesses (female) are typically named beings with individual personalities and
interests. Monotheistic religions focus on a single named god or goddess, and polytheistic religions are built
around a pantheon, or group, of gods and/or goddesses, each usually specializing in a specific sort of behavior
or action. And there are spirits, which tend to be associated with very specific (and narrower) activities, such
as earth spirits or guardian spirits (or angels). Some spirits emanate from or are connected directly to humans,
such as ghosts and ancestor spirits, which may be attached to specific individuals, families, or places. In some
patrilineal societies, ancestor spirits require a great deal of sacrifice from the living. This veneration of the
dead can consume large quantities of resources. In the Philippines, the practice of venerating the ancestor
spirits involves elaborate house shrines, altars, and food offerings. In central Madagascar, the Merino people
practice a regular "turning of the bones," called famidihana. Every five to seven years, a family will disinter
some of their deceased family members and replace their burial clothing with new, expensive silk garments as
a form of remembrance and to honor all of their ancestors. In both of these cases, ancestor spirits are believed
to continue to have an effect on their living relatives, and failure to carry out these rituals is believed to put the
living at risk of harm from the dead.

Religious Specialists

Religious groups typically have some type of leadership, whether formal or informal. Some religious leaders
occupy a specific role or status within a larger organization, representing the rules and regulations of the
institution, including norms of behavior. In anthropology, these individuals are called priests, even though
they may have other titles within their religious groups. Anthropology defines priests as full-time practitioners,
meaning they occupy a religious rank at all times, whether or not they are officiating at rituals or ceremonies,
and they have leadership over groups of people. They serve as mediators or guides between individuals or
groups of people and the deity or deities. In religion-specific terms, anthropological priests may be called by
various names, including titles such as priest, pastor, preacher, teacher, imam (Islam), and rabbi (Judaism).

Another category of specialists is prophets. These individuals are associated with religious change and
transformation, calling for a renewal of beliefs or a restructuring of the status quo. Their leadership is usually
temporary or indirect, and sometimes the prophet is on the margins of a larger religious organization. German
sociologist Max Weber (1947) identified prophets as having charisma, a personality trait that conveys
authority:

      Charisma is a certain quality of an individual personality by virtue of which he is set apart from
      ordinary men and treated as endowed with supernatural, superhuman, or at least specifically
      exceptional powers or qualities. These as such are not accessible to the ordinary person, but are
      regarded as of divine origin or as exemplary, and on the basis of them the individual concerned is
      treated as a leader. (358-359)

A third type of specialist is shamans. Shamans are part-time religious specialists who work with clients to
address very specific and individual needs by making direct contact with deities or supernatural forces. While
priests will officiate at recurring ritual events, a shaman, much like a medical psychologist, addresses each
individual need. One exception to this is the shaman's role in subsistence, usually hunting. In societies where
the shaman is responsible for "calling up the animals" so that hunters will have success, the ritual may be
calendrical, or occurring on a cyclical basis. While shamans are medical and religious specialists within
shamanic societies, there are other religions that practice forms of shamanism as part of their own belief
systems. Sometimes, these shamanic practitioners will be known by terms such as pastor or preacher, or even
layperson. And some religious specialists serve as both part-time priests and part-time shamans, occupying
more than one role as needed within a group of practitioners. You will read more about shamanism in the next
section.

     Shamanism

     One early form of religion is shamanism, a practice of divination and healing that involves soul travel, also
     called shamanic journeying, to connect natural and supernatural realms in nonlinear time. Associated initially
     with small-scale societies, shamanic practices are now known to be embedded in many of the world's religions.
     In some cultures, shamans are part-time specialists, usually drawn into the practice by a "calling" and trained
     in the necessary skills and rituals though an apprenticeship. In other cultures, all individuals are believed to be
     capable of shamanic journeying if properly trained. By journeying--an act frequently initiated by dance,
     trance, drumbeat, song, or hallucinogenic substances--the shaman is able to consult with a spiritual world
     populated by supernatural figures and deceased ancestors. The term itself, samán, meaning "one who knows,"
     is an Evenki word, originating among the Evenk people of northern Siberia. Shamanism, found all over the
     world, was first studied by anthropologists in Siberia.

     While shamanism is a healing practice, it conforms to the anthropological definition of religion as a shared set
     of beliefs and practices pertaining to the natural and supernatural. Cultures and societies that publicly affirm
     shamanism as a predominant and generally accepted practice often are referred to as shamanic cultures.
     Shamanism and shamanic activity, however, are found within most religions. The world's two dominant
     mainstream religions both contain a type of shamanistic practice: the laying on of hands in Christianity, in
     which a mystical healing and blessing is passed from one person to another, and the mystical Islamic practice
     of Sufism, in which the practitioner, called a dervish, dances by whirling faster and faster in order to reach a
     trance state of communing with the divine. There are numerous other shared religious beliefs and practices
     among different religions besides shamanism. Given the physical and social evolution of our species, it is
     likely that we all share aspects of a fundamental religious orientation and that religious changes are added on
     to, rather than used to replace, earlier practices such as shamanism.

     spinning dance. In this state, they are able to commune with the deity. (credit: "Whirling Dervishes 2" by Richard
     Ha/flickr, CC BY 2.0)
     Indigenous shamanism continues to be a significant force for healing and prophecy today and is the
     predominant religious mode in small-scale, subsistence-based societies, such as bands of gatherers and
     hunters. Shamanism is valued by hunters as an intuitive way to locate wild animals, often depicted as "getting
     into the mind of the animal." Shamanism is also valued as a means of healing, allowing individuals to discern
     and address sources of physical and social illness that may be affecting their health. One of the best-studied
     shamanic healing practices is that of the !Kung San in Central Africa. When individuals in that society suffer
     physical or socioemotional distress, they practice n/um tchai, a medicine dance, to draw up spiritual forces
     within themselves that can be used for shamanic self-healing (Marshall [1969] 2009).

Shamanistic practices remain an important part of the culture of modern Inuit people in the Canadian Arctic,
particularly their practices pertaining to whale hunting. Although these traditional hunts were prohibited for a
time, Inuit people were able to legally resume them in 1994. In a recent study of Inuit whaling communities in
the Canadian territory of Nunavut, cultural anthropologists Frédéric Laugrand and Jarich Oosten (2013) found
that although hunting technology has changed--whaling spears now include a grenade that, when aimed
properly, allows for a quick and more humane death--many shamanistic beliefs and social practices
pertaining to the hunt endure. The sharing of maktak or muktuk (whale skin and blubber) with elders is
believed to lift their spirits and prolong their lives by connecting them to their ancestors and memories of their
youth, the communal sharing of whale meat connects families to each other, and the relationship between
hunter and hunted mystically sustains the populations of both. Inuit hunters believe that the whale "gives
itself" to the hunter in order to establish this relationship, and when the hunter and community gratefully and
humbly consume the catch, this ties the whales to the people and preserves them both. While Laugrand and
Oosten found that most Inuit communities practice modern-day Christianity, the shamanistic values of their
ancestors continue to play a major role in their understanding of both the whale hunt and what it means to be
Inuit today. Their practice and understanding of religion incorporate both the church and their ancestral
beliefs.

     in Greenland goes out seeking fish. (credit: Renate Haase/Pixabay, CC0)

     Above all, shamanism reflects the principles and practice of mutuality and balance, the belief that all living
     things are connected to each other and can have an effect on each other. This is a value that reverberates
     through almost all other religious systems as well. Concepts such as stewardship (caring for and nurturing
     resources), charity (providing for the needs of others), and justice (concern and respect for others and their
     rights) are all valued in shamanism.

     The Institutionalization of Religion

     Shamanism is classified as animism, a worldview in which spiritual agency is assigned to all things, including
     natural elements such as rocks and trees. Sometimes associated with the idea of dual souls--a day soul and a
     night soul, the latter of which can wander in dreams--and sometimes with unnamed and disembodied spirits
     believed to be associated with living and nonliving things, animism was at first understood by anthropologists
     as a primitive step toward more complex religions. In his work Primitive Culture (1871), British anthropologist
     Sir Edward Tylor, considered the first academic anthropologist, identified animism as a proto-religion, an
     evolutionary beginning point for all religions. As population densities increased and societies developed more
     complex forms of social organization, religion mirrored many of these changes.

     With the advent of state societies, religion became institutionalized. As population densities increased and
     urban areas emerged, the structure and function of religion shifted into a bureaucracy, known as a state
     religion. State religions are formal institutions with full-time administrators (e.g., priests, pastors, rabbis,
     imams), a set doctrine of beliefs and regulations, and a policy of growth by seeking new practitioners through
     conversion. While state religions continued to exhibit characteristics of earlier forms, they were now
     structured as organizations with a hierarchy, including functionaries at different levels with different
     specializations. Religion was now administered as well as practiced. Similar to the use of mercenaries as paid
     soldiers in a state army, bureaucratic religions include paid positions that may not require subscribing to the
     belief system itself. Examples of early state religions include the pantheons of Egypt and Greece. Today, the
     most common state religions are Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism.

     Rather than part-time shamans, tribal and state religions are often headed by full-time religious leaders who

13.2 · Symbolic and Sacred Space                                                                                          409

administer higher levels within the religious bureaucracy. With institutionalization, religion began to develop
formalized doctrines, or sets of specific and usually rigid principles or teachings, that would be applied
through the codification of a formal system of laws. And, unlike earlier religious forms, state religions are
usually defined not by birthright but by conversion. Using proselytization, a recruitment practice in which
members actively seek converts to the group, state religions are powerful institutions in society. They bring
diverse groups of people together and establish common value systems.

There are two common arrangements between political states and state religions. In some instances, such as
contemporary Iran, the religious institution and the state are one, and religious leaders head the political
structure. In other societies, there is an explicit separation between religion and state. The separation has
been handled differently across nation-states. In some states, the political government supports a state
religion (or several) as the official religion(s). In some of these cases, the religious institution will play a role in
political decision-making from local to national levels. In other state societies with a separation between
religion and state, religious institutions will receive favors, such as subsidies, from state governments. This
may include tax or military exemptions and privileged access to resources. It is this latter arrangement that we
see in the United States, where institutions such as the Department of Defense and the IRS keep lists of
officially recognized religions with political and tax-exempt status.

Among the approximately 200 sovereign nation-states worldwide, there are many variations in the
relationship between state and religion, including societies that have political religions, where the state or
state rulers are considered divine and holy. In North Korea today, people practice an official policy of juche,
which means self-reliance and independence. A highly nationalist policy, it has religious overtones, including
reverence and obeisance to the state leader (Kim Jong Un) and unquestioning allegiance to the North Korean
state. An extreme form of nationalism, juche functions as a political religion with the government and leader
seen as deity and divine. Unlike in a theocracy, where the religious structure has political power, in North
Korea, the political structure is the practiced religion.

Historically, relationships between religious institution and state have been extremely complex, with power
arrangements shifting and changing over time. Today, Christian fundamentalism is playing an increasingly
political role in U.S. society. Since its bureaucratization, religion has had a political role in almost every nation-
state. In many state societies, religious institutions serve as charity organizations to meet the basic needs of
many citizens, as educational institutions offering both mainstream and alternative pedagogies, and as
community organizations to help mobilize groups of people for specific actions. Although some states--such as
Cuba, China, Cambodia, North Korea, and the former Soviet Union--have declared atheism as their official
policy during certain historical periods, religion has never fully disappeared in any of them. Religious groups,
however, may face varying levels of oppression within state societies. The Uighurs are a mostly Muslim ethnic
group of some 10 million people in northwestern China. Since 2017, when Chinese president Xi Jinping issued
an order that all religions in China should be Chinese in their orientation, the Uighurs have faced mounting
levels of oppression, including discrimination in state services. There have been recent accusations of mass
sterilizations and genocide by the Chinese government against this ethnic minority (see BBC News 2021).
During periods of state oppression, religion tends to break up into smaller units practiced at a local or even
household level.

LEARNING OUTCOMES

  · Distinguish between a symbol and sign.
  · Explain the architectural dimensions of sacred space.
  · Understand the meaning of sacred place.

Symbolism in Religion

Symbolism plays a vital role in religion. A symbol stands for something else, is arbitrary, and has no natural
connection to its reference. There are two main types of symbols. A symbol can be a metaphor, meaning that it
is completely disconnected from what it represents, such as the Islamic symbol of the crescent and star, which
410  13 · Religion and Culture

     represents enlightenment brought about through God. Or a symbol might be a metonym, in which the part
     stands for the whole, such as the cross, which is an artifact of a specific portion of Christian history that is now
     used to stand for Christianity as a whole. Symbols are multivocal by nature, which means they can have more
     than one meaning. Their meaning derives from both how the symbol is used and how the audience views it.
     The more common and widespread a symbol, the more conflicting references and meanings may coexist. As
     an example, think of the U.S. flag; when draped over a veteran's casket, the flag has a different meaning from
     when it is waved at a rally or burned in protest. One symbol, multiple meanings.

     The prevalence of symbolism in religion indicates that religions are learned and shared systems of belief.
     While there are empirical aspects to religion, especially in regard to religious practices such as dance, trance,
     and prayer, the meaning behind the practices is entirely learned. Symbolism is attached not only to
     supernatural deities and spirits but also to religious places, myths, and rituals. In the Ethnographic Sketch at
     the end of the chapter, you will read more about symbols and religion.

     Religious Places

     Anthropologists distinguish between space, an unmarked physical field on which imagination or action can
     occur, and place, a location that has sociocultural meaning(s) attached. Many religions and religious practices
     are defined by sacred places that serve as settings for hierophany, the manifestation of the sacred or divine.

Commonly, the sense of the sacred derives from the prior history and the use of a place. In most religions,
sacred places are marked by other symbols. A Jewish home is identified as a special religious place. One way of
marking this sacred place is by attaching mezuzahs, small casings containing a tiny parchment with a verse
from the Torah to external and internal doorposts. Placings these mezuzahs at the points of entry mark the
place inside as holy, sacred, and set apart. Like most religious places, the Jewish home is a densely symbolic
place.

Religious places are part of the built environment, or places that people create as representations of their
beliefs. Religious scholar Mircea Eliade focuses on religious places in his work The Sacred and Profane (1959),
arguing that one "becomes aware of the sacred because it manifests itself, shows itself, as something wholly
different from the profane" (11). He identifies three characteristics associated with sacred places:

  · Every sacred place is marked by a threshold, which separates the two spaces, the sacred inside and the
      profane outside. It marks a passageway and a new mode of being: "The threshold is the limit, the
      boundary, the frontier." It is guarded in various ways and it is an "object of great importance" (25).

  · Every sacred place memorializes a hierophany, or sacred event, by including an area within the sacred
      place that is most holy--usually where something sacred has occurred in the past. This is like an umbilical
      cord (Eliade calls it an axis mundi) that connects practitioner with deity and/or spirit, memorializing the
      occurrence of something special that happened (or happens) here. In many religious places, there will be
      an altar or some sort of commemoration in this spot.

  · Every sacred place represents an imago mundi, an image or microcosm of the world as seen from the
      religious perspective. In some religious traditions, sacred places will be decorated with reminders of what
      is most valued by that tradition, using various types of artworks. In Catholic churches, for example,
      paintings of the events associated with the crucifixion of Christ, known as the stations of the cross, remind
      believers of Christ's sacrifice.

Eliade's characteristics of sacred places can be useful tools for beginning to understand the role of a place in a
religion or a religious practice that is unfamiliar to us. They prompt us to look at the place through a believer's
eyes: What happens here? What are the meanings associated with the different parts of this place? What are
the proper ways to enter and exit and show respect? Because religion is heavily symbolic, we must strive to
understand these places from inside the religious belief system. The practice of casting the Wiccan circle is a
good example of creating religious place.

Wicca is a relatively new religious movement based on ancient pagan beliefs and rituals. It is sometimes
referred to as a neo-pagan movement because it is a modern polytheistic movement focused on belief in
nature spirits. Although it has historical roots, the movement itself began in the mid-1900s in England. Wicca
is focused on the dual energies of the male and the female and typically involves the worship of a goddess and
a god (sometimes along with other deities), celebrating the natural world and the idea that this dual spirit
resides in nature. The pentagram, a five-pointed star, is the primary Wiccan symbol, representing the five
classical elements: air, water, fire, earth, and aether (spirit). When Wiccans--also called witches, regardless of
gender--gather to worship, they establish a religious place outdoors. This is done through a ritual called
casting a circle. Using a ritual knife or sword that represents fire, the witch casting the circle will symbolically
"cut" the circle in three dimensions by walking out the circumference on the ground to symbolically mark the
boundaries and establish the threshold. Then the caster will call on the guardians of the watchtowers of the
four directions--north, south, east, and west--and above to mark the spherical shape as the caster marks the
space using salt water (earth and water) and incense (fire and air). Once the guardians are invoked, the circle is
cast and the practitioners can enter for the sacred ritual. When the ritual ends, the circle is dismantled by
reversing each of these actions and returning the ground to its profane (not holy) status.

The circle is sacred as soon as it is cast and remains sacred until the meeting ends and it is ritually
deactivated. The circle is fluid, portable, and only cast for a single use each time. It serves as the entrance to
the sacred portal in which the practitioners will encounter and interact with the spirits. Knowing how to
properly cast the circle is critical, so a skilled witch is always in charge of this phase.

     While Eliade's approach to sacred architecture remains useful, anthropology increasingly uses a
     phenomenological, or experience-based, approach when studying place. The phenomenological approach is
     based on the belief that the meaning of a place emerges as it is used. Within this approach, a church building is
     understood to become sacred when practitioners bring their beliefs and meanings regarding the sacred with
     them into the sanctuary. It is the meaning assigned to the place by the people entering it that establishes its
     sacredness. The phenomenological approach argues that the nature of a place emerges from its use and
     denomination as a sacred place. This a new perspective in anthropology that opens up exciting new fields in
     the study of religious place.

     13.3 Myth and Religious Doctrine

     LEARNING OUTCOMES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       · Define myth.
       · Explain the social importance of myth.
       · Analyze mythic meaning using a structural approach.
       · Explain the importance of oral tradition in religion.

     The Role of Myth in Religion

     Sometimes, our everyday usage of a word is the same as its scholarly use; when it comes to the word myth,
     however, this is not the case. Myth is used often in popular culture to mean something that is false or deceptive,
     a made-up story that is not true, as in the TV series MythBusters. In anthropology, however, myth is defined as
     a well-known story that explains primary principles, beliefs, and values outside of chronological time. Pieces of
     a myth may or may not be true. Its veracity is not what matters; it is most important for what it teaches. Many
     times, the characters within myths are culture heroes, semidivine persons whose experiences and lives serve
     as a teaching tool, allowing those within the culture to identify with them and learn from their challenges.
     Myths shape a society's worldview, explain its origins, and also teach and affirm social norms (Moro 2012).

     There are various types of myths, including creation/origin myths, culture hero myths, and animal myths. The
     study of myth overlaps with many different scholarly disciplines, including anthropology, folklore, mythology
     studies, and psychology. Anthropology approaches the study of myth by examining each story for its primary
     messages about the society and culture it comes from.

     Creation/origin myths are among the best-known and most universal myths. Among these, a common type of
     creation story is the earth-diver myth, famously studied by folklorist and anthropologist Alan Dundes (1962).

In earth-diver myths, a creator deity sends an agent, usually an animal, into deep waters to find a bit of mud
that the deity will use to create dry land and, later, humans. Through this single act, the deity begins a creative
cycle that will eventually result in life as it is known today. Although there are cultural differences in the way
this myth is told, Dundes argues that the key elements of the myth are universal: a creator deity, an
intermediary agent, and humans created from earth elements.

A Brief Structural Analysis of a Myth

FIGURE 13.10 Anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss (1908-2009) collected and analyzed myths as a way of
studying culture. (credit: Michel Ravassard, UNESCO/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 3.0)

Anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss saw myths as containing both universal messages about shared human
experiences and concerns and particular messages about the cultures with which they are associated. His
approach to understanding myth is part of the theory of structuralism, and it separates myth into its
component parts in order to understand the underlying form--the structure. Lévi-Strauss believed that mythic
structure was the same across all cultures. He argued that the concerns of all cultures, expressed within their
myths, are very similar. Structural analysis can be very complicated. At each step, as the myth is gradually
"stripped down," the information it reveals is more enlightening. There are approaches to structuralism that
can be applied more quickly, however, allowing a more penetrating look at the "real story" within the myth.

A brief version of a structural analysis will have at least three major components: binary oppositions, which
are two contrasting concepts; mythemes, which are the stripped-down minimal units, or story components,
that form the structure of the myth; and the primary messages of the myth, which are universal. Let's look at a
version of structuralism in action by analyzing a myth from the Tsimshian people of the Pacific Northwest
coast of North America, collected by Franz Boas in 1916.

The Myth
"The Bear Who Married a Woman," collected by anthropologist Franz Boas (1916, 192):

1. Once upon a time there lived a widow of the tribe of the G·i-spa-x-lâ°ts. Many men tried to marry her
      daughter, but she declined them all. The mother said, "When a man comes to marry you, feel of the palms
      of his hands. If they are soft, decline him; if they are rough, accept him." She meant that she wanted to
      have for a son-in-law a man skillful in building canoes.

2. Her daughter obeyed her commands, and refused the wooings of all young men. One night a youth came to
      her bed. The palms of his hands were very rough, and therefore she accepted his suit. Early in the
      morning, however, he had suddenly disappeared, even before she had seen him.

3. When her mother arose early in the morning and went out, she found a halibut on the beach in front of the
      house, although it was midwinter. The following evening the young man came back, but disappeared again
      before the dawn of the day. In the morning the widow found a seal in front of the house. Thus they lived for
      some time. The young woman never saw the face of her husband; but every morning she found an animal
      on the beach, every day a larger one. Thus the widow came to be very rich.
414  13 · Religion and Culture

     4. She was anxious to see her son-in-law, and one day she waited until he arrived. Suddenly she saw a red
           bear . . . emerge from the water. He carried a whale on each side, and put them down on the beach. As soon
           as he noticed that he was observed, he was transformed into a rock, which may be seen up to this day. He
           was a supernatural being of the sea.

     The Binary Oppositions
     In order to find binary oppositions, one must identity the important points within the myth--what exactly is
     asserted in the story. The opposite of each of these points, which may or may not be openly expressed in the
     myth, is the primary term's opposition. The oppositions form the structure of the myth because they identify
     what is important. Below are the binary oppositions in the first paragraph of the myth (1). Note that the
     specific words are not always critical, and sometimes there is more than one version of the quality that can be
     expressed.

          Once upon a time there lived a widow of the tribe of the G·i-spa-x-lâts. (then vs. now, live vs. die, male
          vs. female, married vs. widowed, together vs. alone, member of the tribe v. nonmember or belong vs.
           not belong)

          Many men tried to marry her daughter, but she declined them all. (many vs. few, men vs. women,
           marry vs. not marry, daughter vs. son, child vs. childless, accept vs. decline, all vs. none)

          The mother said, "When a man comes to marry you, feel the palms of his hands." (female vs. male,
           mother vs. father, say vs. not say, man vs. woman, come vs. not come, marry vs. not marry, feel vs. not
          feel or test vs. not test or do vs. not do, palms of his hands vs. another body part)

          "If they are soft, decline him; if they are rough, accept him." (soft vs. rough, decline vs. accept, rough
           vs. soft, accept vs. decline)

          She meant that she wanted to have for a son-in-law a man skillful in building canoes. (female vs. male,
           want vs. not want, have a son-in-law vs. not have a son-in-law, man vs. woman, skillful vs. inept)

     Even this cursory analysis reveals certain qualities that come up again and again: male versus female, married
     versus unmarried, belonging versus not belonging (expressed also as accepted versus declined). The
     emphases seem to be on sex, family, and legitimacy.

     The Mythemes
     In the "light" version of structuralism, the mythemes are best revealed by retelling the story in shorter and
     shorter versions, each time with fewer particular details. Using the first paragraph, again:

           (original) Once upon a time there lived a widow of the tribe of the G·i-spa-x-lâ°ts. Many men tried to
           marry her daughter, but she declined them all. The mother said, "When a man comes to marry you,
           feel of the palms of his hands. If they are soft, decline him; if they are rough, accept him." She meant
           that she wanted to have for a son-in-law a man skillful in building canoes.

           (first retelling) Once upon a time there was a widow. Many men tried to marry her daughter, but she
           declined them all. The mother said, "Feel the palms of his hands, and if they are rough, accept him."
           She wanted a son-in-law who was skillful in building canoes.

           (second retelling) A widowed mother told her daughter to get a husband with rough hands. She wanted
           a hardworking son-in-law.

     Note how the second version of the story has only mythemes of action and consequence. The information left
     in the mythemes is the critical information, the major points, of the myth. Lévi-Strauss argued that mythemes
     reveal universal cross-cultural concerns. All specific "local" information is removed. Considering the myth as a
     whole, the tribe and the characteristics to avoid can be omitted.

     The Primary Messages
     In this version of structuralism, the specific ways in which the messages are written are less important than
     what they are generally saying. The general messages are extracted from the emphasis within the binary
     oppositions. How much emphasis is put on something such as kinship? Sharing? There are several possible
     ways to say each of the following, but the central messages in this myth seem to be the following:

  · Be careful what you wish for. (There may be unforeseen consequences to what you think you want.)
  · Don't look a gift horse in the mouth. (Don't find fault with things that are good.)
  · Family matters. (Kinship is important.)

Oral and Written Religious Traditions

Religion scholars often separate religions into oral traditions, or local or indigenous religions passed down
across generations through storytelling, and written traditions, or world religions that are primarily associated
with sacred, written texts. While each may use components of the other tradition--oral storytelling is still
occasionally used in a religion that is primarily a written tradition, for example--the emphasis on either oral or
written worship affects the nature of the religious system in various ways.

Religions that remain primarily oral, such as most tribal and non-state religions, rely on religious performance
as a way of bringing history to life instead of storing this cultural knowledge in written form. Most oral
traditions have a cyclical connection to time, interpreting the past as repeating in cycles over and over, and see
themselves and their ancestors as connected by enduring relationships over time. One of the clearest
contemporary examples of this is a concept in the belief systems of various Indigenous Australian peoples
commonly known as Dreamtime. In her study of women's rituals and song lines among the Warlpiri people,
Diane Bell (1993) became very interested in the yawulyu tradition, the women's Dreamtime rituals. Through
rituals of song, dance, and ceremony, Warlpiri women bring their ancestors to life. In one specific ritual, they
walk paths near their communities where various historic and mythic events are believed to have occurred.
These ritualized walks are called storylines because the women believe they are actually reliving the events
that occurred in those locations and bringing their ancestors to life by remembering what happened in these
meaningful and sacred places. Men have their own storylines and Dreamtime. Among indigenous Australian
peoples, as among many small-scale societies, religion is not separate from everyday life. Instead, it infuses
what they do and how they think about themselves. Theirs are oral and performative traditions in which they
walk alongside their ancestors as they walk the same trails that their ancestors walked and remember them by
remembering their stories. In this way, they turn myth into ritual itself, one intermingling with the other.
Myths, for the Warlpiri, are alive and relived when they are performed. Dreamtime connects the Warlpiri
people to their ancestors and their history and strengthens their cultural identity.

Even in religious faiths that rely primarily on doctrine, storytelling remains critical. The phrase "people of the
book," an Islamic reference to the Abrahamic religions--Islam, Christianity, and Judaism--is used to describe
religious traditions that primarily, although not exclusively, rely on text and textual study. Each of these
traditions has a primary sacred book used as the foundation of the religion--the Bible in Christianity, the
Qur'an in Islam, and the Torah in Judaism. Yet while these traditions are based on scripture (writings), there
are also significant oral components in the practice of these faiths. Many of the writings are based on earlier
oral traditions and retain characteristics of oral performance, such as repetition for emphasis and to
encourage remembering and story units that are self-contained and can be moved around. And each tradition
utilizes oral performance in worship, reading aloud from their sacred texts during religious services.

        PROFILES IN ANTHROPOLOGY

Manuel Zapata Olivella
1920-2004

Personal History: Zapata Olivella was born in Lorica, Colombia, in 1920 and studied medicine in the capital at
the Universidad de Bogotá, eventually working as a physician and psychiatrist. He traveled throughout Latin
America, Europe, and the United States, lecturing in the United States at Howard University and the University
of Kansas. When introducing himself at the Library of Congress, he stated, "Soy Manuel Zapata Olivella,
colombiano, novelista, médico, y antropólogo" (I am Manuel Zapata Olivella, Colombian, novelist, medical
doctor, and anthropologist). His work-- academic, literary, and medical--extends across all areas of what it
means to be human.

Area of Anthropology: Born into a family of mixed ethnic and racial heritage--his father was of European and
African ancestry, and his mother was of Indigenous and Spanish descent--Zapata Olivella was interested in
416  13 · Religion and Culture

     identity and cultural diversity in Colombia. While traveling in the United States in the 1940s, he witnessed
     segregation and racial discrimination against Black Americans; he returned to Colombia and dedicated
     himself to studying the culture of afrocolombianos (Colombians of African descent), even as he continued his
     medical practice.

     Accomplishments in the Field: For his ethnographic-literary works, Zapata Olivella received many awards
     throughout the Americas and Europe. Afro-Hispanic and Americanist scholars today value Zapata Olivella's
     work for its cultural detail and focus on an understudied and too often overlooked population.

     Importance of His Work: His ethnographic work provided the material for him to write a series of historical
     novels, the best known of which is Changó, el gran putas (Changó, the badass, 1983), an epic novel tracing the
     African diaspora from its origins in the slave trade across generations. His work incorporated many of the
     syncretic religious and mythic elements of contemporary afrocolombianos. Speaking at a national literary
     event on the importance of studying Afro-Colombian identity and culture today, he said, "For young countries
     such as ours, to assert our traditions, our evolutionary reality, our creative force is to take possession of
     ourselves, to come of age" (Zapata Olivella 2010, 185). On the afrocolombiano experience in the Americas,
     Zapata Olivella published more than a dozen novels and numerous short stories and essays (Selected
     Correspondence).

     13.4 Rituals of Transition and Conformity

     LEARNING OUTCOMES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       · Identify the characteristics of ritual.
       · Describe how ritual reinforces social solidarity.
       · Distinguish between the different types of ritual.
       · Explain the social forces of liminality and communitas.
       · Identify the stages of rites of passage.

     The Varieties of Ritual Experience in Religion

     Rituals, also called rites, are performative acts by which we carry out our religious beliefs, public and private.
     As sociologist Émile Durkheim noted, they follow a formal order or sequence, called a liturgical order; are
     performed in a place that is set apart and sacred during the time of the performance; and are inherently social.
     Unlike idiosyncratic behaviors that an individual may practice on their own, rituals are learned and shared.
     They foster social solidarity and identity within a community of believers (this a focus of Durkheim's). Even
     when performing a religious ritual alone, such as walking a labyrinth during meditation, the ritual itself,
     because it is learned as part of a larger body of religious practices, connects the individual to the larger
     community.

Rituals tend to have a common structure even though ritual and ritual performance can be quite variable. In
his work Ritual (1993), West African writer and ritual scholar Malidoma Somé ([1993] 1997, 68) outlines the
major stages of most ritual acts:

1. Opening: "setting the stage" by designating the purpose of the ritual and gathering the human
      participants

2. Invocation: calling upon the spirit world to join the group
3. Dialogue: establishing an open connection/communication between participants and the spirit world
4. Repetition: fixed sequences, prayers, and/or acts that are required to legitimize the ritual's purpose
5. Closure: a blessing or other form of official dismissal for both human and spirit participants

Even when rituals are scripted and parts are carefully read and followed, individual participation and
collaboration will subtly change a ritual each time it is enacted or performed. Rituals are never exactly
duplicated, and not all rituals serve the same purpose. Some are primarily performed to affirm, strengthen,
and maintain solidarity within the group; some are social markers of life transformations for individuals,
families, or groups; and others address healing and the need for renewal. There are many categories of ritual:
commemoration feasts or rituals (e.g., Christmas or Hannukah), which are usually held over a calendrical
cycle, usually a year; divinatory rites to find the causes of illness, ask for healing, or prophesy about the future,
which usually occur on an as-needed basis; and rites of rebellion, in which social rules and norms may be
inverted to emphasize their value within a society. Incwala, a ritual found among the Swazi, a group in
southern Africa, is a national holiday during which many social rules are suspended or inverted, allowing
women to take on men's public roles and men to take on women's household duties in a public farce. Among
the Swazi, this ritual is understood to illustrate the value of different gender roles in society as well as the
importance of social norms in reducing social disorder. In the United States, Halloween is also a rite of
rebellion, one in which children go out at night to beg for candy from neighbors. Among the most common
broad types of religious ritual, though, are rites of intensification, rites of passage, and rites of affliction.

     Rites of Intensification

     Called by various names, such as rites of affirmation and calendrical rites, rites of intensification are
     performed to affirm, strengthen, and maintain bonds of solidarity. Most of the repetitive religious services that
     are offered through churches, synagogues, and mosques are rites of intensification. These rituals tend to have
     a rather stable and repetitive structure that allows practitioners to follow along easily. If you attend or
     participant in any kind of repetitive daily, weekly, or monthly religious ritual, it is likely a rite of intensification.
     These rites define and indoctrinate individuals so that they identify as a religious community, even though
     there may be other ritual acts accompanying it. It is not unusual in state religions for these rites to create unity
     among believers across cultures and nation-states. A good example is the daily practice of Islamic prayer, or
     salat. Salat involves praying in the direction of the holy city of Mecca at dawn, noon, midafternoon, sunset, and
     evening every day, regardless of where the believer is located or even what they are doing. Salat establishes a
     direct relationship between the believer and God and affirms one's membership in a global community of
     Muslims.

     Rites of Passage

     First identified by anthropologist Arnold van Gennep in 1909, rites of passage mark social transformations in
     people's lives and establish a change in social status within their communities. Associated most commonly
     with birth, puberty, marriage, and death, these rituals can be prolonged ceremonies during which the
     individual receives instruction and preparation for this change in their lives. Gennep noted that there are three
     stages in a rite of passage--separation, transition, and incorporation--and that during the transition stage, the
     individual must traverse a threshold (limen in Latin) from their old social position or status to a new one.

     1. Separation (pre-limen). The separation phase is marked by detachment from one's previous status. While
           the person or people involved may be physically separated and held in a special place, the separation
           normally occurs within daily life over a period of time and is always marked symbolically. Some examples
           of separation are the formal engagement of a couple with rings and a period of preparation for the
           upcoming marriage; the process of catechesis, or formal religious instruction, for young people planning
           to be baptized or confirmed in a Christian church; and wearing special clothing or colors while mourning
           the death of a family member.

     2. Transition (liminality). The transition phase is marked by an ambiguity of status and associated with
           instruction and teaching. This phase is usually restricted to the period in which an active and public ritual
           transformation is taking place. The person or people involved, already separated from their previous
           status and identity, are now transformed into a new status. This is the most active phase of a rite of
           passage. It is highly scripted and almost always involves teachers, guides, or mentors who usher the
           individuals through the proper steps to a new social status. Some examples of transition are the marriage

      ceremony itself, the actual baptism or confirmation ritual in the church, and the funeral service for a loved
      one.
3. Incorporation (post-limen). The incorporation phase is marked by a formal public presentation of the
      person or people who have gone through the ritual. During incorporation, different symbols are used to
      express a new social status and identity. In this last stage, those going through the transformation begin to
      assume the rights, privileges, and responsibilities of their new social status. This might include changing
      their names, moving to a new location, or wearing different clothing. In many rites of passage, this is an
      extended period that can last from months to years.

Anthropologist Victor Turner (1969) discusses in detail the significance of liminality in rites of passage.
During liminality, an individual is what Turner calls "betwixt and between" (95), without social status or
standing, outside of the structure, and in transition from one social stage to another. It is a form of social death.
Often, the individual will be dressed in uniform, unmarked clothing and follow behaviors associated with
humility and anonymity in their culture. There is also an expectation of total obedience during the change of
status, as the individual depends on ritual leaders (gatekeepers) to teach, coach, and mentor them through the
passage. If there is a cohort of individuals participating in the rite of passage, such as an age grade going
through puberty rites, the participants will share a strong sense of equality and social bonding among
themselves, referred to as communitas. Through Turner's research on the Ndembu of Zambia,
anthropologists were better able to understand these common mechanisms of social change.

One example of a rite of passage among the Navajo of the southwestern United States is the Kinaaldá. The
Kinaaldá is a traditional coming-of-age ceremony (a puberty rite) for young Navajo women that occurs shortly
after a girl's first menstrual cycle and involves her extended family and community (Carey 2010; Meza 2019).
Typically, the ceremony lasts four days and occurs both inside a traditional Navajo house, called a hogan, and
in the surrounding area, where the girl will periodically run to ensure that she has a strong and healthy life. At
the beginning of the ceremony, as separation begins, the girl lies down and her family straightens her limbs
and helps dress her and prepare her for the transition. During the days of seclusion, there are many different
tasks as the girl is initiated into womanhood. On the third day, she and her mother will bake a corn cake called
an alkaan, and then, led by a Navajo medicine man or woman, they will sing prayer songs all night until the
sunrise. During the final stage of the Kinaaldá, in the morning of the fourth day, the mother washes her
daughter's hair and dries it with cornmeal (corn is a Navajo deity). The young woman will then take her last run
toward the east, now followed by many young children, so that she might eventually become a loving mother
whom her children will always follow. After the ceremony, she is reintroduced to her community as a woman
and not a child; she is now considered a young adult.

Not all rites of passage are religious. There are also secular rites of passage, such as graduation or
quinceañera, a celebratory birthday for 15-year-old girls in many Latin American communities. And
sometimes the religious and the secular are intermingled, as in a marriage ceremony that is both civil and
religious. Societies use both secular and religious rites of passage to mark changes in the life cycle of their
members.

Rites of Affliction

Unlike rites of intensification and many rites of passage, rites of affliction are usually non-calendrical and
unplanned. Normally classified as healing rituals or petitions for supernatural intervention, these rites seek
remedy or compensation for the affliction. Whether directly through a shamanic journey or through the
mediation of a religious leader, communities petition the spirits or deity for healing or a blessing. While illness
and health in most Western societies are understood to be biomedical phenomena based on empirical
evidence, in non-Western societies and in localized religious traditions across cultures, well-being is viewed as
a relationship between body and soul and thus is believed to have a religious component.

While nonbelievers might refer to rites of affliction as superstition, a belief or practice that has no credible
evidence for its efficacy, for believers, these religious rites allow them to plead for help and sometimes control
the outcome of threatening life events. Rites of affliction, first described by vary greatly depending on the need.
People may perform witchcraft and sorcery to determine the source of affliction, exorcism to remove the
presence of an adverse spirit, or divination to identify the source of harm. Divination is a practice or test
420  13 · Religion and Culture

     intended to gain understanding, guidance, or advice about an event or situation. There are literally hundreds
     of different methods of divination. Some examples include scapulimancy (burning the shoulder blade of a cow
     or antelope and reading a message in the burn pattern), tasseomancy (reading tea leaves at the bottom of a
     cup), oomancy (rubbing an egg over an area of illness or pain and then breaking it open to read a pattern),
     bibliomancy (randomly opening the Bible or another book and seeking a message in whatever passage is on
     that page), reading tarot cards, and checking astrological signs.

     One common rite of affliction in the Christian tradition is the laying on of hands. This ritual appears in the
     Bible, used both as a means of conveying the Holy Spirit (Num. 27:15-23; Acts 8:14-19) and as an act of
     healing by Christ (Luke 4:40). Today, in many Pentecostal and Evangelical churches, congregations practice the
     ritual of laying on of hands. Believers place their hands on the shoulders or head of the congregant who seeks
     healing--whether from social, mental, or physical distress--in the belief that with fervent prayer and physical
     contact, the Holy Spirit can move from one individual to another to strengthen, heal, and anoint them with
     God's grace. Sometimes the "helpers" stand face-to-face or bend over the individual seeking help. Sometimes
     believers walk behind the individual in need, who sits in a chair, and then lay hands on their shoulders and
     pray, either silently or aloud so that the afflicted individual can hear the prayer being offered. In these acts, the
     religious community pools its spiritual and social resources and encourages the afflicted member--a powerful
     antidote to illness no matter the faith tradition.

     Although they are not exclusively associated with rites of affliction and are sometimes performed as acts of
     obedience, celebration, spiritual merit, enlightenment, or even penance, pilgrimage is often practiced as a rite
     to seek redress and healing. A sacred journey to a shrine or holy place, pilgrimage is practiced in many
     religions. Some of the most famous pilgrimages are the hajj, an Islamic pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia; the
     Christian pilgrimage to the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes, a site in France where Mary is believed to have
     appeared; and the Hindu pilgrimage to the River Ganges in India.

     Mohammed. At the center of the photo, note the Ka'aba, the symbolic dwelling place of Allah. (credit: "Holy Ka'ba"

     The hajj is one of the five pillars, or primary tenets, of Islam. For believers with the physical ability and
     financial means, completing the hajj to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, is essential to their faith. While the pilgrimage
     itself may occur at any time during the last three months of the Islamic calendar, the last five to six days of the
     12th month are those on which the most significant rituals occur. Based on the lunar calendar, the hajj is a
     movable feast, meaning it is a celebration whose dates vary each year and will occur in different seasons over a
     cycle of years. Because the Islamic calendar is a lunar calendar, it does not coincide annually with the
     Gregorian calendar followed by most of the Western world today.

Historically, pilgrims arrived by walking, using the travel time and its accompanying struggles to focus on
growing in their faith. Some individuals continue this traditional means of completing the hajj, but other
devotees arrive by boat, bus, or plane, dedicating themselves to contemplation once they arrive. Mecca is an
important symbolic place for Muslims because it was the birthplace of the Prophet Muhammad. During the
hajj ritual, the pilgrims will perform many faith acts, including circling the Ka'aba, a building at the center of
the mosque representing the most sacred place, seven times clockwise to open the ritual; praying; running
between the nearby hills of Safa and Marwah; clipping their hair; going east of Mecca to confess their sins and
seek atonement; gathering pebbles to perform a symbolic stoning of the devil; buying sacrifice vouchers so
that an animal will be sacrificed on their behalf; and then again circling the Ka'aba seven times, this time
counterclockwise, to close the hajj.

Utopian Religious Communities

While the most typical form of religious community today is a group of people who share a common faith and
set of beliefs and meet periodically to worship, there are other ways of creating religious community. One
example, widespread in the United States during the 19th century, is utopian religious communities. A utopian
community is a community intentionally established by a group of people seeking to live out their ideas of an
ideal society. Utopian communities may be secular or religious. The utopian communities that are most
successful share certain characteristics: they are physically separate from the larger society; establish a degree
of economic self-sufficiency, through either agriculture or industry; and have a clear authority structure and
ideology, or shared set of beliefs.

There have been dozens of utopian religious communities in American history. In the 19th century, many
people in Europe viewed the United States as a blank slate, a country unburdened by history or tradition. The
forced removal of Indigenous peoples opened up vast areas of land and natural resources to White settlers and
new religious groups seeking autonomy. While many of these societies were short-lived, impractical, and
troubled by discord, they were home to thousands of Americans during the 19th and 20th centuries. Today, we
still find small utopian communities throughout the United States, some based primarily on religion (such as
the Bruderhof) and others on sustainable economics (e.g., Serenbe in Fulton County, Georgia).

Religious utopian communities make particular religious beliefs the center of the community. Some such
communities separate themselves completely from secular society, while others establish an enclave, a so-
called heaven on Earth within the larger society, that members hope will spread outward and attract more
converts. Although utopian religious communities are relatively rare today, they do exist. The Amish, found
throughout the United States but primarily in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana, live in small, self-contained
farming communities built around very traditional Swiss German and Protestant roots. The Amish have what
they call a plain lifestyle based on simple technology, and they tend to separate themselves from the non-
Amish communities around them. The Hutterites, now located primarily in Canada, are also from German
Protestant roots and are much like the Amish, except they typically are more interactive with their non-
Hutterite neighbors and do not prohibit more modern technology. The Bruderhof are more recent utopian
religious communities, originating in the 1920s, also with German Protestant roots but now found in many
different places, including South America, Africa, Europe, Australia, and the United States. The Bruderhof have
a communal lifestyle based on biblical ideals, though they interact with communities around them. While they
do have Bruderhof industries, such as a furniture industry for special-needs children, they also work and study
in secular society.

Among the most successful of the 19th-century American religious utopian communities was the United
422  13 · Religion and Culture

     Society of Believers in Christ's Second Appearing, commonly known as the Shakers. Although they first formed
     near the city of Manchester in England in the mid-1700s, the group did not become a self-sustaining utopian
     community until after members immigrated to the United States in 1774. Their first settlement was
     established at Watervliet, New York, in 1776 under the leadership of an Englishwoman, Ann Lee. Mother Ann,
     as Shakers called her, and her original eight English followers traveled throughout New England seeking
     converts to join the community at Watervliet. Following Mother Ann's death in 1784, caused by beatings she
     received during her period of itinerant evangelism, the Shaker society began to develop a more formal
     structure that codified beliefs, social expectations, and a strict work ethic. By 1790, new members were
     required to sign covenants in which they pledged to consecrate all of their property to the society, work for the
     communal good of the group, follow a celibate life (with those who were already married ending their
     marriages prior to formally becoming a Shaker), and adhere to Shaker principles and beliefs. From a single,
     small settlement at Watervliet, Shaker societies grew and spread over 10 U.S. states--New York, Connecticut,
     Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Florida, and Georgia--with a membership at
     its height in excess of 6,000 individuals. Today, the Shakers survive as a single remaining society at
     Sabbathday Lake, Maine. There are now two remaining covenanted Shakers.

     The Shakers are a millennialist Christian faith, meaning that they believe that Christ has already returned and
     is present now on Earth as the Holy Spirit within believers. With Christ within them, Shakers believe that it is
     their duty to establish a heaven on Earth. The Shaker principles of faith historically encompass a range of
     social and religious tenets. They believe that God is dual, both male and female, and they practice gender
     equality, vesting leadership in both men and women since their beginnings in the late 18th century. They also
     embrace a commitment to racial equality. Even during the 19th century, as the Civil War raged throughout the
     United States, this included the practice of housing Black people and White people within the same
     community with equal access to resources. Shakers are dedicated pacifists, refusing to engage in warfare, and
     they commit to hard physical labor and self-improvement, taking as their motto a phrase attributed to Mother
     Ann: "Hands to work and hearts to God."

     The Shakers contributed a great deal to the material culture of the United States. Examples of products
     developed and successfully marketed by the group include paper seed packets (now used throughout the seed
     industry worldwide), their simple and graceful furniture, an improved washing machine, waterproof clothing,
     the circular saw, and medicinal herbs. Their artifacts, architecture, and music continue to be widely
     recognized and highly regarded. The Shaker song "Simple Gifts" (1848), borrowed and used by Aaron Copland
     in his ballet score Appalachian Spring (1944), has been performed at three U.S. presidential inaugurations.

     While there are few Shakers left today, they remind us of the importance of religion as an enduring institution,
     the power of religion to bind people together into common cause, and the rich diversities embedded in the
     heart of faith traditions.

Secular Religion

Secular religion is a system of beliefs held by a society that elevates social ideas, qualities, or commodities to a
metaphysical, semidivine status. Often, the group sees itself in terms of a divine image, creating a situation in
which, as Émile Durkheim famously said, "society = God." Various types and degrees of nationalism are a form
of secular religion in which a group shows honor, respect, and allegiance to the nation itself as a sacred entity.
For large and diverse societies, secular religion can create a powerful and enduring bond among otherwise
very different groups of people. Often, philosophical ideas and materialism itself have been at the center of
secular religion.

One of the most prominent examples of secular religion is nationalism, the belief that the nation-state and its
interests are more important than those of local groups. U.S. sociologist Robert Bellah (1967) studied secular
religion in the United States and documented the many ways that American society uses religious practices,
such as myth, ritual, and sacred space, to elevate the idea of the nation-state. During occasions such as
presidential inaugurations and the convocation of Congress, for example, it is routine to use sacred language
and prayer, elevating the nation-state to a privileged, sacred status, blessed, ordained, and legitimized by
religious imagery. Rituals such as raising the national flag while saying a pledge to the nation-state, flying flags
at full versus half-mast, and draping flags over the coffins of deceased service members are practices of
secular religion. Burials at nation-state cemeteries such as Arlington National Cemetery may be filled with
imagery of secular religion, including a caisson, a bugler, a drummer, and gun salutes.

Día de los Muertos

Experience of Marjorie Snipes, chapter author
424  13 · Religion and Culture

     In the Andean highlands of Argentina, most communities celebrate All Souls' Day, or Día de los Muertos (Day of
     the Dead), on November 1 and 2 every year. While this Catholic ritual commemorates the recently departed,
     usually those who have died in the past three years, it also includes elements of Indigenous religious practices
     and beliefs centered on Pachamama (Mother Earth). This integration of beliefs from more than one religious
     system is common across cultures and is called syncretism.

     The practice of Día de los Muertos is a solemn occasion. Families prepare a favorite meal or food items that
     they associate with the recently departed and set a place setting for their soul (alma). Candles and flowers
     adorn the elaborately decorated family table. The meal remains available for the soul of the departed from the
     evening of November 1 until the evening of November 2. During that time, family members meet periodically
     around the table to offer prayers and to share remembrances of the deceased, and souls are invited to eat and
     prepare themselves for the journey to the spirit world. Souls of the departed are believed to remain strongly
     attached to their families and unwilling to leave the living world for three years following death. They must be
     coaxed by surviving family members to make a peaceful transition to the spirit world, where they can rest. In
     the southern Andes, many people believe that moths are visual symbols of the soul's presence. With candles lit
     throughout the night of November 1, families in rural Andean households often encounter moths. This serves
     as ritual affirmation.

     On the evening of November 2, after a last prayer of departure, Andean families in El Angosto will gather the
     favorite foods of their departed and offer them to Pachamama by piling or burying the food into an altar of
     rocks. Each household has a family altar near their house, called a mojon, dedicated to Pachamama. It is a
     cairn predominantly consisting of white rocks, each believed to symbolize the goddess. The rocks may be
     naturally white, consisting of milky quartz, a common rock in the area, or they may be calcified or even
     painted white. During fieldwork, I asked people about the importance of the color white, but their answers
     were similar to the types of answers many of us would give to questions about our traditions: "This is her
     special color," "It's just this way," or "This is our custom." These truthful responses represent enculturation. As
     a scientist, though, I seek connections between the color white, stones, and Pachamama. I suspect there are
     several reasons that this color first began to be associated with Mother Earth: milky quartz is a common rock
     in the region and readily available; since the earth is considered to be Pachamama's body, the white rocks
     mimic the color of bone; and perhaps most significantly, the color white is associated with breast milk, a
     characteristic associated specifically with mothers. Understanding symbolism is important because it gives
     anthropologists a window into what matters most to those we are studying.

        MINI-FIELDWORK ACTIVITY

Participant Observation: Analysis of a Religious Service

Do fieldwork and an analysis of a religious service of your choice. With permission from the religious leader(s),
attend the service and practice participant observation. Using what you have learned about sacred place and
ritual, analyze the physical environment where the service is occurring. Where is/are the threshold(s)? Where
is the axis mundi? How does the built environment contribute to the practice of religion and spiritual
exercises? In the service itself, what are the primary themes, and how do different participant constituencies
respond to these? Does the service conform to any of the rituals that you studied in this chapter? If so, how?
After analyzing the service, reflect on your experience of doing this mini-fieldwork activity.

CHAPTER OUTLINE
14.1 Food as a Material Artifact
14.2 A Biocultural Approach to Food
14.3 Food and Cultural Identity
14.4 The Globalization of Food
INTRODUCTION The study of food has a long history in anthropology and weaves together various subfields
of the discipline. Among other things, food connects to nutrition and health, rituals and behaviors regarding
production and consumption, and worldwide trade networks and the related diffusion of plants, animals, and
artifacts. Distinguishing between what is and what is not food is a major concern within and across most
human cultures. Food varies not only from one society to another but also across genders, classes, family
groups, and seasons. As both a source of sustenance for the body and a means of establishing or advertising
one's social status, food plays a major role in personal and cultural identity. In globalized Western culture,
people regularly eat foods that originated in other cultures--such as sushi, gyros, tacos, spaghetti, and crepes,
to name just a few--but practices such as avoiding certain foods (food prohibitions) and even eating one's

     family members or enemies (forms of cannibalism) are cross-cultural food traditions that are likely less
     familiar.

     Culturally appropriate preparation and consumption of food requires a vast array of knowledge, artifacts, and
     rituals. In Figure 14.2, an Indigenous woman in Mexico is making tortillas, using a grinder and grindstone to
     transform corn into flour, which she then mixes with water to create a batter. Preparing flour in this traditional
     manner typically requires the cook to navigate various stages of food preparation, including choosing the best
     dried grains, nuts, spices, or herbs; assessing when a flour has reached the desired consistency; and physically
     being able to use the grindstone. The food utensils that the woman is using are not only tools but also symbols
     associated with the women who own and use them. Within families, these utensils may be passed down
     through generations. In some cultures, it is common for Indigenous women to inherit the grindstones of their
     mothers and grandmothers.

     stone) and the mano (the smaller, oblong stone) she used to grind dried corn into flour to create the batter for this

     14.1 Food as a Material Artifact

     LEARNING OUTCOMES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       · Describe archaeological evidence of food.
       · Identify some of the earliest stone tools associated with food preparation.
       · Explain ways that archaeologists identify early human foods.
       · Explain the relationship between archaeology and foodways research.
       · Discuss the relationship between food and cultural heritage.

     Food Artifacts

     The study of early human diets is important in understanding the evolution of the human species. The size and
     shape of our skulls and teeth are directly linked with culture and diet. As foods became softer over time
     (primarily due to the use of fire and cooking) and meat became more common in the human diet, the size of
     human dentition decreased. Along with this reduction in the size of teeth, cooked foods, especially meats,
     made increased calories and nutrition available and also prompted brain growth. The most direct evidence of
     meat eating among early humans is butcher marks found on bone, estimated to be from as early as 3.4-2.6
     million years ago (Wild 2019; Pobiner 2013). The earliest evidence of humans cooking a carbohydrate source
     is charred tubers recently identified by archaeologist Cynthia Larbey (Wild 2019) at Blombos Cave, in the
     Klasies River site in South Africa, and dated to 120,000 BP. Excavations at the archaeological site Shubayqa 1
     in Jordan have uncovered the earliest evidence of charred breadcrumbs, indicating that humans were baking

bread as early as 14,500 BP (Richter and Arranz-Otaegui 2018). From meat to potatoes to bread, humans and
their diets have adapted to changing ways of life.

In the archaeological record, food evidence takes many forms. It may be a hearth or pottery container with
food or drink residue, butchered animal bones, coprolites (fossilized fecal material), tools used in food
processing, baskets or pottery used for storing food, or even garbage dumps or shell middens (large
collections of discarded shells.) In historical sites, there may even be preserved food remains, such as corn
kernels or alcoholic beverages still enclosed in containers. Studying food helps anthropologists better
understand many aspects of human existence and culture, including the rhythms and activities of daily life,
food exchange and preparation, feasting, ritual activities, population density, length of settlement at a site,
division of labor, seasonal activities, diet and health, cultural traditions and preferences, and even social status
within a group. Food is connected with almost all human activities.

Early Archaeological Sites and Food Utensils

By the emergence of Homo habilis around 2.6 million years ago, early human settlements were typically
littered with the debris of stone tools that were most likely used in food production. There is evidence of tools
that were used for hunting, skinning, crushing, slicing, and grinding. These earliest tools were chipped and
flaked from pieces of stone to create objects that had both an edge and a point. As tools evolved and became
more specialized, they became increasingly focused on specific aspects of food procurement and production.

Unfortunately, relatively little study has been done on tool production and its relationship to food preparation.
Historically, utensils and food preparation have received little attention in scholarly research, likely because
daily food preparation is part of domestic work, frequently associated with women, and often occurring as a
private household activity. As archaeologists have somewhat recently turned their attention to the evolution of
food production tools, they have begun to note interesting regional cultural patterns. Recent studies of
grinding tools in the Near East, where cereal production first emerged, have called attention to "untapped
potential in the understanding of food production" (Ebeling and Rowan 2004, 115).

Archaeologist Jennie Ebeling and her colleague Yorke Rowan have studied the evolution of grinding stones in
the Near East from the Upper Paleolithic period (38,000-8000 BCE) into the Iron Age (1200-1000 BCE). Using
a diverse collection of evidence, including excavated artifacts and archaeological sites, tomb paintings, written
sources, and even ethnographic studies, they have formed a better understanding of the role of stone grinding
tools in ancient Near Eastern food production. The earliest stone grinding tools were of two basic types: an
earlier form consisting of mortars, deep concave bowl-like surfaces, paired with pestles, small oblong-shaped
hand grinders (see Figure 14.3); and a later form that featured hand stones and grinding slabs (see Figure
14.4). Using residue studies, the chemical analysis of small amounts of materials left intact on surfaces,
Ebeling and Rowan'determined that both types of grinding tools were used for not only nuts and cereals but
also meat, bark, minerals, salt, and herbs. In some cases, they have been able to determine the origins of the
grinding materials, which include locally sourced stone and much-sought-after basalt, a rugged igneous rock
that resists the type of degradation that would leave small flakes of debris in the meal.

Ebeling and Rowan's study of grinding tools revealed a great deal about life in the Near East. By the emergence
of the Neolithic Period around 10,000 BCE, some stone tools were beginning to be decorated with distinct
geometric patterns and fashioned with pedestaled feet, developments in art and adornment that likely indicate
emerging differences in social status between families. Dental and skeletal studies shed further light on the
use of these tools. Dental decay accelerated during the Neolithic Period, suggesting increased consumption of
carbohydrates such as cereal grains, which convert to sugar during the digestive process. Additionally, skeletal
wear patterns (specifically compressed toes, which distort the alignment of the foot) are evident on the
remains of women and young girls, most likely indicating that females were doing extensive daily work
grinding cereals.

     Ancient Foodways and Food Reconstructions

     Anthropologists are interested in foodways, a term used to describe a society's collection, production, and
     consumption of food. There is a particular interest in understanding how culinary traditions shape identity. It
     is not uncommon for archaeologists and cultural anthropologists to attempt to reconstruct food practices of
     the cultures they are studying, utilizing different types of clues. While written accounts, artwork, and visible
     food remnants help tell the story of a culture's foodways, anthropologists also use residue studies of traces of
     food and drink in pottery, baskets, and gourds and stable isotope analysis of human bones and teeth, in which
     they measure isotopes (radioactive elements found naturally in food) to determine the diet of an individual
     and the environment in which they lived. These clues to ancient foodways can reveal a great deal about daily
     life.
     Archaeologist Lisa Duffy has studied ancient Maya cuisine using residue from pottery and grinding stones.
     Residues include many kinds of trace materials left behind on the artifacts, such as charred remains on the
     sides of a cooking pot or microscopic plant or animal remains on the surface of a vessel. So far, residues have
     been successfully recovered from seven ancient Maya sites across Guatemala and Belize, some dating from as
     early as 600 BCE. Some of the chemicals that have been identified indicate use of chili pepper, cacao,
     chocolate, and tobacco, among other herbs and spices. While chocolate compounds have been found on
     culinary artifacts from many different social strata, most other residues are specifically associated with
     certain social classes. Through studies such as this, foodways help scientists better understand the social
     differences and lifestyles of early cultures.

Foodways can also be explored by reconstituting foods in order to better understand their chemical and
sensual characteristics. In one experiment, physicist Seamus Blackley and his colleagues, archaeologist
Serena Love and microbiologist Richard Bowman, developed a technique to extract hibernating yeast
microbes left behind on porous Egyptian ceramics. These yeast microbes were dated to 4,500 years ago. The
first step in their experiment was to sequence the yeast's genome (i.e., map each of its genetic markers),
through which they determined that it was not genetically the same as modern yeast and that it was as old as
they had originally thought. The researchers then fed the yeast einkorn flour, made from a kind of wheat that
would have existed at the time the yeast was originally active. As Blackley reported, "The yeast woke up right
away.... It was kind of remarkable" (Blackley, Love, and Bowman 2019). The resulting bread was fine grained
and well risen, with a pungent odor of brown sugar. Using experimental techniques such as these,
archaeologists are able to tap into smells, tastes, and textures that were part of ancient foodways and may no
longer exist in our cuisine today.

Food as Cultural Heritage

Sometimes, anthropologists find it useful to distinguish between the terms culture--which, as discussed in
Chapter 3, The Concept of Culture, can be defined as beliefs, behaviors, and artifacts that a group uses to adapt
to its environment--and cultural heritage, which comprises traditions passed down for generations and used
as a way of identifying a group of people. In state societies peopled by diverse cultural groups, it is common for
food to be used to distinguish one group from another. "Those people" eat "those things," and "my people" eat
"these things." Later in this chapter, we will examine how national identities are shaped by food, but ethnic
groups also define themselves by differences in food choices and food preparation. Within American culture,
there are a number of familiar connections between certain groups and certain foods: the Pacific Northwest
Coast Indigenous peoples and salmon; Jewish residents of New York City and bagels; people of German
ancestry in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and brats; residents of San Francisco's Chinatown and steamed pork
buns--to name just a few.

While archaeologists are at work using various techniques to better understand the foodways of ancient
cultures, some contemporary peoples are focused on reviving their own culinary heritages. Reviving and
restoring seeds, recipes, and even early cooking techniques are part of learning more about earlier
populations, diverse foodways, and traditional and perhaps once-lost flavors. For some people, this
rediscovery is also a way of asserting or reclaiming their cultural identity.

Cherokee Ramps

Early studies of the foodways of the Eastern Band of Cherokee mention the prevalence of ramps, wild leeks that
are similar to wild onions and grow in the Appalachian region of the United States. Ramps (Allium tricoccum)
are eaten from the time they begin to sprout in March almost until they bloom in April or May. The bulb is
eaten raw or is chopped up and fried with eggs. Some parboil the entire plant, and in recent years, ramps have
been canned or deep-frozen by some Cherokee families. (White 1975, 324-325)

Used as a supplementary food by the Cherokee for generations and eventually adopted by European settlers in
the Appalachians, ramps today continue to serve as a link to cultural identity. In his ethnographic research on
the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Nation, anthropologist Max White (1975) explained that the Cherokee view
plants as having agency, the ability to make choices about where to grow and whether to intervene to help
people. The Cherokee cultivate relationships of respect with the native flora around them as part of an
enduring relationship with their environment.
436  14 · Anthropology of Food

     FIGURE 14.5 Ramps, wild leeks that are similar to wild onions, have long been an important part of Cherokee
     foodways. They are now increasingly in demand for urban cuisine as well. (credit: "Patch of Ramps" by Wendell
     Smith/flickr, CC BY 2.0)

     Ramps, long valued as one of the first edible green plants to ripen in the spring, are prized by many people for
     their flavor and reported medicinal value for treating common colds, earaches, and circulatory disease (Rivers,
     Oliver, and Resler 2014, 7). Cherokee citizen and anthropologist Courtney Lewis (2012) has studied the recent
     legal and ethical issues surrounding the collection of ramps in the Qualla Boundary, U.S.-designated Cherokee
     land in North Carolina. Because the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP) borders the western part
     of the Qualla Boundary, there had been a long-standing informal agreement allowing Cherokee citizens to
     collect traditional foods within the park as long as their collection did not endanger any species. Up until 2009,
     the relationship between the National Park Service (NPS) and the Eastern Band of Cherokee had been
     primarily amicable. However, in 2007, the NPS had decided to prohibit all harvesting of ramps within the
     GSMNP, based on an earlier study by an NPS botanist that warned that unregulated foraging could endanger
     some plant species. They began issuing citations in 2009, and on March 22 of that year, the NPS arrested a
     Cherokee family that was harvesting ramps, supposedly within park boundaries.

     During the trial, there were many inconsistencies in the testimony and misunderstandings between the
     various parties, with the court often privileging Western scientific knowledge over Indigenous knowledge
     (Lewis 2012, 110). Cherokee scholars and elders pointed out that ramp production is cyclical, consisting of
     high production years followed by recovery cycles; that Indigenous harvesting techniques, which take just the
     stems and leaves instead of the roots, are different from those of non-Indigenous harvesters and allow for
     sustainable growth; and that many of the less productive ramp areas were not within traditional Cherokee
     foraging zones. Many of the zones in which ramps were deemed most threatened were outside of the
     traditional foraging areas and were most likely being harvested by non-Indigenous people meeting the
     demand for ramps in nearby upscale restaurants. In addition, given the increasing levels of air pollution and
     ongoing climate change, many wild plants in the Great Smoky Mountains are facing threats from sources other
     than local foraging. Although the trial ended with the Cherokee family charged for trespassing on federal
     lands, the legalities of ramp collection continue to be debated today.

     While the controversies surrounding ramp collection have not completely subsided, there is increasing
     recognition of the importance of Indigenous foodways and cultural identity. Today, around 50 percent of U.S.
     national parks, including the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, allow some form of foraging within their
     boundaries (Linnekin 2019), regulated by all sorts of rules, guidelines, and informal agreements with local and
     Indigenous populations. The Eastern Band of the Cherokee Nation monitors ramps as part of its natural
     resource management in the Qualla Boundary and continues to negotiate for foraging rights on ancestral lands
     that the Cherokee deem to have belonged to them for thousands of years, now cut off by the national park. For

many Cherokee families, foraging sites and trails are family secrets that have been passed down for many
generations. In 2019, the GSMNP entered into a new agreement with the Eastern Band of Cherokee to allow its
citizens to gather sochan, a kale-like plant located within park boundaries (Chávez 2019). Today, Cherokee still
gather ramps within park boundaries in designated areas, but those gathering for non-subsistence needs are
required to have a gathering permit issued by the GSMNP.

There are many examples of foods and dishes that are considered important to preserving ancestral identities.
In 2006, UNESCO, the educational and cultural group of the United Nations, convened a working group to
establish lists of intangible cultural heritage and a register of good safeguarding practices
(https://openstax.org/r/ich.unesco) as a way to recognize and preserve the cultural traditions of humanity.
Several special foods and cooking traditions are included on the lists as examples of endangered cultural
heritage, such as flattened sourdough bread from Malta, oshi palav (a pilaf made with vegetables, rice, and
meat) from Tajikistan, and the cultivation of the date palm in Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, and other areas of the
Middle East.

It is not uncommon for a family to have special recipes and meals that they serve on holiday occasions as a way
of remembering their past and of passing on traditions to new generations. Does your family follow any food
traditions as a way of remembering your ancestors? Take a moment to consider the different roles that food
plays in your own family.

14.2 A Biocultural Approach to Food

LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Identify a biocultural approach.
  · Describe Three Sisters cropping as an Indigenous adaptation.
  · Identify the various types of evidence that anthropologists use to reconstruct ancient foodways.
  · Describe how contemporary dietary approaches connect with ancient foodways.

Food and the Biocultural Approach

Many anthropologists take a biocultural approach to their study of food, looking at how food plays both a
cultural and a biological role in human lives. Food provides physical nourishment of our bodies and also a
means of understanding who we are. How people procure and prepare foods and which foods are deemed
appropriate for which occasions are important parts of cultural identity. Food is thus an area that weaves
together the biological and cognitive aspects of our lives--an observation captured by the familiar phrase "you
are what you eat." Although the biocultural approach continues to focus on food and identity, it also includes
an emphasis on the nutritional science of food.

The biocultural approach can be applied to the study of food in many ways, from research into subsistence
practices and traditional ways of raising crops to analysis of how groups assign meaning to the food of other
cultures. As popular cultural artifacts, food-related knowledge and practices are shared from culture to culture
as groups seek additional health benefits and food variety.

Subsistence and Biocultural Adaptation

Cereals (including corn, wheat, barley, and rice) and legumes (various types of beans) are the most common
crops grown by subsistence farmers because they are versatile and economical and have a wide range of
health benefits. In addition to carbohydrates, protein, vitamins, minerals, and fiber, they provide a substantial
number of calories. In other words, cereals are a good investment of labor and have long-term health benefits.
Indigenous peoples around the world have long been aware of the potential in these foods.

By the time Europeans arrived in the Americas, Indigenous peoples of North and Central America had been
selectively breeding domesticated plants for thousands of years. Over many generations, the Indigenous
peoples of the Americas had developed a detailed understanding of the health benefits and the risks
associated with certain plants and the ways in which plants could be grown together to sustain higher yields.
The "Three Sisters" is one traditional cropping system that grows specific plants near one another--usually
438  14 · Anthropology of Food

     some combination of corn, beans, and squash--so that each aids and supports the others' growth. This
     approach of placing plants of different types together in such a way as to benefit the growth of each is known as
     intercropping. While variations on the Three Sisters are found throughout Indigenous groups in North and
     Central America, the Haudenosaunee's use of the practice has been particularly well studied.

     The Haudenosaunee people (also known as the Iroquois or Six Nations) of what is now the northern part of
     New York State practiced Three Sisters cultivation with maize, beans, and pumpkins, which are a form of
     squash. Seeds from each of these crops were planted together in small mounds in an unplowed field. Each
     mound contained several maize seeds in the middle, with bean and pumpkin seeds placed around the
     perimeter. (Note the difference from the row-based agriculture practiced on conventional American farms
     today.) Each of the plants in the mound offers a benefit to the others. The vigorous pumpkin vines, with their
     large leaves, quickly form a canopy that shades out weeds, preserves moisture in the soil, and prevents
     erosion. The bean plants, with the help of bacteria, are able to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it available as a
     fertilizer to the plants growing around them. And the fast-growing maize plants, which require lots of nitrogen
     for healthy growth, provide trellises for the climbing beans (Gish Hill 2020). In a 1910 study of Haudenosaunee
     culture, Arthur Parker, archaeologist and Iroquois historian, noted that these crops were planted together in
     part because the Haudenosaunee people believed they were "guarded by three inseparable spirits and would
     not thrive apart" (quoted in Mt. Pleasant 2016, 88). In the Haudenosaunee belief system, these three crops
     were believed to have been given to the people as gifts from the deities. The physical and spiritual sustenance
     provided by each food reminded the people of their cultural heritage each time they were consumed (Carnegie
     Museum of Natural History 2018). Although these foods were foundational to their diets, the Haudenosaunee
     added to the diversity of their cuisine through seasonal foraging of wild plants and animals.

     Jane Mt. Pleasant (2016), a horticulturist and specialist in Indigenous cropping systems, has studied the
     caloric yield (the total calories provided by the harvest) of crops planted using the Three Sisters technique. She
     has found that when planted together, the three crops yield as much as two to four times the amount of total
     calories and protein than they would if the plants were cultivated alone. Corn plants in particular show a
     significant increase in protein when combined with the other sisters (92).

     Today, sustainable farming techniques are increasingly valued by people concerned about the ecological costs
     of conventional farming. Sustainable farming techniques, many of them grounded in traditional practices,
     offer ways to produce higher food yields, reduce fertilizer costs, build healthier soils, and avoid genetically
     modified plants, which have had their DNA deliberately altered in a laboratory setting. Iowa State University
     currently sponsors a Three Sisters gardening project (https://openstax.org/r/threesistersproject), which works
     collaboratively with Native American communities to raise awareness of the techniques, nutritional benefits,
     and cultural values of traditional intercropping methods. The project makes a point of working with heirloom

seed varieties, which are seeds that are not genetically modified, are open pollinated (meaning that the seeds
can be saved for generations and will continue to breed true), and have been in existence for at least 50 years.
One of their goals is to return the seeds to their home communities (Gish Hill 2020). There are many benefits
to using heirloom seeds, including better flavors, better adaptation to local environmental conditions, the
ability to save seeds to be grown in subsequent years, and increased genetic diversity, which contributes to
long-term sustainability.

Increasingly, there is increased interest in new foods and cuisine worldwide. Many of these rediscovered foods
originate in the histories of Indigenous cultures. Using oral tradition, historical documents, and even genetic
analyses, both Western and non-Western peoples are increasingly seeking to revive culinary heritage:

      Many Indigenous people are now on a path of rediscovery, preservation, and reinvention of these
      staple foods. The Three Sisters are experiencing a culinary resurgence after decades of lost knowledge
      due to forced relocation, cultural oppression, and genocide. Numerous tribes have found renewed
      health and spiritual bonds through efforts to sustain, cultivate, and cook with the Three Sisters.
      (Murphy 2018)

Food, Fads, Diets, and Health

In the fifth century BCE, the Greek historian Herodotus wrote about the Macrobians, a cultural group living in
what is now southern Ethiopia who were supposed to have found a mythical "fountain of youth" in which
people could bathe and become young again. Herodotus had heard that the Macrobians lived to be 120 years
old and consumed only boiled fish and milk. Trying to explain the myths he had heard, he surmised that diet
and special waters must have been the cause of their longevity. While this was not likely the first time that
someone claimed a secret elixir or remedy for physical aging and illness, it is one of the earliest recorded
dietary myths. Many more would follow. In 1558, Venetian patron of the arts Alvise Cornaro authored a best
seller titled Discorsi della vita sobria, variously translated into English as Sure and Certain Methods of
Attaining a Long and Healthful Life and Discourses on a Sober and Temperate Life, among other titles. In this
text, he makes the following claims about human health:

      This sobriety is reduced to two things, quality, and quantity. The first, namely quality, consists in
      nothing, but not eating food, or drinking wines, prejudicial to the stomach. The second, which is
      quantity, consists in not eating or drinking more than the stomach can easily digest; which quantity
      and quality every man should be a perfect judge of by the time he is forty, or fifty, or sixty; and,
      whoever observes these two rules, may be said to live a regular and sober life. This is of so much virtue
      and efficacy, that the humours of such a man's body become most homogeneous, harmonious, and
      perfect; and, when thus improved, are no longer liable to be corrupted or disturbed by any other
      disorders whatsoever. (Cornaro 1779, under "A Compendium of a Sober Life")

History offers a long line of pseudoscientists, tonic peddlers, tinkerers, and even some thoughtful people
hawking medicinal potions and diets reputed to solve every imaginable health problem. Many contained
ingredients that are now widely recognized as harmful. In the late 19th century, a concerned consumer could
try Mrs. Winslow's Soothing Syrup for teething children, which contained morphine and alcohol; Cocaine
Toothache Drops; or a cocaine-infused wine called Vin Mariani, which was used in Europe for depression,
malaria, and loss of appetite (Mitchell 2019).

New religious or philosophical movements were often associated with new diets intended to improve both
physical and moral health. In the United States, the Graham diet enjoyed a period of popularity in the 19th
century. The diet revolved around the consumption of graham, a flour made of the whole-wheat berry,
including the bran covering. It was developed in the 1830s by Sylvester Graham, an evangelical minister
touted by Ralph Waldo Emerson as the "prophet of bran bread" (Lobel 2012). Advertised as a remedy for sexual
desire and gluttony, Graham's diet included various elements that constitute sound dietary advice even today:
eat only two meals a day, and eat in moderation; use no spices, meat, alcohol, or tobacco; and consume lots of
fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, including lots of graham. This diet became wildly popular in the
mid-1800s, with religious groups such as the Shakers, the Christian Scientists, and the Seventh Day Adventists
supporting aspects of this diet. Today, Sylvester Graham's contribution to the American diet is still evident in
the graham cracker.
440  14 · Anthropology of Food

     When the World Health Organization (WHO) was established in 1948, it fundamentally changed the way people
     think about health and diet. Compiling comparative data on health and lifestyle from around the world, the
     WHO engendered a greater awareness of health disparities between populations and a rising interest in the
     link between health and lifestyle. Noting that both chronic disease rates and average life spans varied greatly
     among cultural and national groups, people began to make connections between diet and health. Perhaps
     there was something to be learned from societies in which people enjoyed longer lives and had lower rates of
     chronic illnesses such as heart disease and diabetes. And so began a proliferation of healthy diets. Two of the
     most noteworthy today are the Mediterranean diet and the paleo diet.

     FIGURE 14.7 The Mediterranean diet relies on fruits, vegetables, and olive oil, with very limited amounts of meat
     or saturated fats. This "Mediterranean Salad" is light and nutritious. (credit: "Mediterranean Salad / Ensalada
     Valenciana" by Lablascovegmenu/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 2.0)
     The Mediterranean diet is based on long-held dietary traditions in countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea.
     It was first presented formally as a healthier way of eating by U.S. physiologist and nutritionist Ancel Keys at a
     WHO meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1955. Keys described the particular culinary practices found in the
     Mediterranean region and noted their related health benefits. These practices include high consumption of
     fruits, vegetables, and olive oil and low consumption of meats and saturated fats. Today, the Mediterranean
     diet is still recommended for improving cardiovascular health and blood cholesterol levels. In a recent study of
     26,000 women (Ahmad et al. 2018), data showed that the risk of developing cardiovascular disease was 25
     percent lower over 12 years among those following the Mediterranean diet (The Nutrition Source 2018).
     Near Eastern archaeologist Oded Borowski (2004) has researched the origins and history of the Mediterranean
     diet. Textual sources, especially biblical texts, and an array of archaeological artifacts from across the region
     describe traditional foodways in the Middle East very similar to those still prevalent today--a diet consisting
     primarily of cereal grains, herbs, fruit, bread, oil, and fish, with occasional meat. Archaeological artifacts also
     point to a great deal of dietary continuity in this part of the world. Food processing and subsistence tools such
     as grinding stones, churns, nets, fishhooks, and sinkers; storage jars with food residues of substances such as
     grain, yeast, and wine; middens with preserved food remains in ancient garbage; and animal fossils of a
     variety of freshwater and saltwater fish all indicate the long historical trajectory of and cultural preference for
     these foods. This culinary tradition continues today throughout the Mediterranean area, including the Middle
     East, North Africa, and southern Europe (notably Italy and Greece).

FIGURE 14.8 The paleo diet is based on contemporary ideas of how our hunting and gathering ancestors might
have eaten. It includes lean meats, fruits, vegetables, and nuts. Here, the meat kabobs are lying on a bed of
vegetables. (credit: "IMG_0308.JPG" by Michael Arrington/flickr, CC BY 2.0)

Another very popular diet today, based partially on cultural and nutritional studies, is the paleo diet,
sometimes called the Paleolithic diet, the caveman diet, or the Stone Age diet. This diet was first developed in
the 1970s by gastroenterologist Walter Voegtlin, who argued that our bodies (and our digestive systems) have
been evolutionarily designed for a hunting-and-gathering way of life. The paleo diet is made up of foods that
are traditionally associated with this hunting-and-gathering lifestyle--fruits, vegetables, lean meats, fish, nuts,
and seeds. The Mayo Clinic, one of the best-known US medical research centers, describes the paleo diet in
this way:

      The aim of a paleo diet is to return to a way of eating that's more like what early humans ate. The diet's
      reasoning is that the human body is genetically mismatched to the modern diet that emerged with
      farming practices--an idea known as the discordance hypothesis. (Mayo Clinic Staff 2020, under
      "Purpose")

Biological anthropologists have done significant research on the foodways of Paleolithic-era people across
different geographical areas. A great deal can be determined about what these early people likely ate using
various means. Among these means are zooarchaeology (the study of the fossilized remains of animals),
human anatomy and physiological studies, ethnographic studies of contemporary hunters and gatherers, and
analysis of artifacts, coprolites (fossilized feces), and human skeletal and dental remains. Although there
seems to have been a great deal of difference in the specific types of vegetables, fruits, meats, and fish that
were eaten in various cultures, in general, Paleolithic diets and lifestyles were marked by low levels of fat
consumption; high levels of food diversity, including some raw foods; and high levels of physical activity. Not
all the paleo diets in circulation today follow these same guidelines. While anthropological research indicates
that the actual Paleolithic diet likely consisted of 65 percent plant-based foods and 35 percent animal-based
foods, many contemporary paleo recipes and prescriptions do not follow this formula strictly (Chang and
Nowell 2016). In their research on the paleo diet, biological anthropologist Melanie Chang and Paleolithic
archaeologist April Nowell encourage anthropologists to become more involved in current conversations about
Paleolithic lifestyles and what they might suggest about a healthy human diet. There is, perhaps, still more we
can learn about the real paleo diet.

Regardless of our contemporary diet practices, we can learn a lot from our ancestors. Their foodways,
lifestyles, and traditional knowledge offer windows into both the evolution of our bodies and ways of eating
that promote health and longevity. The information offered by anthropology's study of different cultures and
historical periods can supplement our own knowledge base as we seek ways to improve our lives today.

     George Armelagos
     1936-2014

     Personal History: Born in Detroit, Michigan, George Armelagos (https://openstax.org/r/armelagos-george)
     earned his BA in anthropology from the University of Michigan and his MA and PhD from the University of
     Colorado Boulder. During his career, he taught at the University of Utah, the University of Massachusetts, the
     University of Florida, and finally at Emory University, where he was a distinguished professor of anthropology.

     Area of Anthropology: Armelagos took a biocultural approach to understanding ancient human diseases,
     examining skeletal remains to reconstruct how human behavior intersected with disease and nutrition in
     early populations. His areas of focus were wide ranging and included nutritional anthropology, disease in
     human evolution, race and racism, skeletal biology, and medical anthropology. He was a pioneer of
     paleopathology, the study of ancient human disease. His research also extended into contemporary foodways
     and nutrition. His book Consuming Passions: The Anthropology of Eating (1980), which he coauthored with
     Peter Farb, was one of the first anthropology texts devoted wholly to the study of food. Armelagos also had an
     abiding interest in cooking and was a master chef who loved entertaining his friends.

     Accomplishments in the Field and Importance of His Work: Armelagos's contributions to anthropology
     bridge the subfields of biological, archaeological, and cultural anthropology. He was also an accomplished
     professor who taught and mentored students throughout his career and even after retirement. He received
     numerous awards for research and service, including the Viking Fund Medal for distinguished research in
     physical anthropology, awarded by the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research in 2005. In
     2008, he was awarded the Franz Boas Award for Exemplary Service to Anthropology by the American
     Anthropological Association. This annual award recognizes extraordinary achievements that have served the
     anthropological profession and the community beyond by applying anthropological knowledge to improve
     lives. In 2009, Armelagos was awarded the Charles R. Darwin Lifetime Achievement Award in the subfield of
     biological anthropology. His research and mentorship advanced the biological and cultural study of our

     14.3 Food and Cultural Identity

     LEARNING OUTCOMES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       · Describe the relationship between food and cultural identity.
       · Contrast food prescriptions with food proscriptions.
       · Illustrate the connection between food and gender.

     Food and Cultural Identity

     Food travels across cultures perhaps more often and with more ease than any other tradition. Sometimes food
     carries with it related culinary practices (such as the use of chopsticks), and sometimes foods mix with
     existing culinary traditions to form new syncretic cuisines (such as Tex-Mex food, which evolved from a
     combination of Mexican and US Southwest food traditions). Like culture itself, foods are shared within and
     move between communities, adapting to changing circumstances and settings. Although it is adaptable, food is
     also tightly linked to people's cultural identities, or the ways they define and distinguish themselves from
     other groups of people. As part of these cultural identities, the term cuisine is used to refer to specific cultural
     traditions of cooking, preparing, and consuming food. While urban areas tend to shift and adapt cuisine more
     frequently than rural areas, those aspects of cuisine most tightly linked to identity tend to change slowly in all
     settings.

FIGURE 14.9 Japanese short-grain rice plays an important role in Japanese identity. Here, short-grain rice is
served with a beef curry. (credit: Ocdp/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)

In her research on Japanese food and identity, cultural anthropologist, and Japanese scholar Emiko Ohnuki-
Tierney (1993, 1995) explores the sociocultural construction of rice as a dominant metaphor for the Japanese
people. Using evidence from official decrees, taxation documents, myths, rituals, woodblock prints, and poetry,
Ohnuki-Tierney traces the long history of rice cultivation in Japan. Introduced from China, rice agriculture
began during the Yamato period (250-710 CE). While the Chinese preferred long-grain rice, the Japanese
cultivated short-grain rice, which they considered the only pure form of rice. During this period, a series of
myths connecting short-grain rice to Japanese deities emerged in folktales and historical
documents--evidence of Japanese efforts to distinguish themselves from the Chinese, who also relied on rice
as an important source of calories. Over the years, rice developed into a staple crop that Japanese landowners
used as a form of tax payment, indicating strong connections between Japanese land, Japanese short-grain
rice, and the Japanese landowning elite. By the early modern period (1603-1868), as Japan became
increasingly urban and eventually industrialized, agricultural life declined. People moved off the land and into
cities, and rice began to take on new meanings. Symptomatic of a cultural identity strongly rooted in national
history, rice became an increasingly sacred symbol of Japanese identity--a cultural memory with a long
history that consistently tied being Japanese to eating domestic Japanese rice. As Japan opened to interactions
with Western nations, the Japanese continued to use rice as a metaphor for national identity: while the
Japanese referred to themselves as "rice-eaters," they referred to Western peoples as "meat-eaters."

For years, Japan has had a ban on importing any foreign-grown rice, even California export rice, which is
primarily the Japanese short-grain variety and available at a significantly lower price. In 1993, Japan suffered
a growing season that was colder and wetter than normal and had a low-producing rice harvest. US rice
exporters were able to negotiate a trade deal allowing some limited rice exports to Japan. Yet most of this rice
remained in warehouses, untouched. Japanese people complained that it was full of impurities and did not
taste good. Today, on average, Japanese people consume only about 160 grams of rice daily, half of what they
consumed 40 years ago (Coleman 2017). Yet their cultural and symbolic connection with domestic Japanese
rice remains strong. Japanese short-grain rice is still referred to as shushoku, "the main dish" (Ohnuki-
Tierney 1993, 16)--the symbolic centerpiece, even though it is now more frequently a small side dish in a more
diverse cuisine. Ohnuki-Tierney notes that rice plays a particularly important role in the Japanese sense of
community:

      Not only during ritual occasions, but also in the day-to-day lives of the Japanese, rice and rice
      products play a crucial role in commensal activities. Cooked white rice is offered daily to the family
      ancestral alcove. Also, rice is the only food shared at meals, served by the female head of the
      household, while other dishes are placed in individual containers. Rice stands for "we," i.e., whatever
      social group one belongs to, as in a common expression, "to eat from the same rice-cooking pan,"
      which connotes a strong sense of fellowship arising from sharing meals. (1995, 229)
444  14 · Anthropology of Food

     Although the meaning of rice has shifted during different historical periods--from a comparison between
     short-grain Japanese and long-grain Chinese rice to a way to distinguish rice-eating Japanese from meat-
     eating Westerners, then to a measure of the quality of what is grown in Japanese versus less desirable
     imported rice--the Japanese continue to hold a cultural identity closely connected with rice. Being Japanese
     means eating Japanese rice still today.

     The relationship between food and cultural identity is readily apparent in Western societies. Most grocery
     stores have aisles containing goods labeled as "international foods" or "ethnic foods," and large urban areas
     often include neighborhoods featuring a conglomeration of restaurants serving diverse cuisines. In
     Washington, DC, the neighborhood of Adams Morgan is famous for its ethnic restaurants. Walking down the
     street, one might smell the mouthwatering aroma of injera, a sour, fermented flatbread from Ethiopia, or bún
     bò hu?, spicy lemongrass beef soup from Vietnam. Think about your own town and nearby urban areas. Where
     do you go to try new foods and dishes from other cultures?

     Food Prescriptions and Proscriptions

     As with all cultural institutions, there are various rules and customs surrounding food and eating. Many of
     these can be classified as either food prescriptions, foods that one should eat and are considered culturally
     appropriate, or food proscriptions, foods that are prohibited and not considered proper. These food
     regulations are social norms that connect production and consumption with the maintenance of cultural
     identity through food.

     In the previous section, you read about the importance of Japanese short-grain rice as a symbol of Japanese
     identity. For many Japanese people, short-grain rice is a food prescription, something that they feel they
     should eat. Food prescriptions are common across cultures and nation-states, especially in regard to special
     holidays. There are many examples: turkey on Thanksgiving in the United States, corned beef on St. Patrick's
     Day in Ireland, special breads, and candy figurines on Día de los Muertos in Mexico, saffron bread and ginger
     biscuits on St. Lucia Day in Sweden, or mutton curry and rice on Eid al-Fitr in Muslim countries. Food
     prescriptions are also common in the celebration of commemorative events, such as the cakes eaten at
     birthday parties and weddings, or the enchiladas and tamales prepared for a quinceañera celebrating a young
     Latin American woman's 15th birthday. Most of these occasions involve feasts, which are elaborate meals
     shared among a large group of people and featuring symbolically meaningful foods.

     One interesting example is the food eaten to mark the Dragon Boat Festival (Dragon Boat Festival, also called
     Duanwu), held in China on the fifth day of the fifth month of the Chinese lunar year. There are various origin
     stories for the Dragon Boat Festival. In one of them, the festival commemorates a beloved Chinese poet and
     government minister named Qu Yuan (ca. 340-206 BCE), who fell out of imperial favor and died by suicide,
     drowning himself. According to the story, people threw sticky rice dumplings into the river where he had
     drowned himself in order to distract the fish so that they could retrieve his body and give him a proper burial.
     The most important Dragon Boat food is zongzi, a sticky rice dumpling with different fillings, but the feast also
     traditionally includes eel, sticky rice cakes, boiled eggs, jiandui (a wheat ball covered in sesame seeds),

Food proscriptions, also called food taboos, are also common across cultures and contribute to establishing
and maintaining a group's identity. Often, these rules and regulations about what not to eat originate in
religious beliefs. Two examples are the vegetarianism practiced by many Hindus, which is grounded in the
spiritual principle of ahimsa (nonviolence in relation to all living things), and kashrut, a Jewish principle that
forbids mixing meat and dairy foods or eating pork or shellfish. Sometimes food proscriptions are active for
limited periods of time. For many Christians, especially Catholics, the 40 days of Lent, a period of religious
reflection commemorating the 40 days Jesus spent fasting in the desert, are a time when people give up
certain foods or drinks to make a symbolic sacrifice. For many Catholics, this means fasting (withholding a
measure of food) throughout the period and/or totally abstaining from meat on the special days of Ash
Wednesday and Good Friday:

      For members of the Latin Catholic Church, the norms on fasting are obligatory from age 18 until age
      59. When fasting, a person is permitted to eat one full meal, as well as two smaller meals that together
      are not equal to a full meal. The norms concerning abstinence from meat are binding upon members
      of the Latin Catholic Church from age 14 onwards. (United States Conference of Catholic Bishops n.d.)

Muslims observe Ramadan, a month-long commemoration of the prophet Muhammad receiving the
revelations of the Quran, by fasting every day from sunup to sundown. The Islamic fast entails a prohibition on
food and drink, including water. Every evening after sundown, Muslims eat a large meal that include fruits,
vegetables, and dates to rehydrate for the next day's fast.

Some food prohibitions are customary and tied more to ancient cultural traditions than religion. Many food
prohibitions pertain to meat. Among several East African groups, there is a prohibition against eating fish of
any kind. This is called the Cushitic fish taboo because the prohibitions are found among many, but not all,
cultural groups whose languages are part of the Cushite family, such as the Somali, Masaai, and Bantu peoples.
Horsemeat was historically consumed infrequently in the United States until it was outlawed in 2005,
primarily because of toxins in the meat related to the butchering process. Even before then, horsemeat in
mainstream US society was a food prohibition. However, it is consumed throughout Europe, where there are
butchers solely devoted to handling horsemeat.

     An interesting case of food rules and regulations across cultures is cannibalism, the act of eating an individual
     of one's own species. Although we do not usually think of human flesh as a menu item, in some cultures it is
     considered a kind of food, typically eaten as symbolic nutrition and identity. U.S. cultural and medical
     anthropologist Beth Conklin (1995) and Brazilian cultural anthropologist Aparecida Vilaça (2002) conducted
     research among the Wari' of western Amazonia in Brazil and found that prior to evangelization by Christian
     missionaries in the 1960s, the Wari' practiced two different types of cannibalism: endocannibalism, or eating
     members of one's own cultural group, and exocannibalism, or eating those who are "foreign" or outside of
     one's cultural group. Each form of cannibalism was associated with its own beliefs, practices, and symbolism.

     The Wari' belief system is based on the principle that only the Wari' are real people. All non-Wari' others,
     people and animals alike, are not humans and thus can be considered meat (Vilaça 2002, 358). When speaking
     of the practice recognized by anthropologists as exocannibalism, the Wari' did not consider themselves to be
     practicing cannibalism at all; they saw non-Wari' people as not fully human and classified them as a type of
     prey. Endocannibalism was understood differently. Endocannibalism among the Wari' was practiced as part of
     the mourning process and understood as a way of honoring a Wari' person who had died. Following a death,
     the immediate family of the deceased arranged for non-kin and relatives by marriage to dress and prepare the
     body by dismembering, roasting, and eating virtually all of it. Consuming the flesh of the deceased was
     considered the ultimate act of respect, as the remains were not buried in the ground but in the living bodies of
     other Wari'. Once eaten by non-family Wari', the deceased could transform from humans into spirits and
     eventually return as prey animals to provide food for the living. For Conklin, this practice indicates mutualism,
     or the relationship between people and animals through the medium of food and eating:

           For Wari', ... the magic of existence lies in the commonality of human and animal identities, in the
           movements between the human and nonhuman worlds embodied in the recognition through
           cannibalism of human participation in both poles of the dynamic of eating and being eaten. (Conklin
           1995, 95)

     Cannibalism has been associated with many cultures, sometimes accompanying warfare or imperial

expansion, as in the case of the Aztecs (Isaac 2002), and sometimes as a means of showing respect for and
establishing kinship with the deceased (see Lindenbaum 1979 for an example in Papua New Guinea). Although
there have been scholarly arguments around the nature and frequency of cannibalism (Arens 1979), there is
increasing evidence that this was a practiced norm in many human societies. Some religions also incorporate
symbolic cannibalism as a way of identifying with the deity.

Food can be deeply symbolic and plays an important role in every culture. Whether foods are prescribed or
prohibited, each culture constructs meanings around what they define as food and the emotional attachments
they have to what they eat. Consider your own plate when you next sit down to eat. What meanings are
attached to the different foods that you choose? What memories do different foods evoke?

Food and Gender

While food itself is a material substance, humans classify and categorize foods differently based on cultural
differences and family traditions. In many cultures, food is gendered, meaning some foods or dishes are
associated with one gender more than with the other. Think about your own culture. If you were cooking a meal
for only women or only men, would that influence the foods you chose to prepare? Although gender-specific
food choices are stereotypes of male and female dietary preferences and every person has their own individual
preferences, many social institutions and entertainment venues cater to gendered diets.

  · When the television show Man v. Food, a show devoted to "big food" and eating challenges, premiered on
      the Travel Channel in 2008, it had some of the highest ratings of any show on that channel. Many of the
      foods showcased are those stereotypically associated with men (burgers, potatoes, ribs, fried chicken), and
      the host participates in local food-eating competitions, highlighting regional cuisines around the United
      States. In this show, food functions as a sporting activity under extreme conditions.

  · Food delivery business GrubHub did a study of male and female ordering preferences in 2013-2014 at
      some 30,000 different restaurants in more than 700 US cities to "better understand takeout and delivery"
      (GrubHub 2018). In their results, they noted some significant differences between men's and women's
      ordering habits. Pizza was the most popular item for both men and women, but among other selections,
      women tended to order more healthy options, such as salads, sushi, and vegetable dishes, and men
      ordered more meat and chicken, with the most popular choices being General Tso's chicken, chicken
      parmesan, and bacon.

Food historian Paul Freedman traced the emergence of gendered foods and gendered food stereotypes in the
United States back to the 1870s, when "shifting social norms--like the entry of women into the
workplace--gave women more opportunities to dine without men" (2019b). Freedman notes that there was a
rapid development of restaurants meant to appeal to women. Many of these featured lighter fare, such as
sandwiches and salads, and some were referred to as "ice cream saloons," playing on a distinction between
them and the more traditional type of saloon primarily associated with men (Freedman 2015). There was also
growth in the recipe industry to provide women with home cooking options that allowed for quicker meal
preparation.

Gendering foods, a practice often associated with specific life stages and rituals, is found across cultures and
across time. In his study of marriage customs in the chiefdom of Batié in Cameroon, social anthropologist
Emile Tsékénis notes that the marriage is formalized by an exchange of gendered foods between the couple's
polygamous families:

      The groom offers raw "male" products (palm oil, plantain, and raffia wine) to the co-wives of the girl's
      mother, while the co-wives hand over the palm oil to the girl's father, and the girl's side offers "female"
      products (yams, potatoes, and/or taro) to the husband's side. (2017, 134)

This exchange of gendered foods between families mirrors the marriage ceremony and symbolically binds the
couple's families together.

Gendered foods are also common during puberty rituals in many cultures, especially for young women, as
female puberty is marked by the beginning of menstruation, an obvious and observable bodily change. In the
Kinaaldá, the Navajo puberty ceremony for young girls that takes place shortly after the first menstruation, the
girl and female members of her family together cook a corn cake in a special underground oven. The corn
448  14 · Anthropology of Food

     cake, called an alkaan, is understood as a re-creation of the first corn cake baked by the Navajo deity Changing
     Woman. After baking this first corn cake, Changing Woman offered a piece of it to the sun in gratitude for food
     and life. By reenacting this ritual, the young girl marks her own journey toward the creation of life, as she is
     now capable of becoming a mother.

     FIGURE 14.12 Ashes smolder in a firepit in preparation for baking the corn cake that is used to celebrate a Navajo
     girl's Kinaaldá (puberty) ceremony. (credit: "Campfire 1" by Jaroslav A. Polák/flickr, Public Domain)
     As we saw in Chapter 12, Gender & Sexuality, cultures may also celebrate foods that enhance sexuality. In some
     regions of Vietnam, there are restaurants that serve dog to male customers only, as dog meat is believed to
     enhance masculinity (Avieli 2011). Food contains and conveys many cultural beliefs. This can be compared to
     the joys attributed to chocolate in the United States, especially during the celebration of Valentine's Day. Do you
     have similar beliefs about food and sexuality?

     14.4 The Globalization of Food

     LEARNING OUTCOMES
     By the end of this section, you will be able to:

       · Describe the impacts of globalization on food and food diversity.
       · Define food deserts and food oases.

     Globalization of Food

     Most people, when they think about food, consider it a local, individual choice based on personal preferences
     and economic possibilities. But food is a global commodity marketed by transnational corporations, health
     institutes, advertising campaigns, and subtle and not-so-subtle cultural messaging through global media such
     as movies, television, and online video. Most often, what people choose to eat is based on underlying structures
     that determine availability and cost. While there are now hothouse businesses growing year-round fruits and
     vegetables, affordability often prohibits everyone from having access to fresh, ripe foods. Instead, mainstream
     grocery stores most often stock foods imported across long distances. Most fruits and vegetables sold in the
     grocery store were harvested unripe (and often tasteless) so that they would last the days and weeks between
     harvesting and purchase.

before they are ripe so that they will not spoil before arriving at a supermarket, often far from where they were
picked. (credit: Dr. Karl-Heinz Hochhaus/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 3.0)

In her work on food and globalization, anthropologist and food studies specialist Lynne Phillips points out the
"crooked pathways" (2006, 38) that food takes to become a global commodity. Increasingly affected by
transnational corporations, food today is marketed for endlessly higher profits. Food no longer goes simply
from producer to consumer. There are many turns along the way.

Food globalization has numerous effects on our daily lives:

  · The food chains from producers to consumers are increasingly fragile as a small number of transnational
      corporations provide the basic foods that we eat daily. Failures in this food chain might come from
      contamination during production or breaks in the supply chain due to climate crises, tariffs, or trade
      negotiations between countries. Our dependence on global food chains makes the food supply to our
      communities more vulnerable to disruption and scarcity.

  · Our food cultures are less diverse and tend to revolve around a limited number of mass-produced meats
      or grains. With the loss of diversity, there is an accompanying loss not only of food knowledge but also of
      nutrition.

  · As foods become more globalized, we are increasingly dependent on food additives to enhance the
      appearance and taste of foods and to ensure their preservation during the long journey from factory farm
      to table. We are also increasingly exposed to steroids, antibiotics, and other medicines in the meat we eat.
      This exposure poses health risks to large numbers of people.

  · As plants and animals are subjected to ever more sophisticated forms of genetic engineering, there is an
      increasing monopoly on basic food items, allowing transnational companies to affect regulatory controls
      on food safety. As corporate laboratories develop patented seeds (such as the Monsanto Corporation's
      genetically engineered corn) that are super-producers and able to withstand challenges such as harsh
      climate conditions and disease, growers become dependent on the seed sold by these corporations. No
      longer able to save seed from year to year, growers have little choice but to pay whatever price these
      corporations choose to charge for their genetic material.

  · Factory farming of all types, but especially large-scale animal farms, are major contributors to global
      warming. Not only do they produce large amounts of water and air pollution and contribute to worldwide
      deforestation, but as more and more forest is turned into pasture, the sheer number of livestock
      contributes significant levels of greenhouse gases that lead to global warming. Worldwide, livestock
      account for around 14.5 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions (Quinton 2019).

Food has long been an international commodity, even during the 17th and 18th centuries, when traders sought
spice and trade routes connecting Europe and Asia. Today, however, food has become transnational, with
production sometimes spanning many different countries and fresh and processed foods moving long
450  14 · Anthropology of Food

     distances from their original harvest or production. Because these migrating foods must be harvested early or
     packaged with preservatives that we may not know or even be able to pronounce, there has been a parallel
     development in local food movements, organic food movements, and farm-to-table establishments as people
     see the dangers of food globalization. In the very popular The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four
     Meals (2006), American author and food journalist Michael Pollan advocates that people should know the
     identity of the foods they eat and should make every effort to eat locally sourced products. Shortly after the
     book's publication, chef and author Jessica Prentice coined the term locavore to refer to those who eat locally
     and know the origins of their foods. In 2007, locavore was chosen as the New Oxford American Dictionary word
     of the year.

     Food Deserts and Oases

     Worldwide, access to nutritious and affordable foods is growing increasingly unequal. Areas with inadequate
     or unreliable access to nutritious foods are sometimes called food deserts. Food deserts present serious
     challenges to health and wellness in multiple ways and have been linked to eating disorders, obesity, and
     malnutrition. In Western nations, food deserts frequently correspond to other areas of social inequality, such
     as low-income and minority communities. Reduced availability of healthy and economical food often
     exacerbates many of the challenges these communities face.

     FIGURE 14.14 Food deserts are common in Western countries, especially in and around urban areas. This chart
     shows areas in the United States where significant percentages of people both have no car and no grocery store
     within a mile of their home, which is about a twenty minute walk for a healthy adult. (credit: United States
     Department of Agriculture and Centers for Disease Control/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)

     As the world population continues to grow (currently at around 7.9 billion people (https://openstax.org/r/
     world-population)), climate change accelerates, and food production becomes more and more concentrated in
     the hands of a few corporations, access to food will become increasingly critical to our survival. The story of
     progress embraced by Western society tells us that globalization and agricultural developments have
     stabilized and secured our food chains, but anthropological studies of foragers suggest otherwise. Agricultural
     production is tied to access to arable land, clean water, stable climate, and a reliable workforce. Periodically,
     crops (and animals) fail due to disease, drought, and even disruption from warfare and extreme weather,
     leading to scarcity and famine in many parts of the world. In addition, as families and communities produce
     less and less of their own food and become more and more dependent on intermediaries to gain access to food,
     their vulnerabilities increase. While there are many differences between state societies and foragers, there are
     valuable lessons we can learn from them. Foragers, facing the same unstable conditions that we all face
     worldwide, have a more varied and flexible diet and are able to adjust their needs seasonally based on local
     availability. They eat locally, and they adjust their needs to what is available.

     There are also food oases, areas that have high access to supermarkets and fresh foods, and these are growing
     in number. Some are in urban or suburban areas, and some are in rural areas where sustainable farming
     supports a local community or restaurant. In Harrodsburg, Kentucky, the Trustees' Table serves food from the
     nearby Pleasant Hill Shaker gardens. Visitors to the Shaker site, a historic cloistered religious community,
     learn about the Shaker seed industry, plant varieties, and sustainable gardening techniques at Shaker Farm,

then walk down to the Trustees' Table to have a farm-to-table meal. The seasonal menu features local
Kentucky dishes that would have been common fare during the period of Shaker occupation (1805-1910),
such as garlic potatoes, warm or cold salads, vegetable pot pies, and apple pie. By utilizing the foods raised in
the nearby gardens, the Trustees' Table serves as a legacy restaurant that helps preserve and sustain Shaker
research and farming on-site.

In Richmond, Virginia, an organization called Real Local RVA (https://openstax.org/r/reallocalrva) was founded
in 2014 as a grassroots local food movement to support businesses and residential areas in the downtown area
of the city. It expresses its core value as "collaboration over competition." The group sponsors monthly
meetings, local farm tours, and community events highlighting businesses and prominent figures in the local
food movement. The participants are all farmers, independent grocers, or local restaurants that source local
ingredients and products as part of their mission. Besides advocating for small farms and independent
businesses, Real Local RVA also sponsors workshops and education on sustainable farming, does joint
marketing and "storytelling" about its partnership and the values of local food networks, and provide a
recognizable brand to identify participating members for the wider urban community.

Although local food movements are increasingly popular, most still primarily operate in more affluent areas.
As we develop more of these healthy initiatives, we also must expand the zones in which they operate,
especially in cities, to include all of our neighbors and neighborhoods. Food and sociality go hand in hand. As
Michael Pollan writes, "The shared meal elevates eating from a mechanical process of fueling the body to a
ritual of family and community, from mere animal biology to an act of culture" (2008, 192).

The study of food in anthropology is important for many reasons. Food reveals cultural identities and physical
vulnerabilities, and it helps build social networks and mark important life events. How often eating is
prescribed, what foods are considered appropriate, who cooks, who serves whom, and what foods are most
and least valued all vary across cultures. As anthropologists seek to understand human cultures, food is often a
centerpiece ingredient in knowing who we are.

        MINI-FIELDWORK ACTIVITY

Food Memories

Food plays an important role in long-term memory, as it is linked to smell, taste, and texture and often is a
central feature of social functions, whether they be family dinners or holiday feasts. In this project, you will
interview two individuals who are likely to have different food memories than you; they may be older, they may
be living in a different part of the country (or world), or they may have lived part of their lives in a specific
environment (rural or urban) that is different from yours. Ask each person to share with you stories about
special holiday meals prepared and served as part of their family life, whether as a child or an adult. What
foods do they most identify with specific holidays? How did they prepare and consume those foods? Were there
specific gender roles during the preparation and holiday meals? After collecting and writing up what you have
learned, what conclusions can you make about the role of food in human social and cultural life?

INTRODUCTION "I am sorry I cannot show you my face. Because if I do, the bad guys will come for me." Who
is that masked man? That man is Anas Aremeyaw Anas, the famous investigative journalist from Ghana who
gave a TED Talk (https://openstax.org/r/gaveaTEDTalk) about how he "names, shames, and jails" those "bad
guys" (Anas 2013). Using controversial undercover methods, Anas has posed as a street hawker, a priest, a
patient in a mental facility, a janitor in a brothel, and a boulder. His investigations have revealed widespread
corruption in the Ghanaian judiciary, police service, electric company, Ministry of Youth and Sports, and
passport office as well as a Ghanaian orphanage. He has exposed cocoa smuggling, rebel invasions, human
trafficking, child slavery, torture of Africans in Thai prisons, unsanitary food production, forced prostitution,
458  15 · Anthropology of Media

     and abuse of people with mental illness in a hospital.

     Anas has become a kind of anti-corruption superhero in Ghana, combining anonymity and celebrity to force
     social change. While his undercover research is mostly in person, he publishes the reports of his investigations
     as videos, many of which are available for viewing on his website (https://openstax.org/r/anasaremeyawanas).
     He has become famous worldwide through the spread of these videos and the accumulation of interviews and
     commentary on his work that can be found on the Internet. His intriguing persona illustrates the complexities
     of identity in the digital era. Though many have attempted to unmask him, his "real" identity remains a
     mystery.

     As previous chapters have demonstrated, anthropologists are keenly interested in questions of identity and
     social action. The holistic approach leads anthropologists to consider how certain social, cultural, economic,
     and political conditions give rise to public figures such as Anas. Clearly, the phenomenon of Anas cannot be
     fully understood without attention to the functions of media at local, national, and global levels. At the local
     level, investigative journalism functions as a tool of anti-corruption, while global digital media function as a
     tool of celebrity. Are these two functions compatible or contradictory?

     A new field of media anthropology has emerged in the past few decades to address such pressing issues. This
     chapter explores the anthropology of mass media, including how media functions at local, national, and global
     levels. It also addresses how social conditions and cultural forces shape a variety of media genres, including
     news media, photography, radio, television, and the Internet. Just as anthropologists bring their unique
     approach to other fields, the distinctive methods and concepts of anthropology contribute complex, holistic
     insights to the study of media.

       · Define the basic function of media.
       · Distinguish basic media from mass media.
       · Describe the social phenomenon of technophilia.

FIGURE 15.2 Technophiles of the world. Modern communication technologies are widely used in most cultures of
the contemporary world. (credit: top left, "Sinaw, Bedouin Woman with Mobile Phone" by Arian Zwegers/flickr, CC

ECU/2020/Arcos" by UNICEF Ecuador/flickr, CC BY 2.0)

People today live in an era of technophilia--that is, an age when people embrace technologies and incorporate
them into every part of their lives, particularly their social lives. In contrast to the inert functionality of old-
school cameras, watches, radios, and televisions, the new "smart" gadgets interact with their users, learn from
them, make suggestions, and contact their friends and family members. Insofar as they facilitate users'
interactions with other people and the world around them, these smart technologies become part of their
users, akin to an extra organ for sensation and communication. Insofar as they communicate with users,
nudging and prodding them, they become like a friend or family member themselves.

Part of what makes these smart technologies so attractive (and addictive) is that they function as means of
connecting people to one another, carrying messages and data to other individuals and groups. As instruments
of communication, all of these technologies are forms of media. At the most basic level, media are tools for
storing and sharing information.

In this basic sense, media have always been essential to the development and durability of human culture.
Early forms of symbolic communication, such as cave paintings and ancient writing systems, can be
considered media, as they provided people with ways of fixing meaning in material objects that could be
shared with people in other places and other times. The scope of these early forms of media was limited,
however, by their singularity. People could visit a cave painting, but they could not send a copy of it to their
friends. A scholar could inscribe a story on a cuneiform tablet, but that tablet could not be reproduced for a
wider audience without the painstaking work of inscribing copies one by one. Up until 1000 CE, scholars in
many parts of the world specialized in manually copying books and pamphlets, sometimes using wooden
block prints carved out by hand. These methods were so expensive that only the very wealthy could afford to
buy written forms of media.
460  15 · Anthropology of Media

     All of this changed with the invention of the printing press, first in China and then in Germany (Frost 2021).
     Around 1000 CE, the Chinese artisan Bi Sheng created a set of blocks out of baked clay, each one manually
     inscribed with a Chinese character. To publish a page of text, he arranged the character blocks on an iron
     frame that could be pressed against an iron plate to create a print. Around 1440, the German entrepreneur
     Johannes Gutenberg independently invented a similar system of movable-type printing. Gutenberg also
     created a set of blocks, each one containing a letter, but his were made of metal. He used his invention to print
     calendars, pamphlets, and 180 now-famous copies of the Bible. Within decades, the printing press had spread
     from Germany to France, Italy, Spain, England, and the rest of western Europe.

          VIDEO

     To see how Gutenberg's printing press worked, watch this video of a demonstration (https://openstax.org/r/
     YouTubeDLctAw4JZXE) of the world's most complete working replica at Crandall Historical Printing Museum
     in Provo, Utah.

     If manual writing systems are basic forms of media, then mechanically reproduced forms of communication
     are forms of mass media. Whereas forms of basic media operate between one sender and a small number of
     receivers, forms of mass media operate through a sender, a machine, and a potentially very large number of
     receivers. Originating in books and pamphlets produced using the movable-type printing press, the category of
     mass media has expanded over time with the development of new technologies, including photography, radio,
     television, and the Internet. Mass media are forms of communication facilitated by technology, allowing for
     broad distribution and reception by large numbers of people.

     When considered from this angle, it may seem that technology is the most defining element of mass media. As
     machines, communication technologies might seem to function much the same in any context. When
     European printing presses were brought to Africa in the 19th century, they were used to publish newspapers
     that bore a family resemblance to European ones. If someone enables their mobile phone to function in
     another country while on vacation, they can use it to call their hotel or hail an Uber in much the same way they
     would use their phone at home.

     Because communication technologies seem to function in uniform ways across contexts, people often assume
     that mass media are pretty much the same everywhere. Some provide news on current events. Some provide
     diversion and entertainment. Some allow users to communicate with individuals and groups. In this case, the
     differences one might see in mass media forms across cultures would be differences in technological
     sophistication or penetration, the word media scholars use to describe how widespread a communication
     technology is in a certain context.

     Have you ever seen a Ghanaian video film? These are low-budget Ghanaian movies shot on video camera,
     usually completed within a few weeks and aimed at local audiences. They deal with social themes such as
     witchcraft and corruption, often combined with Christian redemption. Such video films are frequently
     criticized (by locals and foreigners alike) for their rudimentary editing and poor production values. When
     compared to Hollywood blockbuster movies, with their multimillion-dollar budgets and complex technological
     production processes, African video films may seem like a poor replica of the American form.

          VIDEO

     Watch Darkness of Sorrow (https://openstax.org/r/DarknessofSorrow) to see an example of a Ghanaian movie.

     But that is not how West Africans view locally made video films. While many Ghanaians enjoy watching
     American films from time to time, the themes and issues explored in foreign films fail to resonate with their
     own experiences and concerns. In contrast, local video films engage with the desires and fears of Ghanaians,
     reinforcing forms of social identity and echoing familiar norms and values. Even as many Ghanaians criticize
     the rustic editing and uneven sound levels, local video films remain enormously popular among West African
     audiences.

     Anthropologist Tejaswini Ganti (2012) conducted ethnographic research on the film industry in India. She

describes how Indian films developed from rustic, homegrown forms of local entertainment to technologically
sophisticated spectacles, forming the globalized industry of Bollywood. Ganti situates this transformation in
the larger economic shifts of the 1990s and the accompanying neoliberal emphasis on global trade and
middle-class consumerism in India. While earlier films focus on themes involving working-class and
marginalized peoples, later films more often dramatize the lives of the professional, highly educated, and
affluent classes. Thus, Ganti links the themes, technologies, and economic contexts of these films.

While technology may seem to be the defining feature of mass media, it is the immersion of communication
technologies in local cultures that produces the total experience of mass media. At heart, mass media are not
just technologies but forms of communication--technological vehicles for conveying forms of cultural meaning
from senders to receivers. The language, images, symbols, and sounds used to convey meaning are all
elements of culture. The thematic content of mass media is also profoundly cultural, shaped by local contexts
of production and reception. Ways of consuming and interacting with mass media are also heavily determined
by local social norms.

15.2 Putting Culture into Media Studies

LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Describe how an anthropologist might use participant observation to study media.
  · Explain the relationship between modernity and media.
  · Give an example illustrating the complex relationship between media and culture.
  · Define the concept of cosmopolitanism.

In this section, the author of this chapter, Jennifer Hasty, describes her own experience using participant
observation.

     In the early 1990s, I went to the West African county of Ghana to study media and politics. I was
     specifically interested in the role of newspapers in the great wave of democratization across many
     African countries in that decade (Hasty 2005). Because I had some undergraduate training in
     journalism, I decided to volunteer as an intern at several newspapers and learn how news is produced
     in Ghana. I wound up working as a journalist for five different news organizations in the Ghanaian
     capital city of Accra over a period of several years. Through these experiences, I learned a great deal
     about how culture and history shape local news production, texts, and reception.

     When people outside of anthropology ask me about my fieldwork, I tell them (maybe too much) about
     working as a journalist in Ghana. They often respond with a perplexed look, saying, "Wait, I thought
     you said you were an anthropologist." When most people think about anthropological fieldwork, they
     think of quaint villages and rural locations, seemingly disconnected from the rest of the world. When
     they think of the topics anthropologists typically pursue, they think of religious rituals, political
     pageantry, complex kinship systems, and folk arts. That is, they think of the realm of "tradition."

     In fact, the contexts in which anthropologists work are not cut off from the rest of the world at all--and
     they never have been. People all over the world, in both rural and urban communities, are hooked up
     to global flows of information, images, ideas, commodities, and people. Newspapers, photography,
     radio, television, and the Internet are woven into daily life nearly everywhere one might go in the
     world.

     Recall the discussions of modernity in previous chapters. Historically speaking, modernity is the
     whole way of life associated with industrial and postindustrial societies--that is to say, the institutions
     and features of modernity emerged alongside industrialization and mass production. However, the
     features of modernity have spread across the globe to societies that are not primarily industrial or
     postindustrial. Features of modernity such as mass media, wage labor, and the nation-state shape the
     everyday lives of people in primarily agrarian, pastoral societies and gatherer-hunter societies.
     Anthropologists have abandoned the idea that some people live traditional lifestyles while others live
     modern ones. Rather, all people are modern in distinctive ways, shaped by local historical and cultural
462  15 · Anthropology of Media

          forces.

          Since the early 1990s, anthropologists have been increasingly interested in the various forms of
          modernity that have emerged in non-European and non-American contexts. As a key tool of
          modernity, mass media have become the object of growing fascination in anthropology over the last
          three decades. My own first fieldwork was part of an early wave of media studies in anthropology,
          culminating in the establishment of an entire subdiscipline, media anthropology (Spitulnik 1993;
          Askew and Wilk 2002; Ginsburg, Abu-Lughod, and Larkin 2002).

          By examining the use of media in contemporary sociocultural life, media anthropologists have
          learned that nearly all forms of culture are shaped by various genres of media. People take
          photographs and videos to commemorate cultural events and share their memories with others. They
          report on cultural topics in print media, radio, and television and discuss those issues on talk shows
          and social media. In fact, it's fair to say that mass media have become primary tools for defining,
          reinforcing, and reproducing local cultures. Rather than being opposed to tradition, mass media are
          key instruments for preserving and transmitting traditional cultures as well as modernity.

          A few months ago, a Ghanaian journalist friend of mine, George Sydney Abugri, emailed me to ask if I
          could help him self-publish several books on Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP). Now retired, Abugri
          wanted to share his essays, poetry, and memoirs with Ghanaians, journalists, and scholars all over the
          world. In order to publish on KDP, you need a bank account from the United States or another
          "approved" country, and Ghana was not on that list. After a bit of textual wrangling, I was able to set up
          an account for him and get his books online so that he could find his global audience.

          Anthropologists have a term for the kind of worldly orientation evident in Abugri's desire to speak to a
          global audience about global issues: cosmopolitanism. Cosmopolitanism refers to a type of worldly
          knowledge and sophistication. Contemporary anthropologists, working in rural, village, and urban
          contexts, find that people in all settings have remarkable awareness of current world issues such as
          climate change, the Arab Spring, and the Me Too movement. One of Abugri's poems describes an
          incident on the German airline Lufthansa in which a White flight attendant claimed she could not
          understand Abugri's request for a glass of water. Cosmopolitan writers such as Abugri link their
          personal experiences to global issues such as race, environmentalism, and gender equality. Global
          issues and modern media forms are tightly integrated in the lives of both rural and urban peoples in
          cultures all over the world.

     15.3 Visual Anthropology and Ethnographic Film

     LEARNING OUTCOMES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       · Give examples of the early use of visual media in ethnographic fieldwork.
       · Define the field of visual anthropology.
       · Describe two examples of ethnographic film.
       · Explain the ethical challenges associated with ethnographic film.

     Although the subfield of media anthropology is relatively new, anthropologists have been incorporating media
     technologies into their methods of research and ethnographic representation since the early 20th century. An
     early pioneer of visual methods, Margaret Mead took some 200 photographs as part of her first fieldwork
     project in Samoa (Tiffany 2005). In the 1930s, Mead and Gregory Bateson used both photography and film in
     their joint fieldwork in Bali and New Guinea. Mead and Bateson embraced visual media as an innovative
     means of learning about social life and used photos and film to study childhood, public ceremonies, and dance.
     Together, they took about 33,000 photographs and recorded about 32,600 feet of film as part of their joint
     research (Jacknis 2020). Focusing on child development and dance, they used these visual materials to
     produce two photographic ethnographies and seven short films.

     Visual anthropology is either the use of visual media as a research method or its study as a research topic.
     Whether they consider themselves visual anthropologists or not, most anthropologists take photos of the

people and places they encounter in their fieldwork. Visual anthropologists go further, using photography and
film to document important events for fine-grained future analysis. As moments frozen in time, photographs
allow for analytical contemplation and shared consideration. Film can be slowed down or sped up to focus on
certain aspects of individual action or group dynamics that might otherwise go unnoticed. Images may be
magnified to reveal minute details. Both film and photography allow for images to be placed side by side for
comparison.

Visual anthropologists are also interested in how people in the cultures they study produce their own visual
representations in the form of art, photography, and film. Visual anthropologists are interested in popular
paintings, billboards, and graffiti as well as forms of photography and film.

the use of visual media in anthropology. (credit: Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead/Wikimedia Commons, Public
Domain)

Early on, cultural anthropologists recognized that visual media made it possible to share the experiences
encountered during anthropological research with their colleagues and students, and the general public. One
example of many is the film Trance and Dance in Bali (1951), written and narrated by Mead, which features a
Balinese dance called the kris. The kris dance dramatizes the story of a witch whose daughter is rejected as a
bride to the king. In retaliation, the witch plots to spread chaos and pestilence in the land. When the king sends
an emissary with a convoy of servants to stop the nefarious plan, the witch turns the emissary into a dragon.
She then causes the followers of the dragon to fall into trance. When the dragon-emissary revives his followers,
they emerge in a somnambulant state, stabbing themselves with daggers but inflicting no harm. After dancing
the kris dance, the dancers are brought out of their trance with incense and holy water. Included in the US
Library of Congress, this stunning early use of film in anthropology can be viewed at the Library of Congress
website (https://openstax.org/r/LibraryofCongresswebsite) or on YouTube (https://openstax.org/r/

Ethnographic film is the use of film in ethnographic representation as either a method, a record, or a means of
reporting on anthropological fieldwork. Like documentary films, ethnographic films are nonfiction films in
which live-action shots are edited and shaped into a central narrative drama. While the line between
documentary and ethnographic film is blurry, ethnographic film is associated with the work of professional
anthropologists and tends to focus explicitly on depictions of sociocultural processes.

Before Mead and Bateson's professional use of film, several filmmakers had made amateur ethnographic films
depicting aspects of non-Western cultures. The very popular film Nanook of the North (1922), made by
explorer Robert Flaherty and based on 16 months of living with the Inuit, follows an Inuit family in the
Canadian Arctic. The film focuses on the heroism of husband Nanook and wife Nyla as they struggle against
the harsh elements to meet their needs and raise their children. The film documents Inuit lifeways such as
464  15 · Anthropology of Media

     traveling by dogsled and kayak, hunting walrus, and building an igloo out of glacier ice. In one controversial
     scene, the family visits a Canadian trading fort, where they express astonishment at instruments of modernity
     such as a phonograph. Though the film has been praised for its representation of Indigenous peoples as
     courageous and hardworking, others have criticized Flaherty for staging some of the events and even having
     his own common-law wife play the role of Nanook's wife in the film. Like Mead and Bateson's film, Nanook of
     the North is now held by the Library of Congress as one of the most significant examples of early documentary
     filmmaking. While some consider Nanook to be a precursor to ethnographic film, anthropologist Franz Boas
     dismissed it as completely irrelevant to anthropology due to Flaherty's use of artifice and staging (Schäuble
     2018). The film can be viewed at the Internet Archive (https://openstax.org/r/nanookOfTheNorth1922) or on
     YouTube (https://openstax.org/r/nanooknorthvideo).

     FIGURE 15.4 Promotional poster for Nanook of the North, considered by some to be one of the most significant
     examples of early documentary filmmaking. While based on field experience, a number of events in the film were
     staged. (credit: Robert J. Flaherty/Pathe Pictures/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)

     From its roots in both amateur and professional filmmaking, ethnographic film became an increasingly
     important tool for teaching and popularizing anthropological research throughout the 20th century. In the
     1950s, John Marshall and Timothy Asch pioneered a more objective, naturalist style of ethnographic film,
     attempting to avoid Western narratives and exoticization. With the development of the ability to
     simultaneously record sound in the 1960s, the commentary and conversations of people represented in
     ethnographic films became audible (even if translations still appeared in subtitles). Subjects could now
     address the camera directly. Around the same time, anthropologists began considering the power dynamics
     embedded in the production of ethnographic film--in particular, the ethical issues involved in White Western
     researchers controlling the representation of non-Western peoples.

     Responding to these ethical challenges, many ethnographic filmmakers have turned away from the heavily
     crafted narrative methods of films such as Nanook toward a more purist style that represents unfolding action
     with little editing. New methods of representation have emerged, revealing the very act of filming itself and
     highlighting the relationship between filmmakers and those being filmed. Rather than using film as a means of
     teaching anthropology to students and the public, some experimental filmmakers conceptualize film as the
     creation of an entirely new sociocultural experience. The experimental ethnographic film Manakamana, for

instance, directed by Stephanie Spray and Pacho Velez and released in 2013, comprises 11 long shots of
Nepalese pilgrims taking cable car rides to a mountaintop temple in Nepal. Rather than teaching the viewer
about an anthropological topic, Manakamana provides live-action portraits of people and their relationships
against the backdrop of the rugged landscape passing below them. Spray and Velez are collaborators in
Harvard University's Sensory Ethnography Lab, a project dedicated to the experimental use of multisensory
methods to create ethnographic media. You can view a trailer for the film on YouTube (https://openstax.org/r/

15.4 Photography, Representation, and Memory

LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Define the gaze and list important features of this concept.
  · Give an example of the imperial gaze in popular photographic media.
  · Describe the use of photography in colonial contexts.
  · Discuss local techniques of self-representation through popular photography.

In addition to creating their own visual media, visual anthropologists conduct research on how the people they
study produce visual media to represent themselves as well as cultural others.

Have you ever browsed through a copy of the magazine National Geographic? In the latter half of the 20th
century, many American schools and middle-class households subscribed to this magazine as an educational
resource for school-age children. Founded in 1888, the magazine has developed a reputation for its colorfully
illustrated coverage of science, geography, history, and world cultures. Now owned in part by the Walt Disney
Company, the magazine is published in 40 languages and has a global circulation of over six million.

What strikes many young people about National Geographic is not so much the informative textual content but
rather the alluring images of non-Western peoples. Cultural anthropologist Catherine Lutz and sociologist Jane
Collins (1993) set out to study how National Geographic depicted people in contexts outside the United States
and western Europe. In their holistic approach, they conducted research into the production process at
National Geographic, then subjected the photographs to rigorous content analysis, and finally interviewed
people about how they made sense of the images.

FIGURE 15.5 National Geographic cover from 1961 featuring the "exotic other." Researchers have noted that
during the latter half of the twentieth century the magazine commonly portrayed non-Western people as exotic and
close to nature. (credit: "NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC Magazine - October 1961 - South Vietnam Fights the Red Tide -

Based on analysis of 600 National Geographic photos depicting non-Western peoples from 1950 to 1986, Lutz
and Collins noted that the magazine portrayed non-Western peoples as exotic, idealized, and close to nature.
Very rarely did photographs in the magazine reveal any traces of the complex colonial and postcolonial
histories of their subjects or their entanglements in national and global processes. Instead, National
Geographic photographs tended to depict happy people immersed in purely traditional lifeways. Without
466  15 · Anthropology of Media

     historical or political context, the apparent difference between "us" (the viewer) and "them" (the people
     depicted in the photographs) would seem to be developmental or evolutionary. In other words, the people
     depicted in the images were made to seem simpler or more backward than those viewing the images. Perhaps,
     the images seem to suggest, "they" have not yet achieved modernity. While emphasizing a theme of common
     humanity, the magazine nonetheless reproduced primitivist and orientalist stereotypes about non-Western
     peoples while obscuring the historical and political processes that have shaped their equally complex lifeways.

     The Gaze of Photography

     In the 1970s, film scholars developed the concept of the gaze to refer both to specific ways that viewers look at
     images of other people in visual media and to the gazes of those depicted within the images. Gaze theory
     attempts to understand what it means to view people and events through mass media.

     Two key features of the gaze are important to this goal. First, the object being gazed at (the person or people in
     the image) is not aware of the viewer. This makes the gaze voyeuristic, like an anonymous peeping Tom
     looking through a window into a house. The gazer knows what is going, on but the people in the house (or the
     image) do not know they're being watched. Second, and because of the first point, the gaze implies a
     psychological relationship of power; the watching person has the power to scrutinize, analyze, and judge the
     watched people. The watcher can manipulate the perspective and conditions of watching. The watcher
     reserves the power to make sense of the image and to use the image however they please--for knowledge,
     pleasure, or criticism.

     British film theorist Laura Mulvey (1975) used the concept of the gaze to develop a feminist approach to film
     studies. The male gaze describes how men look at women through any visual medium and even in everyday
     life. Beauty culture in western Europe and the United States positions women as objects to be gazed upon by
     men (and other women). Media scholars argue that women come to view themselves through the gaze of
     others, particularly men, who evaluate the attractiveness and desirability of their bodies. Thus, rather than
     experiencing her selfhood directly, a woman's self-image is routed through the male gaze.

     The concept of the gaze is also used to think about other sociocultural power relations, particularly the
     historical processes of imperialism and colonialism. In the colonial period, the desire for conquest motivated
     strategic ways of gazing at cultural others. Through forms of media and image making developed in the 19th
     and early 20th centuries, Europeans developed an imperial gaze, positioning themselves as viewers of non-
     Western peoples. In the visual practices of empire, such as surveys and documentary photography, the lands
     and peoples were scrutinized, subjected to the domineering eye of European colonizers. The depictions of
     non-Western peoples in National Geographic are current manifestations of the imperial gaze.

     Photography and the Colonial Gaze

     Photography was invented in the early 19th century and became widespread in the period when European
     countries were beginning to establish formal colonial rule over African, Middle Eastern, and Asian territories.
     In colonial contexts, the imperial gaze framed how Europeans photographed colonial landscapes and
     colonized peoples, positioning them in strategic ways to justify colonial rule.

     As the head of the Basel Mission Society's large archive of colonial photographs, historian Paul Jenkins (1993)
     has studied pictures taken by Swiss and German missionaries in Africa. The Basel Mission Society (BMS) was a
     Christian missionary group that participated in the larger trend of Christian missionizing in Africa in the late
     19th and early 20th centuries. Jenkins's inquiry sought to understand what the BMS photos reveal about the
     people in the photographs, the people who took the photos, and the wider conditions in which the photos were
     taken.

     Jenkins's analysis focuses on one particular missionary, Christian Hornberger, who worked in southeastern
     Ghana in the late 19th century. In 1863, the BMS asked Hornberger to take photographs depicting missionary
     activities in Ghana to be sold to European Christians who donated to the African missionary effort. Hornberger
     took many pictures of African children, the mission station, the local landscape, and scenes from Indigenous
     life. Jenkins points out that the earliest photographs taken by Hornberger emphasize the strangeness of
     African peoples and environments, while the later ones seem to emphasize the kind of common humanity
     found in later National Geographic photos. In Hornberger's later photographs, Africans are depicted in ways

that would have been familiar to many Europeans: families are shown eating dinner together, women are
depicted grinding corn, and local craftspeople are shown creating pottery.

A set of photographs of children dressed in European clothing caught Jenkins's eye. Who were these children,
and why were there so many photos of them? Where were their parents? Digging deeper, Jenkins discovered
that these were local "slave children" (1993, 100) bought into freedom by missionaries and taken to live on the
mission compound. In West Africa at the time, people who fell into debt could "pawn" their children to work as
servants in lieu of paying the debt. Sometimes, children were given to the priests of local shrines as payment
for wrongdoing or gratitude for good fortune. As early Christian missionaries did not initially have much luck
converting local peoples to Christianity, some BMS missionaries saw this practice as a way to both accumulate
converts and drum up European support. BMS missionaries began offering European supporters the
opportunity to "purchase" the freedom of a particular child, give the child a Christian name, and provide for
the child's food, clothing, and other needs. Most of the African children in BMS photos of the time are subjects
of this child-sponsorship program.

FIGURE 15.6 Hornberger's photograph of "emancipated" children. These children, who had been sold into
servitude by their parents, were purchased by White missionaries and brought to live with them. Many were
unhappy in this unfamiliar setting and ran way to reunite with their families. (credit: "L R and 2 Native Children,
Congo, ca. 1900-1915" by Unknown/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)

While this may have seemed like a win-win scheme all around, the "liberation" of African slave children was
apparently experienced by the many of the children as a new form of enslavement. Most were unhappy living
on the mission compound, divorced from their home cultures, forced to wear uncomfortable clothing and
speak a strange language. Many of them ran away, back to the families they had been serving before the
missionaries intervened. By 1868, the BMS was forced to abandon the whole scheme. The backstory of
Hornberger's photographs of these children vividly illustrates the strategic artifice of the imperial gaze--how
missionaries used photography to position themselves as saviors while local people often saw them as agents
of colonial domination. The entire collection of photographs from the Basel Mission Society is archived at the
BM Archives website (https://openstax.org/r/bmarchives).
468  15 · Anthropology of Media

     The Modernity of Postcolonial Photography

     Focusing on more contemporary contexts, many media anthropologists analyze the images produced by
     postcolonial subjects themselves, along with the producers of those images and the production process. Rather
     than scrutinizing the imperial or ethnographic gaze, these scholars are interested in local forms of gazing at
     the self and others in photographs.

     Anthropologist Liam Buckley (2000) has conducted research on studio photography in the West African
     country of Gambia. Through interviews with photographers and their subjects, Buckley traced the
     development of photographic strategies from the more realist style of the 1950s to the more fanciful and
     imaginative style common from the 1970s to the early 2000s.

     In the 1950s, photographs were valued for faithfully depicting the character, mood, and personality of the
     subject, what people referred to as jikko. More recently, people began to prefer being photographed against
     elaborate studio backdrops depicting scenes of modern leisure and cosmopolitan travels. A staging popular
     with young people in particular features the subject relaxing amid an array of appliances, such as radio,
     television, and an open refrigerator full of cold beverages and tasty foods. Some backdrops depict subjects
     climbing the stairs to board an airplane or visiting a foreign tourist destination. Gambians use the term
     juuntuwaay to describe the props and imported goods included in these scenes, which might include bicycles,
     pens, and sunglasses. Young people use these objects to "`complete' themselves" (Buckley, 2000), thus using
     the photograph as a form of aspirational identity formation. The goal of this form of portraiture is not to depict
     personal jikko but rather to represent jamano, a sense of fashionable novelty and change.

     15.5 News Media, the Public Sphere, and Nationalism

     LEARNING OUTCOMES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       · Describe the worldview presented in news media.
       · Define the concept of the public sphere.
       · Explain the importance of the public sphere to the study of news media.
       · Distinguish from independent media.

     While photography arrests attention with images, the various genres of news media draw people in with
     narratives about what's going on in their local communities and the larger world. A person who reads or views
     the news learns not only about current events but also about what counts as a current event--and, implicitly,
     what doesn't count as news (and thus doesn't matter to other people and shouldn't really matter to them).
     People learn to view the world in a certain way and to position their communities and themselves within that
     worldview. The top stories in national newspapers typically highlight the actions of political and economic
     leaders as the most important stories of the day. Political news is presented as an unfolding drama within or
     among nation-states--the United States establishes sanctions against Myanmar, for instance, or China takes
     action against Hong Kong protesters. Economic news is dominated by the gyrations of capitalist markets, both
     global and national, emphasizing the perspectives of the investors and business owners who make (or lose)
     money in those markets. Like the discipline of economics, news media take a market-centered approach to
     covering the economy, rather than a people-centered approach that might highlight labor conditions or
     environmental effects.

     Some of the first news media were handwritten weekly newssheets that circulated in Venice in the 16th
     century, relaying information about European politics and wars. In the early 17th century, German and Dutch
     publishers began using the printing press to mass-produce newspapers for the growing population of literate
     readers in Europe, mainly merchants and lower-level government officials. Early newspapers reflected forms
     of discussion and debate emerging from the coffeehouses and salons of Europe, dominated by the concerns of
     the rising merchant classes that participated in those public arenas of discourse. German scholar Jurgen
     Habermas (1989) links this process to the emergence of the public sphere. Ideally, the public sphere is a
     domain of social life where people represent, learn about, and discuss the important issues of the day. It is
     distinct from both the private economic sphere and the sphere of public authority, including government, the
     military, and the police. The public sphere provides an important stage for the expression of a wide range of

popular opinions with the goal of reaching consensus and influencing government policy. According to
Habermas, newspapers were essential to the construction of the public sphere in western Europe and
therefore were fundamental tools in the emergence of democratic forms of rule. A summary of Habermas's
foundational argument about the rise and eventual corruption of the public sphere can be viewed on YouTube
(https://openstax.org/r/habermasstructural).

Moreover, newspapers were key to processes of language standardization, uniting audiences from regional
communities speaking various, sometimes mutually unintelligible dialects. As mentioned in a previous
chapter, newspapers thus laid the foundation for the "imagined community" of the nation-state.

A glance at any national newspaper, whether in print or online, demonstrates how news media continue to
serve as tools in the construction of public spheres and imagined communities today. With the invention of
new genres of media, news discourse has expanded into radio, television, and the Internet, providing an even
stronger force for the consolidation of national identities. Conducting research in Malaysia, media
anthropologist John Postill (2006) describes how the Malaysian government strategically used state-sponsored
media to consolidate a unified nation-state out of an ethnically diverse collection of former colonies. In one
community, that of the Iban people on the island of Borneo, the state replaced local-language media with
Malaysian-language media in an effort to bind the Iban more tightly to the state. Rather than completely
erasing cultural differences within the nation-state, however, the Malaysian state media promoted a certain
version of Iban "cultural heritage" while simultaneously undermining Iban political and cultural autonomy.

State media are media that are entirely or partially owned by the government. In many countries, including
most African ones, the state has its own media apparatus, including a news agency, newspapers, and radio and
television stations. Independent media are media that are privately owned. But wait, one might ask, isn't all
news media supposed to be independent from government? If a state had its own news media, wouldn't that
just be propaganda? In the United States, news media have traditionally emphasized journalistic
independence and even critical opposition to the government. News media are thought to be the "watchdogs of
the people," maintaining critical pressure on government leaders and institutions in order to maintain
accountability and prevent corruption and abuse of power. This notion that journalists should be critical of
government is a near-universal tenet of professional journalism in capitalist democracies. However, even in
the United States, the government is heavily involved in shaping news texts and organizations. Through
briefings and press releases, the White House press secretary and other public relations officials exert
considerable control over the representation of the positions and activities of government officials. The
American government funds the global media organization Voice of America, producing radio, television, and
digital content in more than 47 languages all over the world. However, the most prominent American news
organizations are independently owned and produced.

But are privately owned news media in capitalist countries completely independent? Rather than being
dominated by the government, privately owned media are subject to the forces of the market as well as the
demands of owners and investors. That is, their commitment to the truth may be challenged by their desire to
sell their media to the largest audiences. If sensationalized conflict and conspiracy theories attract audiences,
news media may become dominated by misleading half-truths and divisive fantasies. Another strong force
threatening the independence of private media is the desire to sell lucrative advertising space to powerful
business interests. If the people who pay for advertising favor a market-centered approach to economic issues,
then stories about working conditions and environmentalism are likely to be marginalized by market news.

How do journalists handle the conflict between the pressures of government and commercial interests and
their role as watchdogs for the public interest? For a firsthand example, read this account by chapter author,
Jennifer Hasty,

     When I first came to Ghana, I wanted to understand the role of newspapers in the wave of
     democratization sweeping across the African continent in the 1990s. In my first few days in Ghana, I
     bought as many newspapers as I could find and read them studiously, marking stories with marginal
     comments and comparing front pages side by side. The state-sponsored newspapers highlighted the
     benevolent actions of government in promoting economic development and social stability.
     Frequently, the front pages of such publications featured an enthusiastic headline about a government

     project to build a new road or market complex, illustrated with a color photograph of President Jerry
     Rawlings wielding a pickax or operating a bulldozer to officially launch the project. Most stories
     foregrounded the official speeches of government officials, emphasizing themes of national cohesion
     and responsible citizenship. In contrast, the front pages of the private newspapers shouted out bold
     allegations of corruption among government officials with stories often based on anonymous sources
     and rumor. In these papers, Rawlings was often depicted wearing mirrored sunglasses and army
     fatigues, portrayed as a barely reformed military coup leader with no interest in real democracy.

     These two versions of the national political reality were completely at odds with one another. And yet,
     in my initial interviews, both state and private journalists maintained that they were the true forces of
     democracy in Ghana, protecting the interests of the people. Both maintained strong commitments to
     journalistic neutrality and objectivity. How could they produce such wildly different optics on the
     political sphere? How could state journalists fervently believe that they were promoting democracy
     when, in daily practice, they were echoing the public pronouncements of government officials and
     providing strategically flattering coverage of the actions of the state? How could private journalists
     claim to be responsible purveyors of truth when their sensational stories were so often based on
     rumor and stirred up political and regional conflicts?

     Anthropologists frequently discover such contradictions between what people say they're doing and
     what they're actually doing. This is one of the advantages of long-term fieldwork; it gives
     anthropologists time to get behind the official story presented in texts and interviews by conducting
     extended periods of participant observation.

     Working at the premier state newspaper, the Daily Graphic, I discovered that the whole working life of
     a state journalist is structured in such a way that the state does indeed seem to be a benevolent patron
     and the words uttered by state officials do seem to be the superior and responsible version of national
     reality. Every working day, state journalists were invited to state ministries to cover official events.
     They didn't have to scramble around trying to gain access to government officials, as private
     journalists did, and they never faced rejection or exclusion when they showed up at state functions.
     Instead, they were politely ushered into the realm of the state to witness some important (or not)
     announcement or action. After the event, state journalists were given copies of the speeches they'd
     just heard and provided with snacks and a beverage--and an envelope with a small sum of cash. This
     small gift was referred to as soli, short for solidarity, and it symbolized the implicit reciprocity
     between state officials and state journalists. When they got back to the newsroom, state journalists sat
     down, printed speeches in hand, and wrote stories depicting the state in the way they themselves had
     just experienced the state: a kind and thoughtful patron supporting the welfare and development of
     the people.

     At the three privately owned newspapers I worked for during my fieldwork, the working day was much
     more stressful and antagonistic. Considered divisive and irresponsible by the state, the private press
     had been banned by Rawlings's military government in the 1980s. In the 1990s, the private press was
     just reemerging as part of the overall process of democratization, but the government still considered
     private journalists to be political enemies. Rawlings issued angry public diatribes against the private
     press, threatening criminal libel suits with long prison terms. Not only were private journalists not
     invited to daily government events, but they were not even allowed to attend. Many government
     officials dodged the phone calls of private journalists, and some refused to speak to them at all.
     Ordinary Ghanaians, still spooked by the government repression of the previous decade, often
     demanded anonymity as a condition of speaking to private journalists. Excluded from official
     channels of public discourse, the private press was forced to rely on unnamed sources and rumors.
     From their point of view, the antagonistic representation of the state as corrupt and repressive was the
     truth as they experienced it every day.

     Taken together, the state and private news media created a highly contentious public sphere with
     competing ideologies--versions of political reality associated with particular groups. While the
     government used the state press to build national unity, the private press challenged the legitimacy of
     the state and its commitment to democracy. Visit the news website Graphic Online

        PROFILES IN ANTHROPOLOGY

Elizabeth Bird

Personal History: Elizabeth Bird (https://openstax.org/r/facebook1674658669247949) was born and raised in
Newcastle upon Tyne in northeast England. As a child, she was an avid reader, especially drawn to historical
and fantasy literature. Reading about various societies in different time periods, Bird developed an early
interest in other cultures and the past. As a self-described "shy and rather unsociable" child (personal
communication), she developed a more analytical view toward social groups. She remarks, "I have heard that
many anthropologists grew up feeling they don't quite fit in--that would be me!"

Bird studied anthropology at Durham University and folklife studies at the University of Leeds, both in
England. She then earned an interdisciplinary PhD from the University of Strathclyde in Scotland. A few years
later, she moved to the United States, where she earned an MA in journalism from the University of Iowa. She
then became a professor of anthropology at the University of South Florida.

Area of Anthropology: Bird pioneered the anthropology of news media. At Iowa, she wrote about the
connection between folklore/myth and journalistic narratives, especially in tabloid newspapers.

Accomplishments in the Field: Anthropologists in the 1980s generally dismissed media as a topic for
research, but Bird considered this view shortsighted given the ubiquity of media in societies all over the world
and the centrality of media to contemporary culture. In her first book, For Enquiring Minds: A Cultural Study of
Supermarket Tabloids (1992), Bird argues that tabloid newspapers such as the National Enquirer build on and
feed larger cultural narratives in the general folklore of American life. In interviews with readers of the tabloid
press, she discovers that they are attracted to tabloids for a variety of reasons and deploy a diverse set of
strategies for finding meaning in these texts. Prescient of the conspiracy theories and "fake news"
controversies of the early 21st century, Bird's work on tabloids the 1980s and 1990s found that many readers
are alienated from mainstream American culture.

In this part of her career, Bird's main focus was on the audiences of media, using ethnographic and qualitative
research to understand how people in a culture read and use media in their everyday lives. This research came
together in her book The Audience in Everyday Life: Living in a Media World (2003). In this book, Bird explores
how people pick and choose different elements of media as they construct their class and ethnic identities,
participate in religious or political communities, and contemplate the meaning of scandals and other
publicized cultural narratives. While much mass communication research has focused on "the audience" as a
monolithic, unified entity, Bird shows how an ethnographic approach reveals "the audience" to be a highly
differentiated assemblage of people using a wide variety of techniques to comprehend and use mass media as
a cultural reservoir.

Importance of Their Work: Elizabeth Bird was among the first anthropologists to take media seriously as an
object of serious academic study. While many mass communication scholars were analyzing the texts of news
media, Bird used interviews and participant observation to explore how people actually make sense of these
texts and weave them into their thoughts and practices.

Around 2009-2010, Bird moved away from media as an exclusive object of study, returning to earlier research
on social history, heritage, and memory in a Nigerian community. Incorporating media analysis and oral
histories, she now conducts research on a traumatic massacre that took place in that community in 1967. She
documents how print and broadcast media have erased popular memory of the event and how social media
has revived and activated personal memories of it. Bird has described the Asaba Memorial Project
(https://openstax.org/r/asabamemorial) as "the highlight of [her] career."

     15.6 Community, Development, and Broadcast Media

     LEARNING OUTCOMES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       · Explain how radio is associated with different themes and audiences than print media.
       · Define the concept of community radio.
       · Explain how community radio gives expression to local forms of identity and social action.
       · Define the notion of Indigenous media.

     The media scholar Marshall McLuhan is famous for his aphorism "the medium is the message" (1964, 23).
     What he meant by this is that each genre of media has its own set of features that suggest certain uses and
     kinds of content. In contrast to print media, radio allows for real-time talk and discussion as well as music.
     Radio reaches beyond the limited audience of avid readers who have time to focus on text to wider audiences
     of listeners who may be too busy to read or have not had access to formal education. As an oral medium, radio
     lends itself more readily to linguistic diversity. In places where many languages are spoken, often the language
     of state is the only one that circulates in written form, while the rest function as spoken languages only. Print
     media may therefore be limited to dominant languages, while the oral genre of radio can provide content in
     alternative and even multiple languages. Finally, while reading print media is largely a solitary and silent
     experience, radio provides a shared and noisy experience. A personal experience shared by Jennifer Hasty
     illustrates this.

          In Ghana, I could nearly always hear a radio blasting from someone's compound or kiosk or car. Radio
          was woven into daily life, a sort of auditory backdrop to everyday work and leisure. News headlines
          were read out each day on the morning talk shows, generating discussions in households and buses as
          people made their way to work. On the popular radio talk shows, Ghanaians from all walks of life
          called in to broadcast their perspectives on the issues of the day. Even during the music shows,
          listeners participated with heartfelt requests dedicated to friends, lovers, and family members.

     Because of its distinctive features, the genre of radio is not as narrowly focused as print media on themes of
     political economy such as nationalism and democracy. While including attention to current events, radio
     typically provides listeners with a wider variety of content, including music, talk shows, drama, and quiz
     shows. In an effort to provide relevant content to the broadest spectrum of listeners in an area, local radio
     stations design their programming to reflect the tastes and issues of particular communities. Certainly, print
     media does this to some degree, but the audience for print media constitutes a narrower segment of the
     community. Radio attempts to address the community as a whole.

     Commercial and state radio are dominant forces in the media landscapes of most countries, but an alternative
     form, community radio, has been growing rapidly in recent decades. Community radio refers to radio stations
     that are community owned and operated, staffed by groups of professionals and volunteers. The involvement
     of local volunteers allows for community participation in programming, production, and on-air performance.
     Community radio stations often focus on local current events, educational programs, and development
     initiatives. Typically, they are low wattage with minimal range and thus are nonprofit.

     In places where people want to start up a community radio station but lack the capital and technological know-
     how, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and development organizations have provided support in
     partnership with community organizations. Such collaborations between community groups and foreign
     NGOs have made possible the start-up of community radio stations in many countries, including Nepal, Sri
     Lanka, and the Philippines. Throughout Africa, community radio stations sponsored by government and/or
     NGOs have been used to educate rural peoples about farming methods and spread public interest health
     messages. In Thailand, the global leader in community radio, more than 7,000 independent radio stations
     have been started since 2001.

     Established in 1997, the Nepalese station Radio Sagarmatha was the first independent community radio
     station in South Asia. The station was started by the Nepal Forum of Environmental Journalists in an effort to
     break the government monopoly on radio and provide better coverage of community issues. Regulated by
     government, Radio Sagarmatha is not allowed to address political or economic issues. Focusing instead on

community development, the station features daily discussion programs addressing such issues as public
health, education, women's empowerment, and workers' concerns. Though not explicitly political, the station
identifies itself as the defender of democracy and free speech in Nepal, giving voice to the people. In 2005, the
army raided the studio, seizing equipment and arresting staff for rebroadcasting a BBC interview with a
politician. The station reemerged after the incident and remains on air today. With 2.5 million regular
listeners, Radio Sagarmatha is one of the largest and most successful community radio stations in the world.

Community radio stations in Brazil have faced similar forms of government regulation and harassment.
Anthropologist Derek Pardue (2011) describes the expansion of community radio in the wake of political
liberalization in the 1980s. As of 2013, there were 4,700 community radio stations operating in Brazil, an
increase of 70 percent since 2002. Moreover, approximately 5,000 such stations have been shut down by
government, their equipment confiscated and management prosecuted as felons. Associated with free speech
and political activism, community radio attracts involvement by counterculture artists and performers such as
the hip-hop communities of impoverished favela neighborhoods in São Paulo. Through community radio, local
hip-hop artists narrate their stories of hardship and heroism, defining their spatially marginal neighborhoods
as economically and politically marginalized periferias (peripheries). Pardue describes how community radio
gives hip-hop artists and other community members a platform for demonstrating their awareness of social
issues and command of information. Using slang that signals racial and class identities, they publicize
otherwise unreported events and perspectives such as police violence and gang activities, providing a much
more inclusive public sphere than commercial media.

In Australia, more than 400 independent radio stations broadcast in 70 different community languages. Many
of these community radio stations have been started by Indigenous Australian communities as a means of
cultural survival and language preservation. Indigenous media refers to the use of media by Indigenous
communities for community identity, cultural representation, and activism. In the 1990s, some Indigenous
broadcasters developed the ability to link community radio stations together in regional and national
networks. As many Indigenous community stations featured call-in request programs, the linking of stations
allowed a person in one community to publicly greet a relative in a faraway community with a song dedication.
Anthropologist Daniel Fisher (2009) describes how radio has become a way for Indigenous Australian people to
celebrate kinship connections in the context of kin dispersal due to government policy, travel, work, and
incarceration. Throughout the 20th century, Indigenous children were seized from their families and sent to
state institutions and foster homes in order to assimilate them into White Australian settler culture. In the
present, Indigenous family ties are further troubled by the disproportionate numbers of young men
incarcerated in Australian prisons. In this context, call-in request shows have become wildly popular on
Indigenous radio networks, as relatives phone in to dedicate emotionally charged songs about love, separation,
and loss to relatives in distant places.

Inspired by a wide variety of social issues, community radio is catching hold in the United States as well. In
response to the domination of American radio by large media corporations, the US Congress passed the Local
Community Radio Act in 2010, authorizing the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to provide licenses
to low-powered community radio stations. A group of community organizers in Madrid, New Mexico, just
outside of Albuquerque, was awarded a license and began broadcasting KMRD 96.9 in 2015. As an alternative
to commercial radio programming, KMRD, like many community stations, features more diverse and locally
relevant content. Local DJs host call-in and talk programs about community issues and spin a wide variety of
music, including alternative, pop, techno, garage, folk, and western. Local bands get frequent airplay,
stimulating the local music scene. On Monday nights, you can hear a program devoted to African music, hosted
by the author of this chapter. Those not within range of the station can listen to KRMD online
(https://openstax.org/r/kmrdlisten). Over a thousand new community radio stations have emerged as a result
of the Local Community Radio Act.

     15.7 Broadcasting Modernity and National Identity

     LEARNING OUTCOMES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       · Identify ways in which governments and development organizations use broadcast media.
       · Detail forms of modernity conveyed by broadcast media in non-Western contexts.
       · Explain the cultural significance of soap opera.
       · Describe the relationship between broadcast media and religious identities and experiences.

     Broadcast media are, of course, not always grassroots tools of community expression and development. Even
     outside of the commercial domain, forms of radio and television are produced by development organizations
     and state governments to address specific development goals, a more top-down model of community
     broadcasting. Throughout the 1980s, a radio project for delivering basic education was carried out in the
     Dominican Republic by the US Agency for International Development. The project was designed to reach
     schoolchildren living in mountainous and isolated regions of the country. Gathering around radios in
     community centers, children listened to lessons on reading, math, science, and history. Students were given
     worksheets and books to supplement the radio lectures. Eighty-two community learning centers were
     established by 1982. Over time, local community groups and the Dominican government contributed funding
     to keep the project going. Similar programs to use radio for basic education have been established in other
     countries, including Mexico and Kenya.

     As with radio, the potentially broad reach of television beyond literate audiences has made it useful as a
     medium of education, particularly for students lacking access to conventional brick-and-mortar schools. In
     most countries outside of western Europe and the United States, broadcast media were initially developed by
     the state because local elites often lacked the capital to start radio and television stations. In the 1960s, the
     newly independent African states used their newly formed state broadcasting corporations to consolidate
     diverse and distant populations as a united audience for national messages and initiatives.

     In her research, communication scholar Carla Heath (1996) shows how Ghanaian children's television
     programs serve as a means of cultivating a distinctively modern national culture that embraces innovation and
     change while remaining grounded in Ghanaian cultural values. For one program, By the Fireside, Ghanaian
     schoolchildren were recruited to act out Ghanaian folktales, discussing how their moral messages could be
     applied to contemporary Ghanaian life. Against a background depicting a rural village, children in simple
     smocks and African-print clothing opened the show with songs and dances, then engaged in greetings, jokes,
     and riddles with the two adult storytellers. As a storyteller narrated a tale, the children acted out certain scenes
     and commented on the themes of the story in musical interludes. After the story, children were called upon to
     recite the moral lessons they had learned. In this way, traditional stories were summoned to discuss such
     contemporary issues as corruption, political conflicts, and juvenile delinquency. Heath argues that such
     programs promote a distinctive form of modern citizenship rooted in local morality and wisdom.

     Anthropologist Lila Abu-Lughod (2002) similarly demonstrates how elites have used television dramas to
     cultivate the ideal of the virtuous modern citizen among women, youth, and rural people in Egypt. One serial
     drama, Hilmiyya Nights, focused on the lives of a group of characters from the traditional neighborhood of
     Hilmiyya in Cairo. The show dramatizes their fortunes and relationships from the 1940s, when Egypt was
     ruled by King Farouk and the British, all the way up to the Egyptian reaction to the US-led Gulf War of 1990.
     Rather than focusing solely on personal desires, trysts, and betrayals, as American soap operas do, the social
     lives of the Hilmiyya Nights characters were embedded in historical and political events, making the show a
     powerful form of commentary on Egyptian national life. Driven by its project of upliftment, the overall theme
     of the show was one of national unity. Characters from all classes were led astray by the temptations of sex,
     money, and power, but they inevitably came to see the errors of their ways, putting love of country above all
     personal desires. Interviewing women who watched Hilmiyya Nights, Abu-Lughod discovered that their love
     for the show had little to do with the uplifting messages about Egyptian citizenship. In fact, some identified
     strongly with the most problematic female characters, who schemed and connived in pursuit of sex and
     money.

Soap opera is a popular format targeted to female audiences in many parts of the world. In India,
anthropologist Purnima Mankekar (1999) examined a number of television serials produced by the state
television station, Doordarshan, in the 1980s and 1990s. In a well-rounded holistic analysis, Mankekar
examines production, text, and reception, the latter an aspect often neglected in media studies. Mankekar
interviewed the writers, directors, and producers of these programs and subjected the programs themselves to
a fine-grained textual analysis. Her focus, however, was audience reception. Among the questions she asked
were how Indian middle-class women viewed these programs, what sense they made of the content, and how
they discussed the themes and issues and applied them to their own lives. Indian state television has always
worked to cultivate an idealized notion of Indian womanhood, implicitly defined as Hindu, middle-class, north
Indian, and upper caste. Mankekar's analysis focuses on two Hindu epic dramas, The Mahabharat (1989-1990)
and The Ramayan (1987-1988). Through these dramas, state television constructed those ideals for the
intended audience of Indian women. These epics feature two ideals of womanhood: Sita, who is demure,
compliant, and self-sacrificing, contrasted with the enraged Draupaudi, whose reckless husband's political
gamble results in her public humiliation. In interviews with Mankekar, women viewers discussed how they
identified with each character in different ways and in relation to different contexts of their own lives. As the
programs aired in the midst of rising Hindu nationalism in India, they became a means of asserting Hindu
forms of heritage and morality as well as gendered identities.

While in the West, modernity is typically associated with rationality and secularism, many media
anthropologists have studied how radio and television enable distinctly modern expressions of religious
beliefs and experiences. Media anthropologist Katrien Pype (2015) has conducted research on television
dramas in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with a focus on the importance of religious themes and
emotional forms of engagement. In one drama, The Heart of Man, two sophisticated urban women become
witches in order to harm their romantic rivals. As a result of their occult rituals, one of the women goes blind,
leading her to confess her sins to an evangelical pastor. The pastor grants her forgiveness and exorcises the
demons from her body. So powerful were the depictions of witchcraft that some viewers reported feeling as if
they had become bewitched themselves just by watching the show. Viewers interpreted their emotional
responses as signs of the deeper meanings of the program. Not merely entertainment, Congolese television
dramas structured by such tales of evangelical redemption are experienced as episodes in an ongoing spiritual
war between the Holy Spirit and the devil. Though fictional, such television programs connect with the
worldviews of evangelical Christians through the conduit of emotional and bodily response.

15.8 Digital Media, New Socialities

LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Define the concept of sociality.
  · Explain how digital media enable new forms of sociality.
  · Identify how digital media shape friendships and romantic relationships.
  · Define the concept of media ideology.
  · Provide a detailed example of the illicit use of digital media.

As much of this textbook demonstrates, anthropologists most often conduct research on topics involving face-
to-face sociocultural interaction such as public ceremonies, religious rituals, work, political activities, and
forms of economic exchange. Over the past 30 years, however, anthropologists have begun to conduct research
on forms of culture in which face-to-face interaction has been replaced with screens and keyboards. In the
Internet era, media anthropologists explore how people connect with others digitally, forming collective
identities based on characteristics such as common interests, gender, race, ethnicity, and religion. Some
anthropologists are interested in the entirely new modes of social interaction made possible by the Internet,
such as hacking, blogging, and creating and sharing memes. Digital media also reshape other domains of
sociocultural practice, such as shopping, financial transactions, transportation, religious worship, and kin
relations. Encompassing the whole realm of social interaction, cultural anthropologists use the term sociality
to describe how people construct and maintain their personal and group relations. Anthropologists are curious
about how new forms of digital media function as tools of sociality.
476  15 · Anthropology of Media

     Digital Socialities: Personal and Political

     How do you talk to your friends on a day-to-day basis? How do you arrange to meet up as a group? If you're an
     American, it's very likely that texts and social media are involved in your communication and coordination
     with your friends. Studying American teens from 2004 to 2007, scholar Danah Boyd found that social
     networking sites such as Facebook were key to the formation of new friendships and the consolidation of
     friend groups, while texting deepened one-on-one relationships (Ito et al. 2010). In fact, friendship was the
     primary reason given by teens for engaging in digital forms of media (rather than, say, looking up information
     for school projects or texting their parents about where they are at midnight on a Friday night). Of course, the
     social preoccupation of American teens is not new, nor is it surprising. But digital media provide new modes of
     engagement, such as the "always on" texting of best friends or social media "friends" who are not really friends
     at all but strangers or even enemies. Social media also provide new tools for authoring self-identity as well as
     the ability to search out information about others that may undermine their own professed identities.

     While American teens generally embrace social media and texting as ways of building friendships, they are
     considerably more troubled by the role of digital media in the other side of social relationships: breaking up. In
     an undergraduate class one day, anthropologist Ilana Gershon asked her students, "What counts as a bad
     breakup?" (2010). Expecting stories of lying and infidelity, Gershon was surprised to hear so many students
     complain about breakups via text or Facebook. Anyone who has ever signed into a social media site to discover
     that their sweetie's relationship status has changed to "single" knows the kind of confusion and heartache
     caused by using digital media in this way.

     FIGURE 15.7 Perhaps not the best use of texting--on both sides. In societies all over the world, digital media have
     become essential elements of social interaction. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0

     Intrigued by the ambiguities of digital etiquette in the realm of romance, Gershon wrote a book exploring how
     Americans use digital media to manage and even terminate ambiguous or troubled relationships. At the heart
     of the matter, according to Gershon, are media ideologies--that is, sets of ideas about the functionality of
     digital media and their relationship to other forms of communication, such as the telephone and face-to-face
     conversation. For some Americans, using digital messaging to break up is an ideal way of avoiding an intense
     emotional scene. This notion relies on a media ideology in which different forms of communication can
     usually be substituted for one another in the interests of efficiency and ease of use. For others, however, the
     text breakup is unfair, disrespectful, and cowardly, as the breaking-up process is made into a unilateral speech
     act rather than a consensual act based on dialogue. Digital media allow the breaker-upper to avoid witnessing
     the consequences of their action. In this media ideology, different forms of communication are appropriate to
     different forms of social action and cannot be substituted for one another without careful consideration of the
     emotional consequences.

     In societies all over the world, digital media have become essential elements of social interaction, from the
     most personal and romantic relationships to larger, more public collectivities. Both media anthropologists and
     communication scholars have contributed to an effort to de-westernize media studies by exploring the use of

digital media in contexts outside of the United States and western Europe. In societies with repressive
governments, traditional media and face-to-face political action are often tightly controlled, making digital
media important tools of social interaction and political resistance. Media scholars Annaelle Sreberny and
Gholam Khiabany (2010) highlight the crucial role of blogging in popular expression and political activism in
Iran over the past several decades. There are more than 700,000 blogs in Iran, many of them authored by
women. Suppressed in the public arena, Iranian intellectuals have embraced blogging as a way to express their
ideas. Though many Iranian blogs are devoted to personal reflections or commentary on entertainment or
sports, Sreberny and Khiabany show how bloggers often convey subtle political messages in their seemingly
personal writing. Like Egyptian and Indian soap operas, Iranian blogs are always embedded in sociopolitical
contexts, whether they are explicitly political or not. Some blogs are, in fact, stridently political, and many
political bloggers have been jailed by the government as dissidents.

Similarly, bloggers in Central and South America form activist communities working for social justice and
equality (Arriaga and Villar 2021). Afro-Cuban activist Sandra Abd'Allah-Alvarez Ramírez blogs on issues of
race and gender in Cuba. Journalist Silvana Bahia operates an organization in Brazil that works to spread the
tools of digital technology to diverse communities, in particular Afro-Brazilian women. She has been involved
in efforts to teach programming to women, showing them how to apply digital skills to further social projects.
She envisions a more inclusive digital sphere that brings in the perspectives of Black, LGBTQ+, low-income,
and disadvantaged groups.

Digital Shadowlands: Illicit Media

Digital media enable and enhance social interaction, deepening relationships and activating imagined
communities for social change. However, these new forms of media have a darker side. Digital media are also a
tool for piracy, smuggling, scams, human trafficking, and illegal forms of pornography. Frequently, these illicit
forms operate across the gulf of global inequality separating wealthy societies from poorer ones. Human
trafficking, for instance, often involves abducting youth from impoverished rural communities and smuggling
them into urban and wealthier communities to be forced into prostitution. Piracy, on the other hand, often
involves making illegal copies of music and movies produced in wealthier countries available to people in
poorer communities who may not otherwise be able to afford them.

The digital shadowlands provide opportunities for those left out of legal, mainstream opportunities in the
digital economy. Sakawa is a troubling example of this. Around 2010 in Ghana, a new social group emerged.
People began to notice that some young men in their twenties were enjoying a very luxurious lifestyle: driving
expensive cars such as Lexuses and Range Rovers, wearing designer clothing and shoes, drinking champagne,
and living in enormous mansions. How were they becoming so wealthy? During this time, Ghana was
experiencing an oil boom, but that wealth was concentrated among older elites. The vast population of poor
and working-class people have not benefited all that much from oil wealth. Commonly, young men with little
education are unemployed, with very little chance of ever escaping poverty. This new class of conspicuously
rich young men were not particularly educated or well-connected, but they had discovered a new way to make
money. Combining digital media with spiritual techniques, they had invented a new moneymaking scheme
called sakawa.

A Hausa term meaning "putting inside," sakawa refers to magically enhanced Internet fraud, mainly targeting
foreigners. Before they become sakawa practitioners, these young men are often unemployed, sleeping on the
streets, not knowing where their next meal is coming from. Often, they report noticing very stylish and well-
fed young people apparently making lots of money by doing something in Internet cafés. Sometimes the
scammers actively recruit such targets, teaching them Internet skills to carry out the elaborate schemes. The
typical con is pretending to be a woman romantically interested in men from Europe, the United States, or
Asia. Another, less common scheme involves using fake documents to persuade foreigners to invest in gold,
timber, or oil concessions. Even more important than technological skills are the sophisticated social skills
involved in creating strategic online personalities, cultivating trust with foreign White men in faraway places,
and knowing just how and when to make requests for money.

Many scammers report practicing these techniques for several weeks or months with only modest success,
then learning about the "spiritual side" of sakawa. In order to become magnificently wealthy, sakawa
478  15 · Anthropology of Media

     practitioners believe it is necessary to become apprenticed to a spiritual leader who can guarantee great
     success in exchange for performing certain rituals on a regular basis. New apprentices are often instructed to
     sleep in coffins and anoint their bodies with special medicines. Some are required to have sex with several
     women each day and deliver their undergarments to the spiritual leader. Some must chew live cockroaches,
     lizards, or maggots. Ghanaians are horrified by rumors of incest and human sacrifice as scammers are said to
     perform more and more difficult forms of spiritual service to their masters. Though many refuse to reveal the
     exact nature of these rituals, numerous sakawa boys report that their efforts to extract money from foreigners
     suddenly became much more successful after performing them. With sudden windfalls from scamming,
     sakawa boys often throw epic parties and buy expensive gifts for their friends. In his documentary film
     Sakawa, Ghanaian filmmaker Ben Asamoah depicts the practices and communities of sakawa in Ghana.

     A trailer to the documentary film Sakawa by Ben Asamoah can be watched on YouTube (https://openstax.org/r/
     sakawatrailer).

     After a time, the thrill of this lifestyle wears off, and sakawa boys come to feel enslaved by the constant ritual
     demands of their spiritual leaders. If a sakawa boy refuses to perform assigned chores, however, he may break
     out in a rash, suffer paralysis, or become deaf or mute. Some report that friends have died when attempting to
     quit sakawa.

     Sakawa is widely condemned in Ghanaian society. Government officials, journalists, and religious leaders have
     all spoken out against it, and the police have even arrested and prosecuted some sakawa scammers. Many
     Ghanaians lament the unbridled celebration of wealth as a marker of social status, arguing that children
     should be instilled with traditional values of hard work, honesty, and modest living.

     Sakawa may seem like a shocking and unusual combination of digital media with supernatural beliefs and
     practices, but at the root of this phenomenon is a set of contradictory beliefs about wealth and power found in
     many cultures and historical periods. Consider the German legend of Faust, based on a 16th-century German
     alchemist. According to the legend, Faust, a bored and depressed scholar, makes a pact with the devil through
     the devil's emissary, Mephistopheles. The deal is that Mephistopheles will help Faust gain access to all worldly
     pleasures, including sex, power, and knowledge. In return, Faust will be required to turn his soul over to the
     devil after several years.

     Forms of this Faustian bargain have emerged in many other parts of the world, particularly as societies are
     drawn into new forms of wealth and inequality in the global economy. For instance, anthropologist Michael
     Taussig (1980) conducted research on beliefs about the devil among people working in the sugar plantations of
     Colombia and the tin mines of Bolivia. Some wage laborers on sugar plantations were said to enter into
     contracts with the devil to increase their productivity, helping them make fast money. Most often, they bought
     flashy clothes and liquor with their newfound wealth but could not establish enduring prosperity. Taussig
     describes how workers in the Bolivian tin mines created a shrine to the devil to ensure their safety and help
     them find rich tin deposits. Taussig argues that people in peasant farming societies feel a sense of unease
     about capitalist forms of work, wealth, and inequality. To agrarian peoples steeped in communal values, it
     seems unfair that some laborers become wealthy while others work just as hard and fail. And yet, young people
     are drawn in by the compelling allure of money and commodities associated with labor in the globalized
     capitalist economy. According to Taussig, this conflicted feeling of unease gives rise to widespread beliefs
     about serving the devil for temporary gains.

around the world, scholars have observed the spread of stories about people serving the devil for temporary gains.

For some young people around the world, digital media have provided paths to astonishing success and
wealth, often through global relations and transactions. While new forms of digital trade and technological
innovation may provide some well-educated and well-connected elites with a means of getting rich, the vast
majority of young people in both wealthy and poorer countries are largely left out of the opportunities of the
digital economy. Sakawa may seem like a disturbing form of digital delinquency to many Ghanaians and
foreigners alike, but it dramatizes the widespread sense of unfairness and inequality in Ghanaian society as a
whole. The phenomenon of sakawa suggests that disadvantaged groups must combine supernatural forms of
power with their computer and social skills in order to get ahead. Hard work alone is never enough. The
unfairness of this situation is symbolized by the ultimate doom faced by many sakawa scammers: unable or
unwilling to keep up with the demands of their supernatural masters, they fall ill and die.

Exploring how forms of media intersect with economic, political, and religious realms as well as gender,
ethnicity, and identity, anthropologists take a holistic approach to mass media. Studying photography, news
media, broadcasting, and digital media, anthropologists discover the cultural contexts of media production
and reception as well as new forms of sociality and transaction. As media technologies become more deeply
embedded in people's lives and instrumental to social relationships and communities, the holistic lens of
anthropology is key to understanding the profound sociocultural changes brought about by media innovations.

Art, Music, and Sport

Figure 16.1 The Colosseum in Rome played a role similar to a professional football stadium today. Here, tens of

CHAPTER OUTLINE
16.1 Anthropology of the Arts
16.2 Anthropology of Music
16.3 An Anthropological View of Sport throughout Time
16.4 Anthropology, Representation, and Performance
INTRODUCTION Think about the last concert or sporting event that you attended, observed on television, or
watched on social media. What was the last piece of art that you saw in person, online, or on social media? Did
you consider that your experience was likely a culmination of tens of thousands of years of human evolution?
Would you consider graffiti on the sides of train cars to be art? Is a pickup game of football in the neighborhood
sport? Figure 16.1 depicts a famous structure connected to sport that is now more often viewed as an art
object--the Colosseum of Rome. The Colosseum served a role in ancient Roman society similar to an NFL
(National Football League) stadium in contemporary American culture. Here gladiators battled animals such
as lions and bears for the entertainment of a crowd of tens of thousands made up of all levels of Roman society.
As you read about the sociocultural diversity in art, music, and sports highlighted in this chapter, remember
the central narrative of anthropology: Human beings have developed flexible biological and social features that
have worked together in a wide variety of environmental and historical conditions to produce a diversity of
cultures. Art, music, and sports have been and continue to be important elements of every culture on earth,
486  16 · Art, Music, and Sport

     helping to create a sense of collective identity and helping societies to hold together. Art, music, and sports
     both reflect the sociocultural diversity found around the world and have played roles in effecting cultural
     change. Art, music, and sports have shaped the evolution of societies, and the evolution of a societies has
     influenced art, music, and sports in turn. As you read this chapter, consider your own experiences with art,
     music, and sport. Consider what you are familiar with and what you appreciate. Reflect also on the art, music,
     and sport in your society that are not particularly interested in or moved by. Where do these preferences come
     from? To what degree are they individual and to what degree do they reflect connections to your culture and to
     the subcultures within it?

     16.1 Anthropology of the Arts

     LEARNING OUTCOMES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       · Describe the anthropological approach to understanding art.
       · Provide three examples of material artifacts of art.
       · Identify forms of prehistoric art and describe how anthropologists have interpreted those forms.
       · Provide two examples of purposes that art serves in a society.
       · Define visual anthropology and describe its role in understanding culture.
       · Describe the relationship between visual representation and cultural expression and memory.
       · Provide three examples of body art and describe the cultural meaning of each.

     The anthropology of the arts can include various approaches to interpreting art forms, including analyses of
     the symbolic meanings represented, the mediums through which art is disseminated, and even how the art is
     manufactured. Art is strongly anchored in the human experience.

     How Do Anthropologists Approach Art?

     You might be asking yourself, How does art reflect or guide the study of anthropology? The simple answer is
     that art is created by humans. While definitions of art vary and have historically been narrowly construed to fit
     within a Western understanding of the term (Morphy and Perkins 2006), a constant element has been the
     intentional application of imagination, creativity, and skill. Art is created with intent.

     Art is a representation of the human experience, and anthropologists approach the study of art the same way
     they do any other aspect of human existence. Anthropologists take a holistic approach to any given topic,
     situating that topic among the broader context of a culture--its "language, environment, economy, religion,
     family life, governance and so on" (Plattner 2003, 15). All of these details are implicitly and inextricably
     embedded in the products of a culture, which cannot be fully understood and appreciated without some
     awareness of them. This is particularly important in regard to the arts, which rely so heavily on a shared
     cultural vocabulary. As Stuart Plattner (2003) asserts:

           Anthropologists think that artistic production . . . should be looked upon, not simply as applied
          aesthetics, but as an activity embedded in an art world, a complex set of social relationships. . . . It is
           wrong to focus on the unique art object, and ignore the complex set of human relationships which
           contributed to its creation. (15)

     Anthropology lends itself to examining both the how and the why of the arts. Art is studied by anthropologists
     through methods such as observation, interviews, focus groups, and site assessments. Anthropological study
     of art includes ethnographic studies as well as inquiries in physical anthropology and archaeology (e.g., Upper
     Paleolithic cave paintings, Aboriginal rock paintings, etc.). Consider the work that is required to analyze an
     artistic creation or sporting event through these anthropological techniques. Such work could include
     unearthing and evaluating artifacts of ancient societies, interviewing theatrical performers, or attending a
     game or match. The study of art, music, and sports requires the same holistic, wide-ranging approach as do all
     other anthropological studies.

     What is art? Who defines it? What is the difference, if any, between a cultural practice and a piece of artwork?
     These are all valid questions to consider when exploring the arts with the goal of better understanding human

cultures. The modern understanding of art began in the 18th century, when the word art shifted from referring
to any specialized skill (e.g., art of gardening) to referencing the fine arts (Kristeller 1990). Anthropologists
consider that art has historical, economic, and aesthetic dimensions. Consider painters in ancient Roman
times, who often had patrons of their work who supported their livelihoods. It could be said that such painters
were people of lesser means; however, with a patron's support, they could earn a wage for expressing their
talents. And in aesthetic terms, art provides a representation of what is considered beautiful within a certain
cultural context.

The subfield of anthropological archaeology has approached the study of arts from its own specific
perspectives. Archaeologists cannot observe how an art object was created or used and are unable to ask its
creators or consumers the types of ethnographic questions that other cultural anthropologists may rely on.
Archaeologists possess specialized knowledge pertaining to the sociohistorical and cultural contexts of early
art. Their research on these art pieces provides other anthropologists with a starting point for analyzing older
art. It also provides them with a more well-rounded understanding of the functionality and purposes of early
art.

Material artifacts of art can include many of the things people interact with at home, work, or school. These
include artifacts that are the results of various people's representations of the world, such as the architecture
of the building one lives in or a favorite coffee shop. They can also be relics from ancient times, such as
weapons, tools, and cave drawings. These relics can be found in the research and reports that art historians,
anthropologists and archaeologists use to analyze the symbolic and cultural meaning of art. Iconographic
study is the study of the visual images, symbols, or modes of representation collectively associated with a
person, cult, or movement. Art is an expressive behavior that encompasses and expresses cultural worldviews,
social status and hierarchy, myth, and cosmology.

     Studying Prehistoric Art

     Much of what anthropologists consider prehistoric art consists of artifacts and materials used to facilitate the
     work necessary to sustain life. It also includes cave paintings created tens of thousands of years ago. Examples
     of such cave paintings are the Upper Paleolithic cave art dated to 40,000 to 64,000 years ago, which features
     stenciled figures of animals and artifacts, though not usually humans.

     FIGURE 16.3 These prehistoric cave drawings are located in the Magura cave in Bulgaria. While cave drawings
     typically focus on large animals such as cave bears, horses, and bison, the drawings in the Magura cave include both
     humans and animals, and provide information about the solar calendar, religious festivals and other customs.
     (credit: "Prehistoric drawings in the Magura cave, Bulgaria" by Nk/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
     This rock art, often called cave art, served as a medium to archive the human experience, tell a story, and
     depict how prehistoric peoples saw the world around them. Figure 16.3 above demonstrates how someone saw
     animals that were being hunted--and, unusually for this type of art, the people doing the hunting. These
     drawings served as a communication tool, historical archive, and artistic representation of a period of time
     and the human experience of the people who were there.

     Interpreting Art

     Visual art can be viewed as important evidence in attempting to understand a culture. Throughout time, visual
     art has been used to convey the human experiences of a vast range of cultures. This art provides modern
     anthropologists with valuable perspectives on other cultures and other times that could be hard to gain access
     to through other means. The image of the Kangxi emperor in Figure 16.4 conveys pride, wealth, and strength,
     characteristics that this artist connects to the China's Qing dynasty, depicting the emperor as its
     representative. This image articulates the successes of this culture at that particular point in history. Detailed
     analysis of works of art can contribute to the sophistication with which anthropologists understand both
     individual cultures and the shifting nature of human cultures in general.

Spiritual Art

Other forms of visual art are significant to spiritual and sociocultural practices and beliefs. One example is the
mandala, a symbolic diagram consisting of various geometric patterns that represents the universe. Mandalas
are a cultural practice in Tibet, India, Nepal, China, Japan, and Indonesia (Tucci [1961] 2001) and can be
traced back to the fourth century CE. Typically square or circular in shape, they are used in Hinduism and
Buddhism to focus attention during meditation.

One significant variation on the mandala is the sand mandala, a beautiful arrangement of colored sand that
originated in India and is now a Tibetan Buddhist tradition. Specially trained Buddhist monks create elaborate
patterns with the sand, beginning in the middle of the diagram and using concentric circles to work their way
to the edge. Once constructed, the sand mandalas are then ritualistically destroyed in recognition of the
Buddhist doctrine of impermanence and the transitory nature of existence.

Visual Anthropology

Visual anthropology is a subfield of anthropology and itself a form of anthropological inquiry. It includes the
study of art as represented in photography and film. The field largely arose with the invention of the camera, as
anthropologists started to document Indigenous groups of the time on film. Some of the best-known figures in
the field of visual anthropology are Edward Curtis, whose images of Native Americans are discussed in detail in
Chapter 19: Indigenous Anthropology, and Robert Flaherty, whose 1922 film Nanook of the North is frequently
shown in introductory anthropology courses as an early example of documentary filmmaking.

While visual anthropology is often confused with ethnographic film, tfilm representations are only a small part
of what the subfield encompasses. Visual anthropology is the study of all visual representations produced by
human cultures, including dances, plays, and collections of art, from the beginning of time. In recent times, it
has become a standard practice to use visual arts to articulate one's feelings, thoughts, and interpretations of
things seen, heard, and witnessed. Many cultures practice visual arts and use them in a variety of scenarios.
They may be used to capture a certain mood, a cultural trend, or a historical event.
490  16 · Art, Music, and Sport

     As mentioned above, film and photography played a major role in the development of visual anthropology as a
     field. Film can be used to capture images of art, such as cave paintings, sculptures from Roman times, or
     modern-day theater. Further, film itself has become an important form of art. Film provides an artistic
     representation of the human experience as seen by its directors, performers, editors, and all who contributed
     to its development.

     The field of visual anthropology has had a significant impact on how anthropologists look at art. It also has
     become a driving force in how anthropologists view sociodemographic evolution, or the evolution of human
     societies with respect to combinations of social (https://openstax.org/r/dictionarysocial) and demographic
     factors. The visual anthropology of art transcends generations, centuries, cultures, and other delineating
     categorical definitions. Consider Figure 16.5, which depicts tourists in the French Louvre, crowding around
     and photographing Leonardo da Vinci's famous painting the Mona Lisa. This photograph portrays the
     dimensions and complexity of the anthropology of art. It transcends the time of the Mona Lisa and is itself an
     expression of the human experience in a more recent time, including how humans relate to visual artifacts
     from an older time in history.

     Because of its age, the Mona Lisa image is in the public domain and can be copied and reproduced anywhere.
     The painting has become the subject of many parodies or memes. A meme is an image, video, piece of text,
     etc., typically humorous in nature, that is copied and spread rapidly by internet users, often with slight
     variations. The prolific production of memes of the Mona Lisa has kept the image relevant in society over a
     long period of time. Read more on the memes that have been created of the Mona Lisa here. Have We Over-
     Hyped the Mona Lisa? (https://openstax.org/r/overhyped-monalisa)

     FIGURE 16.5 The Mona Lisa is five centuries old and still captures the imagination. (credit: "Mona Lisa" by Bradley

     The Appreciation of Art

     Neuropsychologist Dahlia Zaidel has proposed that people's appreciation of aesthetics stems from their
     cognitive and affective processes. This simply means that people are attracted to art on the basis of preexisting
     conditions and that their interest in art evolves through time as they have new experiences, develop
     appreciation for new things, and otherwise mature as humans.

     Appreciation of art is a biological and neurological response. People's individual perspectives are innately
     grounded in biology and nature and neurology and nurturing. Think about someone you find attractive and the
     attributes of theirs that you find beauty in, or consider the last piece of clothing you bought because you liked
     how it fit, how it looked, or how others appreciated it. Attraction is a response based on a myriad of biological
     attributes that each individual person possesses and has since birth. These are anchored in laws of attraction.
     Humanity's attraction to art is as biologically founded as attraction to other things (Zaidel et al. 2013). Perhaps
     this is why some people like various types of art from different time periods that depict the human experience.

Pottery

Traced back to the Neolithic period, pottery is considered one of the oldest inventions of humankind. Pottery is
an art form created by many cultures for both aesthetic and functional purposes, including storing and
cooking foods, carbonization (the formation of carbon from organic matter), and ritualistic practices. It has
long been an important artifact type in archaeology. Pottery is an example of a practical object that also
contains features of artistic beauty. One example is the Acoma pottery created by the Pueblo culture. Acoma
pottery is functional and was not created purely as what we would now consider to be works of art. However,
the pottery itself is a material art. Much can be learned about a culture by analyzing both the functionality of a
particular piece or style of pottery and the imagery or stories depicted within its details and designs. Pottery,
such as the 20,000-year-old pottery pieces found in ancient China depicted in Figure 16.6, has been crucial to
understanding cultural history. The creation of pottery merges human knowledge and experiences, including
artistic resources, emerging technological processes, and the needs of a population at a given time (P. M. Rice
2015).

FIGURE 16.6 These pottery fragments were found in a cave in southern China and have been dated to 20,000
years ago. Pottery is viewed by anthropologists as both functional object and artistic expression. (credit: "Ancient
Pottery" by Gary Todd/flickr, Public Domain)

Though it serves a functional purpose, pottery throughout history has often been adorned with decoration,
color, and other aesthetically attractive features. Decorated pottery is assigned a high value in many cultures,
with people paying large sums of money for especially decorative pieces.

Body Art

Various forms of body art are a foundational form of expression in cultures all over the world. All cultures
decorate and modify the human body in some way, whether temporarily or permanently. Anthropological
frameworks can be used to understand body art as both a form of visual art and a cultural tradition.

Tattooing is a form of body art that has been practiced for thousands of years. Tattoo is a Polynesian term.
Polynesian tribes and people used tattoos to establish identity, personality, and status. The Maori, an
Indigenous Polynesian people of New Zealand, have traditionally used tattoos as an expression of identity and
cultural affiliation. Examples of this can also be found in the Tonga and Samoa warrior cultures, in which
specific tattoo designs and placement on the body were used to demonstrate a warrior's affiliation with a
particular group of elite warriors. In the mid-20th century, American sailors used tattoos to represent personal
interests, aspects of their identity, and group affiliation. Such tattoos might include representations of a unit
mascot, places individuals have visited, or things they found beauty in.

     FIGURE 16.7 One American sailor tattoos another aboard a ship during World War II. Tattooing is widely practiced
     by cultures around the world to express both personal and group identity. (credit: "Two sailors aboard the American
     battleship USS New Jersey in 1944" by Fenno Jacobs. Department of Defense. Department of the Navy. Naval
     Photographic Center/National Archives and Records Administration/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)
     There is clear evidence of the practice of modifying the body with markings dating as far back as 5,300 to
     3,000 years ago (Deter-Wolf et al. 2016; Shishlina, Belkevich, and Usachuk 2013). Such markings are still
     practiced by some of these same cultures today, such as the Maori people. Ötzi, a naturally mummified man
     found in the Ötzal Alps whose death has been dated to around 3250 BCE, is the first known tattooed human.
     His tattoos were of lines and crosses across his body. They are believed to have been made by creating
     incisions in the skin and rubbing charcoal into the incisions.
     Tattooing can be a way for individuals to express membership in a larger community. Not only are
     communities formed around having body art, but some may obtain tattoos as a mark of belonging to a certain
     community (e.g., tattoos of a cross as a symbol of the Christian faith). Tattoos in recent decades have come to
     serve many purposes, including memorializing loved ones, expressing aesthetic tastes, depicting personal
     histories, expressing emotions or feelings, and symbolizing rebellion (Dey and Das 2017).
     A modified approach to the classic tattoo can be found in the art of scarification. Scarification is the branding,
     burning, or etching of designs into the skin. Scarification marks often identify someone as being affiliated with
     subcultures or other groups. The practice is also used to represent individual growth or the growth and
     development of a group or subset of a society.

FIGURE 16.8 The patterned scarification visible on the face of this man was formed through the intentional

Makeup has been an expression of visual art since prehistoric times. It is used to enhance beauty, cover up
flaws, and represent cultural ideals of what beauty is and should be. It is often a sociocultural delineation of
wealth and success. Piercings are used for many of the same reasons and have been found in the earliest of
ancient African mummies. They may be seen as an expression of individuality or of identity and affiliation.

Another example of body art is body painting. In some cultures, body painting is limited to the face, while
others cover their entire bodies. The painting of the whole body is a common practice among Indigenous
Australian peoples (Figure 16.9). The purposes of this type of body art include, but are not limited to,
subcultural identification and announcements of social status and accomplishments. The painting can be
temporary or semipermanent, achieved through various types of paints and stains. Body painting follows
uniform patterns and styles in some cultures and is independently driven in others. The specific designs might
reveal an individual's position within their family, membership in a group, social position, tribal identity, and
even precise ancestral history (Layton 1989).

     conventions and motifs. (credit: "Aborigines on Palm Island, Qld - 1930s Perhaps" by Aussie~mobs/flickr, Public
     Domain)
     Henna art is another example of body painting. Henna paint is derived from crushed, milled, and sifted henna
     leaves. It is applied directly on the skin in intricate designs that leave a red or orange stain once the paint is
     removed. Henna body art is used in various cultures of North Africa, Somalia, Southeast Asia, and the Indian
     subcontinent to adorn the hands and sometimes the feet of young women on special occasions, such as
     weddings and religious celebrations such as Eid al-Fitr (Chairunnisa and Solihat 2019). During weddings,
     women use henna to articulate cultural, familial, and religious affiliations. It is also used to accentuate the
     beauty of the bride and as a testament to the status of the family she is coming from and of the one she is
     marrying into.

     paste time to stain the skin, it is washed away. The arm on the left shows the paste before washing, the arm of the
     woman on the right shows the color once the paste is removed. (credit: "Henna" by Rovich/500px/Wikimedia

     The grooming of hair is also a culturally significant practice in societies throughout the world. The way one
     styles or displays their hair can symbolize many things, including membership in a religious sect, racial
     affiliation, and alignment with pop cultural trends. Hair also has been seen as an indicator of social status.
     From an evolutionary perspective, the quality and amount of hair one has indicates robustness and has
     contributed to mate selection and group identification. Hairstyles, hair volume, and hair coverings all have
     contributed to cultural identity and have been viewed as artistic representations of the lived experiences of
     people in myriad cultures and times. In some traditional Muslim cultures, hair is concealed by headscarves
     called hijabs. This representation of modesty has become an icon of Middle Eastern tradition and culture.

Hairstyles are especially significant in African and African diasporic cultures. Hair played a significant role in
ancient African civilizations, used to symbolize familial background, social status, tribal belonging, marital
status, and spirituality. Hair-grooming practices, particularly time-intensive practices such as getting one's
hair braided, are often social activities.

LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Define ethnomusicology.
  · Describe evidence of musical instruments in prehistory.
  · Articulate the importance of sociocultural context to the understanding of music.
  · Describe how music can form the basis of subculture and community.
  · Evaluate the potential of music to impact processes of social change.
  · Describe how cultural appropriation of music is related to social inequality and power.

Music

Music is found in wide-ranging settings and format, including chants, musicals, live performances, recorded
performances, and spiritual rituals. In prehistoric times, music was used to communicate, to tell the stories of
people and express important elements of cultures. Music articulates the human experience, focusing on what
people want to remember about their history and what they desire for the future. It has been used to heal, to
demonstrate power, and to archive the experiences of people. Present-day music is an extension and an
evolution of the music that has come before. It is a medium that represents the depths of time, culture, and
history. Prehistoric musical instruments, called music artifacts in anthropology, include woodwinds and
percussion instruments of ancient nomadic tribes. These instruments began as rudimentary music artifacts
and evolved into more sophisticated technological equipment invented and formed for the exclusive purpose
of creating music.

Ethnomusicology

Someone who studies music from a global perspective, as a social practice, and through ethnographic field
work is called an ethnomusicologist. The Society for Ethnomusicology defines ethnomusicology as "the study
of music in its social and cultural contexts" (n.d.). Ethnomusicology is complex, requiring the work of many
scientific disciplines. It requires study of many geographic areas, with a focus on the social practice of music
and the human experience. Ethnomusicology is interdisciplinary, with a close relation to cultural
anthropology. It is sometimes described as a historical research approach to understanding the cultures of
people through their music. One well-known ethnomusicologist was Frances Densmore, who focused on the
study of Native American music and culture.

     had recorded and interpreted it for her in Plains Indian Sign Language. (credit: "Piegan Indian, Mountain Chief,
     Listening to Recording with Ethnologist Frances Densmore" by National Photo Company/Library of Congress, Public
     Domain)

     Musical Instruments in Prehistory

     The field of ethnomusicology focuses on all aspects of music, including its genre, its message, the artist(s) who
     created it, and the instruments they used to do so. Have you ever considered why a particular musical
     instrument was created? Who made it? Why did they make it? What did they want it to do? How was it used?
     How did they dream up the design? Emily Brown (2005), formerly of the US National Park Service, studied the
     development of musical instruments in Ancestral Puebloan sites. Her study yielded insights into the types of
     instruments created. These included percussion and woodwind flutes that were used to create music
     culturally centric to the Puebloan people. Her study also yielded great insight into the structural hierarchy of
     those entrusted to manufacture music-making instruments. Not too dissimilar to today's trade
     apprenticeships and master programs found in construction, Ancestral Puebloan people established a system
     of passing down the construction techniques central to creating musical instruments, ensuring that the
     knowledge would be carried on by future generations. Brown's study connected music instruments to politics,
     music, social status, and social experiences.

     The Structure and Function of Music in Different Societies

     Music is grounded in the human experience. It is a theatrical expression of its creator's thoughts and
     perceptions. The structure of music has evolved along with the experiences of the humans who created it.
     Examples of this can be found in the early 1800s hymns of Choctaw tribes. These hymns provide an artistic
     expression of traumatic experiences, referring to a time when the Choctaw people were removed from their
     homelands and relocated to reservation lands by the US government. They speak of both individual and
     collective experiences as these peoples made the arduous journey to their new locations. The songs speak
     about broken promises, the journey, and the fate of their people.

For enslaved people, music was a mechanism of emotional escape from difficult situations as well as a means
of communicating with those speaking different languages during the Middle Passage, the journey from Africa
to locations of forced labor. One of the most iconic spirituals, or songs for survival, is "Go Down Moses." Harriet
Tubman, the legendary Underground Railroad conductor, said that she used this spiritual as a way to signal to
those who were enslaved in the area who she wanted to help escape to freedom (Bradford [1886] 1995). The
song ostensibly speaks about the experience of the Israelites enslaved by the Egyptians in ancient times. For
enslaved Black people in America, the song spoke directly to their own longing for freedom. The chorus of "Go
Down Moses" is as follows:

      Go down, Moses,
      Way down in Egypt's land.
      Tell ol' Pharaoh,
      Let my people go.
      Thus saith the Lord, bold Moses said,
      Let my people go,
      If not, I'll smite your firstborn dead,
      Let my people go.

Listen to this song on the Library of Congress website (https://openstax.org/r/locgovjukebox).

Numerous populations have utilized music as a means of resistance. During the civil rights movement of the
20th century, Black artists such as Nina Simone, Aretha Franklin, and Sam Cooke used their music as a way to
challenge structural inequity. Aretha Franklin, a Black singer, songwriter, and pianist, wrote and performed
music anchored in the Black church that came to represent Black American culture. She achieved national and
international fame for her rich voice and heartfelt performances, and she was able to use her artistic talents to
bring a message of both hope and resistance to her audience. Her songs spoke to both where people were and
where they wanted to be.

     Sam Cooke was an American singer who was given the nickname "King of Soul" by his fans and those in the
     music industry. Like many, he started out singing in church, but eventually his music and passion evolved to
     secular music. He is credited with having significant influence on the civil rights movement, and his music
     often explored themes of oppression and fighting for a cause. The music of his first band, Soul Stirrers, focused
     on stirring the listener's soul to engage in the movement for racial equality.

     Cleveland, Ohio. The music of Sam Cooke had considerable influence on the Civil Rights movement. (credit: "Sam
     Cooke's Outfit" by Steven Miller/flickr, CC BY 2.0)
     Perhaps no artist in recent times is better known for using music as a catalyst for social change than Bob
     Dylan. Dylan was a 1960s-era musical artist who spoke to many cultures and generations about injustice and
     the need for inclusion and change. His 1964 song "The Times They Are a-Changin'" urged politicians and
     voters to support the civil rights movement. He was also well known for his opposition to the Vietnam War. His
     music may have very well changed the course of history, given his influence on his fans' thoughts,
     perspectives, and attitudes toward inclusion (Ray 2017).

     Personal History: Zora Neale Hurston was a Black American anthropologist, author, and filmmaker. She was
     born in Notasulga, Alabama, to a sharecropper turned carpenter and a former schoolteacher. All of her
     grandparents were born enslaved. Hurston moved to Eatonville, Florida, an all-Black town, in 1892, at the age
     of two. She often referenced Eatonville as her home, as she had no recollection of her time in Alabama. She
     lived in Eatonville until 1904, when her mother passed. At the time, Eatonville was a well-established Black
     community with a booming economy. According to multiple accounts, Hurston was never indoctrinated into
     feeling racial inferiority. While she was a resident, her father was elected mayor of the town. All the shop
     owners and government officials were also Black American elites. In adulthood, Huston often used Eatonville
     as the setting of her stories.

     Huston left Eatonville due to a poor relationship with her stepmother. She enrolled in classes at Morgan College
     in Maryland, lying about her age of 26 to be eligible for a free high school education. She graduated in 1918
     and attended Howard University, a historically Black university in Washington, DC, before transferring to
     Barnard College at Columbia University. At Barnard, Hurston studied under Franz Boas as an undergraduate
     and graduate student. She also worked with other foundational anthropologists, including Ruth Benedict and
     Margaret Mead.

     Area of Anthropology: In addition to her time in academia, Hurston was a central figure in the Harlem
     Renaissance as a literary artist, working closely with Langston Hughes, among other writers. She was a pivotal
     literary artist whose work directly reflected the trials, tribulations, and successes of Black American
     communities and subsocieties that were often overlooked or exoticized (Jones 2009).

Hurston was a cultural anthropologist who was passionate about southern American and Caribbean cultural
practices. She spent significant time in these geographical areas, immersing herself in the diverse cultures of
Black people in the American South and the Caribbean.

Accomplishments in the Field: One of Hurston's most notable anthropological works is Mules and Men (1935),
based on ethnographic research she conducted in lumber camps in north Florida. One focus of this work was
the power dynamics between the White men who were in charge and the Black women laborers, some of whom
the men took as concubines. In addition to this work, Hurston studied Black American song traditions and
their relationship to the music of enslavement and to the musical traditions of pre-Middle Passage Africans.

Importance of Her Work: Hurston not only studied human society and culture as an anthropologist but was
also an active participant in the arts. She was a central figure in the Harlem Renaissance, which was a
flowering of Black culture centered in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City. Her most popular novel is
Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937; Carby 2008). Her specific anthropological and ethnographic research
focus areas were Black American and Caribbean folklore. She also worked for the Federal Writer's Project, part
of the Works Progress Administration, as a writer and folklorist. Hurston is now an iconic figure for the
Association of Black Anthropologists and several Black anthropological studies journals.

The Importance of Sociocultural Context in Understanding Music

Ethnomusicologist Patricia Campbell (2011) proposes that children's perspectives on musical interests are
derived from their family, community, and environment. How did you learn about music you liked? What did
your parents listen to, and what do you listen to? While you may have learned about and grown to like other
music as you aged, your appreciation for music is founded in the sociocultural environment that you were
raised in. Imagine growing up in a family that only listened to Bansuri bamboo flute music. Would you even
know, for example, what rap music is?

Music as a Basis for Subculture and Community

The affiliation of music with identity became a common topic of inquiry in ethnomusicology in the 1980s,
perhaps prompted by the music subcultures of the 1970s that arose among groups of people who did not
identify with mainstream norms, values, or ideals. Among the music subcultures that emerged during that
time was the punk subculture (Moran 2010). Though it was often seen as no more than youthful rebellion, the
punk subculture formed its own community, values, and ideals founded in a do-it-yourself, or DIY, ethos. This
can be found in the lyrics, music, and performances of punk groups such as the Ramones and the Clash, as
well as more recent pop-influenced groups such as Green Day and Blink-182. The lyrics tell stories of needing
to break from common ideals and values in order to think and do for oneself.

     Cultural Appropriation

     Cultural practices important to communities are often integrated into the fabric of each person's identity.
     Cultural appropriation is defined as the improper or disrespectful use of a meaningful element of a culture or
     identity outside of its intended cultural context by someone who is not a part of that culture or identity (Young
     2008). The act of cultural appropriation by dominant cultures threatens to erase remaining parts of a culture
     that may already be jeopardized. Cultural appropriation is tied to social inequity in that it involves a socially
     dominant group using the culture of a marginalized group for exploitative or capitalist gain. The cultural
     significance of the appropriated elements is lost. While the act of cultural appropriation is centuries old, there
     has been a renewed call from marginalized communities in recent years to understand how and why this
     practice is harmful.

     Wesley Morris (2019) wrote an article for the New York Times' 1619 Project regarding the mass appropriation
     of Black music. Morris noted instances of appropriation by artists such as Steely Dan, Eminem, and Amy
     Winehouse, all White American or British music superstars. Musical appropriation is the use of one genre's
     musical contributions in other music that is not of the same genre, style, or culture. The power of Black music
     to articulate the history, struggles, and marginalization of Black people has appealed to other social groups as
     well, many of them drawn to the ability of this music to communicate its message with clarity and boldness.
     Morris also discusses how, more recently, the appropriation of Black lyrics, songs, and musical presentation
     styles has become a method of addressing the need for integration and integrated culture. This can be seen in
     Black artist Lil Nas X's 2019 remix of his hit song "Old Town Road," for which he teamed up with White country
     musician Billy Ray Cyrus to perform a duet. The song itself is a blending of cultures, musical and racial, and
     offers a social contribution to evolving efforts at inclusion.

     16.3 An Anthropological View of Sport throughout Time

     LEARNING OUTCOMES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       · Describe the anthropology of sports.
       · Explain how sports are a form of performance.
       · Identify the role that sports can play for young people.

     Sports are also deeply intertwined with the human experience. The anthropology of sports is a rapidly
     developing field that includes specialties such as physiological anthropology and human growth and
     development. Sports can be quite diverse; picture a Roman gladiator, a modern-day European football (soccer)
     player, and an ancient or recent Olympic competitor. Another example of a sport is Trobriand cricket, a bat-

and-ball game played by Trobriand Islanders that had evolved considerably since its introduction by Christian
missionaries at the turn of the 20th century. Sports are expressions of passions and reflections of the human
experience. They have been practiced by many cultures throughout time and across the globe. This section will
specifically focus on how sports have impacted human culture and how human culture has impacted sports in
turn. It will consider the historical foundation of the culture of sports and briefly analyze the way people
interact with sports today, examining how human culture and societal practices are influenced by not only
individual athletes but also social structures.

The Anthropology of Sports

Anthropologists understand sports as a cultural performance. The term performance can describe a plethora
of actions, including any that are artful, active, or competitive--and sometimes some combination of all of
these. Anthropologist Ajeet Jaiswal (2019) describes the anthropology of sports as the study of human growth
and development. If one conceives of sports as a sort of performance, one also sees that each performance is
unique to the performer. Each athlete, even the most impressive and seemingly unique, is a part of a larger
performance. Consider your favorite sport or athletic competition. How long has it been in existence? Does it
have roots in ancient times? Often, athletes and sports personalities--from Roman gladiators to more recent
English footballers, American basketball players, and Olympic athletes--are considered singularly talented at
their respective sports; however, without the broader cultural context that has cultivated gymnastics, tennis,
soccer, and basketball, these talents would have no stage on which to perform.

Anthropologists who study sports do so within a larger context of sports and society. Interests of
anthropologists researching sports might include archaeological research related to sports tools, cultural
anthropological research pertaining to how humans interact with sports, or even biological/physical
anthropological research on biological maturation or physical growth (Damo, Oliven, and Guedes 2008).

Ancient Greece. (credit: "Myron (fl c 460-440 BC) - Diskobolus (Discus Thrower), Plaster Replica with Broken Left
Hand, Right, Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, May 2013" by ketrin1407/flickr, CC BY 2.0)

Sports artifacts such as the weapons of gladiators and tools used in old and recent Olympic sports have offered
504  16 · Art, Music, and Sport

     significant contributions to the anthropology of material art. Picture your favorite sport. It likely involves a
     specific tool that is a representation of that sport. Notable examples of such tools and artifacts include the
     lacrosse sticks of the Iroquois, hammers from the oldest Olympic hammer-throw competitions, and the
     modern-day American football uniform, which is designed for safety and decorated to represent affiliation,
     professionalism, and individual athletes.

     Sports have also offered theatrical performances since ancient times. Picture the gladiators of ancient Rome
     entertaining the wealthy who could afford the best seats or wealthy English footballers entertaining those who
     are likely less wealthy. The status reversal of sports entertainers and audiences in modern-day sports
     represents the dichotomous nature of social status and is just one of many examples of cultural change
     throughout time.

     The Evolution of Sports

     For most of documented human history, sports have been a significant part of the human experience for both
     audience and participants. Archaeological artifacts pertaining to sports, including colosseums, weapons, and
     artistic representations of competition, have been traced back to as early as 2000 BCE in China. These ancient
     sports featured competitions that tested the strength, stamina, and techniques of performers, such as
     footraces and physical fights. Today, many nations around the world participate in a version of the Olympic
     Games that were popular in the ancient Greek village of Olympia. Early events included a marathon run and
     wrestling. The Olympics were revived in the late 19th century, with the first modern games occurring in 1896
     in Athens, Greece. Though rules and regulation may have been less stringent and defined in the sports of
     previous centuries, competition as entertainment has existed for millennia.

     people of what is now Canada. (credit: "Tailgate Bayhawks Game Navy Marine Corps Memorial Stadium" by
     Maryland GovPics/flickr, CC BY 2.0)
     Sports can provide much more than mere entertainment to people and societies. Today, when thinking about
     modern sports, a person may think of professional athletes such as National Basketball Association (NBA) star
     Kobe Bryant or National Football League (NFL) great Walter Payton. In early competitions, the wealthy
     attended sporting events in which the athletes were typically not wealthy or privileged. In modern times, the
     commercialization of sports has largely reversed this trend, with "common" people attending sporting events
     to watch wealthy athletes compete. The business of sports has created opportunities for financial and cultural
     success for people with exceptional athletic abilities. The success of athletes such as Kobe Bryant created
     opportunities for other athletes, paving the way for the success of people who may not have otherwise thought
     it possible to experience the fame, notoriety, and financial success of a modern athlete (Chacko 2020).

Youth Sports

Recreational sports for youth are common in various cultures. This can be especially important in
marginalized communities, where youth sports are often viewed as deterrents from (or alternatives to)
potentially dangerous activities or preventive structures that support youth development and community by
focusing on positive actions that reduce adverse social behaviors. Youth sports programs are often
community-building initiatives. One such initiative is the NFL's Play 60 program, which challenges NFL
football players to engage in activities with underrepresented communities, encouraging kids of all skill levels
to come together to play sports.

Among Indigenous Americans, an aggressive style of basketball called reservation ball, or rezball for short, is
prominent in reservation communities. Rezball is different from traditional basketball, as the techniques used
encourage relentlessly aggressive play and quick shooting. For youth on reservations, this may be one of a
limited number of recreation opportunities. Rezball is documented in the Netflix docuseries Basketball or
Nothing and a 2009 ESPN story about the role of rezball in the culture of Native American children.

16.4 Anthropology, Representation, and Performance

LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Identify how cultural identities, norms, values, and social structures are represented in art, music, and sports.
  · Describe how art, music, and sports can function as means of resistance to dominant sociocultural forms and
      processes.

Art, music, and sports all articulate the experiences of people. One of these experiences might be resistance or
rebellion. Whether it is a piece of art depicting a revolution, a rap song challenging the establishment, or a
protest at a sporting event on a global stage, expression of the need for change are common in contemporary
culture. This section will explore cultural identities; the use of art, music, and sports as resistance; and the
506  16 · Art, Music, and Sport

     representations created by each specialization.

     Cultural Identities

     Think about sporting team uniforms or a clothing style worn by members of a musical group. Each outfit on its
     own may not be distinct or significant, but when worn by a group of athletes or musicians and their fans, they
     become a source of identity. Since prehistoric times, art, music, and sports have been a source of cultural
     identity. Arts and sports have been intertwined with several human rights movements and the push for
     diversity, equity, and inclusion. Music has been a means of coded language for escape. Sports have long been a
     platform for cultural identity and has presented opportunities for cultural evolution and resistance. The
     Olympics are just one example of a sporting event that is linked deeply with national identity and nation pride.

     FIGURE 16.20 The opening ceremonies of the Olympic games are celebrations of national identity and nation
     pride. (credit: "The team of Chile at the opening ceremony of the 1912 Summer Olympics" by photographer of IOC/
     Official Olympic Report/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)

     Art as Resistance

     Art is often used as an act of resistance. Graffiti and hip-hop are two forms of artistic expression that have been
     viewed as acts of resistance in modern times. The practice of graffiti as it is known today is reminiscent of
     ancient cave painting, as both are drawings, depictions, and writings on a wall. Ancient graffiti can help
     archaeologists understand general levels of literacy among a population of people or provide linguistic
     anthropologists with insight into the development of language through time.
     While writings on walls is an ancient practice, graffiti became a popular form of cultural expression in Western
     countries in the 1960s. Modern graffiti is often performed in public view, as it is intended to make a statement.
     Today, during most political uprisings, researchers are able to easily find graffiti expressing views that inform
     and shape the political movement. Although many appreciate the communicative and artistic qualities of
     graffiti, others view it as visual pollution, and graffiti continues to be met with opposition.
     One of the most iconic modern graffiti artists is Banksy, whose art is depicted in Figure 16.24. Banksy is the
     pseudonym of an English street artist who has been active for more than three decades (Ellsworth-Jones
     2013). His identity remains unconfirmed. His work began to appear in the early 1990s in Bristol, England, and
     can now be found in cities around the world, including London, New York, and Paris. Based on reports from
     those who have secured interviews with him, Banksy views his art as an act of rebellion. He was often in
     trouble as a teenager, which is when he first began exploring art. His art typically responds to social or cultural
     issues. One example is his series in New Orleans, Louisiana, which critiqued the government response to
     Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

Music as Resistance

Hip-hop is a form of music that has consistently served as a means of protesting injustice toward people of
color. From its inception in the 1970s at neighborhood block parties, hip-hop has rapidly spread worldwide to
influence various cultures, transitioning from the margins of American culture to a central element of global
pop culture. The culture of hip-hop offers possibilities for rich anthropological exploration, including
linguistics factors, performance, music, and lyricism. The messages expressed by hip-hop often include
complex social commentaries.

With increased representation has come increased acceptance of hip-hop as a respected art form. In 2018, rap
artist Kendrick Lamar was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for his album DAMN. and lauded by former president
Barack Obama (Hubbard 2019). His fourth album release, DAMN. demonstrated why some call him one of the
most influential rappers of his time. Perhaps better known is Public Enemy, the mid-1980s rap group created
by Chuck D and Flavor Flav. The group's lyrics often cite their political beliefs and deep-seated opinions about
American racism and the American media.

The evolution of hip-hop can be observed in many countries and societies. In the 1980s, it first began
appearing in Japan and the Middle East. In Japan, it is thought to have begun with Hiroshi Fujiwara, who had
an appreciation for old-school hip-hop and began to play it publicly. In the Middle East, some call it Arab rap or
Arabic hip-hop. Heavily influenced by Western culture, these artistic representations demonstrate the vast and
culturally diverse adoption of hip-hop as art and expression. Klash, the Muslim rapper shown in Figure 16.25,
is well known in Middle Eastern cultures for telling the story of Muslim people through his artistry. Rap is not a
subculture but a media and method for telling a story and at times expressing the resistance of a group of
people.

     spread around the globe. (credit: "klash with loon in jeddah city" by Ahmed550055/Wikimedia Commons, Public
     Domain)

     Even more recently, Native American hip-hop has been a medium for Native Americans to tell their story and
     preserve the history of their peoples. Founded in American rap and hip-hop culture, this new form of
     expression has been embraced by rappers throughout Native American communities. It has been used to tell
     stories, explain history, and even encourage political activism on social issues.

     Sports as Resistance

     Throughout time, sports have been a global focal point for resistance. The Olympics have repeatedly been a
     site of global resistance and a setting for challenging societal norms and expectations. In Figure 16.26, Black
     American athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos, gold and bronze medalists respectively, are depicted
     raising black-gloved fists during their medal ceremony as the US national anthem plays (Smith 2011). This
     gesture became known as the 1968 Olympics Black Power salute. Smith later described his raised, black-
     gloved fist as a symbol of support for all those who are and have been oppressed. Smith and Carlos made their
     demonstration in response to human rights violations perpetuated in the United States. Another example of
     resistance was seen four years later, when Jackie Robinson, the first Black player in Major League Baseball,
     wrote in his autobiography, recalling the opening game of his first World Series championship: "As I write this
     twenty years later, I cannot stand and sing the anthem. I cannot salute the flag; I know that I am a black man in
     a white world" (Robinson [1972] 1995, xxiv).

in 1968, they publicly expressed support for oppressed people and resistance to a culture viewed as perpetuating
that oppression. (credit: "IMGP7613-olympics-mural" by Rae Allen/flickr, CC BY 2.0)

For many, a more familiar act of protest is likely NFL player Colin Kaepernick's kneeling during the singing of
the nation anthem in 2016 following the shooting deaths of Black men Michael Brown, Alton Sterling, and
Philando Castille at the hands of police officers (Lief 2019). In 2016, approximately 68 percent of all NFL
players were Black (Gertz 2017). Kaepernick continued to kneel during the anthem for the remainder of the
season. His gesture was a symbol of support for the Black Lives Matter movement, which seeks to end police
brutality against Black people and other forms of racially motivated violence in the United States. Initially,
feedback regarding Kaepernick's gesture within the sports world was negative. However, following the death of
George Floyd in 2020, there has been an increased interest in understanding systemic oppression. This had
led to initiatives by organizations such as the NFL, Black Lives Matter, and others to support inclusion and
open dialogues about racism. Throughout the seasons following Kaepernick's initial act of kneeling, it became
common practice in the world of professional sports for athletes to kneel in solidarity. This included Black
players and some White players.

The 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro were a demonstration of social stratification. Media coverage of the 2016
Rio Olympics reported on the less-than-acceptable environmental, safety, and health conditions. Athletes from
more developed nations openly criticized the unsanitary and inhospitable conditions of the housing and
training facilities, which included unpotable water sources, trash in commons areas, and dirty and unsanitary
dormitories. While some protested silently, others used their global notoriety to publicly protest the
conditions. The images and stories provided from Rio by journalists and mainstream media sources showed
garbage-ridden streets, unsanitary rooms and facilities, and irreparably damaged buildings. For Rio, the
Olympics were supposed to be a pinnacle of national pride and a positive contribution to the global stage. For
many who attended, the event proved to be far less than the Olympic image depicted in popular imagination.

Integral Features

Art, music, and sports can themselves be forms of resistance and at the same time can display evidence of
historical resistance. A protest, a cultural statement, the overthrow of a regime--all can be found in, and at
times have even been started by, works of art, music, and sports. From the ancient Romans to professional
American football players, people have used these mediums to fight for their causes and to ensure that the
histories of their plights are recorded in the archives of time.

Art, music, and sports have told the stories of people since prehistoric times. Ingrained in the human
experience, these mediums have been used to establish cultural and national identity. The images in art, the
words of song, and the traditions of sport have had significant impacts on established norms and senses of
510  16 · Art, Music, and Sport

     personal and group identity. These aspects of the human condition are so foundational that each has been
     used as a form of resistance. Art, music, and sports have each contributed to the development of people and
     societies in important ways, and can each reveal important aspects of both past and current cultures.

             MINI-FIELDWORK ACTIVITY

     A Study of Ethnomusicology

     Music is one of the most expressive and diverse forms of art. For this activity, do the following:

     1. Review ethnomusicological study techniques.
     2. Conduct your own ethnomusicological fieldwork. This can be done by interacting with musicians,

           attending a music event virtually or in person, or interviewing audience members at a musical
           performance. Interview both musicians and audience members about the meaning of the music. What did
           they hear? How did it make them feel? What did it make them want to do? Record the results of your
           interviews.
     3. Additionally, record your own response to the music. What did you hear? How did it make you feel? What
           does it make you want to do?
     4. Collect the information and write a 3-5-page comparative reflection paper on what you learned from your
           interviews and how they compare and contrast to your own experience and discoveries.

     All music-making activities are appropriate, whether a formal or informal concert, a street performance, or
     gospel singing in church. You should maintain a field journal to record data, observations, and analysis.

     Research and Literature Review Activity

     1. Pick two (2) different examples of visual art, from the same time period but different socioeconomic
           microcultures, to compare and contrast.

     2. Write a 3-5-page summary paper in which you do the following:
             Identify people and/or studies that have reported on anthropological finds relevant to the images you
                 selected.
             Describe the evolution of the art form you are analyzing from an early time.
             Explain how the anthropological studies you cite compare with other anthropological study
                 approaches.
             Address how the art studied is an evolutionary example of the human experience.
             Evaluate what you perceive to be the future of the art as it continues to develop and evolve in future
                 generations.

INTRODUCTION Health and a preoccupation with maintaining it permeates all aspects of human culture.
Health is a concern to humans everywhere. There is no end to the variety of ways cultures across history have
treated health, healing, and medicine. Human health and well-being sit at the intersection of biology and
culture. Both physical and social environments shape well-being and health outcomes. Medical anthropology
is a holistic specialty that draws on all four fields of anthropology but primarily builds on cultural anthropology
and biological anthropology to understand the health implications of a culture's impact on human physiology
and well-being.

     17.1 What Is Medical Anthropology?

     LEARNING OUTCOMES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
       · Define health, illness, sickness, and the sick role.
       · Describe early research and methods in medical anthropology.
       · Explain Franz Boas's influence in establishing the foundations of medical anthropology.
       · Describe how medical anthropology has developed since World War II.

     Social Construction of Health

     The World Health Organization defines health as "a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being
     and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity" (World Health Organization 2020). Health is affected by
     multiple social, biological, and environmental factors. Disease is strictly biological--an abnormality that
     affects an individual's physical structure, chemistry, or function. Going back to the time of the ancient Greek
     physician Hippocrates, doctors have regarded disease as the result of both a person's lifestyle habits and the
     social environment in which they live. Illness, by comparison, is the individual's sociocultural experience of a
     disruption to their physical or mental well-being. An individual's perception of their own illness is shaped by
     how that illness is viewed, discussed, and explained by the society they live in. The social perception of
     another person's sickness affects that person's social well-being and how they are viewed and treated by
     others. Sick roles are the social expectations for a sick person's behaviors based on their particular
     sickness--how they should act, how they should treat the sickness, and how others should treat them. Malady
     is the term anthropologists use to encompass disease, illness, and sickness.

       · Health is your state of well-being.
       · Disease is a biological abnormality.
       · Illness is your sociocultural experience of health.
       · Sickness is a social perception of ill health.
       · Malady is a broad term for everything above.

Foundational to medical anthropology is an understanding of health and malady that includes social
experiences and cultural definitions. Medical anthropology studies how societies construct understandings of
health and illness, including medical treatments for all types of maladies. Culture affects how we perceive
everything, including health. Culture shapes how people think and believe and the values they hold. It shapes
everything people have and do. Many cultures approach health and illness in completely different ways from
one another, often informed by a number of societal factors. Medical anthropology provides a framework for
common study and comparison between cultures, highlighting systems and illustrating how culture
determines how health is perceived.

History of Medical Anthropology

While medical anthropology is a relatively new subfield, it has deep roots within four-field American
anthropology, with a strong connection to early European anthropologists' study of religion. The holistic
approach of Franz Boas was also key to the development of medical anthropology. One focus of Boas's research
was analysis of the "race theory" common in the 19th and early 20th centuries in the United States. According
to this theory, one's assigned racial category and ethnic background determined certain physical features as
well as behavioral characteristics. Boas challenged this assumption through studies of the health and
physiology of immigrant families in New York City in 1912. Boas found that there was a great deal of flexibility
in human biological characteristics within an ethnic group, with social factors such as nutrition and child-
rearing practices playing a key role in determining human development and health. He noted that cultural
changes to nutrition and child-rearing practices, changes that are commonly a part of the immigrant
experience, were linked to generational changes in biology. Boas provided empirical data from his own
primary sources that refuted theories of biological inheritance as the source of social behaviors and revealed
the impact of local environments (natural, modified, and social) in structuring cultural and physical outcomes.
This foundation was starkly opposed to the inherent racism of social evolutionism, which was the dominant
anthropological theory of his time.

Boas's students, such as Ruth Benedict, Margaret Mead, and Edward Sapir, all continued aspects of his work,
taking their research in unique directions that affect medical anthropology to this day. Benedict's cultural
personality studies, Mead's work on child-rearing practices and adolescence, and Sapir's work on psychology
and language laid the foundations of psychological anthropology. Their foray into psychological anthropology
was preceded by the work of British psychiatrist and anthropologist W. H. R. Rivers (1901), who studied the
inheritance of sensory capabilities and disabilities among Melanesian populations while participating in the
Torres Strait island expedition in 1898. He developed a great respect for his Melanesian research participants
and utilized his research findings to denounce the "noble savage" fallacy. By demonstrating that a shared
biological mechanism of inheritance and environmental influences shaped the Melanesian senses in the same
way as it did the British, he illustrated that their mental capacity was the same as Europeans.

     of factors, including many determined by one's social and physical environment. (credit: US National Archives and
     Records Administration/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)

     Medical anthropology also has roots in the anthropology of religion, a subfield of anthropology that shines a
     lens on many aspects of health. The anthropology of religion looks at how humans develop and enact spiritual
     beliefs in their daily lives and at how these beliefs are utilized as a form of social control. A number of
     commonly studied key frameworks of the anthropology of religion--rituals of healing, taboos of health,
     shamanic healing, health beliefs, cultural symbolism, and stigma, among them--focus on health and health
     outcomes. A number of notable early religious anthropologists, including E. E. Evans-Pritchard, Victor and
     Edith Turner, and Mary Douglas, did work on subjects such as healing rituals, misfortune and harm, pollution,
     and taboo. Evans-Pritchard's work among the Azande people of North Central Africa continues to be
     foundational to medical anthropology. Especially important is the chapter "The Notion of Witchcraft Explains
     Unfortunate Events" from the book Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic among the Azande, which introduces the
     domain of causation and its many cross-cultural forms. This chapter directly impacted the concept of
     explanatory models, which we will cover in depth later in this chapter. The work of Victor and Edith Turner
     focused on ritual healing, pilgrimage, and socially enforced morality. Mary Douglas's Purity and Danger ([1966]
     2002) examined the concepts of pollution and taboo as well as rituals designed to restore purity. Her work
     continues to be influential, particularly for medical anthropologists focused on sickness-related stigma and its
     impact on patients' illness experiences.

     World War II brought about a profound change in the way anthropologists did their work. A number of Boas's
     students helped the British and United States governments during the war, a trend that continued after the
     war. Focusing on both public and private health initiatives, anthropologists increasingly worked to help people
     improve their health outcomes in the post-war era. These public health efforts were directly connected with
     the founding of the United Nations and the World Health Organization (WHO). In this period, well-being and
     health care were included in the declaration of human rights, and biomedical thinking became focused on
     "conquering" infectious disease.

     The formal founding of the discipline of medical anthropology can be traced to the late 1970s. One landmark is
     the publication of George Foster and Barbara Anderson's (1978) medical anthropology textbook. However,
     many applied anthropologists and researchers in allied health fields, such as social epidemiology and public
     health, had been conducting cross-cultural health studies since the conclusion of World War II. These include
     Edward Wellin, Benjamin Paul, Erwin Ackerknecht, and John Cassell. Many of these early figures were
     themselves medical doctors who saw the limitations of a strictly biomechanical approach to health and
     disease.

Personal Histories: Paul Farmer is a medical anthropologist and physician who first visited Haiti in 1983 as a
volunteer. Inspired by this experience, Farmer set out to find a way to bring necessary treatments to parts of
the world seemingly forgotten by modern medicine. When Harvard Medical School began offering a dual PhD/
MD program, Farmer was among the first enrolled, and he soon founded Partners in Health (PIH) with his
colleagues. Since then, he has championed affordable health care around the world. He is currently a professor
of medicine and chief of the Division of Global Health Equity at Brigham and Women's Hospital, while still
being actively involved in Partners in Health. Farmer has written extensively on the AIDS epidemic, infectious
diseases, and health equity. In 2003, Farmer was the subject of Tracy Kidder's book Mountains Beyond
Mountains: The Quest of Dr. Paul Farmer, A Man Who Would Cure the World, which is an accessible account of
Farmer's work with Partners in Health. Farmer is married to Didi Bertrand Farmer, a Haitian medical
anthropologist. They have three children.

Like Farmer, Jim Yong Kim was one of the first to enroll in Harvard Medical's dual medical anthropology PhD/
MD program. He was a cofounder of Partners in Health while still in medical school, at a time when he was
spending his summers in Haiti treating patients with limited access to health care. He championed the initial
expansion of PIH into other countries, beginning with Peru. In 2003 Kim left Partners in Health to join the
World Health Organization, becoming director of HIV/AIDs treatments and research in 2004. Under Kim, the
WHO has fast-tracked a number of new treatments to help those affected by AIDS in Africa. Kim was the
president of Dartmouth College from 2009 until 2012, when he became president of the World Bank. He held
this position until 2019, when he left to join Global Infrastructure Partners.

Area of Anthropology: medical anthropology, applied anthropology

Accomplishments in the Field: Partners in Health was founded in 1987 by a group including Farmer and Kim,
with the goal of setting up a clinic in Haiti to combat the devastation of the AIDS epidemic. Made up of
volunteers, philanthropists, and medical students trained in anthropological methodology, the organization
sought to combat the AIDS epidemic at a time when governments refused to adequately fund efforts to combat
what was then perceived as a "gay disease." By the mid-1990s, PIH was offering patients in Haiti treatments
that cost hundreds of dollars, as opposed to the tens of thousands of dollars they would have cost in the United
States. They have since duplicated this work in other settings, and their methods have been used by countless
nonprofits around the world to offer life-saving treatments to impoverished communities.

Importance of Their Work: Partners in Health works today in 11 countries, with a staff of over 18,000 spread
across the globe. They build hospitals, health clinics, and research labs aimed at improving medical treatment
and creating a more equitable global health care system. Their model has been replicated by countless
520  17 · Medical Anthropology

     organizations around the world to bring down the cost of health care and increase the quality of the care given.

     Since the 1980s, medical anthropologists have diversified the field through interdisciplinary applications of
     anthropology and the applied use of medical anthropology in health care and government policy. The role of
     the anthropologist in this work often varies but is typically focused on translating cultural nuance and
     biomedical knowledge into policy and human-centered care. Today, the field of medical anthropology includes
     applied anthropologists working in medical settings, nonprofits, and government entities such as the Centers
     for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the WHO. Academic
     medical anthropologists are problem-oriented researchers who study the complex relationship between
     human culture and health. As can be seen in the lives and careers of the medical anthropologists highlighted
     in this chapter's profiles, medical anthropologists frequently occupy both academic and applied roles
     throughout their career as they seek to apply insights from their research to effect positive change in the lives
     of those they study.

     17.2 Ethnomedicine

     LEARNING OUTCOMES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
       · Define ethnomedicine, traditional environmental knowledge, and biomedicine.
       · Provide examples of cultural and societal systems that use religion and faith to heal.
       · Define medical pluralism.

     Ethnomedicine is a society's cultural knowledge about the management of health and treatments for illness,
     sickness, and disease. This includes the culturally appropriate process for seeking health care and the
     culturally defined signs and symptoms of illness that raise a health concern. Ethnomedical systems are
     frequently closely related to belief systems and religious practices. Healing can include rituals and natural
     treatments drawn from the local environment. Healing specialists in an ethnomedical system are
     knowledgeable individuals who undergo training or apprenticeship. Some examples of ethnomedical healers
     are midwives, doulas, herbalists, bonesetters, surgeons, and shamans, whose ethnomedicine existed in
     cultural traditions around the world prior to biomedicine. Anthropologists frequently note that
     ethnomedicinal healers possess knowledge of both how to heal and how to inflict harm by physical and
     sometimes metaphysical means. Ethnomedicine does not focus on "traditional" medicine, but instead allows

for cross-cultural comparison of medical systems.

FIGURE 17.5 A Peruvian shaman prepares herbal medicine for an upcoming ritual. (credit: "Shaman" by Alan
Kotok/flickr, CC BY 2.0)

Some forms of healing rely upon spiritual knowledge as a form of medicine. Within shamanism, people
deliberately enter the spirit world to treat ailments, with the culture's shaman acting as an emissary. The goal
may be to eliminate the illness or to at least identify its source. Similarly, faith healing relies upon a shared
understanding of faith and local beliefs, with spirituality pervading the healing process. Exorcising individuals
of possession by negative spirits is a common form of faith healing that occurs within Christian, Islamic,
Buddhist, and shamanic frameworks. In many cases, cultures that utilize biomedicine also utilize some forms
of faith healing.

Ethnopharmacology utilizes herbs, foods, and other natural substances to treat or heal illness. Traditional
ethnopharmacological treatments are currently of great interest to pharmaceutical companies looking for new
biomedical cures. Many common medicines have roots in ethnopharmacological traditions. Used in Chinese
medicine, indigenous American healing, and traditional European medicine, willow bark is a widespread cure
for headaches. In 1897, the chemist Dr. Felix Hoffmann, working for the Bayer corporation, isolated
acetylsalicylic acid as the active pain-reducing ingredient in willow bark, giving the world Bayer aspirin.

The concept of traditional ecological knowledge, or TEK, refers to medical knowledge of different herbs,
animals, and resources in an environment that provides a basis for ethnomedicine. Many cultures have been
able to translate detailed awareness of their environments, such as where water is and where and when certain
herbs grow, into complex and effective ethnomedical systems (Houde 2007). In 2006, Victoria Reyes-Garcia,
working with others, conducted a comprehensive study of Amazonian TEK. Victoria and her colleagues
collected information regarding plants useful for food and medicine from 650 research participants from
villages along the Maniqui River in the Amazon River basin.

China's traditional medicine system is another excellent example of an ethnomedical system that relies heavily
on TEK and ethnopharmacology. While many in China do rely upon biomedicine to treat specific health
problems, they also keep themselves in balance using traditional Chinese medicine. The decision of which
health system to consult is often left to the patient, but at times doctors will suggest a patient visit a traditional
apothecary and vice versa, creating a complementary medical system that makes use of both approaches.
While bound by geography prior to the 19th century, in today's globalized world a traditional Chinese doctor
can use resources from anywhere around the world, whether it is dried body parts of a tiger or herbs found in
another part of China. Chinese traditional medicine, as an ethnomedical system, is heavily influenced by
culture and context. It focuses on balancing the body, utilizing a number of forces from the natural world.
Traditional Chinese medicine makes use of substances as diverse as cicada shells, tiger livers, dinosaur bones,
and ginseng to create medicine. Healers in this system are often in a role similar to Western pharmacists,
concocting medicine in a variety of forms such as pills, tonics, and balms. The differences between a
522  17 · Medical Anthropology

     traditional Chinese medication healer and biomedical pharmacist include both the tools and ingredients used
     and the foundational assumptions about the cause of and treatments for various ailments. Around the world,
     traditional environmental knowledge is used both in place of biomedicine and alongside it.

     Biomedicine is an ethnomedical system deeply shaped by European and North American history and rooted
     in the cultural system of Western science. It draws heavily from biology and biochemistry. Biomedicine treats
     disease and injuries with scientifically tested cures. Biomedical health care professionals base their
     assessment of the validity of a treatment on the results of clinical trials, conducted following the principles of
     the scientific method. It should be noted that as each health care professional is not conducting their own
     research, but instead relying on the work of others, this assessment still requires faith. Biomedicine places its
     faith in the scientific method, where other ethnomedical systems place their faith in a deity, the healer's power,
     or time-tested treatments passed down in traditional ecological knowledge. Biomedicine is not free from
     culture; it is an ethnomedical system shaped by Western cultural values and history. Biomedicine falls short of
     its ideal of scientific objectivity. Medical anthropologists have extensively documented the way systemic
     prejudices such as racism, classism, and sexism permeate biomedicine, impacting its effectiveness and
     perpetuating health inequalities. Still, in the Western world, biomedicine is often utilized as a point of
     comparison for other ethnomedical systems.

     Biomedicine has been critiqued by medical anthropologists for assuming predominance over other forms of
     healing and cultural knowledge. In many contexts, biomedicine is presumed to be superior because it is
     clinical and based on scientific knowledge. Yet this presumed superiority requires that a patient trusts and
     believes in science and the biomedical system. If a person mistrusts biomedicine, whether because of a bad
     experience with the biomedical model or a preference for another ethnomedical approach, their health
     outcomes will suffer if they are forced to rely on the biomedical system. Biomedicine can also disrupt and
     threaten culturally established treatments and cures. For example, in a culture that treats schizophrenia by
     granting a person spiritual power and treating them as part of the community, labeling that individual as
     mentally ill according to biomedical terms takes away their power and removes their agency. In most cases, a
     hybrid model, in which biomedicine does not assume supremacy but instead works alongside and supports
     ethnomedicine, is the most effective approach. A hybrid model accords the ill the ability to choose those
     treatments that they think will best help.

     FIGURE 17.6 An apothecary in a Nanjing hospital in China prepares a treatment grounded in traditional Chinese

     setting. (credit: "Apothecary mixing traditional chinese medicine at Jiangsu Chinese Medical Hospital in Nanjing,
     China" by Kristoffer Trolle/flickr, CC BY 2.0)
     Medical pluralism occurs when competing ethnomedical traditions coexist and form distinct health
     subcultures with unique beliefs, practices, and organizations. In many contemporary societies, ethnomedical
     systems coexist with and frequently incorporate biomedicine. Biomedicine is privileged as the dominant

health care system in the United States, but in many metropolitan areas, people can also consult practitioners
of Chinese medicine, Ayurvedic medicine, homeopathic medicine, chiropractic medicine, and other
ethnomedicinal systems from around the world. Examples of medical pluralism are fairly common in
contemporary Western society: yoga as a treatment for stress and as a form of physical and mental therapy,
essential oils derived from traditional medicine to enhance health, and countless others. Contemporary
cultures often fuse biomedicine and ethnomedicine rather than just choosing one or the other. However, the
privilege and medical authority of biomedicine does not always afford people the right to choose, or may give
them only a limited capacity to do so. Anne Fadiman's (1998) The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down, which
explores the conflicts between a small hospital in California and the parents of a Hmong child with epilepsy
over the child's care, is a classic example of the cultural conflicts that can occur in medically pluralistic
societies.

In many parts of the world, biomedicine has accompanied colonialization, and indigenous health practices
have been suppressed in favor of biomedicine. Juliet McMullin's (2010) Healthy Ancestor: Embodied Inequality
and the Revitalization of Native Hawaiian Health discusses the suppression of Hawaii's indigenous
ethnomedical system as a long-lasting legacy of its colonial history. The book includes the efforts of
contemporary Hawaiians to regain the healthy lifestyle of their precolonial ancestors. McMullin concludes that
while contemporary biomedical health care professionals are more open to Hawaii's ethnomedical practices
than their predecessors were, there is still work to be done.

17.3 Theories and Methods

LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
  · Discuss the importance of cross-cultural comparison and cultural relativism in study of human health.
  · Explain why both objectivity and subjectivity are needed in the study of health.
  · Discuss ethnographic research methods and their specific applications to the study of human health.
  · Summarize the theoretical frameworks that guide medical anthropologists.

The Importance of Cultural Context

Culture is at the center of all human perspectives and shapes all that humans do. Cultural relativism is crucial
to medical anthropology. There is a great degree of variety in the symptoms and conditions that cultures note
as significant indicators of diminished health. How the sick are treated varies between cultures as well,
including the types of treatments prescribed for a particular sickness. Cultural context matters, and health
outcomes determined by culture are informed by that culture's many parts. The United States, for example,
relies heavily on biomedicine, treating symptoms of mental and physical illness with medication. This
prevalence is not merely an economic, social, or scientific consideration, but all three. A cultural group's
political-economic context and its cultural beliefs, traditions, and values all create the broader context in
which a health system exists and all impact individuals on a psychosocial level. Behaviors such as dietary
choices and preferences, substance use, and activity level--frequently labeled as lifestyle risk factors--are all
heavily influenced by culture and political-economic forces.

While Western cultures rely upon biomedicine, others favor ethnopharmacology and/or ritual healing. Medical
anthropologists must attempt to observe and evaluate ethnomedical systems without a bias toward
biomedicine. Medical anthropologists must be cautious of tendencies toward ethnocentrism. Ethnocentrism in
medical anthropology takes the form of using the health system of one's own culture as a point of comparison,
giving it preference when analyzing and evaluating other systems. An American anthropologist who studies
ethnomedicine in the Amazon River basin must be careful to limit their bias toward a biomedical approach as
much as they can. That is not to say that subjective experience and opinion need be discarded entirely, merely
that bias should be acknowledged and where necessary limited. Admitting bias is the first step in combating it.
Being aware of one's own ethnocentrism allows an anthropologist to analyze culture and medicine more
truthfully.

     Methods of Medical Anthropology

     Medical anthropology is a highly intersectional subfield of anthropology. The field addresses both the
     biological and social dimensions of maladies and their treatments. Medical anthropologists must thus become
     comfortable with a wide-ranging tool kit, as diverse as health itself. Like all anthropologists, medical
     anthropologists rely on qualitative methods, such as ethnographic fieldwork, but they also must be able to
     appropriately use quantitative methods such as biometrics (including blood pressure, glucose levels,
     nutritional deficiencies, hormone levels, etc.) and medical statistics (such as rates of comorbidities, birth rates,
     mortality rates, and hospital readmission rates). Medical anthropologists can be found working in a myriad of
     endeavors: aiding public health initiatives, working in clinical settings, influencing health care policy, tracking
     the spread of a disease, or working for companies that develop medical technologies. The theories and
     methods of medical anthropology are invaluable to such endeavors.

     Qualitative Methods
     Within medical anthropology, a number of qualitative research methods are invaluable tools. Qualitative
     methods are hands-on, first-person approaches to research. An anthropologist in the room or on the ground
     writing down field notes based on what they see and recording events as they happen creates valuable data for
     themselves and for others.

     Participant observation is a methodology in which the anthropologist makes first-person observations while
     participating in a culture. In medical anthropology, participant observation can take many forms.
     Anthropologists observe and participate in clinical interactions, shamanic rituals, public health initiatives, and
     faith healing. A form of participant observation, clinical observations allow the anthropologist to see a
     culture's healing practices at work. Whether a doctor is treating COVID-19 or a shaman is treating a case of
     soul loss, the anthropologist observes the dynamics of the treatment and in some cases actually participates as
     a patient or healer's apprentice. This extremely hands-on method gives the anthropologist in-depth firsthand
     experience with a culture's health system but also poses a risk of inviting personal bias.

     Anthropologists observe a myriad of topics, from clinical interactions to shamanic rituals, public health
     initiatives to faith healing. They carry these firsthand observations with them into their interviews, where they
     inform the questions they ask. In medical anthropology, interviews can take many forms, from informal chats
     to highly structured conversations. An example of a highly structured interview is an illness narrative
     interview. Illness narrative interviews are discussions of a person's illness that are recorded by
     anthropologists. These interviews can be remarkably diverse: they can involve formal interviews or informal
     questioning and can be recorded, written down, or take place electronically via telephone or video conference
     call. The social construction of sickness and its impact on an individual's illness experience is deeply personal.
     Illness narratives almost always focus on the person who is ill but can at times involve their caregivers, family,
     and immediate network as well.

     Another method commonly used in medical anthropology, health decision-making analysis, looks at the
     choices and considerations that go into deciding how to treat health issues. The anthropologist interviews the
     decision makers and creates a treatment decision tree, allowing for analysis of the decisions that determine
     what actions to take. These decisions can come from both the patient and the person providing the treatment.
     What religious or spiritual choices might make a person opt out of a procedure? What economic issues might
     they face at different parts of their illness or sickness? Health decision-making analysis is a useful tool for
     looking at how cultures treat sickness and health, and it highlights a culture's economic hierarchies, spiritual
     beliefs, material realities, and social considerations such as caste and gender.

     Quantitative Methods
     Quantitative methods produce numeric data that can be counted, correlated, and evaluated for statistical
     significance. Anthropologists utilize census data, medical research data, and social statistics. They conduct
     quantitative surveys, social network analysis that quantifies social relationships, and analysis of biomarkers.
     Analysis of census data is an easy way for medical anthropologists to understand the demographics of the
     population they are studying, including birth and death rates. Census data can be broken down to analyze
     culturally specific demographics, such as ethnicity, religion, and other qualifiers as recorded by the census
     takers. At times, an anthropologist may have to record this data themselves if the available data is absent or

17.3 · Theories and Methods                                                                                        525

insufficient. This type of analysis is often done as a kind of background research on the group being studying,
creating a broader context for more specific analysis to follow.

Also important to medical anthropologists are analyses of medical statistics. The study of medical records
helps researchers understand who is getting treated for what sickness, determine the efficacy of specific
treatments, and observe complications that arise with statistical significance, among other considerations.
Analysis of census data combined with medical statistics allows doctors and other health providers, as well as
medical anthropologists, to study a population and apply that data toward policy solutions. Famous examples
include the World Health Organization's work on health crises such as HIV/AIDS, Ebola, and COVID-19.

Questionnaires are more personal to the anthropologist, allowing them to ask pointed questions pertinent to
their particular research. Surveys make it possible for anthropologists to gather a large quantity of data that
can then be used to inform the questions they ask using qualitative methods. Distribution methods for surveys
vary and including means such as personally asking the questions, releasing the survey through a health care
provider, or offering online surveys that participants choose to answer.

These are the most common methods used by medical anthropologists. Different theories are influential in
determining which of the methods a particular research might favor. These theories inform how an
anthropologist might interpret their data, how they might compose a study from beginning to end, and how
they interact with the people they study. Combined with more general anthropological theory, each
anthropologist must craft a composite of theory and method to create their own personalized study of the
world of human health.

Theoretical Approaches to Medical Anthropology

Social Health
Biomedicine, the science-based ethnomedical system practiced in the United States, recognizes the impact
physical health and mental health have on one another: when one falters, the other does as well. There is an
increasing awareness in biomedicine of a third type of health, social health, which has long been recognized
by many ethnomedical systems around the world. Each of the theoretical approaches to medical anthropology
demonstrates that to develop a holistic understanding of human well-being, it is necessary to include mental,
physical, and social health. Social health is driven by a complex set of sociocultural factors that impact an
individual or community's wellness. At a macro level, it includes the cultural and political-economic forces
shaping the health of individuals and communities. An individual's social health also includes the support a
person receives from their extended social network, as well as the social pressures or stigma a person may
face and the meaning that they ascribe to their experiences. Just as mental and physical health strongly
influence one another, when a person's social health falters, their physical and/or mental health declines as
well.

health. When one falters, the others are affected. (credit: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0
license)

Physical environments--whether they are natural, constructed, or modified environments--shape cultural
adaptations and behaviors. People living on islands and people living in deserts inhabit very different
526  17 · Medical Anthropology

     environments that inform their cultures and affect their biology. On the other hand, culture often affects how
     humans interact with their environments. People who work in offices in Los Angeles and hunter-gatherers in
     the Amazon River basin interact with their environments differently, relying upon very different subsistence
     patterns and sets of material culture. Culture also informs human biology. Eating a lot of spicy foods changes a
     person's biophysiology and health outcomes, as do dietary taboos such as refusing to eat pork. These dietary
     choices inform biology over generations as well as within a single lifetime.

     The Biocultural Approach
     The biocultural approach to anthropology acknowledges the links between culture and biology. Biology has
     informed human development and evolution, including the adaptations that have made culture, language, and
     social living possible. Culture, in turn, informs choices that can affect our biology. The biocultural approach
     analyzes the interaction between culture, biology, and health. It focuses on how the environment affects us,
     and the connections between biological adaptations and sociocultural ones. The biocultural approach draws
     on biometric and ethnographic data to understand how culture impacts health. The effects of environment on
     biology and culture are apparent in the treatment of survivors of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident that
     occurred in 2011 in Japan. Studies regarding the genetic health of survivors focus on the combination of
     environmental damage and social stigma in Japan due to their potential exposure to radiation.

     Symbolic Approach
     Other theoretical approaches ask different types of questions. What does it mean to be a patient? What are the
     social expectations for the behaviors of a person diagnosed as suffering from a particular sickness? Why is it
     symbolically meaningful for a treatment to be prescribed by a medical doctor? These are questions typically
     asked by those utilizing a symbolic approach to medical anthropology. The symbolic approach focuses on the
     symbolic thinking and beliefs of a culture and how those beliefs affect social and especially health outcomes.

     A person's beliefs affect how they perceive treatments and how they experience illness. The most obvious
     example of the symbolic approach at work is the placebo effect. If a person believes that a treatment will be
     effective, this belief will affect their health outcome. Often in medical trials, people who believe they are
     receiving a treatment but are in fact receiving a placebo, such as a sugar pill, will demonstrate physiological
     responses similar to those receiving an active substance. Accounting for the placebo effect is an important
     consideration for all medical studies. The opposite of the placebo effect, the nocebo effect, occurs when a
     person believes they are not receiving an effective medicine or that a treatment is harmful. Common to both
     phenomena is the importance of meaning-centered responses to health outcomes. One of the most potent
     examples of this is voodoo death, when psychosomatic effects--that is, physical effects created by social,
     cultural, and behavioral factors--such as fear brought on by culture and environment cause sudden death.
     Related to the symbolic approach of medical anthropology is the symbolic interaction approach to health
     utilized by medical sociologists. Both approaches recognize that health and illness are socially constructed
     concepts. The symbolic interaction approach to health focuses on the roles of the patient, caregiver, and health
     care provider and the interactions that take place between people occupying these roles.

     Medical Ecology
     Another major medical anthropology theory is medical ecology. Pioneered by Paul Baker and based on his
     work in the Andes and American Samoa in the 1960s and 1970s, medical ecology is a multidisciplinary
     approach that studies the effects of environment on health outcomes. Examples of these environmental
     influences include food sources, environmental disasters and damage, and how environmentally informed
     lifestyles affect health. Whereas the biocultural approach looks at the intersection of biology and culture,
     medical ecology focuses instead on how environment informs both health and the culture surrounding it.

     A popular example of these connections can be observed in what are termed Blue Zones, certain locations
     around the world where a significant number of people regularly live exceptionally long lives, many over a
     century. These communities can be found in the United States, Japan, Columbia, Italy, and Greece. Common
     links between people who live in these places include a high-vegetable, low-animal-product diet (eggs and fish
     are the exception), a lively social life and regular activity, and a strong sense of cultural identity.

     A negative example of the links between environment and health can be viewed in the Flint, Michigan, water
     crisis. In this case, pollution of the city water system negatively affected health outcomes due to high exposure

to lead and Legionnaires' disease. Studies, including a long-term study by the National Institutes of Health,
confirm that the water, central to the larger environment of Flint, negatively affected citizens of all ages, with
particular harm caused to children and the elderly.

health. (Credit: "Sata angagi" by Hajime NAKANO/flickr, CC BY 2.0)

Cultural Systems Model
Culture is a chief consideration in another theory, the cultural systems model. Cross-cultural comparison is a
core methodology for anthropology at large, and the cultural systems model is ideal for cross-cultural
comparison of health systems and health outcomes. Cultures are made of various systems, which are informed
by sociocultural, political-economic, and historical considerations. These systems can include health care
systems, religious institutions and spiritual entities, economic organizations, and political and cultural
groupings, among many others. Different cultures prioritize different systems and place greater or less value
on different aspects of their culture and society. The cultural systems model analyzes the ways in which
different cultures give preference to certain types of medical knowledge over others. And, using the cultural
systems model, different cultures can be compared to one another.

An example of the cultural systems model at work is Tsipy Ivry's Embodying Culture: Pregnancy in Japan and
Israel (2009), which examines pregnancy and birth in Israel and Japan. A particular focus is how state-
controlled regulation of pregnancy and cultural attitudes about pregnancy affect women differently in each
society. Despite both societies having socialized medicine, each prioritizes the treatment of pregnant women
and the infant differently.

In the Israeli cultural model for pregnancy, life begins at a child's first breath, which is when a woman becomes
a mother. Ivry describes a cultural model that is deeply impacted by anxiety regarding fetal medical conditions
that are deemed outside the mother's and doctor's control. As every pregnancy is treated as high risk,
personhood and attachment are delayed until birth. The state of Israel is concerned with creating a safe and
healthy gene pool and seeks to eliminate genes that may be harmful to offspring; thus, the national health care
system pressures women to undergo extensive diagnostic testing and terminate pregnancies that pass on
genes that are linked to disorders like Tay-Sachs disease.

Japan, facing decreasing birthrates, pressures women to maximize health outcomes and forgo their own
desires for the sake of the national birth rate. The cultural model for pregnancy in Japan emphasizes the
importance of the mother's body as a fetal environment. From conception, it is a mother's responsibility to
create a perfect environment for her child to grow. Mothers closely monitor their bodies, food intake, weight
gain, and stressful interactions. In Japan, working during pregnancy is strongly discouraged. Ivry noted that
528  17 · Medical Anthropology

     many women even quit work in preparation for becoming pregnant, whereas in Israel mothers work right up
     to delivery.

     The cultural systems model also allows medical anthropologists to study how medical systems evolve when
     they come into contact with different cultures. An examination of the treatment of mental illness is a good way
     of highlighting this. While in the United States mental illness is treated with clinical therapy and
     pharmaceutical drugs, other countries treat mental illness differently. In Thailand, schizophrenia and gender
     dysmorphia are understood in the framework of culture. Instead of stigmatizing these conditions as illnesses,
     they are understood as gifts that serve much-needed roles in society. Conversely, in Japan, where
     psychological diagnoses have become mainstream in the last few decades and pharmaceutical treatment is
     more prominent than it once was, psychological treatment is stigmatized. Junko Kitanaka's work on
     depression in Japan highlights how people with depression are expected to suffer privately and in silence. She
     links this socially enforced silence to Japan's high stress rates and high suicide rates (2015). The cultural
     systems model offers an effective way to evaluate these three approaches toward mental illness, giving a basis
     of comparison between the United States, Thailand, and Japan. Assigning ethnomedicine the same value as
     biomedicine rather than giving one primacy over the other, this important comparative model is central to the
     theoretical outlook of many medical anthropologists.

     health initiative targets the cultural tradition of people dying by suicide in the Aokigahara Forest. (Credit:

     The cultural systems model encompasses a myriad of cross-disciplinary techniques and theories. In many
     cultures, certain phrases, actions, or displays, such as clothing or amulets, are recognized as communicating a
     level of distress to the larger community. Examples include the practices of hanging "the evil eye" in Greece
     and tying a yellow ribbon around an oak tree during World War II in the United States. These practices are
     termed idioms of distress, indirect ways of expressing distress within a certain cultural context. A more
     psychologically driven consideration is the cause of people's behaviors, known as causal attributions. Causal
     attributions focus on both personal and situational causes of unexpected behaviors. A causal attribution for
     unusual behavior such as wandering the streets haplessly could be spirit possession within the context of
     Haitian Vodou, while in the United States behaviors such as sneezing and blowing one's nose might be
     attributed to someone not taking care of themselves.

     Causal attributions can be important to one's own illness. Anthropologist and psychiatrist Arthur Kleinman
     has concluded that if doctors and caregivers were to ask their patients what they think is wrong with them,
     these explanations might provide valuable information on treatment decisions. One patient might think that
     their epilepsy is caused by a spirit possession. Another might suggest that their developing diabetes in
     inevitable because of their culture and diet. These beliefs and explanations can guide a doctor to develop
     effective and appropriate treatments. The approach recommended by Kleinman is known as the explanatory
     model. The explanatory model encourages health care providers to ask probing questions of the patient to

better understand their culture, their worldview, and their understanding of their own health.

Political Economic Medical Anthropology
Another medical anthropology approach is critical medical anthropology (CMA), which is sometimes
referred to as political economic medical anthropology (PEMA). Critical medical anthropology has a specific
interest in the inequalities of health outcomes caused by political and economic hierarchies. Critical medical
anthropology advocates for community involvement and health care advocacy as ethical obligations. Defining
biomedicine as capitalist medicine, this approach is critical of the social conditions that cause disease and
health inequalities and of biomedicine's role in perpetuating these systemic inequalities. CMA is also
interested in the medicalization of social distress, a process that has led to a wide range of social problems and
life circumstances being treated as medical problems under the purview of biomedicine.

Systemic racism and structural violence create many negative health outcomes. Structural violence refers to
the way in which social institutions, intentionally or otherwise, harm members of some groups within the
larger society. Structural violence can affect things such as life expectancy, disability, or pregnancy outcomes
and can lead to distrust of medical systems. The Tuskegee syphilis study, a decades-long "experiment" that
studied the long-term effects of syphilis in Black men under the guise of medical treatment, is a prime
example of structural violence at work within the United States medical system. Black men involved in the
study were not told they had syphilis and were denied medical treatment for decades, with most dying of the
disease. The government's internal mechanisms for halting unethical studies failed to stop this experiment. It
was only when public awareness of what was happening resulted in an outcry against the study that the
experiments were stopped.

Another area of interest to medical anthropologists working with a CMA approach is how medical systems
might be inherently biased toward or against certain segments of society. The research of anthropologist Leith
Mullings demonstrated a lifelong focus on structures of inequality and resistance. Her work in Ghana
examined traditional medicine and religious practice through a postcolonial lens, which was critical of the
colonial legacy of structural inequality she observed. Her work in the United States also focused on health
inequalities, with a special interest in the intersection of race, class, and gender for Black women in urban
areas. It has been documented that some doctors in the United States regularly ignore the pain of women, and
this is especially true in cases where the doctor displays racial bias. This tendency has been cited in several
studies, including a study in The New England Journal of Medicine that found that women are more likely to be
misdiagnosed for coronary heart disease based on the symptoms they give and pain levels reported (Nubel
2000). Another study in the Journal of Pain found that women on average reported pain 20 percent more of the
530  17 · Medical Anthropology

     time than men and at a higher intensity (Ruau et al. 2012). Another example of research that takes a CMA
     approach is Khiara Bridges's 2011 Reproducing Race, which brings a critical lens to pregnancy as a site of
     racialization through her ethnography of a large New York City hospital. This medical racism contributes to the
     higher rates of African American infant and maternal mortality.

     Merrill Singer has done work on the role of social inequalities in drug addiction and in cycles of violence. This
     work has led to his development of the concept of sydnemics, the social intersection of health comorbidities,
     or two health conditions that often occur together. For example, Japan's hibakusha, or atomic bomb survivors
     of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, do not live as long as Japan's normally long-lived population and are more likely to
     develop multiple types of cancer and other diseases tied to their exposure to nuclear radiation. In addition to
     these health risks, they face heavy discrimination from the larger Japanese population due to misinformation
     regarding nuclear radiation and radiation contamination. This discrimination carries over to the descendants
     of hibakusha, who have a higher rate of cancer than the average Japanese population despite having no
     detectable genetic damage from the atomic bombings. Studies are ongoing as to the cultural, economic, and
     genetic causes of this cancer. Syndemics is highlighted in the near-century-long struggle for numerous
     conditions caused by the atomic bombings to be recognized as related to the atomic bombings and thus
     treated by the Japanese government.

     Critical theories of health are an applied method, analyzing medical systems and applying critical theory,
     often with the goal of improving the system or improving policy. Recommendations for improvements often
     come out of research but may also be the starting point of a research project, as part of a data-finding mission
     to highlight disparity in health outcomes. Whether it is systemic racism in biomedical treatment or power
     discrepancies in ethnomedical rituals, critical theories of health are a key part of exploring medicine in action
     and understanding real medical consequences. From birth to the grave, social inequalities shape health
     outcomes, life expectancy, and unnecessary human suffering. Critical medical anthropology scholarship
     demonstrates the social forces shaping disease and health, from drug addiction to the impacts of climate
     change. This work becomes a self-evident call of action. It is medical anthropology in action.

             PROFILES IN ANTHROPOLOGY

     Angela Garcia
     1971-

     Personal History: Angela Garcia (https://openstax.org/r/stanford.edu) comes from a small town along the
     Mexican border with New Mexico. She credits her background and upbringing with inspiring much of her later
     work in anthropology. Her early experiences have led her to focus on places where political and cultural
     spheres combine, resulting in inequality and violence. Within this framework, she has focused on medicine,
     postcolonial theory, and feminism. She first attended the University of California, Berkeley, and then earned a
     PhD from Harvard University in 2007, shortly thereafter publishing her first book, The Pastoral Clinic:
     Addiction and Dispossession along the Rio Grande.

     Area of Anthropology: medical anthropology, feminist anthropology

     Accomplishments in the Field: The Pastoral Clinic analyzes heroin addiction among Hispanic populations in
     New Mexico's Rio Grande region. Garcia's work focuses on the political and social realities that contribute to
     addiction and treatment, with dispossession as a central theme. The degradation of the surrounding
     environment and the economic decline of the Great Recession have been important factors in determining
     people's life choices. Also influential has been a political reality that denies many participation or power.
     Garcia describes addiction as a recurring reality in the lives of many, leading them in and out of rehab in an
     endless cycle. Garcia also describes the damaging effects of addiction on relationships within families and
     communities.

     Garcia joined the Department of Anthropology at Stanford University in 2016. Her work has shifted to Mexico
     City, where she studies coercive rehabilitation centers run by the poor. She is particularly interested in

political and criminal violence and in how informal centers like these exemplify the political and social climate
within the larger Mexican nation. As much as these centers embody these realities, they also try to shift power
away from pathways that lead to and encourage violence. In addition to this work, Garcia has also started
examining addiction and mental illness in both Mexico and the United States Latinx (Latina/o) population.

Importance of Their Work: Garcia publishes and presents frequently in preparation for books she is
currently writing. Her work is crucial to understanding dispossession and power dynamics within the United
States and Mexico, including how immigration and migration affect access to health care and shape identity.

Anthropology is an adaptable field of study. Its principles, theories, and methods can easily be applied to real-
world problem-solving in diverse settings. Medical anthropology is designed to be applied to the critical study
and improved practice of medicine. Medical anthropology has been employed in corporate settings, has been
used by doctors who want to reduce ethnocentrism or apply a holistic approach to medical research and
medical education, and has informed the work of academics who want to effect policy changes. The following
are but a few examples of applied medical anthropologists working to create change in the real world.

Evolutionary Medicine and Health

A final theoretical approach to medical anthropology, emerging from biological anthropology, is evolutionary
medicine. Evolutionary medicine sits at the intersection of evolutionary biology and human health, using the
framework of evolution and evolutionary theory to understand human health. Evolutionary medicine asks why
human health evolved the way it did, how environments affect health, and how we continue to affect our health
through a number of factors including migration, nutrition, and epigenetics.
532  17 · Medical Anthropology

     The story of human evolution is the story of gene flow and human migration. Each individual human carries
     specific gene combinations, and each human population carries with it a common set of genes. When people
     migrate, they bring those genes with them. If they have children, they pass those genes on in new
     combinations. Culture impacts population genetics in two ways: migration patterns and culturally defined
     rules of sexual selection impact the frequency of gene alleles, and thus genetic variation, in a human
     population. These genes often affect health outcomes, such as the likelihood of developing certain types of
     cancer or immunity to specific pathogens through exposure. The more frequently a human population
     interacts with other populations through migration, trade, and other forms of cultural exchange, the more
     likely it is that genetic material from one population will be introduced to the other. The current level of
     globalization makes it possible for genes to flow from one corner of the globe to another.

     Moving into a new culture, whether forced or voluntary, requires adaptation. Adapting one's culture to new
     rules, new norms, and new expectations, as well as adapting one's identity to being a minority or facing
     oppression or prejudice, can affect the health of the migration population. An obvious example of this is the
     effects of slavery on Africans brought to the Americas. This impact is shown not just on their genetics,
     discussed elsewhere in this chapter, but also in their cultures. Syncretized religions like Haitian Vodou,
     Candomblé, and other African-inspired religions show the ways in which African populations adapted their
     beliefs to survive contact with oppression and cruelty, evolving and sanitizing certain elements while
     embracing others.

     Populations that are physically isolated for long periods of time might experience negative effects from genetic
     drift as the frequency of rare alleles increases over time. Similarly, cultural groups that practice strict
     endogamy can experience negative effects from genetic drift. In isolation, populations can sometimes see a
     rise in the frequency of maladaptive gene variants, as in the case of Tay-Sachs disease found in ethnic minority
     populations that practice endogamy, such as Ashkenazi Jews or French Canadians. Among these populations,
     which have been relatively isolated from the populations around them, the genes that cause Tay-Sachs have
     become more common than in other populations. This suggests that isolation and segregation can result in
     unhealthy changes in a population's gene pool.

     Another example of evolutionary medicine is the study of the effects of the development of agriculture and the
     growth of urbanization on human health. The development of agriculture caused human health to change in
     many ways. Food became more regularly available, but diet became less varied and the amount of work
     required to procure the food increased. The regular movement associated with a gathering and hunting
     lifestyle resulted in robust overall fitness, but people were also at a greater danger of succumbing to a fatal
     accident before reaching the age at which they successfully reproduced. Our current lifestyle, in which many
     sit behind a desk for eight hours a day, five days a week, damages our spines and overall health. While food
     availability in Western nations is second to none, people living in those societies struggle with health problems
     related to being overweight and underactive. Each lifestyle has its trade-offs, and evolution has, over the past
     ten thousand years, affected both modern and neolithic humans differently. Through evolutionary health, we
     can track these changes and their adaptations.

     With human migration and the concentration of human populations in urban areas, disease has grown
     exponentially. Pathogens can now spread like wildfire across the world. In the past, disease has had a
     devastating effect on human populations. As just one example, the Black Death killed over a third of Europe's
     population, spreading via Silk Road merchants and the conquests of the Mongol Empire. Today we see yearly
     flare-ups of influenza and Ebola and are still dealing with the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic
     that caused nations to close borders and people within nations to limit social contact with one another.
     Globalization not only makes it possible for pathogens and pandemics to spread, but also allows nations to
     cooperatively distribute vaccines and coordinate methods to contain viruses. Nations can now share medical
     data to help develop treatments and help one another in efforts to isolate and quarantine the sick and infected.
     On the other hand, international cooperation can hamper local response and prevent cities, provinces, states,
     and nations from acting in their own best interest.

At the heart of each of these areas of study is epigenetics, or the change of the expression of a gene during a
single human lifetime. Often prompted by environmental exposure and mutations over a lifetime, epigenetic
shifts are heritable changes in a person's DNA that are phenotypical, meaning that they are linked to outwardly
expressed traits. For example, studies show that people exposed to smoking in childhood tend to be shorter in
adulthood. Similarly, trauma can stunt growth or increase the likelihood of developing specific
maladaptations. The development of sickle cell anemia in the African American community has been linked to
epigenetic adaptation to slavery in the United States, according to a 2016 study by Juliana Lindenau et al. This
and other studies suggest that trauma can be inherited and can last generations. Epigenetics show evolution at
work in real time, affecting both individuals and future generations.

Culture and the Brain

The human brain is a fascinating research topic, both medically and culturally. Different cultures
conceptualize the brain, its functions, and its health differently. Biomedicine and ethnomedicine systems view
human physiology in distinct ways, and these two systems typically have very different explanatory models for
understanding the brain and its role in psychology and neurology. Anthropologists are interested in both of
these explanatory models and the ways they influence treatment. Some topics of particular interest to medical
anthropologists include how psychology affects biology and health, the stigma of mental health across
cultures, addiction, culture-bound syndromes, and experiences and illnesses related to stress. Daniel Lende
and Greg Downey brought together these topics under the heading of neuroanthropology (https://openstax.org/
r/neuroanthropology), an emerging specialty that examines the relationship between culture and the brain.

As highlighted during the discussion of the cultural systems model, the acceptance of psychology is highly
variable by culture. Societies that rely upon biomedicine are more apt to embrace psychological approaches to
mental health problems. Encouraging other cultures to apply psychology and psychiatry sometimes requires
an anthropologist's touch. One challenge for a medical anthropologist is convincing people who do not believe
in mental health challenges that acknowledging and treating mental health issues is a better approach than
ignoring them. India's slow but eventual acceptance of psychology is described by Rebecca Clay in a 2002
article. In this case, psychology was gradually normalized and accepted through a combination of Indian
medical theory and psychological treatments and diagnoses. This culturally based path toward normalization
indicates the need for cultural understanding and a nuanced approach by medical anthropologists.

Culturally specific nuance is especially important in understanding what anthropologists call culture-bound
syndromes. Culture-bound syndromes refer to unique ways in which a particular culture conceptualizes the
manifestations of mental illness, whether as physical and/or social symptoms. The condition is a "cultural
534  17 · Medical Anthropology

     syndrome" in that it is not a biologically based disease identified among other populations.

     A prominent example is susto, a syndrome in Latino societies of the Americas. First documented by Rubel,
     O'Nell, and Collado-Ardon (1991), susto is stress, panic, or fear caused by bearing witness to traumatic
     experiences happening to other people around you. Originating with Indigenous groups in the Americas, this
     panic attack-like illness was seen as a spiritual attack on people and has a number of symptoms ranging from
     nervousness and depression to anorexia and fever. Cultural syndromes are not limited to non-Western
     societies, however. According to anthropologist Caroline Giles Banks (1992), anorexia nervosa, an eating
     disorder where the person does not eat in order to stay thin in accordance with the beauty standards in the
     United States and Europe, is a prime example of a culture-bound syndrome. Only in these cultures, with
     specific pressures on weight and beauty applied to women and men, does anorexia nervosa appear. But as
     these beauty standards spread with globalization and the spread of media from these cultures, so does the
     disease. Cultural syndromes are not restricted to cultures that prefer biomedicine or ethnomedicine: they are
     as diverse as human culture itself.

     A related concept gaining ground in psychology is known as cultural concepts of distress, or CCD. These
     concepts, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) 5, "refer to ways that
     cultural groups experience, understand, and communicate suffering, behavioral problems, or troubling
     thoughts and emotions" (American Psychiatric Association 2013). In sum, CCD is used to describe how a
     culture explains and conceptualizes the unique manifestation of mental illness as physical and/or social
     symptoms.

     The psychobiological dynamic of health--the measurable effect of human psychology on physical health--is a
     primary tool used by medical anthropologists to study health. The psychobiological dynamic of health helps
     anthropologists evaluate the efficacy of health-related treatments that may not accord with those used in their
     home culture. For example, ritual healing has real measurable effects on people, both the patient and those in
     attendance during the ritual, as long as they believe that the ritual has healing power. Similarly, for those who
     share a cultural belief in the power of such practices, being prayed over by a priest or blessed with holy water
     can offer effective healing power. Psychological belief grants healing efficacy. The same principle applies to
     biomedicine, as illustrated by the placebo/nocebo effect. Of course, belief alone cannot entirely negate the
     harmful or helpful effects of medicine or any other substance.

     Another area in which psychology and health intersect is the experience and effects of stress, a human
     universal. Indeed, it is well established that mental stress can make someone physically sick. The work of
     anthropologist Robert Sapolsky (2004) analyzes the evolution of the human body to adapt to, use, and heal
     from stress. His analysis suggests that stress pushes humans to both physical and mental limits, that these
     limits differ in different humans, and that being pushed up against limits due to stress can result in growth.
     The human ability to adapt to stress is a difference from other primate species, and it likely developed over
     millions of years of evolution. While human bodies have evolved with stress and have sometimes grown as a
     result of stress, we were not evolved to withstand chronic stress over extended periods of time. Chronic stress
     induces a high rate of stress-related diseases, such as heart disease, indicating the limits of even evolution to
     adapt to long-term stressors.

     Addiction is another area in which medical anthropologists have done significant work, analyzing how culture
     and biology contribute to addiction. Addiction comes in many forms and affects multiple measures of health.
     Medical anthropologist Angela Garcia tackles addiction in her book The Pastoral Clinic: Addiction and
     Dispossession along the Rio Grande (2010), which explores the intersection of race, class, immigration status,
     and dispossession with drug addiction and the ability to treat it. Focusing on a small town on the Rio Grande
     and specifically a clinic within that town meant to treat addiction, she tracks the trajectory of a number of
     patients and the factors that contributed to their addiction. Her analysis highlights the status of these patient
     as immigrants, minorities, and outsiders, which prevent reentry into society for many. Similarly, João Biehl's
     work Vita: Life in a Zone of Social Abandonment (2103) analyzes the effects of dispossession and
     homelessness on social health, looking specifically at the role of drugs in the highlighted zone. His exploration
     of vita, a place where people are "left to die" when their addiction or mental illness becomes too much of a
     burden, shows the cultural effects of mental health and addiction on Brazilian society and the struggles of the
     individuals abandoned there. In both works, the role of drugs is highlighted, exploring how cultures

symbolically characterize problematic drug use and addiction and attach a stigma to admitting a problem and
seeking treatment. The works also explore how drugs are justified and understood, illustrating both how drugs
change the biochemistry of the brain and how the human mind characterizes the drugs, each shaping one
another.

Reproduction

Reproductive health is another area in which medical anthropologists have made significant contributions by
applying their knowledge and methods to real medical practices. Medical anthropologists have studied
reproduction in many cultures, analyzing the practices, beliefs, and treatment of those who are pregnant, their
children, and their supporting network. Another area of interest has been the ritualization of pregnancy.
Robbie Davis Floyd (2004) has done work on birth as a rite of passage and the role of the midwife in modern
birth practices around the world, with a focus on medicalized birth in the United States. Her work highlights
ways in which the experience of birth is made more complicated by policy. Midwives are shown to decrease the
chances of complications in births, yet in many places they are denied a role in the birthing process.
Regardless of patient preference and the documented success of midwives, in most settings in the United
States doctors and medical professionals are given preference over midwives. Floyd argues that this
preference sometimes puts the patient at risk. In the Western biomedical system, doctors are preferred and
imbued with authoritative knowledge, which is a sense of legitimacy or perceived authenticity.

FIGURE 17.13 Women of color are much more likely to die in childbirth, according to a 2019 study by the CDC.
This disparity is a central focus of the research of Dána-Ain Davis. (credit: "Figure 1: Pregnancy-Related Deaths per
100,000 Live Births by Racial/Ethnic Group, 2007-2016" by US Government Accountability Office (GAO)/flickr,

The work of Dána-Ain Davis (2019) on medical racism and inequalities in the health care system shows
structural violence at work. Based on analysis of statistics and vivid ethnographic examples, Davis found that
women of color experienced significantly higher rates of complications, including higher death rates for both
mothers and infants, than White mothers and babies. Davis concludes that cultural bias and systemic racism
are woven into the US health care system. These are often unacknowledged biases, unrecognized by those
perpetrating them in the medical profession. Davis advocates for better policy to address these inequalities
and help mothers maintain control over their bodies and the birthing process.

             PROFILES IN ANTHROPOLOGY

     Dána-Ain Davis
     1958-

     Personal History: Born in New York City, Dána-Ain Davis (https://openstax.org/r/danaaindavis) earned her
     PhD from City University of New York. Her work focuses on poverty, policy, and feminism, with a specific
     interest in urban areas of the United States. She is currently a professor of anthropology at Queens College
     (part of the City University of New York system). In addition to her teaching, she promotes change in policy and
     society through activism and her work in numerous political communities.

     Before enrolling in college, Davis worked widely in publishing, broadcasting, and nonprofit work. She has
     worked for the Village Voice newspaper, the YWCA, the Village Center for Women, and Bronx AIDS Service. This
     work grounded her deeply in her community and the issues facing women, and in particular Black women in
     urban communities such as hers. These skills would aid her as she earned her PhD and began publishing her
     academic work.

     She is the editor of Feminist Anthropology, a new journal focused on feminist anthropological work; sits on the
     editorial boards for Cultural Anthropology and Women's' Studies Quarterly; and in the fall of 2021 became the
     chair of her department.

     Area of Anthropology: cultural anthropology, medical anthropology, public anthropology, feminist
     anthropology, urban anthropology

     Accomplishments in the Field: Davis's first book, Battered Black Women and Welfare Reform: Between a Rock
     and a Hard Place, was published in 2006 and focuses on the intersection of gender, race, and economic
     realities. The book also features her work with the theory of political economy, which looks at how economic
     conditions, law, and policy affect wealth distribution across groups, in this case how economic conditions
     disadvantage Black women. Davis then worked on two edited volumes focused on feminism and gender,
     entitled Black Genders and Sexualities (2012) and Feminist Activist Ethnography: Counterpoints to
     Neoliberalism in North America (2013), before publishing Feminist Ethnography: Thinking through
     Methodologies, Challenges, and Possibilities (2016) about feminism anthropology and ethnographic work.

     Davis's next work, Reproductive Injustice: Racism, Pregnancy, and Premature Birth (2019) fits more squarely
     into the realm of medical anthropology. This work examines the numerous issues that face women of color in
     regard to pregnancy and birth. Like her previous work, her latest book intersects with activism, aiming to
     improve medical and social justice for mothers and children.

     Importance of Their Work: Activism sits at the heart of Davis's work, which has won numerous awards for
     promoting justice and change. Her academic and activist work has helped inform new policy changes at the
     local, state, and national levels. Her work informs continuing work in urban studies, feminist theory and
     practice, reproductive health for women of color, and welfare reform.

     The Inequalities of Health

     Attempting to address the inequalities of health care is a primary application of the work of critical medical
     anthropologists. Inequalities are apparent in relation to COVID-19, the global pandemic that has left no corner
     of the world untouched. A number of agencies in the United States, including the National Institutes of Health
     and the American Civil Liberties Union, have determined that Black and Latinx populations have been most
     negatively affected by the virus, both in health outcomes and overall deaths per capita relative to their portion
     of the population. Several states have emphasized the need to ignore personal safety for the sake of economic
     "health," essentially stating a willingness to sacrifice workers so their economic prospects do not falter.
     Meanwhile, people working on the front lines faced what is tantamount to class violence, as they could not
     afford to stay safely at home and social distance; indeed, it can be argued that later this class violence still
     applied, as the divide between remote working and those forced to work on-site created a stark contrast. The

health of "essential workers" is put at risk. Aside from health care professionals, the category frequently falls
along class lines, with the majority of "essential workers" employed in the service industry, in factories, or
making deliveries. Economic inequalities and lack of access to health care providers both play a role in these
trends. Similarly, the World Health Organization has highlighted how poorer countries have had their access to
the many forms of COVID-19 treatment and prevention restricted by the demands of richer countries like the
United States and Australia.

Another area in which medical anthropologists have documented health-related inequalities in the United
States is access to nutritious foods. It has been well established that poor access to foods, particularly highly
nutritious, diverse foods, can negatively affect health. People who live in food deserts, which are areas lacking
access to good food, are more likely to develop debilitating illnesses and suffer from a basic lack of nutrition in
several major fields. Amplifying the effect of food deserts is that these same areas often also lack access to
health care services.

AIDS has provided a multigenerational study of the inequalities of health. At the beginning of the AIDS
pandemic in the 1980s, the poorly understood disease was stated to be a "gay man's virus" because it seemed
to only affect gay and bisexual men. Medical anthropologists began studying the AIDS virus as early as 1983,
with Norman Spencer notably studying cases in San Francisco. As the virus spread to other populations,
research became more common and well-funded, receiving state support in some cases. Yet between poor and
late funding and the spread of misinformation that took decades to reverse, AIDS devastated populations
around the world. Medical anthropologist Brodie Ramin (2007) has applied anthropological knowledge and
methods to AIDS treatment in Africa, utilizing cultural understanding to develop more effective methods of
medical treatment and enhance public trust in these treatment methods.

Haitians" by Petty Officer 2nd Class Etta Smith/USCG Press/flickr, CC BY 2.0)

Even today, AIDS is highly stigmatized and poorly treated in many places in the world. For over two decades
now, Paul Farmer and Jim Yong Kim, both anthropologists and medical doctors, have worked with their
organization, Partners in Health, to provide better health outcomes and access to poor, remote parts of the
world. Their work has been instrumental in helping treat AIDS and other diseases in places such as Haiti. Jim
Yong Kim used his role in the World Bank Group to help create better outcomes as well. Medical anthropology
has the power to shape policy at the highest level of global health institutions, but it has much to overcome.
Medical anthropologists are well aware of the severity of the problems of structural violence, systemic racism,
and massive health inequalities around the world.

The COVID-19 pandemic changed many aspects of many cultures, affecting people's professional, educational,
and personal lives. Medical anthropologists Vincanne Adams and Alex Nading have already begun to analyze
the social impact of COVID-19: "The pandemic continues to precipitate simultaneous dread over what is to
538  17 · Medical Anthropology

     come and loss over what appears to be gone forever, including loved ones, ways of life, and conceptual and
     literal safety nets" (2020). The COVID-19 pandemic has illustrated how deeply intertwined health and culture
     can be. Elisa J. Sobo's work on the anti-vaccine movement in 2016 is now freshly relevant, as some people fear
     and mistrust both the COVID vaccine and the health measures to slow or prevent the spread of the virus
     proposed by nonprofits and governments. Adams and Nading build upon Sobo's research, exploring the
     central role of belief and culture in the development of policy at the local, state, national, and international
     levels during the COVID-19 pandemic.

     The COVID-19 pandemic has illustrated how deeply intertwined health and culture can be. Medical
     anthropology has a lot to offer public health and health care professionals. Incorporating medical
     anthropology and cultural competence into the training of health care professionals is a proactive step to begin
     addressing medical racism and the inequalities of health documented by medical anthropologists. It also gives
     health care professionals insight into the relationship between social health and physical and mental health
     priorities. The work of medical anthropologists on nutrition, reproduction, and infectious disease has
     significant implications for health care and public policy. Finally, understanding the wealth of cultural
     traditions and ethnomedical systems provides a greater appreciation for the diverse ways of understanding
     health and managing maladies. As the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated, health and health care are a
     complex social issue with global ramifications for billions of people.

             MINI-FIELDWORK ACTIVITY

     Health Perspectives Project: Interviews

     Part 1: Develop Interview Questions

     Select a health-related topic and develop ethnographic interview questions related to it. Keep it short: three to
     five questions relating to the anthropological topic you wish to study. Ideally, your interview questions will be
     open-ended rather than yes/no questions or questions that generate one word replies.

     Part 2: Interview

     Select appropriate people to interview, and set up a convenient time and place to interview them. Remember
     your safety is a top concern; do not meet with anyone in a place where you do not feel comfortable. Ideally, if
     you do not know the person well, you will want a public location that still affords a degree of privacy, such as
     the library or a coffee shop.

     Interview Field Notes

     Your notes should include the following:

       · When and where the interview was conducted
       · Your relationship to the interviewee (if any)
       · The interviewee's

             Age
             Gender
             Occupation
             Native language
             Nationality/country of origin

       · Any other details that are relevant to your interview (Example: religion, sexuality, race/ethnicity, role in
           family, etc. Only ask these if it seems to be relevant to your topic and questions.)

     Take notes not only on what the person said, but how they said it and what you think it might mean in a
     broader context. Reflect on body language, emotion, tone, and emphasis whenever possible.

     Include significant quotes and your reflection on the quotes' significance in the context of the interview.

Explain why and how you selected the person that you interviewed. Do you think that you had the necessary
rapport to receive full and honest answers? Was your interviewee knowledgeable about the topic of your
interview? What additional questions might you want to ask in the future?

Reflect on your experience and what you might do differently next time.

INTRODUCTION Take a moment to consider your relationships with animals. Where do you interact with
animals? Do you encounter them on your plate, in your home, on your walks or visits to zoos and aquariums, in
your vaccines and medical procedures, in your body lotion, or in the clothing or shoes you wear? Or do you
encounter them mostly in books, movies, and poems?
Human-animal scholarship is a relatively new interdisciplinary specialty. Interdisciplinary specialties cross
individual disciplinary boundaries, drawing on perspectives and theories from multiple academic areas, most
commonly anthropology, sociology, psychology, biology, philosophy/ethics, and even economics. When we
consider the multiple roles that animals play in human lives, it is easy to see how this topic intersects with so
many disciplines: the breeding and care of animals is associated with biology; the use of therapy dogs in
human populations, such as with prisoners or those suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), is
associated with psychology; and the ways in which different cultural groups think about and use animals is an
546  18 · Human-Animal Relationship

     anthropological concern. As a result, human-animal scholars take an interdisciplinary approach to preparing
     for and conducting their research to better understand the relationships among humans, animals, and culture.

     18.1 Humans and Animals

     LEARNING OUTCOMES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       · Restate the scientific meaning of animal.
       · Describe the human-animal continuum.
       · Define multispecies ethnography.
       · Identify highlights in the domestication of dogs.

     The Human-Animal Continuum

     Nonhuman animals are part of many facets of our lives. Many people rely on animals as part of food and
     subsistence systems, particularly in the areas of hunting, herding, and agriculture. Some people worship
     deities who are all or part animal. Many people recognize animals as symbols of clans or sports teams. For
     example, did your school have an animal as the mascot for its sports or debate teams? Across cultures, people
     love animals as pets and companions, and, as recognized by evolutionary theory, humans are connected to
     animals as ancestors and relatives. Animals are integral parts of the lives of humans around the world, in
     which they play a variety of roles. Defining an animal, however, can be complicated.

     With some exceptions, an animal is defined in science as a multicellular organism, either vertebrate or
     invertebrate, that can breathe, move, ingest and excrete food and food products, and reproduce sexually. This
     clearly also includes the human species. Western philosophical tradition supports this inclusion. The Greek
     philosopher Aristotle (384-322 BCE) grouped animals as being blooded (e.g., humans, mammals, birds, fish),
     non-blooded (e.g., shelled animals, insects, soft-skinned sea animals), or what he called dualizers, with mixed
     characteristics (e.g., whales, who live in the sea but have live births; bats, who have four legs but fly). Aristotle
     classified humans as animals with the intellectual ability to reason. In 1735, Swedish botanist Carolus
     Linnaeus introduced his binomial classification, which used two terms to identify every living organism: a
     genus and a species designation. In his work Systema Naturae (1735), Linnaeus divided the living world into
     two large kingdoms, the Regnum Animale (animal kingdom) and the Regnum Vegetabile (plant kingdom). Like
     Aristotle before him, Linnaeus classified humans as animals. Today, the scientific approach to the study of the
     animal kingdom accepts that there is a continuum between all living animal species with grades of difference
     between species. However, even though humans are animals, people across cultures define themselves as
     separate from animals.

     French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss (1908-2009) argued that cultures universally define themselves in
     opposition to what they view as nature, a domain they define as outside or on the margins of human culture.
     Humans and human culture are typically seen as everything that is not nature or animal. This makes animals
     and nature very important concepts to human societies, because they shed light on how people think of
     themselves as human beings in the world. Lévi-Strauss famously said of animals that they are "good to think"
     (1963, 89), meaning that animals provide good ways for humans to think about themselves. Animals are used
     as symbols in all cultures, a sign of the human tendency to identify similarities and differences between
     ourselves and (other) animals.

     In all societies, culture plays an important role in shaping how people define animals. Cultures assign various
     meanings to animals; they are ancestral spirits or deities, companions, work animals, wild and dangerous
     creatures, and even objects on display in zoos or raised in factory farms for food. Think of American culture,
     which both loves and dotes on dogs as members of the family and raises pigs as a food commodity. In other
     cultures, dogs are considered a food species. Among the North American Lakota people, dog meat is
     considered a medicinal food (see Meyers and Weston 2020), and in Vietnam, specially designated restaurants
     serve dog meat as a male aphrodisiac (Avieli 2011). To further illustrate the blurring of boundaries between
     categories of animals, some species of pigs, such as the potbellied pig, are kept as family pets in the United
     States. How do cultures designate species as being one thing and not another?

The study of group identity is central to anthropology. Different cultures distinguish what is animal from what
is human by comparing "the other" with themselves. Sometimes called us versus them, we versus they, or
even the Other, capitalized, this binary (two-component) comparison is a human tendency observed across
cultures.

It is common for cultural groups to distinguish between humans and nonhuman species and also to designate
some humans as "other" and not as fully human--comparable to animals or even isolated parts of animals. In
the Andes, indigenous Quechua and Aymara speakers refer to themselves as runa, meaning "people" or
"humans." Those who do not speak their languages and do not live in the Andes are, by extension, nonhuman
and are typically referred to as q'ara, meaning literally "naked and bare," referring to their lack of social ties
and community (Zorn 1995). This distinction between those within the group and those without is common
among Indigenous groups all over the world as well as within Western societies. Although the origin of the
word frogs as an epithet (nickname) for the French is contested, it appears to have begun within France itself
as a way of referring to people who lived in Paris and ate frog legs. By the late 18th century, however, frogs had
begun to show up in English newspapers and other written sources as a pejorative, insulting term for all
French people (Tidwell 1948). Not to be outdone, the French have traditionally referred to the English as
rosbifs (roast beefs), a food common in English cuisine.

Although these examples are relatively lighthearted, there is a dark side to human-animal imagery. In a recent
book, German freelance journalist Jan Mohnhaupt (2020) examines the distorted relationships that some Nazi
leaders had with animals. After coming to power in Germany in 1937, the Nazi state enacted many laws
against the Jewish people, among them a 1942 law that made it illegal for Jewish people to own pets, while Nazi
leader Adolf Hitler doted on his dog and military commander Hermann Göring kept lions as pets. Preventing
them from having companion animals was yet another way in which the Nazis sought to dehumanize Jewish
people. Human-animal relationships are important to our sense of selfhood.

In this chapter, we will explore various cultures' approaches to and understandings of nonhuman animals,
including both living and symbolic animals, and the diverse ways in which humans interact with and think
about these "other" beings.

Multispecies Ethnography

In his essay "Why Look at Animals?," English art critic and poet John Berger writes, "To suppose that animals
first entered the human imagination as meat or leather or horn is to project a 19th century attitude backwards
across the millennia. Animals first entered the imagination as messengers and promises" ([1980] 1991, 4).
Recent trends in anthropological scholarship attempt to interact with these messengers and understand the
relationship that humans and animals share. The term polyspecific refers to the interactions of multiple
species. The relationships shared between humans and other species began with our ancestors millions of
548  18 · Human-Animal Relationship

     years ago.

     The specialty of human-animal studies within anthropology suggests new forms of scholarship that
     deliberately move away from anthropocentrism, which focuses on humans as if they are the only species that
     matters. Human-animal studies opens a window into different ways of thinking about what it means to be
     human. One approach within the specialty, called multispecies ethnography, pays careful attention to the
     interactions of humans and other species within their shared environment--whether those other species be
     plant, animal, fungal, or microbial. Multispecies ethnographies are especially focused on the study of
     symbiosis, which is a mutually beneficial relationship between species.

     Researchers conducting multispecies ethnographies utilize a broad, holistic approach that takes into account
     questions such as where and how interactions between humans and animals occur. This approach is more
     complex than traditional ethnography because it requires that the researcher acknowledge both the
     perspectives of nonhuman actors and their roles in how we see and understand ourselves.

     Cultural anthropologists and ecologists Kirill Istomin and Mark James Dwyer (2010) conducted multispecies
     ethnographies between two different herding populations in Russia: the Izhma Komi, who live in northeast
     European Russia, and the Nenets in western Siberia. The two groups live in environments that are comparable
     in terms of geography, average temperatures, and precipitation, and they herd the same subspecies of reindeer
     year-round. Yet their herding styles are completely different. The Izhma Komi divide their reindeer into two
     large groups: a family group consisting of non-castrated males, females, and calves, called a kör, and a group of
     castrated males used for transportation and hauling, called a byk. Herders accompany the two groups to two
     separate grazing grounds during the day and direct them back to camp at night. While foraging for food, the
     reindeer stay within their particular groups and do not wander away. In contrast, the Nenets allow their
     reindeer to freely disperse and wander during the day, only occasionally observing their general whereabouts
     and well-being. Unlike the Izhma Komi herds, which stay in their two large groups, the Nenets animals forage
     in smaller groups and reunite at night as a single herd when they return on their own to camp for protection.
     Unlike wild reindeer, who do not routinely live in and around human encampments, these groups have a
     symbiotic relationship with their herders. The humans get meat, some limited milk, and leather for clothing,
     shoes, and trade products from the reindeer, and the reindeer get protection and supplemental foods at the
     campsite from the herders.

     Istomin and Dwyer's research notes behaviors that the reindeer have learned from their human herders, but it
     also addresses social learning within the herds. In their interviews with the researchers, both Izhma Komi and
     Nenets herders told stories about the difficulties they faced when introducing new, so-called unmanageable
     animals into the herds. These new animals had not yet learned the herding routines of the group they were
     joining. Some wandered off and were lost before they could adapt to the particular herd culture. Istomin and
     Dwyer conclude that the animals themselves pass along behavioral knowledge to each other across
     generations as offspring follow and learn from their mothers and other adult reindeer. This conclusion
     challenges the notion that animal behavior is solely genetic and instinctual. Expanding ethnographies to
     include an understanding of what animals are doing and thinking is a primary objective of multispecies
     ethnography.

     Despite its recent emergence in anthropology as a separate specialty, the multispecies perspective has a long
     history. Nineteenth-century amateur anthropologist Lewis Henry Morgan's research on the North American
     beaver (1868), which includes material on beavers' adaptation to and interaction with humans, remains one of
     the most insightful and perceptive works on the species. And the research conducted in the 1930s by British
     anthropologist Edward Evans-Pritchard on the relationship between the Nuer people of Africa and their cattle
     resulted in an ethnographic account of their interdependence, both socially and economically.

     More recently, cultural anthropologist Darrell Posey used a multispecies ethnographic approach in his work
     "Wasps, Warriors, and Fearless Men" (1981). In this case, the relationships of interest are between humans and
     insects. Posey's work utilizes a lens of ethnoentomology, exploring the relationships that the Kayapó people of
     central Brazil have with local insects and how these relationships shape their perception of themselves as
     human. Posey documents how Kayapó warriors deliberately provoke a local species of wasp to sting them,
     using the "secret" of the venom to become more powerful:

The warriors dance at the foot of the scaffolding and sing of the secret strength they received from the
wasps to defeat the giant beetle. The women wail ceremonially in high-pitched, emotional gasps as the
warriors, two-by-two, ascend the platform to strike with their bare hands the massive hive. Over and
over again they strike the hive to receive the stings of the wasps until they are semi-conscious from
the venomous pain.

This ceremony is one of the most important to the Kayapo: it is a re-affirmation of their humanity, a
statement of their place in the universe, and a communion with the past. (172)

A Case Study: Domestication of Dogs

Humans interact with and relate to animal species that live in the wild as well as those that depend on them for
their survival. Animals that are dependent on human beings are typically the result of domestication.
Evidence suggests that early humans quickly developed a clear understanding of how selective breeding
works, encouraging animals that shared preferred characteristics to mate and produce offspring. These
desired traits included a calm temperament; the ability to get along with conspecifics, or members of one's
own species; usually a smaller body so that the animal could be gathered or herded in larger numbers; and an
attachment to or tolerance of humans.

FIGURE 18.4 Dogs were among the earliest domesticated animals. Here, Siberian huskies race in a dogsledding
event. Across cultures, dogs have been used for pulling and hauling loads. (credit: "Frauenwald,
550  18 · Human-Animal Relationship

     The dog (Canis lupus familiaris) is believed to have been among the earliest animal domesticates, possibly the
     first. The origins of the domesticated dog are controversial. Most scientists agree that dogs originated from
     wolves, particularly from the subspecies Canis lupus pallipes (Indian wolf) and Canis lupus lupus (Eurasian
     wolf). The wide variety among dog breeds indicates that other wolf subspecies were also involved in selective
     breeding, making today's dogs animal hybrids.

     Wolves have various natural instincts that make them excellent candidates for domestication. They are highly
     social scavengers who could easily have become accustomed to human settlements and food handouts at a
     young age, and they have a hierarchical social structure that includes status and submission within the pack,
     traits that would predispose them to conforming to human direction and domination. Dogs today vary
     genetically by only about 0.2 percent from some of their ancestral wolf subspecies.

     Historically and cross-culturally, humans benefit in many ways from their relationships with dogs:

       · Guarding and protection. Dogs are naturally territorial and highly social; they are both biologically and
           behaviorally prone to be keenly aware of their physical surroundings and their group (or pack). The
           impulse to guard and protect is a genetic trait that was easily manipulated in the species as humans
           selectively bred animals that were particularly loyal to their families and attentive to their property. As
          part of the domestication process, humans selected for dogs who exhibited a bark-howl response when
           alerted, with the result that domesticated dogs bark when concerned or excited. Among wolves, the bark is
           only used as an initial alert (Yin 2002). Wolves do not call attention to themselves as dogs do.

       · Hunting. Descended as it is from a wild predator, the domestic dog can be an excellent hunter and
           retriever. A trained dog offers considerable benefits to humans in the hunting of prey. Some Indigenous
           groups, such as the Chono of Tierra del Fuego, Argentina, trained their dogs to dive and to fish for seals.
           The Tahltan people of Canada used dogs on bear hunts. In czarist Russia, borzoi dogs were used to hunt for
           wolves.

       · Herding. Dogs were key to the development of pastoralism, a subsistence system based on herding
           animals. Many pastoral societies utilized dogs as shepherds for domesticated herds of sheep, goats, cattle,
           and even fowl. Once trained to identify and protect its herd, a dog can be a fierce defender of and guide for
           animals foraging away from human settlements. Trained herding dogs can shepherd their flocks on a
           consistent trail without constant human surveillance. Selective breeding moderated a natural instinct in
          dogs referred to as eye-stalk-chase-bite, a sequence of steps utilized by dogs to focus on another animal
           when hunting. This moderated instinct enables dogs to guide and protect another species by keeping the
           animals rounded up and moving away from danger. While not utilized by every pastoral society, dogs are
           considered vital to most pastoral societies, even today (see the Ethnographic Sketch at the end of the
           chapter).

       · Transportation. Historically, dogs served as beasts of burden, especially in cultures that had no larger
           domesticated animals such as the horse, donkey, or cow. Many Indigenous peoples used dogs to carry
           young children or possessions. Among North American Indigenous cultures such as the Assiniboine,
           Apache, and Inuit, dogs were traditionally used for transportation. Some of these groups developed
           specialized technology, such as the travois and the sledge, that allowed them to harness a dog to a platform
           loaded with items to be moved.

and Dog Travois" by Provincial Archives of Alberta/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)

  · Meat. In some cultures, domesticated dogs offer a dependable source of meat. Some of the earliest
      evidence of dog eating was found at a prehistoric rock shelter site located at Hinds Cave, Texas. At the
      Hinds Cave site, geneticist Raul Tito and his team identified domesticated dog remains in human
      coprolites (fossilized feces) dating to 9260 BP. From the Preclassic through the late Postclassic period
      (2000 BCE-1519 CE) in what is now Mexico, various Indigenous cultures, including the Olmec, Zapotec,
      Aztec, and Maya, raised and consumed dogs as a source of protein (Thompson 2008), eventually
      developing a hairless breed of dog known today as the Xoloitzcuintli. This breed existed when the Spanish
      arrived in Mexico in the 16th century.

FIGURE 18.6 The Xoloitzcuintli is a hairless dog first bred in Mexico. (credit: "MX MM XOLOITZCUINTLE" Milton

Although dogs are primarily pets in contemporary societies, they continue to play other important roles in a
wide range of human activities. As just a few examples, dogs are used as drug detectives at airports, therapy
animals for a wide range of human needs, and guides and helpers for those living with physical challenges.
Dogs also continue to be used as shepherds, hunting companions, and guards.

     18.2 Animals and Subsistence

     LEARNING OUTCOMES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       · Describe the role empathy plays in human-animal relations.
       · Identify some characteristics of the ways that Indigenous hunter-gatherers and nomadic pastoralists relate to
           animals.
       · Discuss the relationship between Rock Cree hunters and animals.

     Human-Animal Empathy in Subsistence

     One of the most important relationships between humans and animals is that centered on subsistence, the
     means by which a group of individuals makes a living. In hunting-and-gathering and pastoral societies, the
     relationships between humans and animals are critical to human survival. Serving as meat, tools for hunting
     and for herding other animal species, and sources of commodities such as wool and leather, these societies'
     animals are central to human lives. In such societies, human relationships with animals are typically
     characterized by animal empathy, or the sense of being attuned to the feelings or experiences of other
     beings--in this case, animals. Elaborate beliefs and rituals surrounding human-animal interdependence are
     common among hunter-gatherers and pastoralists.

     The research of anthropologist Pat Shipman ([2015] 2017) suggests that human empathy and alliances with
     animals, especially dogs, gave humans an evolutionary advantage over animals. Relying on animals for
     survival prompted humans to develop not only improved hunting and meat-processing tools but also a deep
     understanding of their prey. Humans needed to be able to discern and predict animal behaviors, including
     migratory patterns. By the emergence of our species, Homo sapiens, some 300,000 years ago, humans had
     evolved to have a sophisticated empathic understanding of and relationship with animals. By the Upper
     Paleolithic (50,000-12,000 BP), humans were leaving testimonials to their empathic relationships with
     animals in cave paintings.

     One of the most outstanding early examples of animal art is the paintings found in the Lascaux cave in
     southwestern France, depicting the animals and plants that humans encountered some 17,000 years ago.
     These paintings were likely created over a range of years by several generations of hunters. Of the more than
     6,000 images of humans, animals, and abstract signs, some 900 are animals. Animals that appear in these
     paintings include horses, deer, aurochs (wild cattle), bison, felines, a bird, a bear, and a rhinoceros. One black
     bull measures 5.6 meters (approximately 17 feet) in length. The animal is painted as if its legs are in motion.
     One of the felines appears to be urinating to mark its territory.

Animal Relationships among Indigenous Hunters

Many cultures continue to rely on wild animals for subsistence today. This dependence requires the mastery of
various cognitive skills, including knowledge and understanding of animal behaviors. In all cultures, much of
the socialization of children is connected to skills required for subsistence. In societies that rely on hunting for
survival, children learn to be especially attentive to their environments. It is also common in such societies for
children to keep pets, often the young of wild animals that have been hunted, such as birds and small
mammals. Many wild animals are capable of being tamed by human handling when they are young. An animal
is considered tamed when it has learned to tolerate human proximity and interaction for considerable periods
of time.

Indigenous hunter-gatherers subsist on what their environment freely provides. They do not produce food but
rather collect it. Indigenous hunters typically view animals as fellow sentient and spiritual beings with whom
they must maintain a relationship of mutual respect. Commonly, they practice elaborate rituals associated
with hunting, both to show respect for their prey and to increase the likelihood of success in the hunt.

In his study of Yukaghir elk and reindeer hunters in Siberia, Danish anthropologist Rane Willerslev (2004)
recorded many ritualistic hunting behaviors. These included taking a sauna bath several days before the hunt
to diminish the hunters' scent; using special language (code words) to talk about the hunt, never mentioning
death or hunting directly, in order to deceive or confuse the animal spirits; and "feeding" a fire with alcohol
and tobacco the night before the hunt to perfume the air and seduce the animal spirit to desire the hunter.
Even so, the hunters are never overconfident about the hunt, as they believe they risk their own identities as
human beings when trying to lure an animal and its spirit. The bond between hunter and hunted in
Indigenous societies is often viewed as tenuous, a relationship between equals in which the balance of power
554  18 · Human-Animal Relationship

     could shift in either direction. During the hunt itself, Yukaghir hunters wear wooden skis covered in elk leather
     so that their movements sound like the movements of an animal in snow, and they practice thinking like the
     elk or reindeer to lower the animals' inhibitions so that they will allow the hunters to get near. The hunters
     even imagine themselves speaking to the animal, trying to diminish its fears. For the Yukaghir people, the hunt
     can be a dangerous interaction, and so respect is necessary at all times, even after the body of the animal has
     been taken.

     A Case Study: Rock Cree Hunters

     The Asinskâwôiniwak, or Rock Cree, are an Indigenous society of hunter-gatherers living in northwestern
     Manitoba, Canada. In his ethnography Grateful Prey (1993), cultural anthropologist Robert Brightman
     examines the various ways in which the Rock Cree think about and interact with animals. Once a foraging
     society subsisting on big game hunting, fishing, and fur trapping, today the Rock Cree are primarily settled on
     government lands and no longer nomadic. Their relationship with animals continues to be central to their
     cultural identity, however, and today they hunt and trap as part of a mixed subsistence system that includes
     both foraging and wage labor. The Rock Cree's hunting is informed by both Indigenous principles that place
     high value on big game animals such as bear, moose, and caribou and the current market price for animal
     products such as pelts.

     During his research, Brightman observed a fascinating tension between humans and animals at the core of
     Rock Cree hunting culture. Because animals are believed to be both spirit and body and capable of
     regenerating (reincarnating), killing an animal has repercussions for the hunter. If the hunter does not treat
     the animal's body with respect after the kill, the animal spirit will not return to the hunter:

           The animals are endlessly regenerated, and yet they are finite. I am more powerful than the animal
           because I kill and eat it. The animal is more powerful than I because it can elude me and cause me to
           starve. The animal is my benefactor and friend. The animal is my victim and adversary. The animal is
           different from me, and yet it is like me. (Brightman 1993, 36)

     Rock Cree hunters, who may be male or female, are frequently influenced by an animal spirit called a pawakan
     that appears in their dreams. Sometimes referred to as the "master of animals" in other Indigenous societies
     where it is also found, the pawakan is the head spirit of an animal species or type. Individual animals have a
     different and lesser spirit. The relationship that hunters have with the pawakan is complex and variable and
     depends on the hunter's behaviors and circumstances. The pawakan may provide the hunter with useful
     information about where a prey animal can be found and can persuade a specific animal to either go near the
     hunter or elude them. A sorcerer can even send a pawakan to frighten dangerous animals away from a
     potential human victim.

     The Rock Cree believe that an animal can be successfully hunted only if it voluntarily offers itself to the hunter.
     Through offerings of prayers, songs, and bits of food and tobacco burned in a stove or outside fire, the Rock
     Cree symbolically interact with their prey prior to the hunt. Once the animal is slain, the hunter makes sure
     that no parts of its body are wasted. To waste any part of an animal would be disrespectful and would imperil
     the hunter's future success. The Rock Cree have detailed procedures for butchering, cooking, and eating
     animals and for disposing of the bones by hanging them in trees where they cannot be violated by other
     predators. They believe that once the people have finished with the animal and left its bones hanging, the
     animal will recover its bones and regenerate back into the environment. Sometimes, hunters or trappers say
     they recognize an animal and that it is the "same one" that was killed before (Brightman 1993, 119).

     This study of the Rock Cree illustrates the intense and complex relationships that can exist between humans
     and wild animals. Many of these same kinds of relationships between hunters and animals also exist among
     the Netsilik people and other hunting populations. Indigenous hunter-gatherers have a fundamentally
     different view of their relationships with animals and of their own place in the world than do pastoralists or
     people living in industrial societies. This traditional wisdom and interconnected way of being in the
     environment is a valuable part of our shared human cultural heritage.

Animal Relationships among Nomadic and Transhumant Pastoralists

Like hunter-gatherers, pastoralists also have empathic relationships with animals, but the nature of those
relationships is different. Pastoralism, which is subsistence based on herding animals, can be either nomadic
or transhumant. Nomadic pastoralism is herding based on the availability of resources and involves
unpredictable movements, as herders decide from day to day where they will go next. Transhumant
pastoralists have patterned movements from one location to another.

The Izhma Komi and Nenets herders in Russia, discussed earlier in the chapter in the section on multispecies
ethnography, practice nomadic pastoralism. While the relationship between nomadic pastoralists and their
animals is based on respect and empathy, just as with hunter-gatherers, nomadic pastoralists are more
involved in the daily lives of the animals they rely on. Typically, the animals are herded into human campsites
each night, and often their movements are monitored during the day. The animals are not physically
dependent on humans, but the two groups are involved with each other, as herders offer supplemental food to
the reindeer to reinforce their connection to the human campsites for the night. Both hunter-gatherers and
nomadic pastoralists rely on their animals for meat and leather, but nomadic pastoralists might also harvest
milk and use the animals as transport, two practices that require the animals to be more accustomed to
human handling. The pastoral herd is more dependable as a food source than the wild animals of hunter-
gatherers, but it is also more labor intensive and time consuming, requiring humans to manage the animals
according to a daily routine.

FIGURE 18.9 A Sami reindeer herder in Sweden. Pastoralists such as the Sami rely on their animals for meat and
leather, as well as sometimes making use of their milk and using them to transport heavy materials. (credit: "A Day
at Work" by Mats Andersson/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 2.0)

Nomadic pastoralism is not as widely practiced as transhumant pastoralism, which evolved around the time of
the rise of agriculture in Europe, Asia, and Africa. Transhumant pastoralists do not typically raise crops or
forage for wild plants, and they are dependent on trade with agricultural societies for vegetable products.
Interestingly, while there are cultures that practice strict vegetarianism and do not consume any meat
products, such as the Hindu and Jain cultures in India, humans cannot live solely on meat. Arctic hunters who
had no access to vegetation in the winter ate the stomach contents of grazing animals, such as caribou, to
access vegetable matter. Transhumant pastoralists typically have a tenuous and competitive relationship with
agriculturalist societies, as agriculturalists may not always have sufficient surplus for trade in years when
there have been droughts or warfare, for example. At times, the relationships between sedentary
agriculturalists and more mobile and dependent pastoralists break down into conflict involving threats,
destruction of property, and even warfare.

Transhumant pastoralism is usually built around a seasonal migration between a family's two households in
different geographical areas. It normally takes days or weeks to move people and herds between the
households, so pastoralists often have mobile residences, such as yurts or tents, to use during travel. As we
556  18 · Human-Animal Relationship

     find in nomadic pastoral societies, transhumant pastoralists rely on their animals for various trade
     commodities such as meat, leather, wool and wool goods (e.g., ropes and blankets), and juvenile offspring. The
     most common domestic herd animals of transhumant pastoralists are cattle, sheep, goats, camelids (llamas
     and alpacas), and yaks.

     18.3 Symbolism and Meaning of Animals

     LEARNING OUTCOMES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       · Identify totemism.
       · Identify the roles of animals in the oral traditions of many human cultures.
       · Describe the various ways animals are used in religious practices.

     When we think of animals, we usually picture them as pets, food, or wildlife, but animals play a central role in
     the symbolism of human lives as well. Humans relate to animals not only as tangible beings but also as images
     and symbols that carry personal meaning and communicate cultural norms. While we can find animal
     symbols almost everywhere in human cultures, they play a particularly significant role in group identity.

     Totemism

     Totemism is a belief system in which a subcultural group acknowledges kinship with a spirit being, typically a
     plant or animal, that serves as the group's emblem or herald. Relationships with their totems mirror the social
     relationships they have with each other as subgroups within their society. Totemic groups, often referred to as
     clans, view themselves as descendants of nonhuman ancestors and maintain special relationships of respect
     with other species in the natural world. Totemism is an example of a metaphorical relationship between
     humans and the natural world, one that links humans, animals, plants, landforms, and even weather events
     into a unified web of life. Many Indigenous groups practice totemism and have ancestral alliances with certain
     animals and plants, demonstrated by the ways in which they talk about them in their myths and depict them in
     their artwork. Totemic cultures frequently practice shamanism as a way to communicate with animal and
     plant species.

identity, with a focus on the connections that the clan has with ancestors, animals, and plants. This reproduction of
a First Nations totem pole is on display in Stanley Park, Vancouver, Canada. (credit: "2014 06 27 Cher and
Downtown Vancouver 065" by Blake Handley/flickr, CC BY 2.0)

The totem, an animal or plant believed to be spiritually connected to a group of people, is a symbol of identity
for the subgroup. The Anishinaabe, a North American Indigenous tribe located along the midwestern border
between Canada and the United States, was historically divided into various doodeman (clans), most of which
had local animals as their totems. Examples of their totem animals include a loon, a crane, a fish, a bird, a bear,
a marten, and a deer. All members of the same totemic clan identified with one another as descendants and
relatives. The totemic identification that children received at birth (from their fathers' affiliations) connected
individuals not otherwise linked by close social or biological relationships, creating a spiritual kinship within
the clan through the common totem. Clans were often associated with specific occupations and work
assignments within the larger tribe. Clans also determined marriage rules; members of the same clan could
not marry one another, as it was considered to be incest. While the Anishinaabe today have fewer clans, and
thus fewer animal totems, than when their population was higher, and the importance of clans and totems has
lessened, they continue to value the identities that their ancestors constructed through the natural world.

The totem pole is a form of monumental architecture displaying the significant totems and historical events in
a clan or family's ancestral history. It functions as a signpost that identifies the occupants of an area to those
passing through and proclaims the pride that a people have in their ancestry. Extended families are grouped
together in a clan. The totem pole serves to proclaim the clan membership that an extended family has had
throughout its history. The story of the first creation of the Indigenous group and the major events that
occurred in the life of that family, its clan, and its tribe are all depicted on the totem pole. Many, though not all,
Indigenous groups in North America make totem poles. These poles are historical landmarks of cultural
identity.

Although Western societies do not construct physical totem poles, they do utilize some of the same symbolism
in sports mascots and family heraldry. Sports teams use different types of symbolism, but animal symbols are
common. Often, teams choose animals that are local to their immediate environment or that connect with
certain characteristics and behaviors with which the group wishes to identify. Some well-known teams with
animal mascots are the Detroit Lions, the Tampa Bay Rays, and the Boston Bruins. What animal mascots do
you know?

Animals in Oral Tradition

Animals play an important role in nearly all oral traditions and religions. Across cultures, including Western
cultures in Europe and the United States, animals appear as protagonists in myths and stories. The animal
characters in nursery rhymes, fairy tales, fables, and folktales teach adults and children lessons and morals
and model personal characteristics, some peculiar to a specific culture and others more universal. For
example, the story of Chicken Little, also known in the UK as Henny Penny, is one that many US children learn
at an early age. It was collected in print in the early 19th century, but it has older roots as a European folktale.
In this tale, Chicken Little goes out for a walk on a windy day, and an acorn falls on her head. She panics--the
sky must be falling! She runs around the farm warning all the animals about the calamity that she believes is
happening: "The sky is falling! The sky is falling!" The moral of the story is to have courage and not believe
everything you hear.

"The Queen Bee" is an interesting European reflection on animals, recorded from oral tradition by the Grimm
brothers in 1812 . In this story, three princes, all brothers, leave their castle home to seek their fortunes and
travel around the world. Two of the brothers move about haphazardly, paying no attention to the animals
around them, but the youngest son, with the insulting name of Simpleton, is more considerate to the animals
they encounter. When the older brothers try to destroy an anthill, kill ducks, and chase bees out of their hive,
Simpleton intervenes to protect the animals and stop his brothers from causing harm. Eventually, the three
princes arrive at another castle, in which everything living has been turned to stone except for one very old
man. The old man tells the princes that if they can perform three tasks, all of which depend on the help of
animals, they will be able to wake up the castle and earn the hand of a princess. The animals, remembering
how they were treated, agree to help only young Simpleton, who thereby gains the keys of the kingdom. The
558  18 · Human-Animal Relationship

     moral is that even the smallest animals serve a mighty purpose.

     Many of the animal stories that are still told in Western societies were either collected by the Grimm brothers
     in the early 1800s (1812-1857) or taken from Aesop's Fables, a collection of stories supposedly told by Aesop,
     an enslaved Greek storyteller, around 500 BCE. These stories have made their way into children's storybooks
     and animated movies--including an animated version of Chicken Little.

     Indigenous societies across cultures have their own sets of animal stories that provide instruction and
     wisdom. Some of the most common animal symbols among Native American cultures are the coyote, the
     raven, the bear, and the spider. Coyote and Raven often appear in stories as tricksters, animal spirits or deities
     who are lively and clever and get into trouble through thoughtless or unconventional actions. In the story of
     Coyote and Bluebird from the Pima people of the southeastern United States, Coyote envies Bluebird's plumage
     and asks for the secret to the beautiful blue color of the bird's feathers. Bluebird tells Coyote that these pretty
     blue feathers came from bathing in blue water. Coyote does the same and comes out with a fine blue coat. In his
     vanity, he tries to outrun his shadow so that he can see his beautiful blue body in the light, and he crashes into
     a stump head-on, landing in the dirt, which coats his blue fur and paints him a "dirty" color that he still has
     today. The moral of this tale is that vanity does not serve an individual well.

     In West Africa, many myths focus on a supernatural figure named Anansi, the spider. Anansi is a culture hero
     who teaches lessons of bravery and morality. Culture heroes are typically associated with supernatural feats
     and are particular to each cultural group, exhibiting specific traits, actions, and discoveries that are significant
     in that culture. In one Anansi story cycle brought by enslaved Africans to the Caribbean area during the time of
     the Atlantic slave trade, Anansi goes fishing and fills his basket with many different sizes of fish. On his way
     home, he crosses paths with Tiger, who demands to know what Anansi is carrying in the basket. Scared,
     Anansi lies and says he has nothing. Tiger takes the basket and sees the fish. In a series of back-and-forth
     interactions, Anansi succeeds in outsmarting Tiger by agreeing to clean his fur. Tiger shakes down his long
     hair, and then Anansi uses it to tie Tiger to the trunk of a tree, picks up his basket of fish, and continues home.
     The moral of the story? Use your wit to protect yourself and your possessions. Or, perhaps, Don't let a bully get
     the best of you.

     Animals in Religion

     Animals play a role in most religions. Common functions include as objects of ritual sacrifice and as tokens
     symbolizing gifts, payments, or even messages between the human world and the divine. As just one example,
     think of the use of a dove in the Noah and the ark myth (Genesis 8:6-12). The dove is the first animal to bring
     back a piece of greenery, evidence that the flood had receded. With this promise, Noah begins preparations to
     leave the ark and start over. This use of animals as messengers and forms of sacred communication is seen
     across cultures.

     In prehistoric Peru, wild guinea pigs were sacrificed and buried either alone or with humans. They appear in
     archaeological deposits in Peru as early as 9000 BP (Sandweiss and Wing 1997), and they continue to appear
     as sacrifices after their domestication around 4500 BP and through the Inca period that ended in the 16th
     century. Some of the sacrificed animals are whole and intact, mummified and desiccated, while others have
     been burned and their charred bones stored as ritual offerings inside elaborate ceramic jars. Guinea pigs were
     and still are a dependable source of meat in the Andes, where they traditionally live inside kitchens, nesting
     around the warmth of the cooking area. They are also used medicinally, their fat rubbed on areas of sickness to
     draw out pain and infection, and employed as divination tools. During divination rituals today, some Andean
     healers will rub a living guinea pig on a patient's body to draw out some of the illness and then cut the animal
     open to "read" it, looking for a sign of some type of abnormality in the guinea pig's organs that would mirror
     the location of the illness in the human patient. At Lo Demás, an ancient Inca fishing site south of Lima, Peru
     (ca. 1480-1540 CE), archaeologists have excavated multiple guinea pig sacrifices, some of which show
     characteristic signs of having been used for divination and healing prior to burial.

     In India, where Hinduism is the predominant religion, it is common to see cows walking along city streets,
     undisturbed and roaming freely. Many Hindus practice vegetarianism, but even those who eat meat do not
     usually eat beef. Cattle are sacred in Hinduism. In the Vedas, the Hindu sacred texts, the cow is associated with
     Aditi, the mother of all gods. In a very famous study, "The Cultural Ecology of India's Sacred Cattle" (1966),

cultural anthropologist Marvin Harris explores the economic rationale associated with revering cattle, arguing
that cattle are considered sacred because they are more useful when allowed to live out their natural lifespans
than when slaughtered at a young age for meat alone. In India, cattle provide dung that can be dried and used
as fuel, traction for plowing fields, some limited milk production, and reproductive capacity. When cattle die of
old age, beef and leather are then harvested by those in the lowest socioeconomic class. Keeping cattle alive as
long as possible thus provides for a greater range of material assets than raising them for food. This economic
rationale, however true it may be, does not negate the cultural and religious importance of cattle to Indian
people. Understanding animals' symbolic roles is critical to understanding human belief systems.

Buddhism is a religion that reveres all life and sees humans and animals as intertwined, each capable of being
reincarnated into the other, reborn into a new cycle of life inhabiting a new body of the same or another
species. Because Buddhists believe in karma, a spiritual principle of cause and effect in which an individual's
words, actions, and deeds in one life affect their conditions in the next life cycle, the relationship between
humans and other animals should ideally be based on respect and sympathy. All forms of life are working
toward enlightenment, a state of awakening and having a complete knowledge of the life process.

Animals are important in human belief systems. English art critic and poet John Berger ([1980] 1991) writes
about the gaze between humans and other animals, saying that animals remind humans that we are not here
on Earth alone, that we are all companion species. Many religious systems reflect the awareness that life is not
the exclusive domain of the human species and that our world is a shared community. For more on animals
and belief systems, see the Ethnographic Sketch at the end of the chapter.

18.4 Pet-Keeping

LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Define the pet as a cultural artifact.
  · Trace the historical development of pets in Western societies.
  · Provide examples of pets in Indigenous societies.
  · Identify major behavioral and morphological characteristics of pets.

560  18 · Human-Animal Relationship

     One of the most familiar and intimate roles that animals play in the lives of contemporary Western people is
     that of pets. Pets are animals that are either domesticated or tamed with whom humans have developed a
     long-term social bond. Pets are part of many human cultures.

     Pets as Cultural Artifacts

     Although specific pets are actual beings (many of us can think of the face of one or more pets we live or have
     lived with), pets in general can be understood as a cultural artifact. This means that the ways in which pets are
     treated and what is expected of them vary a great deal from one culture to another. Most pets live in or around
     human households, are considered the possessions of their human owners, and have limited ability to make
     freewill decisions. Chinese geographer and early scholar in human-animal studies Yi-Fu Tuan (1984) has
     studied the ways in which humans have dominated the living environment and their pets, with approaches
     varying between extremes of dominance and affection, love and abuse, cruelty and kindness. He argues that
     pets in Western societies are defined by emotion and nostalgia, an approach likely related to increasing
     distance between people and the natural world. Even within a culture that treats certain animals in a
     sentimental way, relationships with other animals can still be characterized by cruelty and dominance. Tuan
     writes, "Animals are slaughtered for food and clothing without a twinge of conscience. A few specimens and
     species, however, catch the fancy of people in a playful mood and are made into pampered pets or fervently
     supported causes" (1984, 162).

     What we would recognize as modern pet keeping in the Western world--an approach characterized by keeping
     animals for no other purpose than to be companions for humans--emerged during the late 18th and early 19th
     centuries. Prior to that time, animals cared for by humans had functions or tasks within the household. As
     communities and towns became increasingly urban and people lost interaction with wild animals, the
     relationship between people and animals shifted in various ways. Many families were smaller and had more
     time to care for a pet. Animals had fewer assigned duties and responsibilities and were more available as
     companions. Improvements in medical and veterinary sciences lowered the risk of zoonoses, or diseases
     transmitted between animals and humans, although zoonotic infections continue to threaten human
     populations (consider COVID-19, for example). Lastly, a growing middle class with more affluence could afford
     the luxury of keeping pets. Modern pet keeping is marked by a relationship of demonstrative affection between
     people and their animals as well as by the economic development of pet industries, such as pet food
     companies, veterinary services, and even cremation and burial services.

     Pet Keeping in Indigenous Societies

     There is extensive evidence of pet keeping in Indigenous societies. In many hunter-gatherer societies, children
     keep numerous pets, most often birds, small rodents, and monkeys. These animals, often taken directly from
     the forest or wilderness area when they are still young, are considered valuable companions for children.
     Caring for the animals is thought to teach children to understand animals' movements and personalities and
     help them develop a sense of stewardship for the natural world.

     Animal ethicist James Serpell (1988) has found wide-ranging pet keeping throughout Indigenous societies in
     North and South America. The Waraõ in the Orinoco region of Venezuela keep birds, monkeys, sloths, rodents,
     ducks, dogs, and chickens as pets. The Kalapalo of central Brazil have a particular affection for birds and treat
     them as members of the family. The Barasana of eastern Colombia keep pet rodents, birds (especially parrots
     and macaws), peccaries (piglike mammals), and even young jaguars. And North American Indigenous groups
     are known to have tamed raccoons, moose, bison, wolves, bears, and especially dogs.

2.0)

While many Native Americans are very affectionate with their dogs, their style of "keeping" these dogs as pets
differs a great deal from what most American are familiar with. In a 2020 article titled "What Rez Dogs Mean to
the Lakota," Lakota tribal members Richard Meyers and Ernest Weston Jr. explain:

      In our culture, people traditionally don't own animals the way other cultures have pets; the animals
      are left wild, and may choose to go to a home to offer protection, companionship, or even to become a
      part of a community. People feed the dogs and care for them, but the dogs remain living outside and
      are free to be their own beings. This relationship differs from one where the human is the master or
      owner of an animal who is considered property. Instead, the dog and people provide service to one
      another in a mutual relationship of reciprocity and respect.

The roles of pets in human societies are very complex and depend on specific cultural traditions and ways of
relating to animals, both wild and domesticated. It is important to note that pets play different roles across
different cultures and cannot be easily defined.

The Making of Pets

In Western societies, domesticated animals have increasingly been subjected to extreme genetic manipulation
in order to manufacture ever more novel and attractive pet animals. In Europe, the earliest kennel clubs,
designed to develop and maintain breeds and record pedigrees, began as dog show societies in England in
1859 and were later established as governing bodies and official institutions, starting in 1873. Although dog
breeds now come from all over the world and continue to be developed--a recent addition to the list of breeds
recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) is the Biewer terrier, first recognized in January 2021--the
majority of modern pet breeds were first developed in Victorian England, where pet keeping flourished and
was adopted by all social classes.

Sometimes, this selective breeding of pets is detrimental to the health of the animal breed. In the English
bulldog, for example, 86 percent of litters must be delivered by cesarian section because the pups' large heads
and mothers' narrow pelvises have made live, natural births very challenging (Evans and Adams 2010). In
addition, as dog breeders create more and more specialized pets, the gene pool becomes narrowed and less
diverse, producing animals that are more prone to conditions such as cancer, hip dysplasia, deafness,
hereditary epilepsy, and allergies. In pedigreed cats, which are subject to the same selective pressures in
breeding, there are both heart and kidney problems that are thought to be accelerated by selective breeding.

One of the most commonly sought set of characteristics by people selectively breeding animals for pets is the
appearance of a permanent juvenile state. Neotony, the tendency for an animal to maintain both physical and
behavioral juvenile characteristics into adulthood, has been highly sought after in many domesticated
562  18 · Human-Animal Relationship

     animals. Some of the most commonly desired juvenile physical traits are larger and wider-set eyes, a smaller
     snout (or nose), a more globular (or rounded) skull, and fewer and smaller teeth (which leaves many dogs with
     crowded teeth and dental problems). Social neotony involves a cluster of traits relating to a strong and
     submissive attachment to humans and increased attentiveness to human behavior.

     The overall size of animals is also a consideration when breeding pets. Consider the range of miniature
     animals we have selected for today: miniature horses, mules, and pigs; pygmy goats and hedgehogs; and
     others. Of all animals kept as pets, dogs have been the most manipulated in size. Today, there is a proliferation
     of "teacup" breeds that can be carried in the owner's pocket or purse. Small dogs offer many advantages to
     humans living in urban environments and small apartments, but there are few advantages for the dogs
     themselves. Most teacup versions are created by breeding the smallest animals in a litter. There are many
     health risks that accompany this process of extreme miniaturization, such as collapsing tracheas, digestive
     problems, heart defects, liver shunts, slipping kneecaps, and a host of dental challenges.

     Pet keeping has deep roots in human societies and has changed over time. Interestingly, it has also been
     documented among some animals. Nonhuman animals have been known to form cross-species friendships
     and alliances and to take care of each other both in the wild and in captivity. One interesting example is the
     gorilla Hanabiko, called "Koko," who was trained to understand spoken English and communicate using a form
     of American Sign Language that her keeper called Gorilla Sign Language. Koko became interested in cats and
     signed that she wanted a kitten for Christmas in 1983. Her keepers at first provided her with a stuffed cat, but
     Koko insisted that she wanted a living one. On her birthday the following July, her keepers allowed her to
     choose a rescue kitten, which she named "All Ball" because he had no tail and was very fluffy. The relationship
     between Koko and her kitten, documented in many articles and videos, was a nurturing one in which Koko
     treated All Ball like her baby and her pet. Pet keeping says a great deal about the human need to reach across
     species for companionship, dominance, and affection. Perhaps, though, this is not solely a human need.

     LEARNING OUTCOMES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       · Describe the evolution of zoos.
       · Recognize the benefits of ecotourism.
       · Define the use value of animals in biomedical research today.

     In the past two centuries, Western societies have increasingly taken the approach of treating animals as a
     commodity--a raw material or resource for human use, a thing instead of a being. When we consider the
     relationships that many Indigenous societies have with animals, we can better realize how different the
     Western idea of animals is. Approaching the world and nature primarily as consumers rather than coequals,
     Western cultures face increasing environmental, socio-emotional, and resource-related challenges in all areas
     of life.

     Zoos

     Zoos have long been part of human societies. The earliest evidence of a zoo has been found in Hierakonpolis,
     the capital of Upper Egypt during the Predynastic period, today called Nekhen. Here, archaeologists have
     unearthed the mummified remains of a collection of wild and domesticated animals from about 5,000 years
     ago that included baboons, hippos, gazelles, crocodiles, a leopard, and cats and dogs. Some of the animals had
     injuries likely caused by being tied or enclosed in some way. Many of them were buried in the same way that
     humans were buried, and some were found inside human burials (Boissoneault 2015). Another famous
     historical zoo was that of the Aztec king Montezuma. When the Spaniards arrived in the Aztec capital of
     Tenochtitlán in 1519, they were surprised by the vast collection of animals housed in enclosures and rooms
     within the king's palace complex, including jaguars, bears, eagles, deer, fowl, ocelots, and little dogs. According
     to the Spanish chroniclers, the zoo had some 300 keepers to care for the animals. Similar to early pet keeping,
     zoos were typically associated with wealth and status.

     Modern zoos emerged in the late 18th century during the period known as the Enlightenment, characterized

by the development of science and the expansion of colonial empires. European zoos were filled with wildlife
from new colonies and "foreign" lands and were considered places to see strange and exotic animals. The first
modern zoos opened in Paris in 1793, London in 1828, and Philadelphia in 1874. These were all very popular
public institutions that exhibited animals for entertainment and observation. The zoos were laid out like
public parks, with small animal enclosures that allowed people to get up close to see.

There have been many changes in zoos over the last 50 years. With the signing of the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES) in 1973 and the passage of the
Endangered Species Act in the United States the same year, wild animal imports to US zoos declined sharply.
This coincided with the development of breeding and conservation programs at zoos, some of which involve
breeding rare and endangered species to be released back into the wild as part of a sustainable population.
One species for which breeding efforts are currently underway is the giant panda. Animals are commonly
moved from one zoo site to another and shared for breeding purposes in an effort to fortify the breed. Animals
that are endangered may be part of a zoo preservation program. In some cases, critically endangered animals
are cared for by zoos when they are young and vulnerable to predators and then reintroduced into the wild.
The website of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) features a long list of animals whose populations
have been preserved through the efforts of zoos, including the black-footed ferret, the California condor, the
Ohio River basin freshwater mussel, the golden lion tamarin, and the Oregon spotted frog. Zoos also sponsor
research programs with goals such as creating sustainable populations in the wild, conserving wildlife
habitats, improving animal health, or even collecting endangered species' genetic material (DNA) (DeMello
2012, 106).

What should be the role of zoos in contemporary Western societies? Should the zoo be closer to a theme park
or a museum? Should the goal of a zoo be animal conservation or human recreation? These questions guide us
as we continue to rethink the mission of zoos today.

             PROFILES IN ANTHROPOLOGY

     Barbara J. King
     1956-

     FIGURE 18.13 Anthropologist Barbara King with Cynthia Goat at the Farm Sanctuary in Watkins Glen, New York
     (credit: Charles Hogg)

     Personal History: Born in New Jersey, King earned her BA from Douglass College (Rutgers University) and her
     MA and PhD from the University of Oklahoma, where she specialized in biological anthropology. Her doctoral
     field research in Amboseli National Park, Kenya, focused on foraging and social behaviors among yellow
     baboons. From 1988 to 2015, she served as professor of anthropology at the College of William & Mary in
     Williamsburg, Virginia, where she received numerous awards for outstanding teaching and mentorship. She is
     now a professor emerita, although she continues to have an active role in academia, research, publishing, and
     mentorship.

     Area of Anthropology: King's research and contributions to the field are notable for their broad-ranging
     relevance across anthropological subfields and disciplines, among them linguistic and communication
     systems in primates, social relationships between species, the primate origins of religious thought, and the
     social and emotional lives of various animal species, including those being factory farmed. Her
     anthropological focus is often on the continuities between humans and other animals and the ethics of
     human-animal relationships. She has published seven books and numerous scholarly articles.

     Accomplishments in the Field: Given the four-field scope of much of King's research, she has had
     considerable impact on many areas of academia. In 2002, King was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for
     "exceptional capacity for productive scholarship" and creativity. Two of her works, Evolving God: A Provocative
     View on the Origins of Religion (2007, Doubleday) and How Animals Grieve (2013, University of Chicago Press),
     have received prizes and awards as outstanding contributions to the field.

     King is also an active public anthropologist, bridging gaps between academic research and the public. A
     contributor to the National Public Radio blog Cosmos and Culture from 2011 to 2018 and a full-time science

writer since her retirement in 2015, King, through interviews, articles, and blogs, communicates the
importance of science for public good and social change. Her research on animal grief, How Animals Grieve,
was highlighted in her 2019 TED Talk, "Grief and Love in the Animal Kingdom (https://openstax.org/r/
barbara_j_king)." King also regularly reviews books for various media outlets, including NPR, the Washington
Post, and the Times Literary Supplement, and publishes in Sapiens, an online anthropology magazine devoted
to public outreach. She is a self-described Twitter addict (@bjkingape).

Importance of Their Work

In her public role, King seeks to educate and incentivize people to make positive change for human and animal
lives. In her newest book, Animals' Best Friends: Putting Compassion to Work for Animals in Captivity and in
the Wild (University of Chicago Press, 2021), King issues a call to cultivate compassionate action toward all the
animals sharing their lives with us. She challenges us to widen our lens on the world around us and become
animals' best friends, whether they are in our homes, in the wild, in a lab, in a zoo, or destined to be thought of
as food. "When we still ourselves and genuinely see the more-than-human-world, possibilities for helping
animals bloom all around us--we may rescue rather than squish a spider in our home; resist an urge to crowd
wild animals in order to snap selfies; advocate for non-animal models in laboratory science; refuse to support
roadside zoos or swim-with-dolphin programs; and increase our plant-based eating" (Snipes, personal
communication, 2021). For more on King's recent work, see her interview with nature writer Brandon Keim
(https://openstax.org/r/youtube_kno1wWevRVg) on Earth Day 2021.

Ecotourism

Another way in which contemporary Western societies are attempting to address the damage caused by a
commodified view of the natural world, including the animals living in it, is through ecotourism. This is
tourism designed to be sustainable and to help preserve the flora and fauna of endangered natural
environments. Often, the focus is on visiting threatened environments and observing wildlife in its natural
habitat. Such tourism can earn money to aid in the conservation of these areas, provide employment for local
residents, and raise awareness of the importance of biological, as well as cultural, diversity. Ideally, care is
taken to ensure that tourists visiting natural areas do not disturb or damage the environment; however, there
are no global standards for ecotourism, and some sites are more successful at protecting sensitive
environments than others. The term greenwashing is sometimes applied to sites that promote the natural
environment as an attraction while engaging in exploitative and environmentally destructive behavior.

An example of effective and increasingly responsible ecotourism is provided by the Galápagos Islands. The
566  18 · Human-Animal Relationship

     Galápagos island chain was made famous by English naturalist Charles Darwin, who used his observations of
     the diversity of the ecosystem's animals to develop the theory of natural selection. Located 563 miles west of
     the coast of Ecuador, the Galápagos were listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 1978. Prior to that, the
     islands were only partially protected. Some of the Galápagos Islands were designated as wildlife sanctuaries in
     1934, and the island archipelago became an Ecuadorian national park in 1959. Around that time, a few
     wealthy tourists began to travel to the islands to view their extraordinary biodiversity. By the 1990s, tourism
     had become very popular and a tourist industry had developed, with hotels, restaurants, and transportation.
     Today, the Galápagos National Park Service, which manages 97 percent of the island lands (the other 3 percent
     are contained settlements where local people live), has strict policies limiting the daily number of visitors.
     Local people serve as employees in the park and teach the value of conservation to tourists. It is the hope of the
     Galápagos National Park Service and the local people that this island ecosystem and its living
     inhabitants--such as the Galápagos giant tortoise, the Galápagos penguin, the blue-footed booby, the flightless
     cormorant, and the waved albatross--will be preserved for future generations.

     Animals and the Medical Industry

     In 2015, there were estimated to be some 192 million animals being used in biomedical laboratories across
     179 countries worldwide (Taylor and Alvarez 2019). These animals are used for medical experiments, drug
     testing, product testing, and psychological research. The most commonly used animals in US labs are mice,
     rats, and birds, though a range of other animals--including rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters, farm animals such
     as pigs and sheep, cats, dogs, and nonhuman primates--are used as well (Humane Society of the United States
     2021). These animals come from various sources, including breeding programs within the biomedical labs
     themselves.

     Although biologists, chemists, animal behaviorists, psychiatrists, and psychologists tend to be more frequently
     involved in medical research with animals, anthropologists--especially primatologists and linguistic
     anthropologists--also have a history of working with animals in laboratory settings. Primatologist Sue Savage-
     Rumbaugh carried out long-term cognitive studies of two bonobos, Kanzi and Panbanisha, from birth. Savage-
     Rumbaugh was interested in understanding how bonobos, which are closely related to humans, learn
     communication. She developed a computer-based language program using lexigrams, or symbols
     representing words, printed on a keyboard. Although lacking the vocal apparatus of a human, Kanzi and
     Panbanisha demonstrated advanced cognitive linguistic skills by responding to human speech and generating
     language by pressing lexigrams. In one study comparing Kanzi's language competence with that of a two-year-
     old human child, Kanzi scored significantly higher: 74 percent accuracy, compared to 65 percent accuracy for
     the two-year-old human (Savage-Rumbaugh et al. 1993). Studies such as this one shed light not only on
     animals' abilities but also on the continuities that exist between humans and animals.

     There are two primary regulations in the United States that pertain to biomedical research animals: the
     Animal Welfare Act (AWA) and the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory
     Animals (PHS Policy). The AWA is a law passed by Congress in 1966 that originally covered the transport, sale,
     and handling of some animals and advocated for more humane animal practices in laboratories. The act has
     been amended several times (1970, 1976, 1985, 1990, 1991, 2002, 2007, 2008, 2014), including to add a
     requirement that researchers register their use of animals and also consider a database of alternatives if the
     procedure can cause any distress or pain. The act cover animals such as dogs, cats, rabbits, and nonhuman
     primates, but it does not cover those animals most commonly used in laboratory experiments: rats, mice, and
     birds. The PHS Policy applies to all research facilities that perform animal research and receive any type of
     federal funding; though not itself a law, its creation was mandated by the Health Research Extension Act,
     passed by Congress in 1985. This policy states that each institution conducting such research must have an
     institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) that reviews all proposed animal research experiments.
     This committee must include at least five members, one of whom must be a veterinarian and another a person
     not affiliated with the institution. When reviewing research proposals, the IACUC is expected to evaluate
     whether (1) basic standards are met, (2) the use of animals is justified, (3) the research is not duplicated, and
     (4) pain and discomfort for the animals are minimized. The United Kingdom and the European Union have
     similar measures to regulate and oversee animal laboratory research.

     Animal research has been critical to many advances in medicine, including the development of the first

human vaccine to successfully eradicate smallpox, the polio vaccine, and treatments for HIV/AIDS, Alzheimer's
disease, hepatitis, and malaria. Animals have played a crucial role in the development of many new drugs and
therapies, and a significant amount of research conducted on animals also benefits veterinary medicine and
other animals as well. However, the use of living animals for experiments and testing raises many ethical
issues and has inspired a great deal of conflict and controversy.

Animals in Our Lives

Humans share their lives with animals in many ways, and how we think about ourselves as human beings rests
primarily on the distinctions we see between ourselves and other species. English art critic and poet John
Berger writes, "With their parallel lives, animals offer man a companionship which is different from any
offered by human exchange. Different because it is a companionship offered to the loneliness of man as a
species" ([1980] 1991, 6). Across cultures and across time, humans have looked toward animals as fellow
participants in their lives. They actively participate in the ways we define ourselves. They feed us and
accompany us. They work for us and protect us. They also serve as symbols and messengers that help us better
understand our world. Our lives are intertwined in multiple ways.

What is an animal? What is the value of nonhuman animals in our lives? How do our attitudes about animals
define who we are as human beings? Anthropologists and other researchers increasingly see the value of
bringing animals into their research because animals are critical to understanding what it means to be
human.

        ETHNOGRAPHIC SKETCHES

Animal Familiarity

Experience of Marjorie Snipes, chapter author

        FIGURE 18.15 A young female goat and her kid. (credit: "Nursing Kid" by swallowsan/flickr, CC BY 2.0)

During fieldwork in northwestern Argentina, I lived with a community of herders who tended goats and sheep,
interviewing every day and taking copious notes. After six months of research, I took a two-week break from
the field to return to the United States to welcome my new niece. When I returned to the field site, I had an
accidental breakthrough.

However, let me back up. In this Andean community, herders believe that their flocks are gifts from
Pachamama (Mother Earth), and women are the primary caretakers and shepherds for the animals. After I had
lived in the community for about six weeks, one of the families gave me a small kid, or young goat, which I
named Maisie. I suspected that this gift was a test to see if I was planning to be part of the community. I took
care of Maisie every day, even though she remained a functioning member of another family's herd.
568  18 · Human-Animal Relationship

     Goats normally reproduce toward the end of their first year, and Maisie was pregnant when I left for my two-
     week absence from the field. While I was gone, she gave birth to a male that the family named Vicente Beda,
     after a Catholic saint. When I arrived back at the household where I was staying, late in the day, Doña
     Florentina was eager for me to meet the newest member of my herd. We entered the corral, and the young kid
     came running up to me with no fear. When I commented about the familiarity, as young animals tend to be
     skittish around new people, Florentina responded, "But he knows you, Margo." And so I learned about the
     librito (little book) that they believe is located in the stomach area of each of their herd animals.

     The librito contains information about an animal's life: who loves it, where it belongs, and when it will die. It is
     the shepherd's duty to discern the contents of the book through the animal's behavior, as she cannot openly
     read it. Animals who get lost frequently or have trouble bonding with the herd will be traded, as families
     believe such animals do not belong to them. And when it is time to select an animal for slaughter, the shepherd
     chooses an animal whose behavior indicates that the time is appropriate. While the signs vary according to the
     animal's disposition, it is normally a change of demeanor that the shepherd interprets as acquiescence. During
     slaughter, a woman typically holds the animal while a man cuts the throat. In all slaughters that I attended, the
     goat or sheep was killed peacefully, and butchering occurred quickly afterward--except one. The animal was a
     large ewe, and she was initially compliant with being handled, but at the moment that her throat was cut, her
     back feet scrambled and she tried to rise up. Everyone around me became very still and began to lower their
     voices, saying that it was not the right time for the ewe, that there had been a mistake. The shepherd had
     "made a mistake."

     The ewe was not butchered. She lay there for about an hour while the family discussed where to take her for
     burial. She was buried far away from the corral and household.

             MINI-FIELDWORK ACTIVITY

     Multispecies Animal Observation

     Ethnography increasingly utilizes methods aimed at incorporating a multitude of diverse voices. The purpose
     of this is not diversity for diversity's sake but to more accurately reflect and understand the various
     interactions that may occur within any field encounter. In this fieldwork activity, you will experiment with
     multispecies ethnography. Choose a wild animal (e.g., pigeon, duck, squirrel, insect, etc.), and observe it (with
     no interaction) for at least 15 minutes. During the observation, make consistent notes every 30 seconds to one
     minute, writing down the animal's behavior incrementally and how it interacts with its environment. Note also
     whether the animal seems to notice your presence or interact with you. Following the observation session,
     write up a multispecies ethnographic account, using the data you have collected to inform you of the possible
     intentions and thoughts of the animal as well as your own thoughts and reactions. Your write-up should be 500
     to 750 words and should end with a paragraph reflecting on the experience of trying to write from an animal's
     perspective (based on human observation). Turn in the original timed notes along with the final paper.

19.4 Applied and Public Anthropology and Indigenous Peoples
INTRODUCTION The author if this chapter, David Lewis, explains his deep connection to the material:
I, David Lewis, am the author of this chapter and a Native scholar--a member of the Confederated Tribes of the
Grand Ronde Community of Oregon. I am a descendant of the original Santiam Kalapuya, Takelma, and
Chinook tribes of western Oregon. I connect the real-world problems facing Indigenous peoples to the
overwhelming lack of knowledge about Native peoples held by most non-Native people in American society. I
have experience researching Indigenous peoples throughout the Pacific Rim, but in my PhD work, I have
focused on the Native peoples of Oregon.
Scholars of Indigenous peoples will normally focus on one or a few Indigenous cultures in their work, but in
any region, a cross section can be found of the sociopolitical themes present in a global context. Because of my
research focus, this chapter contains mainly examples from Oregon and the Northwest Coast, with the
inclusion of a few other case studies and examples from other regions. This chapter privileges North American
subjects over global Indigenous subjects. Regardless of this focus, be aware that most of the topics discussed
574  19 · Indigenous Anthropology

     here exist in some form in all global Indigenous cultures, especially those that have undergone colonization
     and a struggle for sovereignty and rights, which include nearly all Indigenous peoples today.

     19.1 Indigenous Peoples

     LEARNING OUTCOMES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       · Name different terms used for Indigenous peoples and describe the history and current connotations of each.
       · Explain what is meant by the statement that Indigenous peoples have become minorities in their own lands.
       · Define blood quantum and explain its current application.
       · Explain what is meant by the phrases "urban Indian" and "reservation Indian" and describe social and cultural
           characteristics associated with each.
       · Provide two examples of 20th-century challenges experienced by Native peoples in the United States.
       · Explain the need for Native perspectives in studies about Native peoples, using the debate over oral histories as
           an example.

     Indigenous peoples are those peoples who are the original human populations of a land. They are also
     referred to as Native peoples, tribal peoples, tribes, First Nations peoples, and Aboriginal peoples. In the
     United States, they are often referred to as American Indians or Native Americans. The terms used to refer to
     Indigenous peoples are contextualized by the nation or territory they are a part of. For instance, in the United
     States as a whole, the more general term is currently Native Americans, but in the southwest portion of the
     United States, American Indians is quite common, while in Alaska and Canada these peoples refer to
     themselves as First Nations. Hawaiian Indigenous peoples prefer the term Hawaiian. In Mexico, Indigenous
     peoples are called la gente indígena de México. In Australia, the commonly accepted terms are Aboriginal
     peoples and Torres Strait Islander peoples, referring to two broad but distinct cultural groups, and Indigenous
     Australians, referring collectively to both.

     Terms used for Indigenous peoples often reflect political, social, and economic systems. Indians is a term that
     was once very commonly used in the United States to describe the nation's original inhabitants. The word is a
     significant part of the legal and political history of these peoples, appearing in hundreds of treaties and
     thousands of federal documents pertaining to legal rights. But many "Indian" people do not like the word
     because it was first imposed by Christopher Columbus, who mistakenly thought that his journey across the
     Atlantic Ocean had landed him in India. Pointing out that the term Indian is a case of mistaken identity, many
     Indigenous peoples prefer to be labeled by their specific tribal names. There is not one mind about which
     terms to use for Indigenous peoples. There are scholars who refuse to use words such as Indian and scholars
     who embrace the word. Some scholars advocate changing the use of the term Indian in history books and
     historical documents. However, changing historic texts alters the original expression and the meanings
     associated with it. To change terms in this context would literally change history and mislead students of this
     history.

     There has been another tendency in American culture to misuse the term Native American to refer to a single
     monoculture. The majority of Americans have never spent time with Native individuals or engaged in any
     studies of Native peoples and thus do not have any true knowledge of actual Indigenous cultures. Until
     recently, Native cultures and Native history have not been accurately covered in educational institutions. Only
     in the past decade has there been significant movement toward offering accurate characterizations of Native
     peoples in public schools in the United States. While this is a positive development, stereotyping of and even
     racism toward Native peoples remain. The most accepted and appropriate way to refer to any Indigenous
     person is to use their actual tribal association, if known, rather than a general term such as Native American.

     The scholarly debate over these words is somewhat separate from the way the terms are used in Native
     communities. Many Indigenous communities have no issue with the word Indian and think the whole debate
     over word choice is a distraction from the real-world problems that affect their communities, such as poverty,
     substance use issues, poor health care, and inadequate education.

Minorities in Their Own Lands

Indigenous peoples are thought of as minorities in most countries. Many colonizing peoples sought to
eliminate Indigenous peoples and practiced various strategies to reduce their power to control land and
natural resources and even to maintain their cultures and identities. Historically, adult Indigenous people, and
even some young people, were forced to work for colonizers, often doing hard labor or other menial tasks,
without any opportunities to accumulate wealth or claim a position of higher class. Christianity in various
forms was forced on Indigenous peoples through government policies. Children were either not offered any
education at all or forced into boarding schools where they were required to adopt the colonial culture. In this
manner, many Indigenous people lost touch with their cultural heritage, and most Indigenous groups dwindled
in number, some disappearing altogether. This trend was particularly pronounced in Latin American
countries. Most people living in these countries today have some Indigenous ancestry, but as Indigenous
identities have been so discouraged, few openly identify with this portion of their heritage, choosing to focus
on their White and/or Spanish identities. It is evident that assimilation pressures, the process of changing the
culture of a person or group of people to some other culture, through socialization or education, have largely
succeeded when remaining peoples who identify as Indigenous become minorities within their own native
territories.

Many Native Americans, along with members of other Indigenous groups such as the Maori of New Zealand,
do not like to be categorized as minority groups in their own homelands. Native Americans in the United States
and the Maori tribes of New Zealand have treaties and sovereign rights that accord them access to and
ownership of resources that other immigrant minority groups do not have. Some federal funding for programs
is allotted to "minority groups" as a whole, including Native peoples. The Native peoples meant to benefit from
this funding have commented that this approach does not recognize the special relationships the treaty-bound
Indigenous peoples have with the state. The Maori especially have asked not to be considered a minority group.
Instead, they wish to claim rights granted them by the Treaty of Waitangi to the services and resources of the
federal New Zealand government.

     Membership in a Tribal Community

     Tribal relations among mixed-race Indigenous people in the United States are governed according to a series
     of rights first created through federal laws and policies, then later adopted by individual tribal nations. Tribal
     nations now have the right to manage their own membership laws and policies, with each tribe setting its own
     blood quantum rules for membership. Blood quantum refers to a genealogical relationship to one's original
     tribal people. Full-blooded Native people issue from parents who are both full-blooded members of a tribe,
     while half-blooded Native people have parents or grandparents who have at least 50 percent Native blood. A
     person can even be a full-blooded Native, with parents from two tribes, but be considered half-blooded by the
     tribe they are enrolled in because the tribe only acknowledges the Indigenous blood from the enrollment tribe
     (Ellinghaus 2017). Some of the terms for people of mixed heritage in the Americas are mestizo (common in
     Latin America) and Métis (common in Canada). Some nations, such as Canada, assign different rights to
     people of mixed Indigenous heritage; Métis communities are accorded different rights from First Nations
     communities.

     Although Indigenous heritage is preferred in most Native communities, the rate of outmarriage is such that
     pure Indigenous bloodlines are becoming rare. In the United States, most Native people have mixed heritage.
     An exception is the Navajo Nation, which has a significant number of full-blooded Navajo members due to its
     large population of more than 300,000 members.

     Normally, individuals have to prove they have a blood quantum of a certain percentage to enroll in a tribe.
     Some tribal policies require a strict accounting of only the bloodlines that originate within that tribe. Other
     tribes allow for any Indigenous blood as counting toward membership requirements. The latter policy is closer
     to the cultural practices followed by many Native peoples before they became wards of the federal government.
     It was common for many tribes to adopt people who moved into their area and took up their culture. In
     addition, marriage customs of all tribes, which disallowed marriage between individuals too closely related,
     encouraged members to marry outside of their village or tribe. Spouses brought into a village would be
     adopted without discrimination. In tribes in Oregon, women would more commonly go to their husbands'
     villages. In other cultures, such as that of the Seneca of the Northeast, men would move to their wives' villages.

     Some scholars view blood quantum as a means for the United States government to prevent people from
     claiming tribal heritage, ultimately causing tribes to self-terminate. This view is not shared by all tribal
     peoples. Blood quantum was written into most tribal constitutions in the 1930s as a means of determining
     tribal citizenships. This policy has caused numerous problems in contemporary communities, where tribal

members sometimes attempt to marry their cousins in order to "marshal" their blood--that is, raise or
maintain the percentage of blood quantum in their offspring (Nenemay 2005). Scholars have noted that most
tribes will continue to lose members due to outmarriage unless membership requirements are changed, even
though most blood quantum requirements are currently well below one-half. Many tribal communities are
shifting policies so that individuals can claim tribal membership by establishing descent from an enrolled
tribal member (Thornton 1997).

Membership in the Grand Ronde tribe of Oregon requires a 1/16 blood quantum of Grand Ronde blood and an
ancestor or parent who was on a tribal roll or record in the past. The tribe counts only genealogical connection
to original tribal residents of the reservation. Unfortunately, many people have moved on and off the
reservation over the years, and records have not been accurately maintained. Proving past residence on the
reservation is difficult. In addition, more restrictive changes to the membership requirements since 1999 have
reduced the number of members. One controversial change made in 1999 requires that the parent of a
potential new member must have been enrolled in the tribe at the time of the prospective member's birth. This
change denies membership to the children of those who became members after having children and the
children of those born during the period between 1956 and 1983, when tribal rolls were not maintained. One
result has been split families, in which younger children born when their parents were on the tribal roll are
deemed members, while their older siblings are not eligible for enrollment.

The issue has become politicized at the reservation, with some enrolled members fearing that a flood of new
enrollments would impact services and funds and others wanting to expand enrollment to allow more
descendants into the tribe. These questions of identity, both political and social, will likely continue to excite
debate in the coming decades, as many tribes acknowledge that unless they change membership
requirements, they may cease to exist in the future.

Tribal Groups and Communities

Most Indigenous communities are extremely poor and face a number of challenges resulting from centuries of
colonization, settlement, and exploitation. In the United States, Canada, and Australia, Indigenous peoples
were forcibly relocated to reservations, often marginal lands "set aside" for Native peoples after European
settlers and colonists claimed their original homelands. Many North American reservation communities have
been, and continue to be, kept in a state of perpetual poverty. Reservations typically have few employment
opportunities, high substance addiction and alcoholism rates, and high morbidity rates caused by long-term
persistent poverty. Some tribes have been successful in making good education available to young people
through successes in casino development and effective management of federal education grants, but there is a
significant disparity of completion rates at all levels of education. A 2011 report by the Higher Education
Research Institute found that among those enrolled in four-year degree programs, approximately 17 percent of
Native students completed the degree within four years, compared to 45 percent of Asian students, 43 percent
of White students, 26 percent of Latinx/Latina/Latino students, and 21 percent of Black students (DeAngelo et
al. 2011, 10; see also Al-Asfour and Abraham 2016).

In the United States, tribal reservations were historically prevented from developing their own industries by
the Nonintercourse Act sections of the Trade and Intercourse Acts. This legislation made it illegal to sell
products beyond the borders of a reservation, which were viewed in the same way as state borders. Tribes can
petition Congress to approve a reservation-based industry, but the petition can take decades to be approved.
Many reservations have languished for two centuries with few or no jobs or opportunities for Native peoples
(Miller 2012). Those who leave reservations for jobs rarely return as full-time residents. Still, Indigenous
people on reservations in the United States enjoy the comfort of living within their own cultures and face less
discrimination in their communities than they would in White-dominated communities.

People of mixed Indigenous heritage who can "pass" as White have often done so, thus abandoning their
Indigenous ancestry. Many took advantage of opportunities to move to cities and get jobs as "White" people,
enjoying the pay and social benefits that went along with those jobs and social identities. This path was
followed by many Native people in the United States beginning in the later 19th century. The exodus to the
cities reached a peak in the 1950s and 1960s following the United States' termination of the status of 109
tribes. Termination refers to a US federal policy adopted in 1953 that voided the treaty agreements between
578  19 · Indigenous Anthropology

     the federal government and Native peoples. The US government then repossessed and sold reservation
     property in a process called liquidation. Terminated tribal peoples were released from reservation lifeways
     with no money or resources. They were no longer federally recognized Native peoples and had no rights to ask
     for federal services or assistance. Most of the tribes that underwent termination were restored beginning in
     the 1970s.

     Many of those who underwent termination moved to urban environments in search of work, resulting on
     populations of " urban Indian" communities. During World War II, the Keiser Shipyards in Portland employed
     a number of Native people, many of them women (https://openstax.org/r/oregonhistoryproject), who left
     regional reservations for work. The twentieth century trend of Native peoples moving to cities creating has
     resulted in significant populations of "urban Indians."

     Today, the majority of Native people in the United States live in urban environments. This movement has
     created tensions within Indigenous communities. The phrase "urban Indian" has taken on negative
     connotations within some Indigenous contexts. Some "reservation Indians" accuse urban Natives of willingly
     giving up their status, land, and culture. While some urban Natives struggle with feeling disconnected from
     their tribal identities, many maintain a connection with reservation communities by visiting on weekends and
     holidays and participating in special events such as tribal government meetings.

     Urban Native communities typically include groups to benefit Native people, such as educational and culture-
     based organizations and civic-minded business associations. Many of these groups include people from
     various tribes who work together to plan community spiritual activities such as powwows, support urban
     Indigenous food systems, or serve on culture-based committees. Tribal nations often have offices in urban
     communities that offer services to their citizens and serve as a site of sovereign activities of the tribe.
     Indigenous-language learning groups are now quite common in urban centers, especially at universities and
     tribal offices. Universities in many ways form cultural centers for urban Indigenous people, offering Native
     centers, employing Indigenous scholars, and funding cultural activities and events.

     There are several tribal offices in Portland, Oregon, which has one of the largest concentrations of off-
     reservation Native people in the United States, with an estimated 40,000 people of Native descent. On the west
     side of town is the Portland-area office of the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde. This office hosts weekly
     cultural education programs called Lifeways, which are free to tribal community members, along with classes
     in wood carving, drawing, storytelling, and the Chinuk Wawa language. Other services offered to tribal
     members living in the Portland metro area include jobs programs, food distributions, and a large boardroom
     equipped for hosting formal meetings. Also in Portland are the offices of the Confederated Tribes of Siletz
     Indians (https://openstax.org/r/ConfederatedTribesofSiletzIndians), the Native American Youth and Family
     Center education organization, the Oregon Native American Chamber of Commerce (https://openstax.org/r/
     AmericanChamber), and the Columbia River Intertribal Fish Commission (https://openstax.org/r/
     ColumbiaRiver). Portland is the site of community organizations such as the Bow and Arrow Culture Club,
     which hosts annual cultural gatherings and the large intertribal Delta Park Powwow. The radio station KBOO
     (90.7) consistently features Native programming.

     The Native population of Portland is a broad mixture of enrolled tribal people and unenrolled descendant
     people from throughout the United States. There are also large numbers of Indigenous peoples from other
     countries, with concentrations of Latina/Latino and Pacific Islander peoples. In addition, the Hawaiian
     community has deep roots in the region due to the inclusion of Hawaiian labor in the 19th-century fur trade of
     the Pacific Northwest.

     20th-Century Challenges

     In the 20th century, some tribes grew self-sufficient or even wealthy by harvesting or extracting the natural
     resources on their reservations. The land of the Osage Nation of Oklahoma was found to contain vast reserves
     of underground oil. Members of the nation who had oil under their allotments became wealthy, so much so that
     some were among the wealthiest people on the planet during the height of the oil boom. But soon after
     acquiring this wealth, White neighbors began marrying into the tribe. Tribal members began being murdered,
     and authorities were slow to launch any investigations. Eventually, White relatives ended up owning much of
     the Osage lands. The story of the Osage murders is documented in several books, including Killers of the

lands initially brought some members of the Osage Nation considerable wealth, it also made them the target of
unscrupulous White neighbors. Many Osage were murdered, with their White relatives coming into possession of
their land and the petroleum beneath it. (credit: Oklahoma Historical Society/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)

In a similar story, the Klamath tribe of Oregon established a very successful logging operation on their
reservation in the early 20th century. The reservation included a million acres of ponderosa pine. The Klamath
people established sawmills and sold the timber off the reservation, becoming quite wealthy. They even built
an airfield on the reservation. But their prosperity did not last. The federal government had been serving as
the bank administrator of the Klamath money and managing their profits. It became apparent that some
money had gone missing and that the land was being poorly managed by federal agents. The tribe successfully
sued the government for mismanagement, but they only received a percentage of the money they were owed.

In the 1940s, tribal liquidation/termination began to be discussed with the Klamath people. Some Klamath
people initially liked the idea of termination because it would free them from control by the federal
government. They were initially told they would receive their reservation land, but the government later told
them the land would be sold. Termination began in 1954. In 1961, the remaining unsold reservation lands
were turned into the Winema National Forest. Klamath members were forced to leave their homelands and
find employment in regional cities. The result of termination was that the Klamath lost their land and many
rights as Native people. Their population was dispersed, making it difficult to keep the culture alive. By the
1960s, most of the tribal languages were extinct, and many people had lost connections with their tribal past.
In the 1970s, some of the tribal elders, many who had remained in the vicinity of the original reservation,
began activating for restoration. The tribe was restored in 1983 (Lewis 2009).

An extreme example of the disenfranchisement of Native people is the movement of Indigenous peoples who
were part of the Okie migration of the 1930s. The Okie migration was to the movement of people out of
Oklahoma during the Dust Bowl crisis, in which agriculture yields collapsed due to drought and poor land
management practices. Topsoil blew away in large clouds, and thousands lost their land and their jobs. These
thousands included a large percentage of mixed-blood Native people. Those who could no longer earn a living
farming the degraded land moved west in search of work in Arizona, California, Oregon, and other western
states. These migrants led difficult lives, working at low-paying jobs and moving constantly in search of
seasonal work. One result of this movement westward was a shift of Native populations to the West and a
related collapse of tribal populations in Oklahoma. Among the artifacts of the Okie migration are photographs
taken by federal workers who visited the migrant encampments. Likely the most famous of these images is the
one now known as Migrant Mother, taken in 1936 by photographer Dorothea Lange. The subject of Lange's
photo has been identified as Florence Thompson, a Cherokee woman.

     FIGURE 19.5 Migrant Mother, one of the most famous photographs taken by Dorothea Lange, features a Cherokee
     woman, Florence Thompson. Like many people during this period, she and her family moved from place to place

     Seven Children. Age Thirty-Two. Nipomo, California" by Dorothea Lange/Library of Congress, Public Domain)

     By the 1970s, most Indigenous people in the United States were still very poor. In this period, a number of laws
     were passed to help Native people. These laws gave tribes the rights to control their cultures, educate their
     people, and administer their own foster care. These rights were difficult to act on, however, without financial
     resources. In the 1980s, tribes began seeking new ways of making money to take care of their citizens. In 1988,
     Congress passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. This law allowed Native peoples to establish casinos on
     their reservations. The caveat is that tribes must "compact" with the state they reside in to secure the right to
     operate a casino. Many Indigenous people have criticized this stipulation, stating that needing to ask
     permission places them at a lower level of sovereignty than the states. According to the federal government's
     own laws, tribal reservations are federal trust lands with sovereignty on par of that of the states. Still, most
     tribes have compacted with the states they reside within, agreeing as part of the compact to cede a percentage
     of casino profits to the state to aid with funding for services such as education and road maintenance. Tribal
     casino profits have made it possible for many tribes to establish fully operational governments that offer
     services and programs for their members in areas such as health care, housing, education, and jobs.

     There have been challenges to tribes' rights to establish casinos, the most notable occurring in California
     during Arnold Schwarzenegger's tenure as governor. Governor Schwarzenegger refused for years to meet with
     Native representatives to discuss a statewide casino compact, even after voters overwhelmingly approved
     tribal casinos twice. The tribes felt that Nevada casino operators, who could lose significant revenue from the
     competition, were influencing the California government. The tribes won a lawsuit in 1999, and many tribes
     subsequently signed compacts with the state. There have been continued lawsuits against California stating
     that the compacts require too large a portion of casino profits. Still, tribes in California now have the right to
     establish casinos, and the income is greatly improving services to tribal members.

Perspectives

Indigenous peoples have undergone some five centuries of colonization. During this time, the societal
structures of the colonial states have emphasized the perspectives of non-Indigenous peoples, broadly
identified as White people. Histories have been written to benefit White people, to support their colonizing
cultures and to legitimize their takeover of vast territories from Indigenous peoples. Minority perspectives,
including Indigenous perspectives, have not been emphasized and have even been sometimes intentionally
repressed. Indigenous peoples have struggled with disempowerment in their sovereign relations with state
systems and in legal proceedings over their sovereign rights. Many Indigenous peoples still struggle to prove
that they are part of a legitimate nation. State-sponsored erasure of Native culture and history has caused
losses of and changes to tribal cultures and languages.

Beginning the later 20th century, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous scholars have noted that history has
long been presented in a way that is biased toward a White perspective. This bias has been critiqued as a form
of systemic racism. In most academic institutions, until relatively recently, most if not all professors were
White. There were few opportunities for Indigenous people to establish positions of influence over the
presentation and study of Indigenous history and culture. Native studies programs began to be developed at
various universities in the United States in the 1970s, a movement that coincided with greater opportunities
for Indigenous scholars to conduct research on their own peoples. Indigenous people are now actively working
to write their own histories and describe their cultures and philosophies from Indigenous perspectives.
Indigenous scholarship has made great strides, but there is still a hesitancy in academia to allow Indigenous
people to establish positions of authority or introduce Indigenous ways of thinking. Among the academic
disciplines, anthropology in particular has made strong progress in recognizing the value and validity of
Indigenous perspectives.

An interesting example of recent changes in approaches to Indigenous perspectives is the ongoing debate over
oral histories. For much of the 19th and 20th centuries, Indigenous "myth texts" were collected from tribes
and studied by anthropologists, linguists, and folklorists. Studies of this material typically utilized a linguistic
or philosophical framework. The texts were understood, much like Greek mythology, as supernatural stories
with a special focus on the godlike animals appearing in them, such as Coyote, Raven, and Blue Jay. Also of
interest to early scholars of such texts were their performative aspects and the metaphorical commentary they
offered about human existence. A debate emerged between some scholars such as Dell Hymes, who noted that
the texts were most valuable as "original texts" or direct ethnographic translations, and others such as Claude
Levi-Strauss, who concluded that there was no original text and every version was plagiarized from a previous
storyteller. In this authenticity debate, the texts were treated as literature, with little recognition of the
582  19 · Indigenous Anthropology

     historical events appearing in many of the stories (Hegeman 1989). This inability to see the historical value of
     these texts reflects a bias toward written material and against knowledge presented via oral tradition.

     Read about how translations of oral histories are analyzed and updated in the online journal Quartux
     (https://openstax.org/r/onlinejournal).

     David Lewis, the author of this chapter, discusses the loss of many native languages and reads translations of
     "A Kalapuya Prophecy (https://openstax.org/r/davidlewisexpanding)".

     Many of these assumptions about myth texts have changed in the past 70 years. One study of Crater Lake in
     Oregon, conducted by geologists in the 1940s, determined that the lake was on the site of what once had been a
     large volcano, Mount Mazama, known as Moy Yaina by the Indigenous people of the area. When the volcano
     exploded, the top of the mountain fell inside the cone and formed a caldera, which in time filled with water,
     resulting in Crater Lake. This event happened some 7,000 years ago. This established geological event is
     reflected in Indigenous oral traditions. A Klamath tribal oral history tells the story of two mountains, Moy Yaina
     and Mlaiksi (Mount Shasta in California), having a fight. The Klamath oral history clearly delineates a double
     volcanic event, with Moy Yaina and Mlaiksi erupting at the same time, but Moy Yaina erupted with a larger
     explosion and therefore lost the fight. Geological evidence of the explosion spoken of in this myth indicates
     that Klamath oral history does indeed reflect actual history. Similar oral histories of thousands of Indigenous
     peoples are now acknowledged to reflect many natural events, especially those that significantly changed the
     earth in some manner. Oral histories of tsunamis, Ice Age floods, volcanic eruptions, catastrophic fires, and
     other events are now acknowledged in the stories of many peoples. New understandings of the legitimacy of
     Indigenous oral histories are leading to increased research into numerous areas of Indigenous knowledge
     systems.

River and its tributaries drained the Willamette Valley and joined with the Columbia River in the vicinity of
present-day Portland. The river served as a highway of trade and travel about the valley and to the trading
center at Willamette Falls. The Kalapuya had salmon runs, but not the concentration of salmon fishery sites
seen on the Columbia River. They did have expansive prairies and oak savannas that supported a vegetable-
rich lifeway. Hunting of deer and elk was always a part of their lives, but they followed a lifestyle of camping at
root-digging sites through the summers. Root camps would be established in midsummer near a camas field.
They would dig camas for a week, then cook the camas in pit ovens while in the camp. The camas bulbs would
cook for three to four days in the underground ovens, changing to a brown color. The cooked bulbs became
sweet and were highly desired by the Kalapuya. Cooked camas would be stored in cool underground storage
spaces or hung in plank houses for wintertime use. The Kalapuya would store many types of roots and grains
in this manner and would also prepare dried salmon and meat for winter storage. In the fall, acorns and
hazelnuts could be gathered, and in marshy lakes or the Willamette slough, wapato could be gathered in great
quantities. Wapato, or Indian potato, would be stored or traded to other peoples for other foods and trade
items. The Tualatin Kalapuya, a northern Willamette Valley tribe of Kalapuya, especially had much wapato at
Wapato Lake as well as large amounts of oak savanna on the Tualatin plains. Almost all foods were gathered
and prepared in the encampments and then brought back to the villages later. Acorns would be gathered,
shelled, and left to rest in cool creeks to let the tannins leach out, then dried and ground into a meal. From this,
the Kalapuya would create a mush cooked in woven baskets. Hazelnuts would be shelled and dried on hot
rocks in the sun, then eaten on the spot or saved for later. Hazel switches would be harvested from the bushes
to make strong baskets. At other times of the year, some Kalapuya would travel into the mountains to pick
berries or gather weaving materials for making baskets. Baskets, hats, and large woven mats made from tules
and cattails for sitting or lying on would be used by the maker or traded for other items. Most weaving
materials would have to be dried for a year before being rehydrated and woven into a useful basket.

The Kalapuya were very community oriented. If other Kalapuya or neighboring tribal peoples were starving,
they would help them and feed them. Trade could happen at any time of the year, but in the winters, Kalapuya
might approach neighboring tribes to trade for additional food or wealth items they desired. Dried and smoked
salmon could be acquired from the Clackamas and Multnomah, who would prepare plenty when the salmon
ran. From the Coos, they acquired seashells. The Klickitat had exceptionally good baskets, and the Chinook
had canoes and prepared salmon as well as items from throughout the trading sphere of the Columbia River.
The Kalapuya specialized in camas and root digging and were dependent on other tribes for quantities of other
products.

LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Articulate the contributions of Vine Deloria Jr. to the critique of anthropology and the growth of Native studies
      and Native scholarship.
  · Define the practice of "othering" and explain how it has affected and continues to affect Indigenous people in
      the United States.
  · Evaluate the historic issues related to anthropologists serving as cultural experts.
  · Relate how anthropology has aided colonialism and propose some ways these practices may be reversed.

Anthropology has been criticized by numerous anthropologists and other scholars as participating in the
colonization of Indigenous societies. While settlers took land and resources from tribes and forced them to
relocate to reservations, anthropologists gathered knowledge from Indigenous peoples for their own purposes.
Another critique has focused on the right claimed by some anthropologists to speak for Indigenous peoples.
Books written by early anthropologists have been viewed as disempowering Native peoples, claiming a place of
greater legitimacy than the perspectives of Native people themselves. Some anthropologists in the late 19th
and early 20th centuries collected images of Indigenous people posed and dressed to fit a stereotypical
conception of "Indians." Edward S. Curtis was one such anthropologist and photographer. Although his photos
are rendered beautifully, they reflect his own conceptions rather than the realities of life for Native peoples at
584  19 · Indigenous Anthropology

     the time the photographs were taken. Curtis and many of his contemporaries are now critiqued for privileging
     their personal perspectives over the stark realities of Native peoples impoverished on reservations.

     FIGURE 19.8 This photograph of three Sioux chiefs, taken by Edward S. Curtis circa 1905, does not reflect actual
     cultural practices. At this time, these men were living on a Sioux reservation and would have dressed much like
     other Americans. Curtis posed these men on horses and in traditional regalia to please an American audience eager
     to see stereotypical images. (Credit: "Sioux Chiefs" by Edward S. Curtis/Library of Congress, public domain)

     Deloria's Critique

     These criticisms of anthropology gained strength in the 1960s, with several Native scholars questioning in
     particular the higher value assigned to academic scholarship than to the voices of Native peoples. These
     critiques caused many scholars to reassess the nature of anthropological research.

     Vine Deloria Jr. was a Sioux scholar who gained fame in the 1960s. Deloria openly challenged the legitimacy of
     anthropology as a discipline, criticizing anthropologists for benefiting from their research projects, whether
     through selling books or achieving tenure at their universities, while those they studied rarely received any
     benefits. Deloria developed his evaluation over a long career consisting of five decades of scholarship. One
     focus of his scholarship was the biased nature of supposedly "objective" scientific research, which he called
     "an entrenched state religion" (1997, 211). He also accused Western academics of relying on notions of Native
     peoples that were biased by stereotypes and assumptions.

     In many ways, Deloria inspired the growth of Native studies programs. His critical arguments resonated with
     tribal communities and were, and still are, an inspiration to generations of Indigenous scholars. His critiques
     have resonated with the discipline as a whole as well, resulting in adjustments and changes to anthropological
     methods and practices. There are now many more Indigenous and minority scholars in anthropology than
     ever before, in part aided by Deloria's critique. Maori scholar Linda T. Smith describes the mission of these
     scholars in this way: "Telling our stories from the past, reclaiming the past, giving testimony to the injustices
     of the past are all strategies which are commonly employed by Indigenous peoples struggling for justice. . . .
     The need to tell our stories remains the powerful imperative of a powerful form of resistance" (2021, 38).
     Indigenous specialties have been developed in most areas of anthropology, including Indigenous anthropology
     and Indigenous archaeology. Deloria's criticisms have also been influential in the creation of the fields of
     public anthropology, public archaeology, and applied anthropology, all of which seek to establish a closer
     relationship with research subjects and apply research findings to address current problems.

     The Othering of Indigenous Peoples

     Othering, discussed earlier in this text, refers to viewing those from different cultures or backgrounds as
     "other," or inherently and importantly different from oneself or one's own "type" of people. Indigenous peoples

have been particularly affected by a tendency to be viewed as other by White society. As Linda Smith writes, "A
critical aspect of the struggle for self-determination has involved questions relating to our history as
Indigenous peoples and a critique of how we, as the Other, have been represented or excluded from various
accounts" (2021, 31). The "otherness" that Smith refers to reflects tendencies both to not think about
Indigenous peoples at all and to deliberately deny Indigenous cultures an equal share of the history of their
land. Indigenous histories and contexts are viewed as something "other" than White histories and contexts
and are largely ignored. Othering happens in every conceivable context and affects almost all aspects of social
existence, including social mobility, civil rights, getting a job, and applying for grants and funding. Othering
figures strongly into sometimes subconscious determinations as to whether a person is the right type of
person for a specific position or role. Othering is a form of discrimination and racism. Othering has played a
large role in recent discussions of policing in the United States. Othering is influential in the ongoing issue of
missing and murdered Indigenous women. Many police agencies are not investigating missing Indigenous
women because they are the other--Indigenous--and the women are singled out by predators because they are
clearly Indigenous.

Cultural Experts and Authority

Anthropologists have noted the value of tribal cultural experts to their research projects. A cultural expert is
immersed in the culture of their Indigenous community and has insight into the intricacies of their
community. Cultural experts have been used by anthropologists since the beginnings of anthropology.
However, when reporting information provided by cultural experts, anthropologists have too often taken a
position of authority that somewhat disempowers these same cultural experts. Those learning about an
Indigenous society will typically turn to the published ethnographic literature on the subject. This literature
will most likely present an outsider's understanding of that society, frozen in a specific time frame and based
on a single research project. This gives the readers a warped understanding of the culture they are interested
in, only completely valid within the time frame of the study.

Cultural experts, on the other hand, adapt and modify their insights and knowledge as they age. It is now
common for researchers to seek out cultural experts to provide contemporary understandings of a culture and
society. In addition, many researchers will now form collaborations with cultural experts that assign
ownership and authorship to the cultural expert or the culture they are researching. Within this approach, the
anthropologist becomes the compiler or editor of any publications, or perhaps the lead author of a team of
authors. Many Indigenous scholars now conduct their own research, taking the roles of lead authors and
editors of studies. Tribes are also taking control of research projects, contracting with anthropologists who
agree to conduct the work with significant tribal input and review.

Indigenous Societies as Colonial Societies

Indigenous societies are in many ways colonial societies. Most Indigenous people are of mixed heritage, and
Indigenous cultures have changed in ways that make them more similar to the surrounding White
communities. As just one example, many Indigenous peoples have adopted Christianity as their primary
religion. But in most Indigenous communities, there is space for Indigenous traditions and spirituality as well.
Sometimes, White and Indigenous cultures exist parallel to one another. Such hybrid societies are often
criticized by Indigenous and non-Indigenous people as no longer being Native or Indigenous, but this criticism
reflects an understanding of what it means to be Indigenous that is frozen in time. Many people envision
Native cultures as they existed in the 19th century as being the "true" cultures, while the cultures of Native
people living in urban suburbs with automobiles and ranch-style houses are viewed as tainted or inauthentic.
Culture is not a static thing; it is dynamic, constantly changing to fit the context of the present. Native peoples
continue to maintain a cultural core that is Indigenous while they adopt the technology and trappings of
contemporary society.

Decolonizing Anthropology

In the 1970s, a movement began to "decolonize anthropology." This movement seeks to address
anthropology's role in collecting and taking ownership of Native knowledge and culture and to speak out
against anthropological analyses and products that support colonialism. One aspect of anthropological
practice that has been particularly criticized is a tendency to treat Native people purely as research subjects,
586  19 · Indigenous Anthropology

     without acknowledging their agency or their rights, such as the right to protect their buried ancestors or
     control their knowledge, stories, and even place names. As part of the "decolonizing" movement, scholars
     began developing research protocols to address these criticisms. The Indigenous perspective has begun to be
     recognized as valuable, and people from diverse backgrounds have been welcomed into the discipline.

     In the 1990s, the Southwest Oregon Research Project (SWORP) was established to collect and return to those to
     whom it pertained knowledge collected by anthropologists and other researchers. The SWORP project began
     under the leadership of George Wasson of the Coquille Indian Tribe of Oregon. Wasson worked with
     Smithsonian Institution and University of Oregon administrations to copy and collect documents pertaining to
     some 60 western Oregon tribes and return the resultant collection to the university archives. The project
     eventually hosted three trips to Washington, DC, to collect more than 200,000 pages of anthropological and
     federal documents from the National Anthropological Archives and the National Archives and Records
     Administration. The collections were then organized and hosted in the University of Oregon Special
     Collections. In 1995 and 2001, copies of these documents were given to some 17 tribes in Oregon and the
     surrounding region. This project served in a very real sense to decolonize the anthropology of the past by
     returning Indigenous knowledge to tribal peoples.

     Peoples receiving the SWORP collections have been free to access the knowledge collected from their ancestors
     over a 100-year time period, from the 1850s to 1950, and build on this knowledge with further projects to
     restore tribal culture. In one instance of a successful restoration, techniques for creating the traditional canoes
     of the Clackamas Chinook were studied in an effort to restore both the production and use of these canoes in
     the Northwest region. Scholars made use of a SWORP collection of files created by anthropologist Philip
     Drucker, which described traditional methods of construction and traditional designs. Since the 1990s, there
     has been a marked resurgence in traditional canoe construction on the Northwest Coast. Tribal nations along
     the Northwest Coast now undertake an annual canoe journey that involves hundreds of communities and
     thousands of tribal members. These developments have been aided by the preservation and return of cultural
     knowledge.

Some tribal scholars have raised concerns that many ethnographic and anthropological field notes are
untrustworthy sources because they are the products of biased research practices and may reflect
anthropologists' efforts to confirm previously conceived ideas about tribal peoples. The critics rightly note that
some anthropologists may have altered their findings to fit stereotypical notions. Tribal peoples have thus
been wary of relying solely on field notes to reconstruct cultural practices, taking care to compare the field
notes of anthropologists with elder knowledge to devise valid restoration projects for culture and language.

The existence of field notes themselves is somewhat controversial among Native communities. Some
Indigenous people have criticized the act of writing down Indigenous stories, which were normally oral
literatures. This same criticism calls into question the legitimacy of all field notes collected from peoples who
rely on oral histories. Some Indigenous scholars thus refuse to use any ethnographic notes, viewing them as
biased documents. However, another perspective is that many of these field notes were collected from tribal
cultural experts who willingly participated in the collection of their stories and knowledge. Many of these
cultural experts were elders in their communities who wanted to save their culture and language, not passive
participants unaware of the outcomes of their work with anthropologists. From this perspective, these elders
knew what they were doing and were aware that they may hold the last remaining knowledge of certain
cultural practices or languages; therefore, their work and contributions need to be respected by all scholars
today.

        PROFILES IN ANTHROPOLOGY

Beatrice Medicine (Sihasapa and Minneconjou Lakota)
1923-2005

Personal History: David Lewis recollects: I had an opportunity to meet Dr. Beatrice Medicine
(https://openstax.org/r/appliedanthro) when she visited the University of Oregon in the early 2000s. Medicine
gave numerous presentations about her work. The most impactful presentation was her study of Scandinavian
revivalists who were recreating Native American traditions in Europe and Russia. She told stories of how the
Lakota community met with these revivalists and decided to help them practice the culture correctly. What
they had been practicing emulated Native cultures as stereotyped in Hollywood films, including a US cavalry
588  19 · Indigenous Anthropology

     charge and a tom-tom drumbeat. This was clearly inaccurate, and the Lakota decided that if the revivalists
     really wanted to represent Lakota culture, they should help them do it correctly. Medicine and other Lakota
     culture bearers then took on the responsibility of going to Europe to meet some of these groups and teach
     them the correct culture.

     Additionally, Medicine told stories of how anthropologists who came to reservations in the 19th century were
     sometimes fooled by Native collaborators. She noted that some of the stories collected were made up on the
     spot by men who realized that they would be paid for more stories. So, they created stories of history and
     events for the anthropologists, earned a few extra dollars, and later made fun of the anthropologists for not
     really knowing the culture. Some of these stories were published in anthropologists' language texts and are
     now part of the legacy of the discipline. Much of the legacy of oral histories involves tribal mistrust of the
     products of anthropologists, considered to be inaccurate and biased--a feeling supported in part by this story.
     But Medicine's discerning of the reason behind the creation of new stories provides additional contexts that
     then partly refute the distrust of anthropologists once the intentions of the Native collaborators are known.
     The stories themselves are not worthless to tribal people who study them today, and they teach scholars about
     tribal peoples' ingenuity and humor.

     Medicine's storytelling was very powerful. She did not follow the typical narrative that presented anthropology
     as a handmaiden of colonialism, instead showing how she, as an anthropologist, could help people understand
     others and apply anthropology to work out problems in the world. Medicine's series of talks at the University of
     Oregon was inspiring to Native scholars and provided examples of how we could use anthropology to help our
     peoples when we returned to our Native communities, as many will.

     Area of Anthropology: Dr. Beatrice Medicine was a scholar, anthropologist, and educator known for her work
     in the fields of Indigenous languages and cultures, applied anthropology, gender studies, and Native history.
     She was born on the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota and spent years teaching, traveling, and
     working in anthropology throughout the world before returning to Standing Rock to retire. In her final years
     she helped build an elementary school at the reservation.

     Accomplishments in the Field: Medicine was able to shift seamlessly and effectively between her roles as a
     Native person and an anthropologist. She had a lot of faith that anthropology could understand and recover
     from the effects of our colonial histories. Medicine worked to promote applied anthropology as a way for the
     discipline to contribute in positive ways to Native societies. She inspired many young Native scholars and
     anthropologists to use anthropology to help Native peoples. As one of the few Native and women
     anthropologists of her time, she faced and overcame many challenges posed by the paternalistic White men in
     the discipline.

     Importance of Her Work: For her work, Medicine earned numerous awards, including a Distinguished Service
     Award from the American Anthropological Association (1991), the Bronislaw Malinowski Award from the
     Society for Applied Anthropology (1996), and the George and Louise Spindler Award for education in
     anthropology from the American Anthropological Association (2005). The Applied Anthropology Association
     established a travel award in her name, and her life's work was featured in a 2015 panel at the American
     Anthropological Association's annual meeting.

     Medicine's most influential book is Learning to Be an Anthropologist and Remaining "Native", published by
     the University of Illinois Press in 2001.

Treaties and Removal

In the mid-19th century, the United States federal government shifted its approach toward purchasing tribal
lands rather than conquering Indigenous nations. Many Native societies had already suffered greatly due to
White settlement and were ready to sign treaties that would guarantee them protection on federal Indian
reservations. Population loss caused by epidemic disease also played a role in many tribes' decisions to sign
treaties with the federal government. Those who signed treaties received payment for lands, money for
schools, and support in establishing Western farming practices in addition to land allotments on a reservation
where federal authorities were to guarantee their safety.

As White settlement expanded into the western United States, Indigenous peoples both on and off federal
reservations were subject to waves of removal from their lands. Areas set aside for reservations that had once
seemed undesirably remote for White settlement became increasingly desirable as the White population grew.
In the 1830s, tribal peoples living on reservations east of the Mississippi River were forced to move to what is
now Oklahoma, then called Indian Territory. The tribes were promised that they would be able to keep their
new reservation lands in perpetuity. However, when political currents changed, largely due to the pressures of
European immigrants moving westward who desired land for settlement, the land formerly designated Indian
Territory was opened to White settlement, and reservations diminished.

The most famous Native removal was the Cherokee Trail of Tears in 1838. After President Andrew Jackson
signed the Indian Removal Act in 1830, the US Army forced an estimated 16,000 Cherokee then living in the
southeast United States to walk to Indian Territory. An estimated 5,000 of these people died on the trail. The
Cherokee Trail of Tears was not the only removal. Each time the United States expanded its borders into Indian
Territory, tribes were forced to move to smaller reservations with less desirable, resource-poor lands. The
Choctaw were removed from Florida to Oklahoma in 1831, and the Creek were removed in 1836, leading to an
estimated 3,500 of their 15,000 people dying. Twenty years later, the United States assumed sole title to the
lands of the Oregon Territory and removed 4,000 Native people from some 60 different tribes onto two
reservations, the Coast and Grand Ronde Reservations. During the western Oregon "Trails of Tears," members
of tribes then living on the temporary Table Rock and Umpqua Reservations were forced to walk more than
300 miles in the dead of winter to the Coast and Grand Ronde Reservations, with many dying from exposure.
Once at the Coast and Grand Ronde Reservations, the tribes were made to live with many other tribes from five
different language families and to join as one tribe on the reservations.

     Administration, Public Domain)

     In all parts of the United States, life on the reservations was very challenging. Native peoples had to build their
     own houses and establish means of producing food and other necessities with limited resources. Federal aid,
     although guaranteed in the treaties, was slow to arrive and sometimes lost in transit or simply missing. For the
     first 20 years of the Grand Ronde Reservation, residents lived in poverty with inconsistent food and health care
     and poorly planned schools. On Oregon reservations, the tribal peoples did not receive their treaty rights of
     individual plots of farmland until at least 1873. While the government had guaranteed food, by 1860, it was
     clear that federal officials could not be counted on for regular food shipments. Thousands of Native people
     died at early ages in the first two decades due to malnutrition and newly introduced diseases. Similar stories
     can be told for all tribes in the United States. Problems were also caused by untrained, unqualified, and
     corrupt government officials who stole food, money, and supplies.

     Domestic Dependent Nations

     The legal status of Native nations was greatly influenced by several paternalistic rulings by the US Supreme
     Court in the 1830s. Three rulings known as the Marshall court trilogy (Johnson v. M'Intosh, 1823; Cherokee
     Nation v. Georgia, 1831; Worcester v. Georgia, 1832) determined that tribal peoples were domestic sovereign
     nations within the United States and dependent on the federal government to guarantee their sovereignty.
     These rulings meant that all reservations were "federal lands," not part of the states, with the federal
     government as the administrator. Native rights, therefore, must be given through federal authorities or named
     in treaties with the federal government.

     This state of dependency has caused much consternation among Native peoples ever since. As "domestic
     dependent nations," many aspects of tribal societies--including management of money, land, education,
     health care, and other programs--have been administered by the federal government. Beyond the question of
     the appropriateness of this arrangement, there have been innumerable documented cases of Native peoples
     not receiving the services or funds they were promised. Between 1910 and the 1980s, Native peoples filed
     hundreds of civil cases against the federal government for mismanagement of service, land, and money. By the

19.3 · Indigenous Agency and Rights                                                                                     591

1940s, there were so many cases that the federal government established a special jurisdictional court, the
Indian Claims Commission, to deal with the volume of lawsuits. Under the Indian Claims Commission, many
cases were consolidated to make the process more efficient. Originally planned to exist for 10 years, the court
was extended into the 1970s, as hundreds of cases had been filed and it was taking decades to decide many of
them. The Klamath tribe, for example, filed seven Indian Claims lawsuits for mismanagement of the money
they earned through logging operations. The Klamath cases were combined and decided in the 1950s, with
some payouts from their lawsuits extending into the 1960s. The Indian Claims Commission ended in 1978,
having cleared 546 dockets and named 342 awards totaling $818,172,606.64.

One example of a successful Indian Claims case (number K-344) involved California tribal members of groups
called the Mission Indians and other tribes from Northern California. These tribes had signed 18 treaties with
the federal government in 1851. The treaties were never ratified, and as such, the tribes were never paid for
their lands. After the treaties were found hidden in the vast record collections of the National Archives in 1905,
the California tribes began working on a case for payment for the lands, for which they filed suit in 1928. The
first case was not decided until 1942, with the court declaring that "the Indians of California consist of
wandering bands, tribes, and small groups, who had been roving over the same territory during the period
under the Spanish and Mexican ownership, before the [1848] treaty between Mexico and the United States
whereby California was acquired by the United States" (Indians of California ex rel. U. S. Webb v. United States,
98 Ct. Cl. 583, 1942) This decision meant that the tribes were determined not to have a case for the return of
lands and could only ask for cash payments. A second case was decided in 1964. Payments from both cases did
not come until 1969, when the court gave the tribes 47 cents per acre for the 64 million acres of California
lands they had once occupied, a total of $29.1 million. Court awards were subject to political maneuvering and
arbitration within the House of Representatives over how much the tribes would actually receive. In the case of
K-344, the award amount was based on the value of the lands in 1851, which had skyrocketed in value over the
more than a century that had passed. Many tribal members were very upset by the paltry sum awarded for the
wealthy lands of California.

Water, Fishing, and Agency

became a particular source of conflict between Indigenous and White people in the northwestern United States in
the 1960s. (credit: "Fish-Weir across Trinity River--Hupa" by Edward S. Curtis, Smithsonian Institution/flickr, Public
Domain)

From the 1960s to the 1980s, an issue of particular concern to the tribes of the northwestern part of the United
States was fishing rights. The "fishing wars" were a series of political and legal battles over whether Indigenous
peoples had the right to fish in their usual and accustomed places, as promised in numerous treaties.
592  19 · Indigenous Anthropology

     Following the Belloni (Sohappy v. Smith/United States v. Oregon, 1969) and Boldt (United States v. Washington,
     1974) court decisions, the tribes of Washington State, including those that had been terminated and not yet
     restored, maintained their rights to fish in their usual and accustomed ways--and their right to half the catch
     in the state of Washington.

     These decisions affirmed tribal sovereignty rights promised in ratified treaties but had the negative
     consequence of causing delays in the restoration of other tribes from termination. Many sport fishermen's
     organizations feared that an increase in restored tribes would impact fishing for non-Natives. Both the Siletz
     and Grand Ronde tribes experienced delays related to fears about fishing in their federal restorations in the
     1970s and 1980s. Ultimately, both tribes were forced to give up fishing and hunting rights to become federally
     restored. Ironically, neither the Grand Ronde nor the Siletz have fishing or hunting rights in their ratified
     treaties. Both tribes concluded that restoration of the tribal governments was more important than holding out
     for fishing and hunting rights.

     FIGURE 19.13 Two Native men dip-net fishing at Celilo Falls on the Columbia River, circa 1950. Some tribes were
     forced to give up the right to fish in their traditional locations in return for the restoration of their tribal status.

     Archives/flickr, Public Domain)
     The Klamath tribe of Oregon was terminated in the 1950s, along with tribes in California, including the Karuk
     and Yurok, all of whom traditionally relied on fish from the Klamath River. In the 1970s and 1980s, these tribes
     were restored by the US federal government with their rights intact. The Klamath tribe of Oregon is the only
     tribe on the river with a ratified treaty that guaranteed fishing rights. During the termination period, the
     federal government had built numerous dams and water reclamation projects on the river and given away
     water resources to farmers and ranchers in the area. Dams such as the Shasta Dam had destroyed many
     salmon runs, and the water giveaways had taken much-needed in-stream flows out of the river, making the
     river warmer and less environmentally friendly to fish. When local tribes were restored, they began
     demanding rights to fish the river again. These rights were decided in a series of court decisions determining
     that the Klamath tribe's water rights preceded those of farmers and municipalities, meaning that their rights to
     in-stream flows needed to be upheld. Numerous projects are underway to eliminate the dams on the Klamath
     River and return it to its original state.

Tribes with fishing rights in their treaties are now encroaching on the territories of tribes without such rights,
leading to legal and political maneuvering between tribes. In Oregon, the Grand Ronde tribe was forced to
purchase land at a key fishing location, Willamette Falls, and had to sidestep federal permissions, working with
the state to gain "ceremonial" rights. Ultimately, the intertribal conflicts are caused by tribal adherence to
federal bureaucratic processes that rely on legal or political channels to resolve problem rather than
traditional tribal methods that bring people to the table to form agreements under traditional protocols.

Culture and Language

Native languages are the most threatened part of the cultures of Native peoples. Many tribes now have only a
handful of people who fluently speak the tribe's language. Of the estimated 10,000 languages once spoken
worldwide, at least half have now gone extinct with no speakers, and there are 3,018 Indigenous languages
spoken worldwide that are today endangered. One assessment of the 115 Indigenous languages currently
spoken in the United State rates two as healthy, 34 as in danger, and 79 likely to go extinct within a generation
(Nagle 2019). The rate and severity of language loss is connected to the remaining population of the tribe,
whether the tribe has a functioning cultural center, and whether the language continues to be spoken in the
households of tribal members. In large part, tribal people of the United States are becoming English-only
speakers (Crawford 1995).

Language recovery and revitalization have become a focus of many Indigenous peoples. Many tribal members
consider knowledge of their language to be the true determinant of tribal identity. Complex understandings of
philosophies and lifeways are embedded in language. In addition, tribes believe that their ancestors' spirits
visit members of the tribe to speak with and advise them, and if a person does not know the language, they will
not be able to understand them. Tribes are now working to restore, preserve, stabilize, and teach their
languages to the next generations to preserve their knowledge and cultural identities. The University of
California, Berkeley, developed a master-apprentice program that is helping many Indigenous groups develop
more language speakers by partnering fluent speakers with young tribal members. Even with this type of
training, it can take years to learn to fluently speak the language. Another approach is the language immersion
program, inspired by Hawaiian and Maori educational models. The immersion model places students in
immersive classrooms for a period of several years, in which only the Native language is spoken. Evening
classes are also offered for adult learners.

In addition to efforts to restore Native languages, many tribes and urban tribal organizations offer cultural
education classes to teach traditional skills. Art and craft classes are quite popular. Classes offered by Native
594  19 · Indigenous Anthropology

     instructors teach traditional techniques for making bows and arrows, weaving baskets, drawing in traditional
     styles, beading, and making moccasins, among others. History is another area that is receiving some attention.
     As just one example, the Cherokee Nation has instituted a history program for tribal members and tribal
     government staff so that all people working with and for the tribe have a shared understanding of history.
     Finally, Native events and celebrations typically draw substantial crowds. Many tribes and organizations host
     events such as powwows and tribal dances annually. These events are free to attend and present many
     different styles of dance and drum music, along with the opportunity to shop for Native arts and crafts.
     Powwows are usually multi-tribal events, in part reflecting the origin of these events in intertribal boarding
     schools.

     Tribal cultures and languages are a deep part of Native identity. There was a time in the United States when
     Native people were heavily exposed to assimilation pressures. During this time, many Native people stopped
     identifying as Native and did not teach their language or culture to their children or grandchildren. Acceptance
     of Native peoples has now shifted in most regions of the United States, and Indigenous peoples do not
     experience as much overt racism as they have in the past, although there are still some areas in the United
     States--many on the borders of tribal reservations--where overt racism against Indigenous peoples persists
     (Ashley 2015). Many of the descendants of once reservation-bound tribes are now actively seeking to
     reassociate themselves with their tribal cultures, recognizing this part of their heritage as a central part of
     their identity.

     Traditional Material Culture

     The traditional material cultures of Indigenous peoples showcase an impressive array of styles and skills.
     Native art was heavily collected by individuals and museums in the 19th century, when there were fears that
     Indigenous cultures were disappearing. Native art remains popular today. While many Indigenous artists
     continue to work in traditional styles, some are also incorporating contemporary styles and techniques. Native
     material cultures embed much cultural philosophy. As anthropologist and museum director Nancy Parezo
     says, "To anthropologists, Native American/First Nation arts are windows to understanding other cultures and
     societies. They can be specimens used to support evolutionary theories or explain the maker's cultural
     concepts of beauty--to show universal concepts and cultural differences, shared meanings, and modes of
     communication" (1990, 12).

be appreciated as both historic and spiritual statements. The petroglyph site in Cascadia Cave, near Sweet
Home, Oregon, has hundreds of carvings. The most easily recognizable are the bear paws on the wall of the
cave. There are also numerous lines, zigzags, and holes carved out of the cave wall. Willamette Forest Service
archaeologist Tony Farque noted that people had long thought that the place was used to gain "bear power" for
Native shamans. However, when one steps back, it is apparent that the decorated area of the wall is bordered
by a large relief of a salmon, with one hole as its eye and the carved lines creating gills. The cave is now
understood as a site where Indigenous peoples--Kalapuya, Molala, and other tribes in the region--sought to
gain power when fishing in the nearby South Fork Santiam River, where salmon were known to spawn.

Cultural sites such as Cascadia Cave are in danger of being destroyed by too much attention from
archaeologists and the public. For more than a century, Cascadia Cave has been visited by thousands of
tourists who have touched the walls, dug in the ground in search of artifacts, taken rubbings of the carvings,
and sometimes even carved their initials or painted over petroglyphs to make them stand out more. All these
activities degrade the site. Early archaeologists did much the same, digging into the ground and moving many
yards of dirt, which has caused rainfall to pool at the walls of the cave. The pooling moisture accelerates the
growth of mosses and other plants, which also degrade the walls of the cave. Digging also destroys the
archaeological context of the site. It is important to note that in many countries, including the United States, it
is illegal to dig up and remove archaeological materials. Those who continue to dig up materials for private
collection or for sale are conducting illegal activities. Many of the sites illegally dug are cemetery sites,
containing the remains of people and cultural artifacts that are related to descendant tribal populations today.

distinct, but this partially destroys the context of the petroglyphs. Additional petroglyphs are all over this portion of
the wall. (credit: 46percent/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)

Weaving arts are another significant aspect of material culture for many Indigenous peoples. Basketry
techniques were and still are used to construct vessels used for regular household and resource-gathering
activities. Indigenous groups developed various techniques for weaving, such as right twist, left twist, overlay,
and false embroidery. These techniques result in decorative styles unique to individual tribes. Weaving
techniques make use of many natural materials. Large objects such as mats were typically made with cattail
and tule, while baskets could be made from a wide variety of materials, including juncus, hazel branches, cedar
bark, bear grass, spruce roots, willow, and maidenhair fern. Some materials were chosen for their stability and
durability, others for their flexibility, and still others for their color and luster. Dyeing weaving materials
created complex color variations. Baskets were even used for cooking. The technique for boiling water in a
basket is similar across many cultures: the basket would be tightly woven, normally with a double weave, and
then filled with water. The fibers of the basket and the tight weave created a watertight exterior; additionally,
some traditions coated the fibers with grease or pitch. Hot rocks, heated in a fire, would be placed in the basket
596  19 · Indigenous Anthropology

     to make the contained liquid boil. In this manner, food could be cooked without destroying the basket.

     Many tribes now offer classes to teach people the basic techniques and styles particular to their tribal heritage.
     The Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde offer classes in carving, weaving arts, beading, regalia making, drum
     making, and other arts associated with the 27 tribes that make up the confederation. Arts and crafts are
     intermixed with education about Native philosophy, spirituality, and language. Some people attend classes for
     years to master the art style they enjoy, and tribal members may apprentice with master artisans to learn more
     advanced techniques. Many artisans are creating works of art that are inspired by deep feelings of Native
     identity, using their art to define themselves and their people within the contexts of both the present and the
     past. Several artists have become professionals and are producing work for galleries, exhibits, exterior
     monuments, and contracted sales. The artists employ traditional arts as well as contemporary sculptures and
     artistic traditions such as painting, drawing, and illustration. Many traditional three-dimensional artworks,
     such as cedar statues, are now rendered in metal, stone, or even glass so that they are more durable and can
     survive the rigors of contemporary tourism.

     Indigenous Philosophy and Worldviews

     A shared element of Indigenous philosophy across various cultures is the conception of humans existing in
     relationship to the world around them. Native peoples believe they are deeply connected to the natural world;
     animals are viewed as relatives, and plants, rocks, and mountains are all understood to have animistic spirits.
     Rivers, lakes, and even the seasons themselves are also understood as having spirits. Many Native American
     peoples believe that animals were once their brothers and sisters. It is believed that from the actions of some of
     the godlike animals, such as Coyote, Beaver, and Raven, much of the world was made. Many Native peoples
     gain shamanic powers by forming close relationships with certain animals. These powers might include the
     ability to heal, to poison, to call salmon, to call weather, to fish, or to communicate with animals. Typically,
     these abilities are gained through ceremonies designed to familiarize people with their spirit helpers at a
     young age. Ceremonies differ, but a common format involves a youth going off by themselves into a special
     natural area--such as a forest, hilltop, or mountain cave--and fasting and meditating until they hear their
     helper spirit. In this manner, many Native peoples are connected to spiritual powers; the most powerful may
     become a shaman or spiritual leader of their tribe. Details of these types of ceremonies are kept secret within
     each tribe. One reason for this secrecy is a concern that non-Native people might attempt the same
     ceremonies without guidance and perhaps hurt themselves or the world around them in the process.

     Native philosophy is understood to be embodied in the elders of the tribes. By living a full life within their
     particular cultural context, tribal elders gain wisdom about their people and culture. Many maintain tribal
     languages, too. Elders are honored and supported by younger members of their societies, who in turn learn
     about tribal traditions and philosophies from the elders. Elders come to their position partly through age, but
     normally they are recognized by their tribes when they exhibit great wisdom. Certain elders may have greater
     status than others depending on how well versed they are in their traditions and how respected they are by the

community.

Native philosophy can also be gleaned through the study of oral histories. Many oral histories relate to subjects
such as how the world was formed, how humans relate to animals, and how to acquire food, offering moral and
ethical lessons. Oral histories may also be records of historic events, such as when the tribe was removed to a
reservation, when many people died from disease, when a tsunami forced the people to escape to a mountain,
when the land was changed by geological activity, or when there was a war. Oral histories are often full of
metaphors and symbols of powerful spiritual forces that caused the event. One example is the story told by the
Wasco people of when Coyote and Wishpoosh (Beaver) fought on the Columbia River and created the Columbia
Gorge. This oral history reflects Native explanations of a series of flood events that occurred when rushing
floodwaters carved out the Columbia Gorge in Oregon. The Missoula floods occurred from 18,000 to 15,000
years ago during the large Ice Age. The floods, perhaps as many as 90 of them, are noted by geologists to have
been caused by the breaking of glacial ice dams behind which was Lake Missoula. During fluctuations in the
warming period, the ice dams burst, and millions of hectares of water from the glacial lake flooded down the
Columbia to carve out the Columbia River Gorge. The dams would refreeze and burst again, perhaps hundreds
of times, to scour the lands east of the Columbia of topsoil and carve out the gorge. The topsoil would be
deposited in the Willamette Valley (Allen, Burns, and Burns 2009). It is remarkable that Native peoples
maintained oral histories documenting this event for at least 15,000 years. The Wasco oral history of
Wishpoosh and Coyote is only one such story of this event. All tribes in the region have a story that mentions a
flood of this magnitude.

Indigenous worldviews are embedded in ceremonies as well. The Tolowa Nation of Northern California
practices Nee-dash, their world renewal ceremony, also called the Feather Dance, on the winter and summer
solstices. This ceremony lasts as long as 10 days and is meant to showcase the wealth of the tribe. Dancers,
both men and women, wear regalia and dance continuously for the 10 days of the ceremony. Each day, they
increase the number of necklaces they wear and the wealth displayed in their regalia. When the dancers
become "wealthier," it is a metaphor for the growth of food, understood as the wealth of the land, that begins in
the spring of each year. Dancers move in a semicircle, men on one side and women on the other, as a leader
sings Native ceremonial songs and stamps out a beat on the hard-packed earthen floor with a tall stamper
stick. Dancers take turns "coming out" and dancing, individually or in twos, threes, or larger groups,
understood to be displaying their ceremonial power in hunting, fishing, or gathering. An audience of tribal
people is normally situated around the benches of the dance house, men on one side and women on the other.
The dances are meant to renew the earth to ensure strong returns of seasonal fish runs, good hunting
opportunities, and rich yields of acorns or berries. The ceremony honors the land, the animals, and the plants

     that sustain the people. This ceremony establishes a spiritual relationship in which people are not separate
     from nature but a part of it, with the responsibility to act as stewards of its great wealth.

     acknowledging the responsibility to act as stewards of its great wealth. (credit: David G. Lewis, Public Domain)

     Most Indigenous cultures have ceremonies similar to this, centered on events such as the first salmon catch,
     the first hunt, or the first gathering of any important food. First salmon ceremonies for the Takelma peoples of
     the Rogue River Valley in Oregon involve a young man taking the bones of the first salmon caught that year
     down to the bottom of the Rogue River. These ceremonies are an important way for Native peoples to
     acknowledge and recommit themselves to a responsibility to steward the natural world in order to sustain its
     health and vibrancy so that the people who rely on it may thrive into the future.

     Indigenous Critique: Rights, Activism, Appropriation, and Stereotypes

     In the contemporary era, the publications of academics have had a great deal of influence on how tribes have
     been treated by the federal government and other groups. A 1997 essay, titled "Anthropology and the Making
     of Chumash Tradition," included the authors' opinion that the Coast Chumash tribe were descendants of
     Mexican people, and not Native people of North America at all (Haley and Wilcoxon 1997). The essay relied in
     part on rumors that were later refuted as unproven by archaeologist Jon Erlandson (1998). These claims, even
     disproven, aided other Native peoples in accusing the Coast Chumash of not being Native, resulting in many
     social and political problems for the community. Scholarly publications such as these can affect the ability of
     tribal nations in the United States to gain federal recognition status because all applicants for federal
     recognition must establish continuous culture and governance. Public and scholarly opinions can have a huge
     effect on whether tribes get recognized and are able to restore their culture and sovereignty after centuries of
     colonization.

     Responses to the disempowering effects of colonialism have sometimes been overtly political. In the 1960s, the
     American Indian Movement (AIM) took actions to bolster tribal sovereignty throughout the United States. AIM
     was involved with several highly public activities, including an occupation at Mount Rushmore in 1971 in
     protest over the illegal taking of Sioux lands and the carving of presidents' faces in a mountain sacred to the
     Sioux. AIM also participated in the occupation of Wounded Knee in 1973, the site of a historic battleground, in
     protest over the failure to impeach Oglala Sioux president Richard Wilson; the resulting standoff with federal
     law enforcement lasted 71 days. Public awareness of the federal government's oppression of Native peoples
     grew when a large military force was deployed during a second occupation of Wounded Knee, an event called
     Wounded Knee 2. AIM's work was part of a larger civil rights movement that involved Black, Latina/Latino, and
     women activists as well as the growing anti-Vietnam War movement. This larger movement created political
     shifts in the United States that benefited Native communities (Johansen 2013).

Beginning in the 1970s, several laws were passed by Congress to empower tribes. These included policies
pertaining to education (Indian Education Act, 1972), child foster care (Indian Child Welfare Act, 1978), college
education (Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities Assistance Act, 1978), freedom of religion (American
Indian Religious Freedom Act, 1978), and rights to archaeological sites and remains (Archaeological Resources
Protection Act, 1979, and Native American Graves and Repatriation Act, 1990). This period also saw the end of
the national policy of termination and a turn toward allowing tribes that had been terminated to be restored,
with self-determination becoming standard federal policy.

Stereotypes

Native peoples have also become vocal in confronting stereotypes about them. The first Western stereotypes of
Native peoples in North American depicted them in primitivist terms as noble savages, living in harmony with
nature, with no notions of laws, time, or money. Implicit in this view was the idea that Indigenous peoples were
not fully civilized and did not deserve the same rights as White, Christian people. Their land could thus be
taken away. This stereotype has been described by writer Albert Memmi "as a series of negations: they were
not fully human, they were not civilized enough to have systems, they were not literate, their languages and
modes of thought were inadequate" (Smith 2021, 31). Throughout the history of the United States, these
stereotypes have been used to progressively take more and more away from Native peoples. When
reservations were first established, they were said to be permanent homes, but as White settlers began to see
these lands as attractive places, the notion was again raised that Native peoples were not using the land
appropriately.

     FIGURE 19.21 Chief Joseph of the Nez Percé tribe (Niimiipuu), pictured with a stoic "noble savage" look. The
     stereotype of Indigenous people as "noble savages" has been used as justification for taking their land away from
     them. (credit: "Joseph--Nez Percé" by Edward S. Curtis/Library of Congress, Public Domain)

     Additional stereotypes originated with early anthropological research. Notions that Native peoples could not
     digest alcohol, were lazy and would not work, were not intelligent enough to become civilized, or were dying off
     as a population because they did not have a civilized culture have all been perpetuated by scholars who
     embraced social evolutionary theories about human societies. The idea that societies and civilizations existed
     in competition with one another, and that Native peoples were not competitive because they were savages or
     barbarians, was inspired by Lewis Henry Morgan's proposal of a hierarchy of civilizations. These ideas have
     been heavily refuted, but the stereotypes persist and continue to affect Native peoples in prejudicial ways.

     Recently, the issue of Indian mascots has received a lot of attention. In the early 20th century, private and
     professional sports teams and franchises begin to name their athletic teams after Native groups or some
     characteristic words referring to Native peoples. Common names include the Warriors, Chiefs, Indians, Reds,
     Redskins, and Braves. Some of these names may have been chosen to honor the strength and resilience of
     people who had survived centuries of war with colonizing peoples. Regardless of the original intention, as time
     went on, fans of many of these teams developed practices that disparaged Indigenous peoples. Many mascots
     were cartoonish or savage caricatures. These mascots may have been the only exposure many American
     people had to Native peoples, at a time when there was no valid education about Native peoples offered in
     public schools.

     The first significant challenge to the use of such mascots was led by Charlene Teters, a student at the
     University of Illinois, against the university's mascot, Chief Illiniwek, in the 1980s. Teters criticized various
     aspects of the chief's presentation, including the headdress, regalia, and dance style, the latter of which was
     the invention of students who took the role of mascot each year. The campaign against this mascot continued
     for some 20 years, with many fans and alumni of the university countering that the mascot was meant to honor
     the Illiniwek people. The mascot was finally dropped by the university in 2007.

     Much opposition to mascots is connected not to the use of the figure itself but to the behavior of fans. Practices
     such as dressing in red paint, wearing outfits of fake feathers and fake headdresses, and using arm motions
     such as the "tomahawk chop" to show team spirit have offended Native groups. Names might also carry

meanings not fully understood by fans. Controversy around the Washington Redskins' name and mascot lasted
for some 30 years. Many fans weren't aware that the term redskins was used in states such as California and
Oregon to refer to Native scalps collected by White American militia members. These scalps, or redskins, could
be returned to the state government for a bounty. At certain periods in U.S. history, hundreds of Native people
were killed, and whole villages sometimes destroyed, by militia seeking redskins to collect these bounties. In
2020, the Washington Redskins dropped the name, becoming known as the Washington Football Team until a
replacement name was chosen. Similarly, in 2019, the Cleveland Indians dopped its "Chief Wahoo" mascot,
and in 2021, the team changed its name to the Cleveland Guardians.

In some cases, tribal nations have collaborated with universities to develop more respectful mascot images.
The University of Utah has collaborated with the Ute tribe in designing its mascot image featuring a feather,
and Florida State University has worked with the Seminole tribe to develop its Appaloosa horse rider and spear
imagery. There remains a political divide in the debate about mascots, with some Native activists believing
there should be no Indian mascots, while others think that sovereign tribal nations, as sovereign governments,
should be able to decide how their people are characterized by organized athletic organizations.

19.4 Applied and Public Anthropology and Indigenous Peoples

LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
  · Explain how tribal cultures are using anthropology to secure rights to sites of cultural significance.
  · Describe how anthropologists and Native scholars aid Indigenous peoples using anthropology.
  · Discuss how Indigenous peoples create networks to help one another.

Applied anthropology, which applies anthropological research and methods to contemporary problems,
addresses much of the critique of anthropology offered by Vine Deloria Jr. and others. Many Indigenous
peoples have become active participants in applied anthropological research, both seeking out and
collaborating with anthropologists to work on projects that they themselves have defined. Many tribes now
take a directive approach with researchers, offering contracts and funding for anthropologists who will work
on issues that the tribes think are important. As tribes develop their reservation infrastructure, many have
established archaeology programs to protect their rights to sites of importance. Many have asked scientists to
create GIS (geographic information system) products, which feature layers depicting various resources and
characteristics on a map, to manage their lands and help them effectively consult with states, the federal
government, and private agencies. The layering of information in the GIS can create deeply immersive maps
and models that include information about types of vegetation, the environmental history of lands, changes to
lands, and any other information than can be captured and mapped. Layered information can be activated or
removed from a map to meet specific aims. Tribes can now reference both the information available through
scholarly studies and information about their lands and peoples from their own internal studies, which they do
not typically share outside of the tribe. In many ways, tribes are now more knowledgeable about the
archaeology of their territory than most institutions and are making plans to protect and preserve cultural
sites and resources.

Public anthropologists aim to engage with communities and involve the general public in their work as much
as possible. In doing so, they empower communities to address their own problems. Many public
anthropologists publish their research in readily accessible formats, such as newspapers and popular
magazines. The Internet offers many ways for public anthropologists to reach a broader audience. Blogs and
digital journals make it possible for anthropologists to make information broadly available in order to benefit
the greatest number of people.

The author of this chapter, David Lewis, describes his own efforts to make anthropological research more
readily available:

I produce a blog, the Quartux Journal (https://openstax.org/r/QuartuxJournal), which I began in 2014. At that
time, I was engaged in a decade-long series of studies of the tribal peoples of western Oregon. Years of research
had given me much to write about. The blog offered a means of releasing that information quickly and without
charge to a broad group of colleagues and the public who desired information about Native peoples. Many of

     my readers are educators seeking content for high school or college classes they are teaching about Native
     peoples. This blog began at a time when Native groups and the state of Oregon were developing Native
     curricula for public schools, and it has become an essential curriculum tool for educators in the region.
     Educators have written back about the lack of resources and the great aid the blog has offered in filling their
     need for facts about the tribes of Oregon. The blog has now grown to more than 450 essays about tribal peoples
     throughout western Oregon and beyond. Its essays are easily read in about 10 minutes and are not jargon
     laden. There are currently more than 1,000 subscribers to this blog. The essays have inspired additional
     research on Native peoples' history and has lent Native contextual details to local studies of the histories of
     Oregon.

             MINI-FIELDWORK ACTIVITY

     Research Activity: Native American Peoples

     Conduct research into Edward S. Curtis's photographs of Native North American peoples. The majority of his
     images are online in the Library of Congress Edward S. Curtis Collection (https://openstax.org/r/
     LibraryofCongress).

     After picking at least one image, research the circumstances under which Curtis took the photograph. Curtis
     himself offers clues to his subject and location, sometimes even identifying his subjects by name. Then,
     research the tribe the subject(s) was or were a part of, including where the tribe was living at the time the
     photo was taken and their socioeconomic situation. Expect to conduct research to locate the correct historic
     sources. Finally, compare the culture portrayed in the photo and noted by Curtis's information with your
     research findings. Note differences and ways in which Curtis may have altered the context.

     One reference for research is the video Edward Curtis: Photographing the North American Indian
     (https://openstax.org/r/EdwardCurtis), available from the Smithsonian Institution.

     Present your research in a formal report of 3-5 pages, including full references and the image being
     researched.

CHAPTER OUTLINE
20.1 Our Challenging World Today
20.2 Why Anthropology Matters
20.3 What Anthropologists Can Do
INTRODUCTION In "Waddling In," a provocative essay published in 1985, interpretive anthropologist Clifford
Geertz proposed that among the various academic disciplines, anthropology was uniquely capable of leading
into the future. He pointed out the fundamental changes anthropology faced as it headed into the 21st
century--changes in its traditional subject focus, its traditional field sites, and its wide, holistic perspective,
which Geertz referred to as "walking barefoot through the Whole of Culture" (1985, 623):

      Pulled in opposed directions by technical advances in allied disciplines, divided within itself along
      accidental ill-drawn lines, besieged from one side by resurgent scientism and from the other by an
      advanced form of hand-wringing, and progressively deprived of its original subject matter, its
      research isolation, and its master-of-all-I-survey authority, [anthropology] seems not only to stay
      reasonably intact but . . . to extend the sway of the cast of mind that defines it over wider and wider
      areas of contemporary thought. We have turned out to be rather good at waddling in. In our confusion
      is our strength. (624)
In our confusion is our strength. For Geertz, this confusion reflects anthropology's flexibility as a science and a

     humanity and its acknowledgment that we do not yet know everything about who we are as a species. Our
     ongoing mission is to be open to what comes next, open to the potential of what it means to be human. This is
     especially important at this moment in history when global challenges remind us of how much remains to be
     done for every person to have a life of dignity. Instead of predicting the end of anthropology, "Waddling In"
     challenges anthropologists to discover an ever-widening relevance and importance for the discipline, in a
     world of ongoing cultural change.

     Anthropology is both an academic and an applied discipline. What anthropology reveals about human culture
     and human biology can be used to improve lives today. Anthropology is deeply relevant to contemporary lives
     in many ways. Museums are a common way in which anthropological knowledge is presented to the public,
     interpreting cultural and biological diversity and inspiring new generations of scholars and a broader public.
     The Museum of Anthropology at the University of British Columbia, shown in Figure 20.1, is an example of one
     way anthropologists share their knowledge in a public space. But there are many other ways in which
     anthropologists interact with and influence our global community.

     20.1 Our Challenging World Today

     LEARNING OUTCOMES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       · Identify some of the most critical global challenges.
       · Define ethnosphere.
       · Analyze the importance of the ethnosphere today.

     Critical Global Challenges

     Today humanity faces a growing number of global problems, most of them linked to one another and to long-
     standing historical inequities and injustice. Many of the problems people experience in their daily lives derive
     from major global issues, which intersect with and affect cultural traditions and contemporary social
     behaviors. In other words, our global problems are deeply connected to the ways we live locally. Local and
     global problems connect and reinforce each other.

country acting alone" (United Nations 2021). Many of these challenges, which affect all nations, are
particularly harmful to those facing discrimination, environmental and social racism, and economic poverty.
As you read through these "global issues," notice how many of these challenges are linked together (e.g., Africa,
decolonization, democracy, poverty, global health, etc.). Go through this list and note which of these impact
you and which might have affected your ancestors. Consider such things as cost of goods and services, possible
effects on health and welfare, and even the political instability that might result from these issues, creating
global ripple effects. Also, consider how populations suffering various injustices might experience greater
impacts than those in otherwise stable communities.

  · Africa: promoting democratic institutions, supporting economic and social development, and protecting
      human rights.

  · Aging: responding to the growth of aging populations (ages 60 and over) worldwide.
  · AIDS: continuing to reduce infection and death rates in the global fight against AIDS.
  · Atomic energy: promoting the safe, secure, and peaceful operation of more than 440 nuclear reactors

      generating electricity worldwide.
  · Big data for sustainable development: monitoring inclusiveness and fairness in the application of new

      data sources, technologies, and analyses.
  · Children: protecting the rights of every child to health, education, and protection and expanding children's

      opportunities.
  · Climate change: responding to the unprecedented challenges of shifting weather patterns that threaten

      food production and create climate emergencies.
  · Decolonization: continuing to monitor and encourage self-determination among former colonies, which

      the UN refers to as a "sacred trust." When the UN was founded in 1945, approximately 750 million people
      were living in colonies and dependencies; today, fewer than two million live under colonial rule.
  · Democracy: strengthening democracy, "a universally recognized ideal" and a core value of the UN, as a
      way of strengthening human rights.
  · Ending poverty: reducing global poverty rates, which could increase by as much as 8 percent of the world's
      population during the COVID-19 pandemic.
  · Food: working toward food security and increasing nutrition for the most vulnerable population groups,
      especially during COVID-19.
  · Gender equality: promoting gender equality as both a fundamental human right and a critical factor in
      achieving peaceful and sustainable societies.
  · Health: monitoring, promoting, and protecting health concerns worldwide. Much of the leadership in this
      area is provided by the World Health Organization (WHO).
  · Human rights: continuing the ongoing effort to guarantee human rights around the globe. This is a central
      focus of the UN's work, as set out in the UN Charter (https://openstax.org/r/un-charter) and the Universal
      Declaration of Human Rights (https://openstax.org/r/universal-declaration-of-human-rights).
  · International law and justice: continuing to promote international law and justice across the three pillars
      of international peace and security, socioeconomic development and progress, and respect for
      fundamental human rights and freedoms.
  · Migration: ensuring the orderly and humane management of migration, finding practical solutions to
      migration problems, and providing humanitarian assistance to refugees and internally displaced persons.
  · Oceans and the law of the sea: ensuring peaceful, cooperative usage of the oceans and seas to the common
      benefit for humanity and combating the rising threat of pollution and waste from transport vessels and oil
      tankers.
  · Peace and security: helping restore peace and preventing disputes from escalating into war.
  · Population: promoting sexual and reproductive health and individuals' ability to manage the size of their
      families.
  · Refugees: providing aid and safe haven to the millions of people forcibly displaced worldwide. In 2019, an
      estimated 79.5 million people were refugees, 26 million of them under the age of 18.
  · Water: managing the competition between individual and commercial needs for access to water, which is
      critical for all human populations.
  · Youth: providing for a more just, equitable, and progressive future for persons between the ages of 15 and
      24, including ensuring access to health, education, and employment and working toward gender equality.
612  20 · Anthropology on the Ground

     Private philanthropists have been working on some of these same problems as well. In 2020, the Bill and
     Melinda Gates Foundation, founded in 2000 to work collaboratively with governments to solve critical global
     health issues, expanded their focus by naming three major action areas for their multibillion-dollar
     foundation, in addition to ongoing educational priorities:

       · Climate change: increasing clean energy, providing zero-emissions energy to low-income countries, and
           developing innovative approaches to food production.

       · Gender inequality and gender-based violence: expanding access to education to improve women's lives
           and increasing women's leadership positions in government, finance, and health.

       · Global health: sponsoring initiatives to deliver vaccinations and otherwise combat major global diseases,
           such as AIDS and malaria. (Bass and Bloomberg 2020)

     These lists represent only the beginning of the challenges that face us as human beings living on one shared
     planet. Underpinning these challenges are many others, none more important than the loss of diversities. We
     face devastating losses in three major areas of diversity: biological diversity, as species are increasingly
     endangered or become extinct; cultural diversity, as Indigenous peoples, minorities, and smaller populations
     in more isolated areas, such as rural areas, face encroachments on their lands and their lives, including their
     right to exist as diverse cultures; and linguistic diversity, with thousands of languages already extinct and
     many more facing imminent extinction. As diversity declines, our species has fewer options and less flexibility.
     When we consider that most innovation builds on preexisting forms--whether of biology, culture, or
     language--the loss of anything that once existed is also a loss of potential, of what could have been.

     But all is not doom and gloom. Hope is offered by disciplines, such as anthropology, that work to value and
     preserve diversities. Anthropology has taken a lead role in bringing positive change to our global world.
     Projects in which anthropological knowledge and insight is applied to current challenges include language
     reclamation and revitalization, primate conservation and habitat enrichment, revitalization of traditional
     foodways and technologies, and other projects to revive, restore, and encourage cultural, biological, and
     linguistic diversity.

     The Ethnosphere

     When considering the many challenges facing us as a global community, we must also acknowledge our
     assets--the tools and conditions we can harness to increase value and effect positive change. We do not enter
     our future empty-handed. To some extent, our challenges and assets have evolved together, hand in hand. As
     we face concerns about another possible global health pandemic, for example, we bring with us a depth of
     scientific knowledge based on earlier experiences, having learned and retooled our responses to be better
     prepared for those things we have experienced before. As we begin to combat overwhelming climate crises
     after decades of abusing our environment, we have knowledge and tools to make positive changes while
     continuing to educate people about our physical world, pollution, and global warming. We understand the
     causes of most of our challenges, and we have the ability to harness large groups of people globally to work
     together to address them, with an impressive array of technology at our fingertips. We are not a helpless
     species. We are not necessarily smarter or wiser than our ancestors were, but we do have one great
     treasure--we have what our ancestors left to us. We have the accumulation of all their cultural wisdom,
     ingenuity, and humanity.

     In 2001, Canadian cultural anthropologist Wade Davis coined the term ethnosphere to refer to the sum total of
     all of human knowledge across time:

           You might think of the ethnosphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams, myths,
           intuitions and inspirations brought into being by the human imagination since the dawn of
           consciousness. The ethnosphere is humanity's great legacy. It is the product of our dreams, the
           embodiment of our hopes, the symbol of all that we are and all that we have created as a wildly
           inquisitive and astonishingly adaptive species. (Davis 2003)

The diverse ways in which humans have solved or managed the challenges of our lives, many of them
challenges that we have inflicted on ourselves because of greed and ignorance, is a rich storehouse for our
future. Too often, contemporary people feel there is little to learn from those who are different from us or who
came before us, but the solutions to our current problems are founded upon this legacy.

Humans have faced grave environmental challenges more than once in our species' history. Our ancestors also
faced global climate challenges. The last glacial period occurred between 120,000 and 11,500 years ago.
During that time, alternating periods of global cooling and warming displaced human populations and forced
them to adapt to new plants and animals as they migrated and ultimately peopled the globe. One of the notable
consequences of the last years of the glacial period was the extinction of some 177 species of megafauna (large
mammals), including woolly mammoths, giant deer, and saber-toothed cats. There have been two primary
theories about these extinctions, which occurred worldwide (in Europe, Africa, Asia, and North and South
America). Did the animals go extinct due to climate change and habitat loss or to overkilling by human big-
game hunters? Recently, researchers at Aarhus University in Denmark studied the extinction of megafauna
species through global mapping techniques that compared timelines of human occupation and of animal
extinction (Sandom et al. 2014). In about one-third of the animal extinctions, the correlation of the dates of the
earliest arrival of human hunters and the extinction of the animals was clear and consistent. While the
majority of cases were not consistent, they did not present contrary evidence to the theory of human overkill
and environmental exploitation. It appears that humans were involved in mass extinctions and environmental
changes even in these early periods.

     early humans. (credit: "Siegsdorfer Mammut" by Lou Gruber/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)

     And yet people have also been involved in animal reintroductions and species conservation. Today, U.S.
     National Parks have reported a variety of species reintroduction success stories. In several national parks
     across the United States, native animal species have been reintroduced to better manage habitats, conserve
     endangered species, and support a healthy ecosystem. Among the most successful reintroduced species are
     California condors, Pacific fishers, black-footed ferrets, gray wolves, bald eagles, desert pupfish, bighorn sheep,
     elk, and nn, a species of goose native to Hawaii (Errick 2015).

     Entomologist Edward O. Wilson has devoted his life to studying and working to protect biodiversity, the
     astounding variety of plants and animals on our planet that together form a healthy ecosystem. As part of the
     biological web of life, humans are important actors. Within the ethnosphere lies the wisdom of generations of
     human interactions with other species for food, medicines, clothing, shelter, protection, companionship, and
     economic exploitation. Many of the tools related to this valuable knowledge are found within Indigenous
     cultures, too many of them also endangered or extinct today. By preserving and valuing the ethnosphere and
     its diversity, we preserve ourselves, our children's futures, and the hopes we have for our planet.

     Anthropology plays a major role in preserving, valuing, and teaching about the ethnosphere. In this critical
     role, anthropology makes an important difference in how well we encounter the future--whether we will adapt
     and thrive or face ever-increasing threats to our survival. Whether you are a practicing anthropologist, a
     student of anthropology, or someone who enjoys learning about our diverse world, including its diverse
     peoples and cultures, you have a role to play in bringing about a more hopeful future.

     A Uniquely Relevant Discipline

     As you learned in What is Anthropology?, anthropology is a unique discipline. Not only does it study all aspects
     of what it means to be human across time, with a focus on evolution and how changes occur in our bodies and
     cultures, but it also examines the ways in which we adapt to different social and physical environments. This
     process of adaptation is a primary source of cultural and biological diversity. Anthropology is also holistic,

examining the context of and interconnections between many parts of our lives and weaving together our
biology, our traditions, and the diverse social and physical environments in which we live. The anthropological
approach views humans as part of a wider system of meaning, as actors and change-makers within a dynamic
environment populated by others. Across cultures, those others can include other species (plant and animal)
and spirits as well as other human beings. It is the human ability to imagine and construct the universe in
which we live that most interests anthropologists.

In most four-field introductory classes, students are surprised at the breadth of anthropology, but this wide
lens is the cornerstone of the discipline. Today, anthropologists increasingly approach the study of humans as
a dynamic construct. We see humans as agents in motion, undergoing change as a normal state of being,
rather than as objects in a petri dish, preserved and inert. This means that anthropological studies are by
necessity messy and in flux, as our subject matter makes change. Because holism, adaptation, and adjustment
are critical to anthropological studies, we bring an especially powerful lens to attempts to understand complex,
large-scale global problems.

Few of our challenges today are simple. Solving the climate crisis requires changes not just to our use of fossil
fuels but also to the ways in which we produce food, bathe, heat and cool our houses, and travel. Each culture
and each community must be aware of its power and potential to enact positive change. Both a scientific and a
humanistic approach are needed to solve our current global challenges.

Anthropological Values

The anthropological perspective is grounded by principles and standards of behavior considered important to
understanding other people and their ways of life. These include the value of all cultures; the value of
diversities, biological and cultural; the importance of change over time; and the importance of cultural
relativism and acknowledging of the dignity of all human beings. These anthropological values undergird our
discipline.

The study of culture intersects with each of the four subfields and highlights the importance of diversity. From
the beginning, humans have used ingenuity to tackle problems and provide solutions to challenging
circumstances. Anthropologists study and value this extraordinary process of human creativity, documenting
it in living and past cultures, in our languages and symbol systems, and even in our bones, through cultural
procedures such as elongating women's necks (as is practiced by the Kayan people of Myanmar) or flattening/
elongating people's heads (practiced by the Chinookan peoples of North America). Even our diets, which are
cultural artifacts of adaptation, are written on our bones. The consumption of corn, for example, is measurable
as carbon isotopes in human bone. Anthropology celebrates this human uniqueness and diversity,
understanding that different ways of being are humanity's greatest legacy--a foundation embodied in the
concept of the ethnosphere.

     Anthropological studies produce documentation of immeasurable worth. Through anthropological research,
     we collect, preserve, and share the stories of living humans as well as human artifacts, sites, and bodies.
     Together, these documents form a valuable database. Field notes and artifacts from the earliest
     anthropologists document diversity that has since disappeared. Franz Boas taught his students how to make
     life masks of the people they were studying to document the physical diversity of different groups of people (A.
     Singer 1986). This vast collection of some 2,000 life masks is now preserved at the Smithsonian Institution as
     an archival resource for understanding environment, culture, and biological adaptations. Many masks
     document ethnic groups that are now extinct. Anthropology collections (https://openstax.org/r/naturalhistory)
     are of inestimable value for future research.

     The Council for the Preservation of Anthropological Records, or CoPAR (https://openstax.org/r/copar.umd),
     works with anthropologists, librarians, and archivists to obtain and preserve anthropological records and
     make them available both for the study of human diversity and as a record of the history of the discipline. The
     organization has two primary goals. The first is to educate anthropologists on the value and urgency of saving
     documents. The second is to help train archivists and information specialists in best practices for handling the
     sometimes very sensitive information within these documents while also facilitating them in making sure that
     the information is available to scholars anywhere (Silverman and Parezo 1995).

     Diversity is a product of adaptation and change over time. As cultural groups encountered different challenges
     in their environments, they used ingenuity and innovation to address these challenges, sometimes borrowing
     other cultures' solutions when applicable. In the high Andes of South America, the steep mountainous inclines
     mean that there is little flat ground for growing food. In response to this challenge, Inca farmers used terrace
     farming, building steplike terraces into the hillside to create areas of flatter surfaces for growing crops (see
     Figure 20.6). Forms of terrace farming are found all over Asia and in parts of Africa, with cultures in each area
     adapting the use of terraces to meet specific climatic conditions and crop requirements (e.g., paddy rice
     cultivation requires small earthwork borders to allow for flooding). In short, there is no one way to do
     something; every solution is calibrated to particular needs. Today, with increasing urgency to minimize our

carbon footprints, architects are designing homes to meet clients' demands for net-positive houses--that is,
houses that produce more energy than they consume through solar power and lower-energy appliances
(Stamp 2020). As we work toward reducing our dependence on fossil fuels, the architectural and construction
industries are beginning to adapt to these changing needs and demands.

FIGURE 20.6 Adaptations: (left) By cutting these steplike terraces into the mountain, Andean farmers created
more arable land for farming. (right) In this net-positive house in Australia, the solar panels, increased insulation,

Besides culture and diversity, anthropology is also about the human power to change. Through adaption,
evolution, and even acclimatization (short-term adaptation to environmental change), the human body has
evolved alongside human cultures to make us a species uniquely capable of adapting to almost any
environmental or social conditions. Humans can survive even in such inhospitable environments as outer
space (thanks to the human-designed technology that makes up the International Space Station) and the polar
regions (where human-built structures and protective gear make habitation possible at McMurdo Station in
Antarctica). And humans have survived health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic and historical tragedies
such as slavery and warfare. The ability to change, redirect, reassess, reimagine, and innovate has sustained
our species across time.

Diversity matters more today than ever. Where diversity is valued, there is greater potential for innovation and
collaboration. A central value of anthropology, evident in both research and applied work across communities,
is anthropologists' focus not only on understanding other cultures and different ways of living but also on
translating them--that is, communicating what is learned across cultures in order to share it more broadly.

The most important anthropological value, however, is cultural relativism, or suspending judgment about
other cultures until one gains a clear understanding of the meaning and significance of what those cultures do
and believe. Cultural relativism requires us to understand the rationale, purpose, and meaning of cultural
traditions and knowledge before we decide on their validity. And it provides significant advantages in better
understanding others:

  · It allows us to see the worth, dignity, and respect of all persons, allowing for initial exchange and
      collaboration between "us" and "them."

  · It reminds us to approach the study of other cultures without automatically judging them as inferior, thus
      minimizing ethnocentrism.

  · It helps us keep an open mind about the potentials and possibilities inherent in our species.

First formally introduced by Franz Boas, cultural relativism laid the groundwork for the discipline of
anthropology, a science that would study what it means to be human in all its diverse forms. Boas and his
students worked to apply cultural relativism across racial, ethnic, linguistic, and socioeconomic boundaries,
documenting the rich cultural traditions of Indigenous peoples, minority communities, and immigrants. The
concept, though, has undergone a great deal of debate since the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights
by the United Nations. Is anything okay if a culture decides it is? Are there any boundaries to cultural
618  20 · Anthropology on the Ground

     relativism? Do we have to accept everything that a group does, or can an anthropologist ultimately judge that a
     practice is damaging, harmful, and not deserving of being respected and upheld?

     While these debates remain, anthropologists still value cultural relativism (and the worthiness of other peoples
     and cultures), although perhaps in a modified form that anthropologist Michael Brown calls cultural relativism
     2.0. As Brown states, cultural relativism 2.0 is "a call to pause before judging, to listen before speaking, and to
     widen one's views before narrowing them" (2008, 380). In other words, first give people a chance.

     Anthropology is important today, perhaps even more than when it formally began some 150 years ago. As
     French anthropologist Maurice Godelier says:

           Anthropology--together with history--is one of the social science disciplines best able to help us
           understand the complexity of our now globalized world and the nature of the conflicts and crisis we
           are experiencing. In such a world, it would be irresponsible and indecent for anthropologists [to] stop
           trying to understand others. (2016, 75-76)

     20.3 What Anthropologists Can Do

     LEARNING OUTCOMES

     By the end of this section, you will be able to:
       · Describe the primary areas where the anthropological approach is relevant.
       · Identify the ways that anthropologists are specifically trained for today's challenges.
       · Explain how anthropological skills can help address contemporary problems.

     What Anthropologists Do Today

     Anthropologists are at work now to make a difference in our lives. There are various ways in which
     anthropologists and those utilizing an anthropological lens or framework contribute critically needed skills
     and resources in the 21st century.

       · Research. Sometimes referred to as pure or theoretical research, fieldwork is conducted in all kinds of
           settings in order to answer practical and theoretical questions that form the basis of anthropology. How do
           cultures change? How do artifacts and technology evolve within a culture? How do trade and exchange
           affect the development of cultures?

           Many of the chapters in this text feature stories about anthropological research and its importance in
           understanding what it means to be human. Each of the subfields engages in distinct types of field research
           as ways to test theories and advance our knowledge of human beings. Theoretical research is the
           backbone of academic anthropology.

       · Research and development. Research and development are associated with practical applications, such as
           creating or redesigning products or services for governments or corporations. Anthropologists who work
           in research and development contribute what they know about human behavior and the world around us
           to projects that serve the interests of human organizations and the human community.

           Cultural anthropologist Genevieve Bell worked for 18 years in research and development for Intel
           Corporation, the world's largest semiconductor chip manufacturer. Her focus at Intel was on user
           experience, researching how people use technology and apply it in their lives with the goal of designing
           more relevant and user-friendly products. Intel valued the way Bell's deep knowledge of human behavior
           and human culture helped the company better anticipate their clients' needs. Bell's insights helped make
           Intel a more competitive corporation. She has described her job as "mak[ing] sense of what makes people
           tick, what delights and frustrates them, and . . . us[ing] those insights to help shape next generation
           technology innovations. I sit happily at the intersection of cultural practices and technology adoption"
          (City Eye 2017).

   In a TED Salon talk titled "6 Big Ethical Questions about the Future of AI (https://openstax.org/r/
   genevieve_bell_6)," Bell explains that the technological revolution of artificial intelligence is already in
   progress, affecting many aspects of our lives. She says that the challenge now is to use artificial
   intelligence "safely, sustainably, and responsibly." Bell advocates for human-scale technology. Using skills
   and knowledge gained through her training as an anthropologist, she looks at the ways in which
   technology, culture, and environment interact. In her work today, she continues to use an anthropological
   approach: "It's about thinking differently, asking different kinds of questions, looking holistically at the
   world and the systems" (Bell 2020).

   Bell left Intel in 2017 to serve as a distinguished professor at the Australian National University College of
   Engineering and Computer Science, where she serves as the director of the School of Cybernetics and
   continues to research the interface between culture and technology.

· Public policy. Anthropologists are involved in public policy making all over the world. Anthropological
   skills and outlooks are increasingly valuable to the development of principles and regulatory measures
   that increase public safety and resolve real-world problems. Applying a holistic approach to these issues
   allows government and nongovernment organizations to avoid some problems and better anticipate
   future challenges.

   The American Anthropological Association (AAA) (https://openstax.org/r/ParticipateAndAdvocate) has
   identified five public policy areas that would greatly benefit from an anthropological approach. In each of
   these areas, the AAA hopes to involve more anthropologists in public policy in the 21st century and to
   work collectively to message international, national, and local agencies about the importance of
   anthropological knowledge and involvement:

    Social and cultural aspects of health: identifying ways in which categories of race, ethnicity, gender,
       socioeconomic status, and age hinder medical delivery.

    Culture and diversity in education: understanding the diversities that affect educational delivery and
620  20 · Anthropology on the Ground

               the gaps that exist in current educational policies due to such things as changing demographics and
               new information technologies.
           An interdisciplinary approach to the environment: focusing on the ways in which anthropological
               knowledge contributes to understanding the human dimensions of the environment and interfacing
               with federal agencies actively seeking to support this type of environmental research.
           Economic, social, and cultural aspects of the information revolution: examining the human dimensions
               of the information revolution and the impact that it is having on our work and personal lives.
           Globalization and its impact on public policy: specifically, focusing on issues of conflict and war and the
               effects of globalization on transnational communities.

           One of the challenges that anthropologists face is better educating governments and corporations about
           the skills they can bring to understanding and addressing contemporary problems. Working
           collaboratively within and beyond the discipline is important for advancing an awareness of the
           possibilities that anthropologists offer as public policy advocates.

     Personal History: Gillian Tett is a British author and journalist who trained in anthropology. She studied at
     Clare College, Cambridge University, where she earned her PhD in social anthropology after conducting
     doctoral research in Tajikistan, in what was then the Soviet Union. Tett intentionally chose to turn her
     anthropological gaze outside of the university setting, where she believed her training would have greater
     impact.

addition to her role as a journalist. Her articles on finance, business, and political economy appear in the
Financial Times and in various leading newspapers and media outlets. She forecast early warnings about the
2008 economic downturn, applying her anthropological knowledge and skills to understand emerging global
economic patterns, and she participates frequently in conferences on finance and global economics. Tett also
contributes to new directions in anthropology; at the joint 2019 American Anthropological Association and
Canadian Anthropology Society/La société canadienne d'anthropologie Annual Meeting, she served as a
discussant in a presidential session on the topic of breaking down silos in anthropology,

Accomplishments in the Field: Tett has earned various commendations and awards in and outside of the field
of anthropology, including the British Press Award for Business and Finance Journalist of the Year in both
2008 and 2009. She was awarded the President's Medal of the British Academy in 2011, given in recognition of
"academic-related service activity" beyond the academy. Her book Fool's Gold: How Unrestrained Greed
Corrupted a Dream, Shattered Global Markets, and Unleashed a Catastrophe (2009), which takes a cultural
anthropological approach to analyzing the global economy and financial system, was a New York Times best
seller and was chosen as the 2009 Financial Book of the Year by Spear's magazine. In 2014, Tett received the
Royal Anthropological Institute's Marsh Award for Anthropology in the World, which "recognises an
outstanding individual based outside academia, one who has shown how to apply anthropology or
anthropological ideas to the better understanding of the world's problems" (Royal Anthropological Institute
2021). Her latest book is Anthro-Vision: A New Way to See in Business and Life (2021), published by Simon &
Schuster.

  · Applied or practicing anthropology. Anthropologists are engaged in wide-ranging work on the ground in
      real-life situations, helping address numerous current and emerging needs in communities around the
      world. Many work within nongovernmental agencies. Some anthropologists are already engaged in efforts
      pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic, gathering preliminary data and working to streamline access to
      treatment and preventative measures.

      In 2014, the WHO reached out to sociocultural anthropologists to help address an outbreak of the Ebola
      virus in Mali. They sought the help of these anthropologists as liaisons to connect with the local people and
      lessen their anxieties about the disease, help those recovering cope with the stigma of having had Ebola,
      and build a bridge between the community and the health system. They also sought anthropological
      direction on how best to interact with local people while respecting their culture and traditions. The WHO
      described some of the roles of the anthropologists who aided in this project:

            The social anthropologists have also helped train teams searching for Ebola patients and
            monitoring Ebola contacts, teaching them to make allowances for local culture and the rules of
            hospitality and politeness when visiting families. These factors are key to getting the message
            across and being heard by members of the community. (World Health Organization 2015)

The global emergency of COVID-19 mobilized a number of anthropologists, especially those in the applied field
of medical anthropology. Medical anthropologist Mark Nichter (2020), who has studied emerging diseases and
global health for much of his career, was returning from fieldwork in India and Indonesia when COVID-19
cases started being diagnosed in the United States. He traveled from Asian countries, where people were
wearing masks and showing a high level of concern for the disease, into Europe and then the United States,
where there seemed to be little concern. These different attitudes prompted him to think about other
pandemics he had experienced as a medical anthropologist and about how complex these global events can
be. Deeply aware of issues of social inequality, he worried about the poor infrastructure conditions in so many
countries and the dense populations in refugee camps. What would happen in water-insecure areas where
accessing any kind of water, especially clean water for handwashing, was difficult? He wondered just how bad
this was going to be as a global event.

During lockdown in the United States, Nichter used his training as a medical anthropologist to create positive
change within his community. He first developed a COVID-19 primer, explaining health concepts about
COVID-19 and methods of slowing and preventing transmission in everyday terms to help professors and
teachers educate themselves and their students. The primer quickly began circulating on campuses in the
622  20 · Anthropology on the Ground

     United States and around the world. Nichter also worked with fellow anthropologists in a special working
     group supported by the American Anthropological Association to identify research areas of critical need. Many
     of these research areas concerned structural threats and areas where mortality data were revealing
     disparities, indicating that certain populations were more vulnerable than others. Third, Nichter began
     advocating and working for COVID-19 testing resources, the development of contact tracing, and symptom
     monitoring to better contain outbreaks within communities. Lastly, he helped develop a health care worker
     support network with both online and grassroots resources, knowing that frontline workers would be those
     most taxed by the pandemic. Nichter advocates for what he calls anticipatory anthropology. In the context of
     medical anthropology, anticipatory anthropology acts to shore up the fault lines that have emerged in the
     global health system, working toward creating stronger resistance to the next health care emergency.
     "COVID-19 provides an opportunity to build alliances and momentum for significant health care reform"
     (Nichter 2020).

     Anthropological skills are increasingly vital to developing and communicating culturally relevant messages.
     While global health initiatives are very prominent within the field of applied and practicing anthropology, the
     range of interventions is wide. Applied anthropology projects might involve improved farming techniques and
     heirloom seed banks, better educational services, and even work on the front lines with persons displaced by
     war, migration, or climate emergencies.

     Anthropological Skills and Resources

     Anthropologists are trained to look at the larger context and understand how smaller, local environments fit
     into overarching forces. They aim to hold a multicultural perspective that represents various constituencies
     and to interact with people around them with the goal of better understanding where they are coming from
     and what things mean to them. Anthropologists gather and analyze data that reflects real life on the ground
     and in the streets. The central anthropological specialty is an unfettered interest in human beings.

     In 2020, career research and employment website Zippia interviewed a group of teaching and practicing
     anthropologists about the anthropological skills they believe are most valuable in today's job market. The two
     quotes below illustrate the breadth of career preparation that anthropology provides:

           Organizations are looking for people who can articulate the value of their experiences. Anthropology
           provides a broad array of skills. Some [are] more general, such as critical thinking and written and oral
           communication and teamwork. Some skills are more specific, such as survey and excavation for
           archaeology positions, research design, data analysis skills (qualitative and quantitative), and
          familiarity with research ethics. --John Ziker

           Young graduates need to think quickly and with skepticism, read situations from multiple angles, and
           have openness to variable solutions. This means that they need skills in understanding pluralistic
           vantage points, judging where information comes from and who it benefits and who it hurts, and being
           gifted at recognizing and acknowledging their own biases. Anthropology teaches these skills as it
          prepares graduates for work in a wide array of fields. --Suzanne Morrissey (Stark et al. 2020)

     Anthropologists and anthropology students, undergraduate and graduate, fit into a wide array of careers and
     contribute valuable skills and resources to their communities everywhere. As people specialists,
     anthropologists understand how to approach diverse peoples, elicit information about and from them, and
     work with that information to understand broader situations. Some of the broadly applicable skills that
     different anthropologists have include interviewing; excavating; mapping; analyzing data using various types
     of methodologies, including mixed methods (combining qualitative and quantitative methods); applying ethics
     in difficult, emerging situations; and engaging with new technologies in the sciences. All of these are 21st-
     century skills and resources. However, the most advantageous of an anthropologist's skills is an attitude of
     respect and dignity toward diverse peoples everywhere. In our global world, this may be the most important
     asset of all. As anthropologist Tim Ingold says, anthropologists "study ... with people" and "learn from them,
     not just about them" (2018, 32).

     How Anthropology Can Lead in the Future

     Career and employment trends today align with what anthropologists do, whether or not one is a full-time

practicing anthropologist. Students heading into any fields that address the human condition, past or present,
will benefit from studies in anthropology. Within colleges and universities across the world, there is a
reemergence of transdisciplinary approaches that utilize methods and perspectives from multiple disciplines
to study and propose solutions to complex problems. This educational model, sometimes called the matrix
model (National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineers, and Institute of Medicine 2005), has
resulted in the development of new interdisciplinary degree programs such as the biomedical informatics
program at Stanford University; the Indigenous food, energy, and water systems program at the University of
Arizona; and the science, medicine, and technology in culture program at Union College. Training in
anthropological holism is the ideal foundation for working in teams with multiple interests and a shared focus
on the larger context. Specifically, the four-field approach in anthropology prepares researchers to apply a
keen perception of the ways in which biology and culture interact and influence each other.

With the increasing prominence of social media and grassroots communication across cultures, it is important
that emerging leaders have the ability to interview people, elicit relevant information from them, and analyze
what they think, do, and desire. Anthropologists are trained to interact with others, seek connections and
patterns in what they observe, and analyze the symbolic significance of what they find.

Anthropologists are also trained to work in the field, wherever and whatever the field may be, taking their
offices and research labs into the communities in which they work and live. Accustomed to being flexible and
adaptable to the needs of the situation and letting the field dictate how best to accomplish their work,
anthropologists have the skills, technology, and experience to work well in a global community.

In the 20th century, academia sought to become ever more specialized, constructing departments, specialties,
and subspecialties to home in on very particular subjects such as a disease, a genre of literature, or a type of
religion. This approach was an advance over the more generalist approach that was common in the 19th
century, in which academics were trained in very broad fields such as medicine, ancient history, or culture.
Now, in the 21st century, the shift is toward a more complex and multifaceted understanding of how we live
and the challenges we face. Many anthropology programs today provide vocational skills and workplace
training. There is a growing awareness that we need to develop the ability to think both generally and
systematically (such as in an ecosystemic approach) while also seeking to understand the particularities of
specific challenges. Anthropology, with its holistic approach, mixed methodology analyses, and deep, abiding
appreciation of diversity and the dignity of all people, is situated at the crossroads of what comes next. This is
how anthropology can guide us as we move into the future.

As Geertz said, "We have turned out to be rather good at waddling in" (1985, 624). Anthropological skills are
based on flexibility and adaptation to a changing world, open-mindedness and openness to new ideas, and a
willingness to engage with complex issues in order to find solutions to problems facing our world today. The
anthropological skillset is critical in the 21st century.

        MINI-FIELDWORK ACTIVITY

Global Challenges

Choose three global challenges, and research more about them. Consider how these three global challenges
are linked to one another and to long-standing historical inequities. Collect information on the current state of
each problem in the United States and worldwide, what measures are being taken to mitigate the problem, and
whether there are any local initiatives in your own community. Consider both campus and community
organizations. Using what you have learned about anthropology, propose three anthropological skills that you
could employ to help address each of these challenges.
