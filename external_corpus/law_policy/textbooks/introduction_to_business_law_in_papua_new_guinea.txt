1 | INTRODUCTION

INTRODUCTION

The aim of this book is to give you, the reader, an introduction to the importance of having a
basic understanding of Business Law, and the role it plays in both your everyday life and in
business. It will not make you a lawyer but importantly it will enable you to recognise legal
issues, minimise exposure to risk, and know when to consult a lawyer. To help you, and to
make the book as user friendly as possible, the book is written primarily in the first person
where you are the plaintiff. And to provide you with more help you will find Business Tips
and summaries throughout the text.

       Your feedback and suggestions are invaluable to us. If you have any corrections or
       ideas to share, please email us at library@scu.edu.au, or complete the Feedback form.

        Introduction

Why study Business Law?

Introduction to Business Law introduces you to an area of life that you probably have not
thought much about the law and can't see much relevance for you because you are not
studying to be a lawyer, yet. But you may change your mind after you have finished this
Unit. But despite what you may think, an understanding of what we will cover in this subject/
unit will be both relevant and useful for you in the future. It is not boring (well perhaps a little
bit in parts) or scary (there is a lot of reading) and if you do the Readings and look at what
goes on around you, you will realise that it is all very relevant.

It is important to understand that you are not studying Introduction to Business Law to be
a lawyer but rather to obtain a basic understanding of the relevance of Business Law in
the context of business and commerce, and also what you do in your personal life - for
example, like shopping which is all about contract law, consumer protection and the tort of
negligence.

By the end of this subject/unit, the hope we have is that you will have a basic understanding
of how the legal system works and how laws are created, but also that you will be able to
recognise a legal problem coming your way and be proactive in taking appropriate steps to
ensure that the problem can be resolved in your favour.

       Note: The online reference materials, although referenced throughout this book, are
       supplementary and while not necessary, will help you to understand the core content
       of this unit. Further, all Acts and legislation mentioned can be considered PNG Acts
       and legislation unless otherwise indicated.

Chapter contents

As noted above, this subject/unit is hopefully going to provide you with an understanding of
four different areas of law - negligence, contract, consumer protection and agency - that
are useful for you in business and commerce, as well as being relevant in your personal
lives.

The purpose of this Chapter is not only an introduction to what to expect in the coming 6
weeks but to also provide you with an overview of how to plan your study in the subject/unit,
how to understand a case, how to read an Act, and how to write an essay.

See the table under the heading What do you need to know about module readings? to
learn more about what readings to complete and when during the unit.

What is a study session planner?

The first thing to organise is a study session planner andthe second thing to do is to stick to
it (so tick the boxes as you read through the planner).

Now that you have your Study Plan sorted, have a look at the following suggested study
sessions below for each Module. You really need to be disciplined and try and cover each
topic in the time allocated (but you can adjust it as everyone reads at different speeds
and writes different amounts of notes. Try and keep your notes short and to the point).
Remember, a good set of notes is important when it comes to understanding, remembering
and applying what you have read.

What do you need to know about module readings?

The times set down in the Module Planners above are approximate times it will take you
to read through a topic. It is hard to be accurate when it comes to reading times because
everybody reads at a different pace, however, the times above will give you a starting
point.

The table below provides you with an overview of readings for each of the Modules. Try
and read each chapter carefully. A highlighter can be very useful to highlight key points and
things you might not understand. A good idea is to use two (2) different highlighter colours,
one for key points and the other for what you don't understand. It makes revision much
easier and the more you read, the more you will comprehend.

Some tips on studying Business Law

What problems with words are you likely to encounter?

Studying a law subject is not quite the same as studying a lot of your other subjects/units.
You will find that the chapters are different from what you are used to as a lot of the
language appears, at first glance, to be `foreign'. This is because the law is about language
and how we interpret the meaning of words in documents, as well as Acts and regulations,
from which we develop legal rules and principles. Here are some words to watch out for
when reading legal documents, legislation, or texts.

`Means' versus `includes'

Definitions of words and expressions in legislation will often commence with either `means'
or `includes'.

   `Means' is used when the draftsperson wants the defined words to have an exact
      meaning. These can be found in the Interpretation section of an Act. For example, in
      the Independent Consumer and Competition Commission Act 2002 s 2 states that
      `Commission' means the Independent Consumer Commission and Competition . . .'
      Thus, `Commission' in this legislation refers to the PNG Consumer and Competition
      and no other commission.

   `Includes' expands or clarifies the ordinary meaning of a defined word by giving
      examples - for example, in s 2 of the Independent Consumer and Competition Act
      2002, `decision', when used as a verb, `includes . . . declaration, determination, order,
      or other decision . . .'. The draftsperson has attempted to enlarge the ordinary
      meaning of `decision' using the word `includes' and the examples that follow.

`And' versus `or'

The words `and' and `or' are commonly found in Acts, regulations, and legal documents.

   `And' is used when the draftsperson wants the words or phrases to be read together.
      All the matters or facts listed must exist, or if it is a requirement, all of them must be
      satisfied.

   `Or' is used to split words or phrases. The importance of the distinction between the
      two words is illustrated in s. 130(6)(b) of the Independent Consumer and Competition
      Act 2002, where the section states that a person who `wilfully furnishes false or
      misleading records. . .' is guilty of an offence. The effect of `or' is to make it an offence
                                                                                                                                       ORIENTATION | 16

      if you furnish false records, and similarly, if you furnish misleading records. Remove
      `or' and substitute with `and' and you can see the difference because now there are
      two requirements to satisfy.

`May' versus `might'

   The use of the word `may' in an Act or regulation used in relation to a duty or power
      should suggest to you that the duty or power is discretionary, not mandatory, that is,
      there is a likely possibility that the duty or power will be exercised but it may not be.

   `Might' indicates an unlikely possibility that something is not happening and is the
      past tense of `may'.

`Will', `shall' and `must'

The use of the words `will', `shall', and `must' in an Act or regulation are all used as verbs to
express an obligation. Context is important and you need to consider three principles when
you come across one of these words in an Act or regulation (or in correspondence such as
a commercial contract):

   What is the natural and reasonable meaning of the sentence or clause?
   What did the parties intend?
   What makes the most sense in an Act, regulation, or commercial contract?

`Must' always suggests an absolute obligationand is now commonly used in all legal
documents. It means you have no choice but to do it. `Will', refers to a personal promise and
in a contract reflects the future tense, that is, it is predictive. It doesn't create an obligation
to perform. `Shall', like `will', is also predictive rather than obligatory, and future tense. It is
confusing because it can mean `may', `will', or `must' depending on the context it is being
used in. But in legal drafting, it expresses a third party's positive or negative obligations and
is a command.

`Could', `would,' and`should

These are the past tense of `shall', `will', and `can'

   In the case of `could', this is generally used to suggest a possibility or to make a
      request - for example, `Could you please pass that book?' `Could' suggests you could
      do it, but you might not want to.

   `Would' is used to refer to a possible or imagined situation, often used when that
      possible situation may not be going to happen: `When would you have time to read a
      chapter before class?'
17 | ORIENTATION

   `Should' is the conditional form of shall and implies that something ought to be done,
      or to express something that is probable, for example, `Your book should be here after
      lunch?', or to ask a question, for example, `Shouldn't you read this chapter before
      class?'

What does `reasonable' mean?

Here is another word you frequently encounter in law, but do you know exactly what it
means? You will encounter the reasonable person referred to on numerous occasions as
you cover the materials in this subject/unit. To establish a breach of the duty of care the
court must be satisfied that the risk was foreseeable, not insignificant, and what would a
reasonable person have done in the circumstances.

The court will consider the meaning of `reasonable' according to the circumstances and
consider:

   The more serious the harm, the more likely it is that the reasonable person would take
      greater precautions

   The more probable the harm, the more likely the reasonable person will take
      precautions

   If there is little prospect of harm occurring, the more likely it is that the reasonable
      person will not take any precautions, and

   If the potential benefit of the defendant's actions or inactions is greater than the risk of
      harm to others, a reasonable person is less likely to take precautions.

So how do the courts deal with interpreting language? They generally resort to the following
rules:

   words will generally be given their normal dictionary meaning (if you come by a word
      you haven't seen before, get a dictionary or look it up online)

   technical words are generally given their technical meaning
   words are interpreted according to their current meaning
   if a word is used more than once, it should be given the same meaning unless a

      contrary intention exists in the Act, and
   a statute should not be given retrospective effect unless expressly provided for in the

      statute. Parliament has the power to make laws but the problem with it is that
      Parliament is making a law today to apply to an act or omission that was legal when
      you did it yesterday. Do you think that is fair? Most legislation is proactive because it
      only alters the direct legal consequences of future events or actions.

The Courts

How do you find and reference a case?

If you need to find a case, there are two options: go to a law library or, much easier
nowadays, use the internet and the databases online.

                   Online reference

     Find a case online

     If you do ever need to find a case online, go to the Papua New Guinea Primary Materials
     on the Pacific Islands Legal Information Institute website. See also recent cases and
     updates for the Supreme Court, National Court, and District Court (and cases in 2022).

If you need to find a case, the name of the case is followed by:

   the year of publication
   the initials of the court making the decision, and
   the judgment number.

For example, if you needed to find the case of National Housing Corporation v Kipoi all
you need to do is type in the name in whatever search engine you use and you will see
the name and URL for the case. Click on it and you will get taken to the site for National
Housing Corporation v Kipoi[2021] PGSC 116.
If the case is not available online, reference needs to be made to a set of traditional law
reports. Law reports have a slightly different citation to the electronic one. Each report has
its own citation, and a law librarian will be able to direct you where to find the relevant
report. Try the library at the PNG Supreme Court located in Waigani, which has both a print
collection and an electronic legal collection or the Law School library at the University of
Papua New Guinea.

When it comes to including a case in an assignment, or an answer to a legal problem, some
basic principles should be kept in mind. These include:
19 | ORIENTATION

   The initial case name (citation) must appear in full - for example, National Housing
      Corporation v Kipoi (`National Housing'). If there is no reference to a specific page in
      the case, and as this case now appears in an online version it would appear as:
      National Housing Corporation v Kipoi [2021] PGSC 116 (`National Housing').

   If there is a reference to a specific point in the case, the reference to the citation would
      be to the paragraph number and it would appear as: National Housing Corporation v
      Kipoi [2021] PGSC 116 at [8].

   Any further references to that case can then be in abbreviated form, as in footnote 2
      here:

       1. National Housing,above n 1, [9].

Note: The footnote above is an example based on AGLC4 referencing style. This
referencing style is not used throughout this text.
See a citation example below in Figure 1.

Kipoi. Image description.

Finding the ratio decidendi (reason for deciding) and obiter dicta (sayings
by the way)

It is useful to just briefly explain the meanings of two key terms that you will come across
in reference to cases and there is more on this in Chapter 2 in relation to what we call
precedent.
Theratioof a case is the reason for the decision. It is the reason/s for a judge's decision in a
case based on a ruling on a point of law deduced from the facts of the case as presented to
the court. It is not a statement of the law. Obiter(or sayings by the way), on the other hand,
are remarks made by judges that do not affect the decision in the case.
                                                                                                                                       ORIENTATION | 20

An excellent case that illustrates how these rules work is an English case called Hedley
Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd [1964] AC 465 which expanded the law of
negligence (what is known as a tort) to a new area of the law of negligence to include
negligent misstatements, which caused pure economic loss.

If you are ever in the position of having to find either the ratio or examples of obiter (or both)
in a case take the following steps:

   First, what were the parties asking the court to decide - the issues in contention?
   Secondly, read the whole judgment.
   Finally, what is the court's reasoning in determining the case's outcome?

Parliament

How do you find Acts and regulations?

As you will read in Chapter 2, the second main source of law within the PNG legal system
is statute law and all three levels of government - national, provincial, and local - have
legislative powers under the Constitution and the Organic Law on Provincial Governments
and Local-Level Governments.

The three levels of Parliament each have their own distinct law-making powers. The powers
that are not specified are assumed to remain with the national government. Provincial and
local-level government powers are subordinate to the national law and have legislative
power allowing them to pass legislation, but only to the extent that the national interest
requires, otherwise they have relative autonomy in how they are to operate. It is worth
noting that the powers of local-level governments are subject to the powers of provincial
governments.

The law-making powers of the National, Provincial, and Local-Level Governments are set
out in the Constitution of the Independent State of Papua New Guinea, while a list of
Organic Laws can be found online at Papua New Guinea Organic Laws(the law-making
powers of the Provincial and Local-Level Governments can be found in the Organic Law on
Provincial Governments and Local-Level Governments).

                   Online resources
21 | ORIENTATION

     Find Acts and regulations
     Legislation can be found at Papua New Guinea Sessional Legislation but the best site is
     the National Parliament of Papua New Guinea.
     If you want to find an Act or regulation, and you will find numerous references to Acts (or
     statutes) and regulations in business, it is useful to know how to be able to find copies. Do
     notrely on another person's copy unless you are confident it is a copy of the most recent
     copy. Similarly, do not rely on what a person states about how or why an Act or
     regulations apply unless you know what they are talking about. Why? The reason for
     being so pedantic is that if you are relying on an Act or regulation to make your case, or to
     be used as a defence in court, and you have been given the wrong information because
     you didn't check, you might lose the case, so always check.

                   In brief

     Some key points to note about legislation
           Acts and regulations are made by the three levels of government in PNG (and any
             subordinate bodies to which the Parliaments have delegated power to legislate).
           They are supreme law.
           In the event of a conflict with the common law, statute law prevails.
           They assume the existence of common law and often reaffirm common law
             principles.
           They can modify or replace the common law.
           They can respond more quickly to change to meet current community needs than
             the common law.
           They can be made retrospective and apply back in time.
           Because of the increasing complexity of legislation, doubts about the meaning of a
             word, phrase, ambiguities, or the extent of the operation of the Act itself will arise.
           Their titles are proper nouns and therefore commence with a capital letter, for
             example, the Goods Act 1951. Similarly, the word `Act' is a noun and always begins
             with a capital `A'.

How do the courts determine the meaning of an Act or regulation?

Because Acts and regulations are made up of words, you don't give a great deal of thought
to their purpose in a sentence. Remember the example above of `false and misleading'
versus `false or misleading'? Substitute `or' for `and' and vice versa in a paragraph and
note the difference. Now, what happens with Acts and regulations? Can you have similar
problems with the meaning of a section in an Act or regulations? The answer is `yes'. So
how do the courts deal with this type of problem?

To assist the courts (and you) there are rules for interpreting legislation. It is useful
knowledge to have when you are in business because of the increasing role of statutory
regulation by the three levels of Parliament in PNG in how business is to be conducted.

The tools available to the courts to use when the question of statutory interpretation arises
include:

   rules of statutory interpretation (see for example, s 109(4) of the Constitution of the
      Independent State of PNG 1975)

   Interpretation Act 1975
   maxims (or aids to construction), and
   precedent.

In Gari Baki v Allan Kopi[2008] PGNC 251, N4023 the then Deputy Chief Justice Sir
Salamo Injia at [16]:3 suggested the correct approach insofar as the principles of statutory
interpretation were concerned was settled:

      "The Court must give effect to the legislative intention and purpose expressed in the
      language used in the statute. If the words used in the statute are clear and unambiguous,
      the Court must adopt the plain and ordinary meaning of those words. There is no need for
      the Court to engage in any statutory interpretation exercise. If the words are not so clear or
      ambiguous, the Court must construe the words in a fair and liberal manner in ascertaining
      their meaning and give an interpretation which gives meaning and effect to the legislative
      intention in the provision. The purpose of words or phrases used in question should be read
      and construed in the context of the provision as a whole. The Court should avoid a technical
      or legalistic construction of words and phrases used in a statutory provision without regard
      to other provisions which give context and meaning to the particular word (s) and phrases in
      question."

If the meaning and intention of the legislature is clear in the statute, the courts need to do
no more than give effect to those words in the context of the Act.

An example of the literal approach can be found in the English case Fisher v Bell [1961] 1
QB 394 (the citation stands for Volume 1, QB stands for Queen's Bench and 394 the page
number of that volume), at that time the Restriction of Offensive Weapons Act 1959(UK)
23 | ORIENTATION

made it an offence for a shopkeeper to display a flick knife in a shop window, the relevant
section stating `Any person who sells, lends or gives a flick knife to any other person
commits an offence.'

The court concluded in this case that the shopkeeper was inviting people like yourself who
might have been walking past the shop to make an offer if they wanted a flick knife - that
is, a sale would only be made if the shopkeeper accepted your offer. So, no breach of the
Act occurred because you didn't go into the shop and make an offer to the shopkeeper. As
an aside, the case was also interesting because selling a flick knife was a criminal offence
and the court applied contract law to see whether an offence had occurred.

However, if the words in the Act lead to an absurdity, injustice, or repugnancy, or the
words or phrases are ambiguous, vague, or uncertain, the courts today look at what the
statute was intended to remedy and attempt to choose a meaning that will try and avoid an
inequitable result but looking at what was Parliament's purpose or intention in passing the
Act or regulations in the first place.

The courts will try and interpret the words in the legislation in a way that will help the
legislation achieve its purpose where - for example, a literalist approach may leave the
words ineffective and defeat the purpose of the legislation. The purpose rule was given pre-
eminence by s 39(2) of the National Constitution, directing the courts to consider the objects
and purposes of an Act when interpreting its provisions.

                             Act 1960 (UK) read:

                             `If in any case, owing to the presence of a motor
                             vehicle on a road, an accident occurs whereby ...
                             damage is caused to a vehicle ... other than that
                             motor vehicle the driver of the motor car shall stop'

Does a literal reading give you a sensible result? What was the purpose of the section or
intention of Parliament?

The UK Parliament repealed the Road Traffic Act 1960 (UK) in 1988 with the Road Traffic
Act 1988 (UK). It now requires that a driver involved in an accident has a:
                                                                                                                                       ORIENTATION | 24

                   with requirement of compulsory insurance

               172. Duty to give information as to identity of driver etc in certain circumstances."

Is the Road Traffic Act 1988 Act clearer to you now than the Road Traffic Act 1960 Act? Can
you find similar legislation in PNG? Don't forget to check not only for relevant statutes but
also regulations such as the PNG Road Traffic Rules - Road User Rules 2017.

One final comment on Acts and regulations is that they generally carry their own definitions
of terms. They are set out in a definition section that appears either at the beginning of the
Act or regulation at the end as a Schedule. These are often terms that recur throughout the
various sections of the statute and that the draftsperson felt needed clarification.

The use of extrinsic evidence

The courts may refer to extrinsic (external) material in the interpretation of provisions of Acts
and regulations, such as:

   parliamentary debates
   headings, margin notes and end notes of the legislation under scrutiny
   reports of Royal Commissions, Law Reform Commissions and committees of inquiry

      that have been tabled in Parliament
   treaties or other international agreements referred to in the Act
   any explanatory memorandum attached to the bill
   any document declared by the Act to be relevant, and
   anything recorded in the official reports of the proceedings of Parliament.

Maxims

Maxims are not rules of law but, rather, are aids or guides to construction. While the
draftsperson tries to define words in such a manner that every possible interpretation is
covered, no definition can be exclusive or perfectly describe a class of people, things or
acts.
25 | ORIENTATION

There are several maxims available to help the courts determine the meaning of a word or
phrase, although the all-important matter is to consider the purpose of the legislation. Two
of the more important maxims are:

   noscitur a sociis (`it is known from its associates'), and

   ejusdem generis (`of the same kind, class, or nature').

Noscitur a sociis

Noscitur a sociis, or the context rule, means that the words of a statute are to be construed
in the light of their context. For example, in the English case of R v Ann Harris (1836) 173
ER 198, the words `If any person unlawfully and maliciously shall shoot at any person, or
shall, by drawing a trigger, or in any other manner, attempt to discharge any kind of loaded
arms at any person, or shall unlawfully and maliciously stab, cut, or wound any person with
intent in any of the cases aforesaid to maim, disfigure, or disable such person or to do some
other grievous bodily harm to such person . . .' were considered by the court to cover only
wounding by a weapon, not by hands or teeth. Any comment on the decision?

Ejusdem generis

Ejusdem generis is a subset of the rule noscitur a sociis and is known as the class rule.
This rule is used to find a viable meaning for a broad, general word, such as `building',
when that word follows a group of more specific words - for example, `any house, flat, villa,
unit or other building' - and is based on context. In this case we can say that the principle
of ejusdem generis applies. The word `building' is limited to the same class as that which
precedes it--here, places where people live. All the specific words preceding a general
word must form a class. Thus, a reference to `any plant, root, fruit or vegetable production
growing in any garden' does not extend to trees, since there is no class here.

The class rule cannot be used:

   to find the meaning of a word that is of a specific nature
   unless there are two or more specific words before the general word.

Thus, in the case of the phrase `any flat or other building', the class rule does not apply, as
`flat' on its own does not form a class.

Dictionaries

If a word is not defined in the definition section of an Act or regulations, a dictionary can be
                                                                                                                                       ORIENTATION | 26

How do you write a good law essay or answer to a problem
question?

An essay is a common type of assessment for a unit like Business Law. This resource offers
tips and resources to help you plan and write law essays. There are usually two types of
law essays: the problem-styleessay and the theoretical basedessay.

The theoretical based essay may ask you to critically discuss a new piece of legislation or
a recent case in relation to existing laws or legal principles. You may also be asked to take
a side in an argument or discuss the wider societal implications of a legal outcome.

Problem-style essays require you to advise a party based on the analysis of a scenario or
given problem. You will be required to identify the legal issues and apply relevant law.

Problem questions and essays

Begin by making sure you understand the question. It sounds obvious but read the question
a couple of times and if you are still not sure please ask your tutor for assistance.

As you read the question, consider the following points (and use a highlighter to mark up
what you consider to be key issues):

   Read the lecturer's instructions before you start to look at the question and note down:
          the due date, and
          the word limit. If you go over the word limit you may get penalised; if you go too
            far under there is a possibility that you haven't covered everything.

   What is the question asking you to do, for example, critically analyse, discuss,
      explain? Is it an essay or problem-based question?

   Think about what general area/s of law the question is focussed on? An essay
      question will tell you, but a problem-based question will leave you to work out what the
      relevant area of law is.

Answering a problem question or essay

In a problem question, you are normally given a fact situation and asked to explain what the
legal outcome would or should be. There might be one issue or a series of issues in the one
scenario. Hence the reason to read the question carefully a couple of times.
27 | ORIENTATION

If the question is a problem question, most Universities in Australia have adopted the IRAC
(Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion) method or style. In using this method, you will:

   Identify the legal ISSUE/S that arise in the question, stating the legal conclusion that
      needs to be reached and connecting it to the relevant facts in the question.

   Identify and explain the relevant legal RULES that apply in this problem - that is, what
      general law/s or test/s apply. You are not arriving at a conclusion at this point though.

   APPLICATION of the legal rules is where you are going to explain how the legal
      principles (RULES) can be applied to the facts. It is not enough to state the rules. You
      must link the rules to the facts.

   In your CONCLUSION concisely state the outcome of each issue you identified in the
      problem. This is based on the application of the rules to the facts. Then provide an
      overall judgment. DO NOT MENTION ANYTHING NEW. Your conclusion should
      explain to the reader why you have come to this final judgment.

Answering essay questions

Plan the essay

Begin by making a plan. Consider the topic and make sure that you understand it. Think
about what the question is asking you to do. It may be necessary to have done some
reading around the topic before you can understand the issue/s. But having a plan will help
you with the structure and order of discussion of the essay when you come to write it

Just as an aside, the aim of background reading is to help you understand the context of the
assignment question. Begin with general sources first and then more specific ones. Take
notes as you go along as that helps you to understand different arguments and issues, or
information and context, relevant to the essay. And a tip here is to be sure when taking
notes that you make a note of the source so that you can correctly cite it in your essay.
Remember you don't want to be accused of plagiarising.

Don't forget that the purpose of an introduction is that it should be an outline of the structure
of the essay and prepare the reader for the topic. This should include the central argument
of your essay and the key arguments which will form the main part of the essay. Its purpose
is to make the reader want to read on and see whether they agree with what you are going
to argue.

Structuring your answer

A key element of a successful law essay is the structure. A good structure will enable you
to communicate your ideas fluently and efficiently and is an important skill in business.
                                                                                                                                       ORIENTATION | 28

Make a list of key and supporting arguments and decide on their order. Generally, your
essay requires an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. Try and use headings
and sub-headings (three to six words) in the main body of the essay for each of your
supporting arguments. This helps the reader to see where you are taking them (and it helps
you ensure that you have covered everything you wanted to cover).

The advantage of using sub-headings is that it not only helps in providing structure to your
writing but it also provides you with a structure to follow. If you are struggling to know at
this stage what the exact content for each paragraph will be, simply list relevant material
you have found while reading, and list any cases and sections of statutes/regulations which
may support your arguments in each paragraph.

Try and have one idea per paragraph and aim to keep the paragraphs shorter than what
you probably would have written in high school or other Faculties.

Conclusion

Do not introduce any new material into your Conclusion. The Conclusion reviews what
you have written for the question. It should begin by rephrasing or restating the main
argument/s of the essay butin a different way. It summarises the essay's main arguments,
gives final thoughts about the topic, and provides closure for the reader. If you are struggling
to write an Introduction, try writing the Conclusion and then writing the Introduction last.

Achieving success

In order to do well, plan your work so that you can complete the final draft a few days
before it is due for submission. This gives you time to ensure that your essay reflects good
academic standards and is not an example of last-minute hasty work. Make sure footnotes
are included, citations are correct, headings and subheadings are appropriate, that the
essay is in `plain English', and that there are no grammar or spelling mistakes.

Always try and get a third party to proofread your work before you submit it. When we
proofread our own work, we often don't see spelling or grammatical errors because we are
seeing the text from our memory and not what is written in front of us. Get a friend to check
your work for you.

Markers highly value closely edited and proofed work. Poor grammar and/or spelling
mistakes can be extremely costly as the marker has to struggle to understand what the
writer is saying. A lot of marks can be lost here. Good students write in clear and concise
English that is easily understood.

        Summary

This introductory chapter was originally intended to be a brief chapter on helping you
navigate your way through a range of commercial law topics that you need to have an
understanding of if, first, you want to pass easily, and secondly, which you can use later on
in business or your personal life.

The problem was that to understand areas such as negligence (a tort), contract law,
consumer protection and agency you really needed to understand that reading is terribly
important. The more you read, the better you will understand. But even while the more
reading you do is great, you must also understand the importance of the use of words
like `and' and `or', `must' and `may', and so on, and as you read you can appreciate their
importance.

You also need to understand where the law comes from, hence the reason why we have
included a commentary on the courts and help with how to find a ratio and obiter as they
form the basis of common law, as well as how to interpret Acts and regulations.

What you need to understand at the end of the day is the role law plays in your lives and
that ignorance of the law is no excuse.

        Introduction

This chapter contains background information on the PNG legal system. It is not exhaustive
as we would need a book for that, but it will provide you with a basic understanding of
what is `law', how laws are made, its role, the major and minor types of laws that make up
the PNG legal system and understanding the role of Parliament and the importance of the
Constitution. This chapter has been divided into 6 parts to make it easier to understand,
however it is not exhaustive.

Part 1: Why is an understanding of law important in
business and life?

This chapter will help you understand your legal system and how it impacts on you both
in business and your personal life. The interesting thing about the law is that you and it
are in almost constant contact every day but, like a lot of people, you don't realise it and
understand it. So here is a question to think about: is a basic understanding of the law such
a foolish thing?

What is the importance of the law as a regulatory tool in society
and business?

Law is basically a device to regulate the economic and social behaviour of people like you
who live in a society. If people lived in complete isolation and didn't carry on any economic
activity or recognise any superior authority, there would be little or no need for laws to exist
because there would be little to regulate or control. Think about life in a remote village in
the Highlands and then about life in a city like Port Moresby. Is there the same level of
regulatory control in both, or needed in both?
                                                                                                                           LEGAL FOUNDATIONS | 32

In most nations around the world, people don't live in complete isolation and business
activity is carried on regardless of whether people like it or not. If you live in a city or town,
you depend on the existence of businesses for work and money, and for the purchase of
goods and services for your survival. What do you think would happen if there were no rules
to regulate business or what you could do as a member of the community? This is where
the law comes in.

The law, as a regulatory device, provides the mechanism for society to function by
prioritising needs and desires through tools such as legislation (Acts and regulations of
Parliament) and custom or customary law.

When you look more closely at the PNG legal system, it has what can be best described
as a dual legal system with a formal court system and a customary court system which
generally applies in two broad areas: marriage and land ownership. The latter is recognised
by the PNG Government because many villages, for example, in the Highlands, prefer to
resolve disputes in a traditional way rather than more formally through the courts.

Can we define the term `law'?

We should begin by trying to explain what the term `law' means. In trying to do this just
accept that it is not easy as evidenced by the numerous unsuccessful attempts to produce
a universally acceptable definition of `law' over the centuries. Yet, despite this lack of
agreement on a precise definition of `law', it is still possible to identify two common themes:

   control by humans like us; and
   human conduct, regulated by a superior authority or power--in this case the

      government of PNG and the elders of villages.

So, let's not be too academic and go for a general definition:

. . . a set of rules developed over a long period of time regulating people's interactions with
each other, which sets standards of conduct between individuals and other individuals, and
individuals and the government, and that are enforceable through sanctions.

In the case of PNG, `the supreme laws' are contained in The Constitution and Organic
Laws (which have the status of constitutional law see section 11 (s 11) of the National
Constitution). But in addition, there are rules and principles of conduct that are enacted by
government including the Bougainville Constitution and legislation, organic laws of PNG,
local-level government, decisions of the courts, and customary law.

We should note that when a reference is made to `the law', it is a reference to the body of
law generally, while a reference to `a law' is a reference to a particular legal rule.

     If you have access to the internet, have a brief look at the Constitution of the Independent
     State of Papua New Guinea and see if you can locate section 11 (s 11) as mentioned above.

Are rules always law?

While it is generally true to say that the law is a set of rules, do not assume that all
rules are (or will be) automatically law. There are numerous examples of rules governing
daily behaviour that are not laws and, generally will not become laws--for example, rules
controlling sport, playing games, social behaviour, family behaviour, or how a person should
behave at school and university. The list is endless. But just remember that while these
rules are not intended to be legally enforceable, it does not mean that they cannot finish up
in court in the event of a dispute arising over the rules, particularly in sporting contests.
To determine when a rule becomes law isn't always an easy task. Consideration needs to
be given to where the rule comes from. If it is made by a person or organisation rather than
by parliament or the courts, it generally cannot be said to be a rule of law.
So where do tribal laws fit in? Are they part of the legal system? In the case of PNG, they
are part of custom or customary law and expressly provided for in the Constitution (see
Schedules 1.2 and 2.6 of the National Constitution).
When looking at the `law' in PNG, it should be noted that tribal connections are at the core
of PNG's culture. This is not going to change in a hurry as customary lawhas still got a
significant role to play in the community.

What is the role of the `law' as a regulatory tool?

In society generally, the law as a regulatory tool not only prescribes what people like you
cannot do, it also informs you of what you cando and what you mustdo. For example,
you cannotcommit a crime, but you canown property, and you mustpay taxes. But the law
also plays a number of other roles, such as guaranteeing your freedom, permitting free
                                                                                                                           LEGAL FOUNDATIONS | 34

enterprise, establishing rules for business and commerce, and providing a means to settle
disputes peacefully.

Could business exist without a legal system?

Do you think business, as you know it, could exist without the law? To operate effectively
and efficiently, you need to understand that business needs laws to regulate business
activities, to facilitate business transactions and to settle disputes that can arise between
manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers and consumers (like you) of goods or services.

As we noted at the outset to this chapter, there are very few aspects of life--business or
personal--that are not regulated by law, either directly or indirectly, in developed countries
like Australia.

In countries like Australia, England, America and other developed countries, laws shape
every stage of commercial enterprise. Because people are constantly engaged in business
transactions, an understanding of business law is important and this is equally true in those
areas of PNG where there is commercialisation, as in shops and industry. As you will
discover, the principles of contract law, for example, enable both individuals and businesses
to rely on agreements:

   of employment
   to purchase raw materials
   for the purchase and sale of goods or services
   for the purchase of a home or a business
   to insure property
   for the appointment of an agent
   to catch a bus or to purchase a plane ticket
   to buy food and fuel
   to buy clothes
   to go to the movies, and so on.

So, when things go wrong, they provide a remedy to persons `injured' (they have lost
money or suffered some other form of loss or damage) by another's failure to perform an
agreement.

                   Reflection

     Think about your country for a moment. Do you think PNG is a highly regulated country?
     Look at the type of regulatory frameworks currently in place.

Part 2: What are the sources of law in PNG?

The laws of PNG consist of the National Constitution and any laws made or adopted by it
and the Organic Laws (which together are the supreme law of PNG), Acts (or legislation) of
Parliament, the Provincial Laws, customary law, common law and equity.

Common Law

This is lawcreated through the reported decisions of judges(the doctrine of precedent or
case law) in the higher courts (which in the case of PNG are the National Court and the
Supreme Court). It is non-statutory law and based on decisions that were made about
similar cases in the past. It is law made by the courts, not parliament,and it usually includes
the principles of equity or equity law (or fairness). It has both a criminal and civil jurisdiction.
In a civil case, for example, you have been injured because of the carelessness of another
person, the onus of proof rests on you as the plaintiff to establish on the balance of
probabilities that your claim is stronger than the person who caused the injury (the
defendant). This is a lower burden of proof than required in a criminal case where the onus
is on the Crown to prove a case against an accused beyond reasonable doubt.
The role of the judge in this case is to decide questions of law unless there is no jury (who
would decide questions of fact) although it has become increasingly common for judge only
trials because of the complexity of commercial cases coming before the courts.
The concept of precedent is fundamental to the functioning of the common law system.
Remember that there are two kinds of precedent:

   Binding precedents are past decisions of superior courts which must be followed by
      judges in other similar cases by that court and lower courts in the same jurisdiction (as
                                                                                                                           LEGAL FOUNDATIONS | 36

      long as facts of the case are sufficiently similar)
   Persuasive precedents are ones that should be seriously considered, but which are

      not required to be followed because they might be from a superior court in another
      hierarchy (for example, a decision of an Australian court such as the NSW Court of
      Appeal as it is a different jurisdiction).

The emphasis is on remedies, usually in the form of monetary relief (or compensation) and
is available `as of right' under common law.

Equity

Equity is a separate body of law from common law and in the event of a conflict between
the common law or equity, equity will prevail. It is a discretionary remedy available to the
court when monetary damages, which are a common law remedy, might not achieve a fair
outcome for a plaintiff.

Equity law does not apply to all civil disputes, and it has no application in criminal law.
Where equity might apply is where the injured party (the plaintiff) does not want damages
because it is not `as of right') or where there is an unconscionable dealing by a stronger
party in a contractual situation. Unlike common law, equity is not available `as of right'and it
involves a plaintiff coming to the court in good faith (as in, based on fair dealing and asking
the court to exercise their discretion in granting an equitable remedy.

The two main types of equitable remedy, which are court orders are:

   an injunction: a court order that directs a person to stop doing something that could
      harm the interests of another and may be granted as a temporary order (called an
      interlocutory injunction) before the court makes a final order in the matter, or as a final
      injunction; and

   specific performance: a court order directing a person to carry out an obligation that
      they have accepted, often in a contract--for example, to complete a sale of land. It is
      not available where the contract requires a personal service such as an employment
      contract because of the difficulties created for the court to supervise.

What are the differences between common law and equity?
37 | LEGAL FOUNDATIONS                             Equity
                                                   1. Not a comprehensive system--for example,
 Common law                                        it never had a criminal jurisdiction.

                                                   5. Follows the common law; it will not override
                                                   it except where there is a conflict and then
                                                   equity prevails.
                                                   6. Acts only against the individual (that is, in
                                                   personam), not property.

Statute law

Statute laws are laws made by parliament, such as the National Parliament in PNG, in the
form of statute law or legislation(also known as enacted law) or other government bodies in
the form of by-laws, orders, rules and regulations, and known as delegated legislation.

The laws created by Parliament are the highest ranking in the land, overruling all other laws.
As noted earlier, while statute law assumes the existence of common law, in the event of a
conflict between common law and statute law, the latter will prevail. Common law principles
will be maintained only to the point at which they conflict with statute law.

The reason why statute law prevails is that judges are independent of Parliament (and
the people), while politicians, who are responsible for the making of statute law, are
accountable to the people through the electoral process. If people don't like the laws that the
politicians make in Parliament, they can vote them out at election time. There is, therefore,
a degree of accountability as far as politicians are concerned which is absent in the case of
judges because you can't vote out the judges. A judge can be removed from power only by
reaching the age of retirement, or by misbehaviour or incapacity. It is largely for this reason
that in the event of a conflict between statute law and common law, statute law prevails.

Customary law

Customary law is a body of rules and practices derived from the country's regional customs
and which govern a community and their way of life. In the case of PNG, with its very
diverse society in terms of its cultural practices and customs, each area in PNG has its
own customary laws which, in addition to the western legal system they inherited from
                                                                                                                           LEGAL FOUNDATIONS | 38

European occupation, have been recognised and provided for in the Constitution and are
now a recognized part of the PNG legal system.
So, what is customary law in the context of PNG? Its inclusion in the National Constitution
preamble (Preamble, s 5) and sch 1.2 has established its place within PNG's legal system
and provides a definition:

       `The customs and usages of indigenous inhabitants of the country existing in relation
       to the matter in question at the time when and the place in relation to which the
       matter arises, regardless of whether or not the custom or usage has existed from time
       immemorial.' 
The same definition can also be found in the Interpretation Act 1975, s 1 and in 2000
when the PNG National Parliamentenacted theUnderlying Law Act 2000, which also
incorporated the same definition of customary law in s 1.

Organic law

Organic or fundamental law is a system of laws which form the original foundation of a
government and can include a constitution which is a particular form of organic law.

Organic Laws, which are part of the laws of PNG (see s 9(b) of the National Constitution)
are defined in s 12 of the National Constitution as laws made by Parliament and in terms
of status sit above an Act of Parliament in the context of importance. They can only be
changed or repealed by another Organic Law or by alteration of the Constitution under s 13
and made and certified in accordance with s 14.

     Examples of Organic laws can be found at Papua New Guinea Organic Laws. Anexample
     of an Organic Law is the Organic Law on Provincial Governments and Local-level
     Governments 2014.
39 | LEGAL FOUNDATIONS

Underlying law

Underlying law is a reference to the separate common law of PNG. It is made up of
customary law and the common law of England (including the House of Lords, Court of
Appeal, and the King's Bench) up to PNG's independence in 1975 (Underlying Law Act
2000, s 3(1)).
Underlying Law Act 2000 is an interesting Act as it sets out the sources, application,
formulation and development of underlying law and the roles of the common law and
customary law. It should be noted that insofar as underlying law and its application by the
courts, s 5 provides that `the courts, especially the Supreme Court and the National Court,
shall ensure that, with due regard to the need for consistency, the underlying law develops
as a coherent system in a manner that is appropriate to the circumstances of the country'.

     Time for a break. Give yourself constant breaks so you can have time to reflect on, and
     think about, what you have read. Write down your thoughts because they will form the
     basis of your notes:

             A. Common law ceases to be common law when it becomes codified. What does
             this mean?

             F. What is customary law and why is it important in PNG?

Part 3: What are the characteristics of a legal system?

To be effective and have widespread community acceptance, whether it be in PNG or
anywhere else in the world, a legal system must have the following characteristics:

   clarity and certainty
   flexibility
   fairness and
   accessibility.

Does the legal system provide clarity and certainty?

The law needs to be as clear and certain as possible. It can never be absolute, but it should
be predictable and flexible so that you, and people like you, as well as businesses can
conduct their affairs knowing what the law is (or being able to find out what it is), and what
the consequences of their actions will be if they follow or don't follow the rules.
In part, this need for certainty helps to explain why parliaments are reluctant to pass
retrospective laws (laws that change what people's rights were in the past), as such laws
can have the effect of making an act that was lawful at the time it was done subsequently
unlawful. This, in turn, can produce elements of uncertainty or unpredictability in the
community as well as unfairness in the legal system.
41 | LEGAL FOUNDATIONS

Is the legal system flexible?

If there is to be widespread community acceptance of the law, then the law must be seen
as responsive, and adaptable, to changing circumstances--that is, it must be flexible.

If the law cannot respond or adapt to change in a timely fashion, then there is a real risk
that it will become redundant because it is not meeting the needs of the community it serves
and they will ignore it. Consider, for example, how the law has responded to the rapid
advancement of technology or adjusted to changes in moral values within the community.

Is the legal system fair?

The law must be seen to be fair and just, at least by most members of the community.
If the law is seen as inequitable, unfair, unreasonable or unjust, it will not be accepted or
obeyed by the community. Widespread community rejection of the law inevitably leads to
civil unrest, with members of the community taking it upon themselves to enforce what they
perceive the law to be. In other words, members of the community take the law into their
own hands, for example, the Port Moresby riots in January 2024.

A concept that is closely identified with the law is justice. It is highly desirable that there be
some sort of relationship between law and justice, but do the terms `justice' and `fairness'
mean the same thing? Unfortunately, `justice' can be a difficult term to define. As Lord
Denning(1955: no pagination), one of England's greatest judges, suggested:

       It [justice] is not a product of intellect but of spirit. The nearest we can go to defining
       justice is to say that it is what right-minded members of the community--those who
       have the right spirit within them--believe to be fair.

A legal system embodies what society believes is right or fair. It protects our safety
and protects our rights as members of the community against abuses by other people,
organisations and even the government. In simplistic terms, a legal system is all about
justice and it is supposed to mean that everyone is entitled to be treated fairly.

If a person breaks the criminal law or you are injured because of the actions of another--for
example, someone robs you or the other person is negligent (a law of torts action) or they
breach a contract you have with them--the community assumes that the legal system will
ensure that the person who robbed you will be punished and that the person who injured
you will compensate you for the damage they caused you. It is assumed by the community
(and both parties) that should the matter go to court they will receive a fair trial.

As you are probably aware, there are many different types of laws. In PNG for example,
there are three law-making sources - the National Parliament, the Provincial Parliaments
                                                                                                                           LEGAL FOUNDATIONS | 42

and local or village bodies. But which body do you go to if you want to find out what type
of law might apply to your problem? Be aware that you may have a problem. Many of
the laws currently in force in PNG are outdated, culturally inappropriate, lack operational
effectiveness, are difficult to find, and are no longer relevant or up to date.
Don't believe that the PNG legal system is foolproof and just (or fair), because it is not.
Humans are not foolproof, and nor are you as you make mistakes now and will continue to
do so through life, and as laws are made by humans, they will not be foolproof either. As
our society evolves, it is to be hoped that the legal system will also evolve and that existing
injustices will gradually disappear and be replaced by fairness with the passage of time.

Is the legal system accessible?

The legal system is based on the premise that everyone is expected to know the law,
which explains why it is not possible to argue, in a court of law, ignorance of the law as an
excuse for breaking the law. But given the complexity of the legal system, is this expectation
realistic?
The fact is that no one knows all the law. All we can assume is that everyone has
access to the law. This can be through copies of legislation (for example, through the PNG
government printer and Government Gazette) and cases (for example, law reports), the
Internet, or through a lawyer.

                   Online Reference

     A useful site for PNG case law and legislation (but note that Sessional Legislation is only
     including up to 2021) is Papua New Guinea Primary Materials.

Solving the problem of accessibility doesn't solve the problem of knowledge--that is, that
everyone is expected to know the law. Accessibility doesn't equate with knowledge or
understanding of the legal system. That only comes when you or a business can:

   identify the legal issue
   determine what area of law may apply
43 | LEGAL FOUNDATIONS

   know where to find information about the relevant area of law
   understand the relevant elements of legislation or a case
   be able to understand and interpret what was read
   apply the relevant legal rules to the facts.

A basic understanding of how the legal system operates reduces the possibility of a serious
legal issue arising. But if such a problem arises anyway, an understanding of some basic
legal skills will result in dealing with the problem in an opportune manner for a better result.

                   Revision questions

     Time for another break. Think about what you have just read and try to answer the
     following questions:

             A. What does the phrase `ignorance of the law is no excuse' mean to you?
             B. Is it reasonable to expect that everyone knows the law? Do you? How do you
             overcome this problem?
             C. What are the benefits if you are in business of understanding the different legal
             systems in the world?

Part 4: Why should we classify laws?

An understanding of the main principles underlying each source of law is important when
trying to understand how the law and business interact. But first you need to understand
what area of law may be applicable to the matter you are dealing with.
Law can be classified in different ways depending on the purpose of the classification and
the needs of the classifier. Common classifications include:

   by legal system
   international law and municipal (or domestic) law
   public law and private law
   substantive law and procedural law
   criminal law and civil law.
                                LEGAL FOUNDATIONS | 44

Are there other legal systems?

Do not assume that there is just one or two legal systems in the world of which one is
the PNG legal system. Arguably, there are two major legal systems -- a common law
system (such as in PNG) and a civil law system (such as in Europe and a lot of Asia) --
of the Western world. There are several other legal systems in existence around the world
including dual systems (such as in PNG) which is made up of a formal court system and a
customary court system.

If you are doing business overseas, either as an importer (or exporter or investor), there are
political, economic and legal factors that you have to take into account. Where legal factors
are concerned, you need to consider what legal system you are most likely to encounter.
These legal systems could be any of the following:

Common law system

As noted earlier, the common law system is derived from case law (or precedent) and
legislation. It is accusatorial in form and the burden of proof depends on the type of case. If
it is criminal, the onus is on the Crown to prove their case beyond reasonable doubt while
if it is civil, the burden of proof is on the plaintiff and they must establish their case on the
balance of probabilities.

Civil law system

The civil law system is a comprehensive codified system of law with its origins in Roman
law. In civil law systems, comprehensive legal codes and statutes are designed to cover
every contingency and form the primary source of law. While case law exists in civil law
jurisdictions, it is considered a secondary source and does not have the same influence as
it does in common law systems.

Unlike the common law system, the civil law system follows an inquisitorial approach and
it is the judge who asks questions, gathers evidence, determines the issues to be decided
and applies the law. Juries are rarely involved in civil actions.

Socialist law system

The socialist law system is based on the philosophy of Karl Marx (as in the eradication of
capitalism and the elimination of private ownership). With its emphasis on codes, means
it is really only a variation of civil law but with an emphasis on public law. Like the civil law
system, it is a complete code of written laws whose primary source of law is legislation.
While it is inquisitorial in form and judges dominate trials, courts are subordinate to the
legislature. It applies to more than 30 per cent of the world's population.
45 | LEGAL FOUNDATIONS

Islamic law system

Islamic law system has its roots in religious doctrine, particularly relying on the Koran (or
Qur'an) which is the central religious text of Islam and believed by Muslims to be the literal
words of God and, a complete code of conduct that provides guidance through life. In
addition, there is the hadith (or Sunnah) which are the decisions and sayings of the prophet
Muhammad.

Religion and Islamic law are intertwined to greater and lesser degrees depending on the
country. What should be noted is that Sharia (which means the "correct path "in Arabic)
isn't the same as Islamic law. While Islamic law is influenced by local customs and evolves
over time, it is important to understand that Islamic laws are based on interpretations of
sharia. The emphasis is on divine revelation and while it coexists with other laws, Islamic
law encourages disputes to be resolved outside the court through arbitration (tahkim) and
mediation (sulh). As an aside, it is interesting to note that where contract law is concerned,
the emphasis is on fairness.

Islamic law applies to approximately 25 per cent of the world's population with most of the
world's almost 50 Muslim majority countries having laws that refer to sharia.

Hybrid and dual law systems

Several countries have mixed legal systems which incorporate common, civil, and religious
law systems into what is effectively a hybrid system that is unique to the country's needs.

As noted at the start to this section, PNG currently has a system that can be described
as a dual legal system because it is made up of a formal court system and a customary
court system. Currently, the dual system of law is not applicable to all sections of law.
Generally, it applies to only two broad areas: marriage and land ownership, but this is not
to say that the role of customary law within the legal system will not gradually increase over
time with the growth of an indigenous Melanesian jurisprudential influence, as enshrined in
the preamble of the national Constitution as goal number 5 of the Five National Goals and
Directive Principles.

Why is knowledge of a legal system important?

The purpose of providing an overview of some of the world's legal systems is to provide you
with a better understanding of some of the complexities involved when dealing with other
nation-States, since no two legal systems are the same.

                   Video reference

     Why do countries trade? Look at this short video about what makes an economy grow.

Familiarity with the political and economic status, and the legal system, of a potential trading
partner is essential. Businesses must abide by the local rules and regulations of the States
in which they operate. Governments make and enforce the rules and regulations based
on their political beliefs and ideologies. So, you may want to assess at least the following
matters when assessing risk:

   How stable is the government?
   What sort of government is it - democracy dictatorship?
   Is the prospective country politically stable?
   What impact does the prospective State's political system have, if any, on the

      economy and, how may it impact on you, your firm and industry?
   What sort of legal system does the prospective State? Will you need to assess how

      local policies, rules and regulations will affect your business?
While all nation-States have a legal system, it is important to remember that there will
always be differences in local policies, rules and regulations. You need to assess the level
47 | LEGAL FOUNDATIONS

of risk involved, balancing political, economic and legal realities with the need to control and
manage trade.

In addition to the different types of legal systems, two further classifications of law are:

International law and municipal (or domestic) law

International law is that body of law concerned with regulating, for the most part, the conduct
between nation-States. Nation-states like PNG could not enjoy the benefits of trade and
commerce, exchange of ideas, or even normal routine communication without some system
of international law and, it is only the nation-State which enter into international trade
treaties and agreements with other Nation States that must abide by international law.

Three of the better-known trade agreements with PNG is a member are:

   GATT -- the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is a multilateral treaty that aims
      to encourage free trade in goods and PNG has been a member since 1994 (and a
      member of the World Trade Organisation or WTO since 1996)

   theVienna Sales Convention -- this is a multilateral treaty that sets out standards of
      conduct for sales agreements between traders of signatory countries and PNG has
      been a member since December, 1994

   APEC -- Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation is a regional treaty that provides special
      trading advantages to its 21 member states. PNG has been a member since 1993.

Municipal (or domestic) laws come from statute orcase law. They regulate the relations
or conduct between individuals(or natural persons) and organisations legal persons) that
come within the nation state's borders. This doesn't mean that the individual or organisation
must be a citizen of the state making the law, just that it must be within the nation state's
borders. For example, if you live in PNG, you are subject to the municipal or domestic laws
of PNG. But if you visit Australia, you become subject to the municipal or domestic laws of
Australia.

Public law and private law

Public law is concerned with the organisation of government and the relationship that exists
between the government and the people. The areas of law that form part of public law --
such as administrative law, constitutional law, criminal law, industrial law and taxation --
are areas in which the public has a determining interest.

Private law is concerned with those areas of the law that deal with situations involving
disputes over rights and obligations between people or organisations. There are numerous
branches of private law, but some of the more important areas that are relevant to business
                                                                                                                           LEGAL FOUNDATIONS | 48

that you will encounter (and will discover in the following chapters) include contract law,
commercial law, negligence (law of torts), consumer law and agency. But do not think
that this list is an exhaustive list of areas of law relevant to business because it is not. It
does not included areas such as corporations law, partnerships, property law, negotiable
instruments, trusts, and taxation to mention but a few.

Is a knowledge of criminal law important?

To date the focus has been on civil law but it would be wrong to assume that criminal law
is something you don't need to worry about in business. There is an increasing amount
of legislation relevant to business that carries criminal penalties, particularly in the area of
corporations, work health and safety and consumer protection.

Note that insofar as Criminal Law is concerned, unlike a civil law action brought by a
plaintiff, the action is brought by the Crown on behalf of `the people' (not the police, as they
enforce the law) against a `person' for the commission of an act that the state considers to
be a crime and that should be punishable by a penalty (for example, a fine or jail) if it can
establish its case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. Note that there is a higher
degree of proof than is required in a civil case, where the plaintiff must only prove their case
on the balance of probabilities.

In addition to the criminal sanctions that can be found in the criminal law legislation of
PNG, an increasing amount of business-related legislation also carries what are known as
civil penalties (also known as pecuniary penalties or fines) where there is a breach by a
corporation (corporate crime) or an individual (if it is an employee, white-collar crime).

Civil penalties are reserved for conduct that falls short of criminal behaviour. The legislation
provides for pecuniary penalties for conduct that falls short of criminal behaviour, but without
the stigma attached to a criminal conviction, as (for the purposes of the law) an offence has
not been committed.

Civil penalty proceedings generally require proof only to the standard of the balance of
probabilities unless there are serious allegations of impropriety, in which case the court
must be satisfied to a higher standard of proof. An example of where civil penalties can
be found is the Companies Act 1997 -- Part XXII, s 413 where corporations, directors and
managers may incur criminal or pecuniary (fine) penalties for breaches of the Companies
Act 1997.
49 | LEGAL FOUNDATIONS

                   Online reference

     The Companies Act 1997is a good example of an Act which can impose a civil penalty on
     a corporation or senior management for, in this case, a failure to comply with the
     Companies Act 1997.

Who is a `person' in law?

All rules of law are concerned with the activities of persons. You will probably think of people
or humans, but you would only be partly correct. For the purposes of the law, the reference
to a `person' includes not only human beings but also entities or organisations, which can
have rights and obligations in much the same way as natural persons. Examples of entities
include the Crown, companies and incorporated associations.

                   Revision questions

     It's time for another break. Here are some more questions for you to consider. Remember
     to write down your thoughts for your notes.

             A. Explain why an understanding of different legal systems around the world might
             be useful for you in business.
             B. Why do you think it important to know what the term `person' means in law?
             C. Why is it important to understand the difference between international and
             domestic law in business?
             D. Why do you think an understanding of the main principles underlying each
                                                                                                                           LEGAL FOUNDATIONS | 50

             source of law is important when trying to understand how the law and business
             interact?

Part 5: What is PNGs political structure?

There are three tiers of government: national, provincial and local. If you wish to establish
a business in PNG, you may need to consider the Acts, regulations and policies of all three
levels of government, but note that finding up-to-date copies of legislation is time consuming
and difficult.

The Doctrine of Separation of Powers

When PNG became independent it adopted a Westminster system of government as a
constitutional democracy. Section 99 of the PNG Constitution provides for the separation of
powers doctrine which provides for three arms of government, namely: the Executive (the
Prime Minster and Cabinet), the Legislature (Parliament), and the Judiciary (the courts).
Each arm has their own area of responsibility, and they keep a check on the actions of the
others to prevent a concentration of power of any one branch, and to provide for checks
and balances for effective and efficient government.

The separation of powers, together with the principle of `responsible government', provide
a guide for how laws are made and managed. Responsible government means that a
party (or a coalition of parties) must have the support of a majority of members of the
House to form a government (the Executive or Prime Minister and Cabinet). As noted in
the last paragraph, this provides a check on the Executive and ensure accountability to
Parliament. In addition, the Constitution vests the power of judicial review on the Supreme
Court over both the legislation passed by Parliament and the actions of the Executive to
ensure legislation passed by parliament, and the actions of the Executive government,
comply with the Constitution.

National Government

PNG's National Government is a single or unicameral national parliament(there is no Upper
House or Senate) that operates a multi-parliamentary democracy nationally. It has 118
members who are elected for 5 year terms, 96 of whom are from constituencies and 22
from single member provincial electorates (on election, each of the single members also
becomes a governor of their province unless they become a Minister). It is a constitutional
51 | LEGAL FOUNDATIONS

monarchy with a Head of State (King Charles III), who is represented by a governor-general
nominated by parliament who performs mainly ceremonial duties.

The PNG Constitution was adopted in 1975 and has been amended at least 43 times
since then reflecting that it is essentially the product of a political process. Unlike western
countries PNG has dozens of small political parties with no-one party getting enough votes
to govern in its own right, which has resulted in a fluid party system and a lack of well-
developed policy framework.

The Constitution and the Organic Law regulate the law-making powers of the National
Parliament and can be found at Part VI of the Constitution and s 41 of the Organic Law on
Provincial Governments and Local-level Governments 2014. While provincial and local or
village governments have specific powers, they are subject to the national law but only to
the extent that the national interest requires, otherwise they have relative autonomy.

Interestingly, as part of a constitutional review process the Constitution was reviewed by
the Constitutional and Law Reform Commission (CLRC) in relation to its form and system
of government. The CLRC report to the government was submitted in December 2023 but
the report is still to be released and whether and what changes it might bring remains to be
seen. Currently, the National Government is responsible for foreign investment, exchange
control, immigration, trading and financial corporations, banking, most taxation, customs
and excise, shipping and overseas trade.

Provincial Governments

There are 21 separate provinces and a National Capital District (which is similar to a
provincial government) within PNG. Their powers are delegated to them by the National
Government but note that as the powers of the Provincial governments are delegated to
them, they are subordinate to the National Government.

Powers of the Provincial Governments include agriculture, fishing, trade and industry, land
and land development, forestry and natural resources, rural health, transportation, village
and urban or community courts (but not jurisdiction), commissions of inquiry, with limited
revenue raising powers to impose sales and services tax.

Local and village Governments

Local and village governments are enshrined in the national Constitution and the Organic
Law at Part VIA, s 187I of the Constitution while ss 26, 27, 28 and 44 of the Organic
Law on Provincial Governments and Local-level Governments 2014 and the Local-Level
Governments Administration Act 1997 provide the legal basis for the 336 local-level
                                                                                                                           LEGAL FOUNDATIONS | 52

governments (LLGs). The Minister of Provincial and Local Government Affairs is
responsible for local government.
The powers of LLGs are subject to the national law and provincial governments, but only
to the extent that the national or provincial interest so requires. A council will represent
several villages andmanage and administer the area that is under its control including
labour and employment, provision of water and electricity, local trading and the local
environment, some revenue-raising powers, and jointly with provincial governments, for
health and environmental protection, waste disposal, roads and economic promotion.

     the National Government and the Provinces and LLGs.

Part 6: Do I need to know the National Constitution?

Hopefully you are now aware that the Constitution and the Organic Laws are the supreme
law of PNG and that, subject to s 10 of the Constitution (construction of written laws), all
Acts that are inconsistent with it are invalid to the extent of any inconsistency. You don't
need to know the National Constitution of by heart, but it is useful to be aware of what it
contains because it is the most important document in your legal system.

                   Reflection questions

     Time to take a break from reading and think about the following questions:
             A. What reasons can be put forward to explain why the PNG National Constitution
             has undergone change at least 43 times since its inception in 1975?
             B. What do you think is the purpose of having a Constitution? Do we even need
             one?
             C. Is the Constitution too complicated and should it be simplified? Explain why?
             D. If you had the power, what would you change in the Constitution? Explain why?

       Key points

An understanding of the following points, coupled with your answers to the Revision
Questions, will help you to better revise material in this chapter and should form the basis
for your notes. Don't try to memorise what you read but rather focus on understanding the
material.

   What is law? There is no universally accepted agreement on `what is law', but a
      starting point is that the law is a set of rules, developed over a long period of time,
      regulating people's interactions with one another.

   What is Organic Law? Organic Laws regulate the legislative powers of the National,
      Provincial and Local Governments of PNG and found in ss 41- 44 of the Constitution.
      The Constitution and the Organic Powers are the supreme law of PNG and all
      legislation that is inconsistent with the supreme law is invalid and void to the extent of
      any inconsistency.

   What are rules, and what is law? It does not automatically follow that rules are
      always law. To determine whether a rule is law, consider where it came from, how it
      deals with the person who has broken the rule, and the type of penalty that is handed
                                                                                                                           LEGAL FOUNDATIONS | 54

      down.
   What are the various classification of law? Laws may be classified in a number of

      ways, including:
          the common law system (based on precedent and statute law) and the civil law
            system (based on a code-based system)
          customary law(laws that exist within tribal communities established through
            cultural or societal norms that existed before European occupation of PNG)
          international law (which regulates conduct between states) and municipal or
            domestic law (a state's internal laws)
          public law (concerned with the organisation of government and with the
            relationship that exists between people and the government--for example,
            constitutional law, industrial law, taxation)
          private law (concerned with relations between natural and legal persons--for
            example, contract law, torts law, property law, company law); and
          substantive law (actual rights and duties under the law) and procedural law
            (the rules of civil and criminal procedure, and evidence).

   What is the distinction in common law between civil law and criminal law? Civil
      law involves an action between individuals, where the plaintiff (who starts the action)
      has to establish, on the balance of probabilities, that their case is the more believable
      than that of the defendant and aims at compensating them. Criminal law involves an
      action brought by the state, with the state having to establish beyond reasonable
      doubt that the accused has committed a wrong for which they should be punished.

   What are the major and minor sources of law that together make up the PNG
      legal system? Three major types of laws are common law, equity and statute law,
      while minor types include customary law.

57 | THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE

       Key terms

Here are some terms you will encounter in this Chapter, which will help you understand the
topic of negligence:

          Contributory negligence: negligence by the plaintiff that has contributed to their
            loss, damage or injury.

          Negligence: an indirect interference with the person or property of the plaintiff.
          Negligent misstatement: a false or inaccurate statement of fact made by a

            person recklessly or knowingly that there were no reasonable grounds for such a
            belief.
          Occupier's liability: as an occupier of premises, whether you own or rent, if you
            have control over the property, you must take reasonable care to ensure anyone
            who comes onto your premises is reasonably safe, although what is reasonable
            will vary according to the circumstances.
          Product liability: as far as manufacturers are concerned, at common law they
            owe a duty of care to consumers who purchase their goods and that the goods
            are fit for purpose. There is an overlap here with the Goods Act 1951 and the
            Independent Consumer and Competition Act 2002 which provide protection for
            the consumer.
          Res ipsa loquitor (`the facts speak for themselves'): a doctrine that provides
            that the elements of duty, breach and damage can sometimes be inferred from
            the nature of the accident even though the exact act of negligence cannot be
            exactly identified.
          Strict liability: liability regardless of fault where the defendant is held liable even
            though they were not at fault.
          Tort: a civil wrong other than a claim for a breach of contract.
          Vicarious liability: where a person is held responsible for the acts or omissions
            of another even though they may not have personally been at fault (for example,
            employer and employee).
          Voluntary assumption of risk: where the plaintiff freely and voluntarily
            understood and assumed the risk that caused the injury.
                                                                                                                   THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE | 58

        Introduction

Just note that when reading this chapter that you, the reader, will be treated as being the
plaintiff unless otherwise stated.

Chapter 3 begins by considering what a tort is and the basis on which it operates; that is,
through compensation for the injured party. It then looks at the function of the law of tort,
the principles on which the law of tort rests, and the rights protected by the law of tort.
The chapter then moves on to consider in more detail what is perhaps the most important
area of tort law: negligence, and in particular how it relates to business, but also to you
personally if you or your property is damaged by the actions of another party because of
their carelessness (or negligence), for example, a car accident. This chapter then finishes
by providing a brief overview of seven torts that have been absorbed into negligence
including: vicarious liability; occupier's liability; product liability; negligent misstatements;
strict liability; breach of statutory duty; and the rule in Rylands v Fletcher.

Part 1: Why is an understanding of the tort of negligence
important?

The law of torts is an area of the law that can become relevant for you, and your business,
often when you least expect it but only aftera loss-making event has occurred. It is a legal
wrong where one person or entity injures the person or property of another person and for
which the usual remedy is an award of damages. For example, you go to the local shop to
get milk and as you enter the shop you slip and fall on a wet floor where another customer
had dropped a bottle of dishwashing detergent which the staff of the shop owner were still
to clean-up. You break your hip. Can you get compensation?
This is the sort of scenario where a knowledge of the law of torts may come to your
assistance. This is what we lawyers call a classic negligence action and it may enable you
to recover compensation in the form of damages. Just as a matter of interest, who would
you sue, if anyone? And if you were the shop owner, wouldn't this be a situation where it
would have been a good idea to have liability insurance?

                   Video reference
59 | THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE

     For an interesting overview of Torts watch this video on Principles of Justice - Tort Law.

While not every event is foreseeable (or not far-fetched or fanciful), a lot of potential injury
causing or loss-making events can be avoided by establishing good business practice.
This means being proactive and taking the type of steps that a reasonable personin
business might take if they were in a similar position and understanding what the legal
consequences might be if such steps were not taken.

                     Business tip
       Insurance pays
       One of the features of tort law is that a person or business who is at fault should bear
       the consequences of their actions. In a negligence action this can be catastrophic for
       the wrongdoer, and beyond their ability to pay. The financial cost of a tort action is
       meant to deter others from intentionally causing harm. But the growth of liability
       insurance cover has largely negated this fear. Today, a potential wrongdoer knows that
       they can take out insurance cover against potential business risk. Any monetary loss or
       damage that a victim may suffer because of their actions will be borne by the
       insurance company rather than the business or individual.

What types of tort actions are there?

Just so you are aware, Tort law is not just about negligence (though you might think so). It
is the most common of tort actions, other tort actions include:

   liability for a breach of duty to take reasonable care (negligence)
   liability arising out of occupation or possession of property (occupier's liability and

      part of negligence as well as private nuisance)
   direct interferences with the person, property or goods of another (trespass)
   liability for misrepresentations that affect a person's reputation and standing in the
                                                                                                                   THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE | 60

      community (defamation), or which cause financial loss (negligent
      misrepresentation)
   interference with contractual relationships (inducing breach of contract, conspiracy
      or intimidation)
   a fraudulent misrepresentation (if it doesn't form part of a contract, it may amount to
      the tort of deceit); and
   breach of statutory duty (involving motor traffic and work health and safety issues,
      and an action in its own right).

Part 2: What are the general principles of tortious
liability?

The word `tort' is a French word and it means `civil wrong'. It is a type of behaviour by
an individual (sometimes called a `tortfeasor' but more often a `defendant'), in the form of
an act or omission not authorised by law that causes loss, damage or injury to another
individual (such as yourself and who we call a plaintiff), their property, business or economic
interests.

The law of torts is about the infringement of an individual's rights and the protection
of those rights.If a person has suffered a loss or damage (which the law describes as
`harm') because of something that another person has done--or if they have suffered
damage because of something that other person should have done but didn't--then the law
of torts determines whether the injured person is entitled to seek a remedy for that loss
or damage from the wrongdoer. That remedy is usually in the form of compensation or
monetary damages.

                     Business tip
       Do not assume that tort actions always result in the wrongdoer paying for the loss or
       damage suffered by you if you are the victim. In fact, before you commence a legal
       action it pays to do two things:

             first, find out whether you have suffered a `harm' (or injury) that the law
                recognises

             second, can the defendant pay damages plus legal costs? Do they have
61 | THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE

                personal injury or professional indemnity insurance to cover the loss and legal
                costs? If they do not have insurance, do they have sufficient personal assets to
                cover your loss and legal costs?

If the defendant does not have either insurance cover or any assets, it may not be
worth suing.But if you (as the plaintiff) decide that you still want to sue, and the matter
goes to court and you win, can you recover damages from the defendant? The answer is:
`Probably nothing but your lawyers still expect to get paid'. You have to ask yourself whether
it is worth the time and effort to sue. Just as the defendant must take you as the plaintiff as
they find you, so must you take the defendant as you find them.

Win, lose or draw in court, the objectives of the law of torts are basically twofold:

   to protect the rights and interests of you if you are the victim by requiring the
      wrongdoer to rectify your loss or damage (compensation) and

   to impose a burden of rectification on the wrongdoer which will act as a deterrent to
      others who may want to act in a similar way

Just remember that torts are breaches of the civil law, not the criminal law and not to be
confused with the civil law legal system found in Europe and other parts of the world. This
means that if you are the plaintiff:

 1. You commence the action
 2. You have the onus of proof, on the balance of probabilities, that the loss or damage

      you suffered was caused by the actions/omissions of the defendant
 3. You can show that you should be entitled to a remedy for the loss you have suffered.

What is the difference between law of torts and contract law?

In both tort and contract, the law is seeking to regulate a private relationship between two or
more parties, with both (or all) aiming to provide remedies for the loss or damage suffered
by the actions of the wrongdoer.

In tort law, any rights or obligations agreed between the parties are imposed by law, not
as a result of agreement, and they can be enforced only by an injured party. In contract
law, the rights or obligations between the parties are created through their agreement and
                                                                                                                   THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE | 62

are enforceable only by the parties to the contract (and usually then only by the innocent
party).

Damages in both tort and contract law cases generally restore the injured party back to the
position they occupied (were in) before the tortious act or breach of contract occurred. So,
if you are the injured party, how you decide to proceed will generally be influenced by the
sort of outcome you may want.

In contract law, damages are awarded to place you in the position you would have
occupied if the contract had been executed according to the agreement. A contract
law action can also include claims for loss of expected profit and `loss of expectation', which
cannot be included in a tortious claim.

Sometimes the same set of facts can mean that you, as the injured party, may have a
possible action in both tort and contract. For example, if a potential buyer of a business
employs an accountant to advise on the financial viability of purchasing that business and
they fail to do so with due care and diligence, actions may `lie' in both contract and tort law.
In contract, it is an implied term in the contract that the accountant will act with due care and
diligence while in tort the action would be in negligence for breach of their duty of care.

It could be argued that in the contract action there is an `implied' assumption (that is,
one that is not expressed in the contract) that the accountant will exercise due care when
examining the financial statements of the business. If the accountant can be shown to have
failed in carrying out their implied duties appropriately, then the accountant has breached
the contract with the potential purchaser.

The accountant may also have an obligation to the client in tort (in this type of situation, `in
negligence'). As we shall see later in this chapter when considering the tort of negligence,
the starting point for such an action is the relationship between the parties and whether
the accountant owes the potential purchaser a duty of care when it comes to carrying
out their professional responsibilities. The question for the court to determine is whether a
reasonable accountant in the same position would have discovered any anomalies in the
financial statements.

However, having the two possible causes of action does not mean the injured party can
recover damages under each action. Strategically, it gives the plaintiff a better chance of
success because if one action fails, it may be possible to succeed under the other.

What is the difference between tort law and criminal law?

Both tort law and criminal law seek to impose duties on people, but they do it in different
ways and with different outcomes. Yet interestingly, there is an overlap with the two areas
63 | THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE

of law, for example, in the area of trespass to the person where there are three tort actions:
assault, battery and false imprisonment, all of which are also potential criminal offences.

Tort law is private in nature in the sense it is brought by a person who has suffered some
form of loss or damage and who is now seekingcompensationfrom the person who caused
that loss or damage. Criminal law, on the other hand, is principally public in nature, as
breaches are enforced and `prosecuted' by the state, and the outcome for the wrongdoer is
punishment, generally imprisonment and/or a fine.

                                                        contractually

Remedies

The most common `remedy' in a tortaction is monetary compensation or
damages.However, sometimes an injured party, such as yourself, may want some form of
relief other than money. The relief you will be seeking will depend on the type of damage
you have suffered. For example, if it is damage to your reputation, you may be seeking
an injunction (a discretionary equitable remedy) to stop the offending party from causing
further damage to your reputation; or you may seek an order of specific performance (also a
discretionary equitable remedy) directing the other party to carry out their obligations. Both
remedies are discretionary as the court is not obliged to award either of them, even if the
plaintiff wins their case.

Although there may be remedies available to you as a plaintiff, there must be some reason
for shifting the loss from you to the defendant. Sometimes this is not possible because:
                                                                                                                   THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE | 64

   there may be statutory restrictions on what you as the plaintiff may recover (such as
      the civil liability legislation which excludes intentional conduct such as tobacco related
      claims)

   there may be no legal remedy because the harm may have been caused by accident
      or misjudgement

   the claim may be considered too trivial to warrant the attention of the courts
   there may be a complete defence available to the defendant: you knew what the risk

      was and went ahead regardless, and was injured as a result, for example in sport

Also, the fact that you as a plaintiff has suffered `harm' recognised by the law and can shift
the blame for their loss or injury on to the defendant does not automatically mean you will
win your case. Whether you win or not may depend on a number of factors, including:

   the inability to find the tortfeasor
   the difficulty with proving fault on the part of a defendant
   whether the defendant is insolvent or uninsured (recovery of damages is difficult or

      impossible even if a tort is proved if the defendant has no money)
   whether you as the plaintiff has been partly or fully responsible for the damage they

      suffered--that is, contributory negligence or voluntary assumption of risk
   the cost of litigation (can you, as the plaintiff, afford the legal costs if you lose?)
   delay in obtaining compensation, placing pressure on you as the tort victim to settle

      the action before going to court, thereby increasing the chances of under-
      compensation
   difficulties in assessing accurately your actual loss--that is, assessing whether your
      injuries will worsen in the future.

What are the time periods for tort actions?

A criminal law action has no time limitswithin which an action can be brought by the
State. In the case of a tort action, under s 16(1) the Frauds and Limitations Act 1988 an
action you must commence your action within 6 years from the date on which the cause
of action accrued (if the action is against the State, then under the Claims By and Against
the State Act 1996 you have six months from when the claim arose) or the defendant may
be able to argue that your action has become `statute-barred' (that is, the plaintiff cannot
proceed any further with their claim)
65 | THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE

                  Reflection question

     If you are injured because of the actions of another person, would your preference be to
     take action against the person who injured you in tort law or criminal law? Explain why.

Part 3: What is the tort of negligence?

                   Video reference

     A simple introductory video titled Tort of Negligence: Standard of Care that will help you
     understand what negligence is.

As noted earlier, there is a wide range of torts, each covering a different type of `civil wrong'.
However, by far the most important tort is negligence. It is a tort capable of almost infinite
expansion and adaptation, and its impact has been extensive on both business and the
community.

                       In brief
                                                                                                                   THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE | 66

     A definition of negligence
     Negligence is omitting to do something that a reasonable person would do, or doing
     something that a prudent and reasonable person would not do, to prevent harm. It is the
     failure to exercise reasonable care and skill that results in an unreasonable risk of
     foreseeable injury.

For most people, negligence generally means carelessness or thoughtlessness. However,
this is not completely accurate. Careless acts or misjudgements do not necessarily
amount to negligence,and therefore do not necessarily lead to a court action in
negligence. As far as the law is concerned, a person is only liable for harmthat is
a foreseeable consequenceof the defendant's actions; that is, their failure to exercise
reasonable care and skill which causes you injury, which carries legal consequences.
In an English House of Lords case called Lochgelly Iron and Coal v McMullan [1934] AC 1,
Lord Wright described the concept of negligence in the following way:

      In strict legal analysis, negligence means more than needless or careless conduct, whether
      in omission or commission. It properly connotes the complex concept of duty, breach and
      damage thereby suffered by the person to whom the duty was owing.

The origins of negligence are based in the common law, with roots that go back to a case
in Scotland in 1932 involving ginger beer and the remains of a snail in an opaquebottle -
the House of Lords decision in Donoghue v Stevenson[1932] AC 562 marked the beginning
of the modern law of negligence and laid the groundwork for business liability and today's
consumer protection laws.

Part 4: What are the roles of the plaintiff and the
defendant in establishing the elements of negligence in
PNG?

As the plaintiff, you can only commence legal action if you can first establish that
yousuffered harm.`Harm' is broadly defined and includes death, personal injury, damage
to property and economic loss.

What does the plaintiff have to establish?

If you suffer loss or damage (harm) that is recognised by the law as being of a type for
which you should receive compensation (usually damages), then you must establish(on the
balance of probabilities) three(3) criteria or your action fails:

   Step 1: As the plaintiff you must first establish that the defendant owes you a duty of
      care (here the focus is on the foreseeability of causing harm to you as the
      plaintiff). This is essentially a question of law that the judge decides based on
      common law principles.

   Step 2: If the defendant owes you, as the plaintiff, a duty of care, then you must
      establish that the defendant breached that duty of care? This step requires
      establishing what is `a reasonable standard of care', a question of law.

   Step 3: If you can establish breach, then the final step you must establish as the
      plaintiff is that that the defendant's actions caused you, as the plaintiff, to suffer loss
      or damage? The loss or damage must be recognised by law and be factually caused
      by the defendant.

What is the `reasonable person' standard?

To determine fault, the court examines the defendant's conduct and considers it against
a standard of what a `reasonable person' would or would not do in similar circumstances.
The `reasonable person' is someone of normal intelligence, credited with such perception of
the surrounding circumstances and knowledge of other pertinent matters as a reasonable
                                                                                                                   THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE | 68

person would possess in similar circumstances. For example, driving a car requires a
certain set of demonstrable skills and knowledge. The same applies to professional
standards and behaviour, such as expected knowledge, experience and skills. It is this
requirement of reasonableness which has substantially contributed to the flexibility inherent
in the negligence action. It permits social judgments by the courts relevant to the times to
be made within the law-making process.

Once you, as the plaintiff, has established all three elements of duty, breach and damage,
then the onus shifts to the defendant to present their case (although it should be noted that
the defendant will have already argued that they do not owe you a duty of care; or if they
do, then they haven't breached it; or if they have, you did not suffer damage as a result of
their breach).

What does the defendant have to do?

   Step 4: Once you have established your case, the onus shifts on to the defendant
      to establish a defence--again, on the balance of probabilities this could
      be:contributory negligence, voluntary assumption of risk, illegality or inevitable
      accident.

Contributory negligence aside, if the defendant succeeds in establishing a defence, you as
the plaintiff has lost your claim and the case ends at this point. If the defendant can establish
contributory negligence on your part (that is, you failed to take reasonable care for your own
safety), the court can reduce the amount in damages the defendant may have had to pay
by an amount it considers fair and equitable, which can be up to 100 %!

   Step 5: If the defendant fails to establish a defence, or you contributed to your injury
      or loss, that only leaves the court to decide what sort of compensation or damages
      (usually monetary compensation) the plaintiff is entitled to

                   Online reference
69 | THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE

     At this point note that the PNG Magistrates' Manual - Chapter 15 contains an overview of
     key concepts in Tort (and contract).

Let's examine each of these steps in greater detail

It is important to note that each of the three elements, that is, duty of care, breach of that
duty and damage suffered by you as the plaintiff, mustbe established by you.

Step 1: Does the defendant owe a duty of care to you -
the plaintiff?

                   Video reference

     This is quite a good explanation of the first step in deciding whether you have a cause of
     action in negligence. Watch this video titled Personal Injury: Experienced Attorney's
     Outline

A duty of care is the obligation owed by one person (the defendant) to another (the
plaintiff) and is based on the relationship between them. It is perhaps the prerequisite of
all negligence cases because it goes to the heart of liability by examining foreseeability of
potential harm. It is the first question that a plaintiff must establish. In many cases you will
find that the defendant does not argue this element because it is established from previous
case decisions.
To establish a `duty of care', you as the plaintiff must show that the kind of harm you
suffered was reasonably foreseeable and was a result of the act/s or omission/s of
the defendant.One way you can do this is by showing that you were one of the class of
people who would foreseeably be at risk of injury if the defendant failed to take reasonable
care.
                                                                                                                   THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE | 70

The duty concept is a control mechanism and is a question of law (notfact, which
is decided by a jury if there is one) determined by a judge who assesses the particular
facts of each case. Note that duty will only be imposed when it is reasonable in all the
circumstances to do so.
Depending on the facts, cases fall into two categories:

   those where duty is said to be established because the facts fall into a well-
      recognised duty category: for example, motorist-other road-users,
      employer-employee, manufacturer-consumer

   the `novel' cases where the question of whether a duty of care exists is difficult to
      answer and depends on the surrounding facts: for example, in cases of economic
      loss, psychiatric illness and medical negligence

If you cannot show that the defendant owes you a duty of care, the action fails.

Is it safe to drink ginger beer in an opaque bottle?

The starting point for the modern law of negligence was the decision of the English House
of Lords in a case calledDonoghue v Stevenson (1932) AC 562.. It established a general
test for when a defendant owes a duty of care to a plaintiff. Prior to this case, a buyer of a
faulty good who suffered a financial or physical loss could only sue for a breach of contract.

                   Video reference

     Watch this video on Donoghue v Stevenson, preferably while you drink a bottle of ginger
     beer in an opaque bottle with a friend to get really in the mood.

     Think about the following while watching the video and drinking your ginger beer:
           who were the parties (the plaintiff and defendant)?
           Briefly summarise the facts
           State the issue before the court
           Briefly summarise the court's decision. Do you agree with it?
71 | THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE

In a 3:2 decision, the House of Lords held that Donoghue was a `neighbour' to the
manufacturer and bottler of ginger beer (Stevenson), and the one to whom a duty of care
was owed. But why? Stevenson should have reasonably foreseen that careless or negligent
bottling could have harmed a consumer (not necessarily the purchaser).

In this case, Stevenson failed to ensure that consumers such as Donoghue could drink the
contents free of impurities. As a result, she suffered shock from seeing the remains of a
snail, part of which she had consumed, and suffered severe gastroenteritis from drinking
the contaminated ginger beer. Next time you drink from an opaque bottle (or one where you
can't see the contents), think of Donoghue v Stevenson and you can wonder what is in your
drink here?

The court found that Stevenson (the manufacturer) had breached his duty of care to
her by not making sure that his ginger beer was free from impurities. In this case, the
foreseeability test works because the focus is on the prevention of harm to the
plaintiff (consumer), But where the harm is caused indirectly, the question of reasonable
foreseeability can be more difficult to determine.

Note that in Donoghuea breach of contract action was not available to the plaintiff as she
didn't buy the drink, her friend did, and so she couldn't rely on the sale of goods legislation
or sue in contract. Did you pick up this point when watching the video?

For a defendant to be liable in negligence they must owe you a legal duty of care. As noted
earlier, this is a question of law for the judge to decide based on the factual merits of the
individual case.

The duty of care concept says you must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions
that you can reasonably foreseewould likely injure your neighbour if you act, or fail to
act, in a particular way without care as to what the outcome may be. This does not mean
that a defendant owes a duty of care to ensure no harm befalls you. That would make
the defendant an insurer. The duty is one of taking reasonable care.What the term
`reasonable care' means is constantly evolving and depends on individual circumstances.

                        In brief
                                                                                                                    THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE | 72

     The foreseeability test

     Foreseeability is based on an objective test of whether a reasonable person would have
     foreseen that there was a real risk of the likelihood of injury to the plaintiff by taking into
     account all the circumstances of the particular case. But remember foreseeability alone
     does not give rise to a duty of care. While duty of care is one test of foreseeability, other
     important considerations can include:

           reliance of the plaintiff on the defendant
           knowledge on the part of the defendant about the risk
           the vulnerability of the plaintiff to harm from the conduct of the defendant
           whether the defendant has the power to control the actions of another and is in a

             position to stop the harm from occurring.

The question to consider in all negligence cases is whether there was a real
possibility that the defendant's actions caused harm to the plaintiff. Were the actions
of the defendant reasonable and it this requirement of reasonableness has substantially
contributed to the flexibility found in a negligence action. It permits social judgments relevant
to the times to be made by the courts within the law-making process.

It is worth noting that over the last three decades the Australian High Court has increasingly
emphasised the importance of the autonomy and responsibility of you (if are the plaintiff) to
take care of yourself, and this has been re-emphasised in Australian civil liability legislation
and decisions of the courts. Do you think that is fair?

Again, whether a duty of care exists is a question of law--a question that can be answered
only by reference to the facts of each individual case, with a focus on the
foreseeability of causing harm to you, the plaintiff. This means considering all of the
circumstances that may have a bearing on the relationship between the parties, including:

   the particular risk of injury that occurred
   the relationship of the defendant to that risk (that is, was the defendant in a controlling

      position through resources, knowledge or legal duty, and aware that they were in a
      controlling position?)
   whether the plaintiff was in a position of powerlessness and therefore reliant on the
      defendant
   whether the plaintiff's reliance put the defendant in a position that required them to be
      protective of the plaintiff
   the nature of the damage that the plaintiff suffered
73 | THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE

In the majority of cases that come before the courts, whether the defendant owes you, as
the plaintiff, a duty of care can be determined from precedents created by earlier cases from
the UK and Australian courts. Examples of settled cases include the following:

   Manufacturers of goods owe a duty to consumers and users that the design,
      manufacture and packaging of products are not going to harm the ultimate user

   Employers owe a duty to employees to avoid causing them injury (providing the
      employee with a safe system of work, plant and equipment, and competent co-
      workers and supervisors: Industrial Safety, Health and Welfare (Amendment) Act 2016

   Motorists (and other road-users) owe a duty to passengers and other road-users
      including cyclists and pedestrians

   Boat captains owe a duty to their passengers
   Teachers owe a duty to their students
   Councils owe a duty to those who use their facilities
   Occupiers owe a duty to persons who come onto their property.
   Professionals, for example, lawyers, doctors, engineers, chemists owe a duty to their

      clients
   Prison authorities owe a duty to their prisoners
   Lifesavers owe a duty to swimmers who swim between the flags.

                         In brief

     There is little difficulty in the `settled' cases where physical injuries or damage to property
     have been caused by direct physical contact with you or your goods. You, as the plaintiff,
     only needs to demonstrate that the injuries are reasonably foreseeable and need to
     establish that:

           You are owed a duty of care; and
           The duty of care should be imposed in the circumstances

In addition to the established categories of duty of care outlined earlier, there are several
                                                                                                                    THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE | 74

categories of immunity from liability, generally because of `public policy', where the
defendant cannot be sued including:

   the armed forces on active duty
   child protection agencies
   police officers, prosecutors and parole boards
   fire brigades and emergency services
   barristers
   statutory immunities under legislation

Is the duty question always clear cut?

Do not assume the duty question is always clear cut. Problems can arise in determining the
duty in the following situations:

   Where the harm is caused indirectly. For example, in Chapman v Hearse (1961)
      HCA 46 (an Australian High Court decision), Chapman negligently caused a motor
      vehicle accident during which Dr Cherry went to assist. Dr Cherry was subsequently
      killed by another driver, Hearse. Hearse successfully brought action against Chapman
      for contribution for damages he was required to pay to Dr Cherry's estate.

The High Court held that Chapman owed a duty of care to Dr Cherry as it was reasonable
to assume someone would come to Chapman's aid. There was therefore a relationship
between Chapman and Dr Cherry, as well as a relationship between Dr Cherry and Hearse
as a driver and road-user (person on the road). Both drivers owed Dr Cherry a duty of care,
but they belonged to different, though still reasonably foreseeable, classes of person.

   In cases involving pure economic loss, such as Hedley Byrne v Heller & Partners
      Ltd(1964) AC 465, the English House of Lords recognised the pure economic loss
      suffered by the respondents (Hedley Byrne, an advertising agency).

Hedley Byrne were advertising agents. They placed contracts on behalf of a client on
credit terms and would be personally liable should the client default. In order to protect
themselves, Hedley Byrne asked their bankers to obtain a credit reference from Heller
& Partners, the client's bankers. The reference was favourable, but also contained an
exclusion clause to the effect that the information was given `without responsibility on the
part of this Bank or its officials'. Hedley Byrne relied upon this reference and subsequently
suffered financial loss when the client went into liquidation. The court found that the banks
disclaimer was sufficient to protect them from liability and Hedley Byrne's claim failed.
75 | THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE

The significance of the case is that it established that financial loss suffered by a plaintiff for
a negligent misrepresentation was recoverable. But not in this case. It is interesting to then
note that this case is a good example of obiter dicta (sayings by the way) as the ratio of the
case was that the exclusion clause was valid and binding. Also remember Donoghue was
about a snail in a bottle and the duty of care of the manufacturer, so the decision in Hedley
Byrne extended the rule relating to what negligence could apply to.

   In cases of psychiatric injury (nervous shock) and mental harm, the law has taken
      a restrictive approach to compensating people who have suffered no physical injury
      but have been left with psychiatric or mental problems as a consequence of the
      defendant's actions.

What about `novel' cases?

In `novel' cases, that is, where there have been no previous cases to guide the court, for
example, climate change cases, once the court decides that the harm suffered by you was
foreseeable the courts then look at what are referred to as the `salient features (or factors)'
of the relationship that exists between you as the plaintiff and the defendant.

Just for your information, the factors or `salient features' that you could consider in a `novel'
case were set out in a list of 17 salient features by Allsop P in Caltex Refineries (Qld) Pty
Ltd v Stavar (2009) NSWCA 258:

   the foreseeability of harm
   the nature of the harm alleged
   the degree and nature of control able to be exercised by the defendant to avoid harm
   the degree of vulnerability of the plaintiff to harm from the defendant's conduct,

      including the capacity and reasonable expectation of a plaintiff to take steps to protect
      itself
   the degree of reliance by the plaintiff upon the defendant
   any assumption of responsibility by the defendant
   the proximity or nearness in a physical, temporal or relational sense of the plaintiff to

                     Business tip
       If there is knowledge of risk of injury, greater care should be taken
       If a defendant has a greater than average experience of a particular risk, greater
       precautions may have to be taken than would normally be the case. Think about this in
       the context of medical procedures where there is always risk involved. Did the
       defendant act as a reasonably prudent person would have once it was determined
       that a risk of injury existed? Was the defendant's failure to eliminate the risk
       demonstrative of a lack of reasonable care for the plaintiff?

Note that if you are dealing with an infant, the standard to be applied is not the same as
that of an adult but of a child of like age, intelligence and experience, thus requiring greater
care needs to be taken by you if you are the defendant.

Should there be consideration of the particular risk of injury that
occurred?

The question to consider here is: What would be the response of a reasonable person
foreseeing the risk?The smaller the risk, the greater the likelihood a reasonable person
would choose to ignore it. In formulating the duty of care, consideration must be given to
the defendant's responsibilities and the resources available to them. Remember that the
law is not going to treat a defendant as an insurer of you (if you are the plaintiff).
77 | THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE

What is the relationship of the defendant to that risk?

This involves consideration of a number of factors, including whether the defendant was
in a controlling position through resources, knowledge, legal duty or right.

Think about playing rugby. Does the League owe you a duty of care? There are a number
of factors that need to be taken into account including your age when you were injured,
whether the League arranged insurance for all its players and insisted they be registered
with their clubs, that you were a player injured in a competition organised by the League,
that the League tried to arrange for all coaches to be accredited but knew that some
coaches had not undertaken coaching courses, that it knew that a number of under-age
players played in and against open-age teams, and that it knew that some players were
vulnerable to serious injury because of their physical characteristics, that players were not
being taught how to tackle properly or made properly aware of the rules of the game.

What was the nature of the damage suffered by you?

In considering the nature of the damage suffered by you, the law does not provide
compensation simply on the basis that the injury was disproportionately severe. Remember,
it was noted at the outset that it is often a good starting point to look at the damage you
suffered and see whether the damage is of a type that the courts are prepared to recognise
as compensable or too trivial to amount to a cause of action.

It is also worth noting that in some cases--for example, in the case of an entrant who
deliberately and for pleasure engages in hazardous recreational activities where the risks
are obvious--the scope of the duty of care, and a breach of the duty, may be limited
giventhe proposition that people ought to take reasonable care for their own safety. Do you
agree?

Does liability follow an omission to act?

At common law there will generally be no breach of duty where physical harm or loss arises
as a result of a failure to act, as the liability for an omission involves the imposition of a
duty to take positive action. Thus, there is no duty to attempt a rescue, and this is so even
if the defendant has the means available to affect a rescue. But note this rule is subject to
a number of exceptions, usually arising from your reliance or dependence on the defendant
where a duty of care may arise to take positive action; for example, a driver may be held
liable for causing damage through failing to indicate that they were turning.

A positive duty of care may be imposed where the defendant is in a pre-existing
`protective' relationship with the plaintiff, such as parent and child.A child may sue
                                                                                                                   THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE | 78

their parents, but parents are not automatically responsible for the torts of their children in
the absence of `special circumstances' such as personal fault.

In Smith v Leurs (1945) HCA 27 (an Australian High Court decision), the defendant's 13
year old son ignored the instructions of his parents not to fire his slingshot outside the
boundaries of his home and hit another boy in the eye. The court found that while they
were expected to maintain reasonable control over their children to avoid exposing others to
unreasonable danger, the parents had done all that could be reasonably expected of them
by telling their son not to fire his slingshot outside the boundaries of their property. Do you
agree with that decision by the Australian High Court?

Again, note that the duty of care does not extend to                     Business tip
that of an insurer.It attaches only to where a
person knows, or ought to know, by exercising               Once you start to do
reasonable care, of the existence of the                    something, there is a duty on
danger.For example, previous actions may create             you to take reasonable care
a reliance situation. But if the risk of injury is slight,
then the precautions that need to be taken will be
minimal.

Other common law examples of situations where               not to cause `harm' to
liability for an omission has arisen and positive           another, particularly if a
action by a defendant has been required include:            situation has been created
                                                            where the other party has

 School authority and students: School

authorities owe a personal, non-delegable

duty to their students to ensure that reasonable care is taken while they are under the

school's control. This duty arises out of the relationship of care and control that exists

between students and teachers. But it will vary according to the nature and location of

the activity, as well as whether the injury arises during school hours but note that the

school is not an insurer and liable for every injury a child may incur while at school.

 Local councils: entrusted with statutory powers to protect public safety.

 Statutory authorities: in the exercise of their statutory powers.

Public authorities

There is not an absolute duty on a public authority (which includes the National
Government, Provincial Parliaments, or local or village bodies or any public authority) to do,
79 | THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE

or not do, a particular thing unless the act or omission of the authority was so unreasonable
that no public authority with the same functions could properly consider the act or omission
to be a reasonable exercise of its functions.

Recreational activities and the duty of care

Given that so many people participate in sport, and so many sporting activities involve
some element of risk, it is worth considering what the duty of care is, if any, in recreational
activities.

Negligence is still a fault-based system and, as a matter of law, there is a point at which
those who indulge in pleasurable but risky pastimes must take personal responsibility for
what they do. That point is reached when the risks are so well known and obvious that it can
be reasonably assumed that the individuals concerned will take reasonable care for their
own safety.

The scope of the duty of care may be limited where there is a high risk of being injured
but as noted earlier, whether a duty of care exists or not is a question of law. It is a
question that can be answered only by referenceto the facts of each individual case. That
point will be reached when the risks are so well known and obvious that it can reasonably
be assumed that the individuals concerned will take reasonable care for their own safety.
This includes taking into account:

   consideration of the risk of the particular injury that occurred
   the relationship of the defendant to that risk; and
   the nature of the damage that you as the plaintiff suffered.

There are two questionsto consider here:

   The factual question: to what extent, if any, is the risk of serious injury from
      participation in the recreational activity obvious? Is there a hidden danger of which the
      parties should be aware? Was there signage that effectively communicated the risk.

   The legal question: this concerns the effect of the obviousness of the risk and the
      obligation to take reasonable steps to avoid foreseeable risk of injury.

The relevant question is whether the defendant, with their state of knowledge, acted as a
reasonably prudent person should have done once it was determined that a risk of injury
existed. `Did the defendant's failure to eliminate this risk show a want of reasonable care
for your safety? Note that the standard of care is lower for children because of their lack of
understanding of what risk is.
                                                                                                                   THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE | 80

A participant in a recreational activity not only owes a duty of care to other participants to
operate within the rules, but they also have a duty to take reasonable care for their own
safety where they are voluntarily participating in `high-risk' recreational activities. Failure
to exercise reasonable care may result in liability to an injured participant, while voluntary
acceptance of the risk may act as a `bar' to an action for damages.

                  Reflection question

     Time for a break. Remember to try and revise regularly what you have read. So here is
     a problem question to think about while having a break. What are your thoughts on
     this fact scenario?

     FACTS: Time to go swimming. The local resort has an excellent beach over which it had
     care, management and control. They employed lifeguards because of its popularity with
     tourists who often brought their kids down to the beach to play on the sand and swim. The
     lifeguards were responsible for making sure that the best places to swim were marked
     with flags and they encouraged people to swim between the flags for safety reasons.

     You and some friends decide to do the right thing and swim between the flags but you
     didn't check the depth of the water and you were injured when you dived in and hit your
     head on a sandbar. The lifeguards on duty could see the sandbars and should have been
     aware that diving into the water without checking its depth was dangerous.

     QUESTION: Did the resort owe a duty of care to users of the beach such as you to ensure
     that where the flags were placed was safe to swim? Did the lifeguards owe you a duty of
     care? Or was this a case of bad luck and you have no legal remedy?

     WHAT IS YOUR DECISION? Do you think you have a case and could sue for damages?

     HINT: Is it worth suing the lifeguards? Think about the question of duty of care in the
     context of the resort and what their responsibilities were to you and others, if any. Do you
     think that those who go to the beach, like yourself, have to accept a degree of
     responsibility for their conduct?
81 | THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE

Step 2: Has the defendant breached their duty of care?

                   Video reference

     This videoabout TortLaw from Cambridge Law Facility will provide you with a good
     overview of breach of duty of care and has some interesting examples that will help you
     understand breach.

Once you, as the plaintiff have established to the satisfaction of the court that the defendant
owed you a duty of care (a question of law for the judge to decide), you then have to
establish that the defendant has breached that duty of care. In other words, the defendant's
acts or omissions failed to meet the standard of care required by the law, or as reasonably
expected in the circumstance.
Whether there has been a breach of the duty of care involves:

   determining what is a reasonable standard of care as a question of law; and then
   determining whether the defendant has reached that standard.

What is the `reasonable person'?

                   Video reference

    This video titled `what does it mean to be reasonable?' Explains quite succinctly what
    is the reasonable person and will help you understand what the expression
    means.
                                                                                                                   THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE | 82

We have made a number of references to `the reasonable person', and hopefully the video
has helped you understand what this term means. A reasonable person is a hypothetical
person created by the courts who is of normal intelligence, credited with such perception
of the surrounding circumstances and such knowledge of other pertinent matters as an
average person would possess.

If a person professes to have a particular skill--for example, driving a car--they are
required to show the skill normally possessed by persons claiming such a skill. The
law requires the person to show such (reasonable) skill as any ordinary member of the
profession (for example, a doctor, a lawyer, an accountant or manager) or calling to which
they belong would normally show.

It is worth noting again that this requirement of reasonableness has substantially
contributed to the flexibility inherent in the negligence action. It permits social judgments
relevant to the times to be made by the courts within the law-making process.

What standard of care is expected of the reasonable person?

The standard of care is the level (standard) that the defendant's conduct is measured
against objectively. It is a question of law,not fact. The question to consider is: What
would the reasonable person have done if they had been in the defendant's
position?This means that it is generally not acceptable to argue that inexperience should
be a valid excuse for failure to attain a standard of care that would ordinarily be expected of
a person in that position.

Is the standard of care flexible?

The standard of care required in a particular case is a question of law for the judge
to determine. It will vary from situation to situation, and is flexible depending on the
circumstances of the case--for example, is it an emergency? --as well as the personal
characteristics of the defendant, including age (young children are not expected to exercise
the same degree of care as adults), fitness, health, disability, skill and knowledge.

For example, in an action in negligence where you are a passenger who has been injured
in a motor vehicle driven by the defendant, the relationship of the parties is simply that of
driver and passenger and normally the standard of care required is the degree of care of an
experienced and competent driver, regardless of the driver's status.

It may also be necessary to consider the characteristics of the defendant in determining the
standard of care such as the skill and knowledge of you (as the plaintiff), or whether you are
still a child, intoxicated, a prisoner, or infirm or elderly.
83 | THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE

What is the standard of care for children?

In the case of children, you need to understand that they are less capable than adults in
taking care of themselves. So, the reasonable person test gives way a different standard,
that is, the standard of a child of similar age and experience.

If you are placed in a position of responsibility for children, directly or indirectly, you must
make the children's safety your foremost concern. This carries a more onerous duty of care
because children don't perceive danger or risk in the same way you do as an adult. There
is a duty of care placed on you but your obligation is to exercise reasonable care, not a
duty to prevent conduct that could be potentially harmful.

What elements need to be established for breach?

If a duty of care is found to exist, you, as the plaintiff, mustthen establish that the defendant
breached this duty.

   there was foreseeable risk (that is, a risk which the person knew or ought to have
      known based on what a `reasonable person' would have known if they were in the
      position of the defendant); and

   what would a reasonable person in the same position as the defendant have done in
      the circumstances.

When trying to determine what precautions a reasonable person in the position of the
defendant might have taken, the courtwill consider a number of factors, including:

   The probability that the harm would have occurred if care had been taken.This is
      to be considered objectively. In Bolton v Stone[1951] AC 850, an English case, the
      House of Lords found that the defendant may have been justified in disregarding a
      foreseeable risk of injury where there was only a remote chance of being hit by a
      cricket ball while walking past a fenced cricket ground, and one that a reasonable
      person would think highly unlikely to occur. A cricketer hit a six, which went more than
      65 metres from the wicket, cleared a 2.2 metre fence and struck Stone, who was
      standing outside her house across the road from the ground. Not only was the
      probability of risk materialising quite low, but the precautions that the club would need
      to have taken to avoid a similar accident occurring could only have amounted to it
      ceasing to play cricket at the ground!

   The likely seriousnessof the harm.This is also to be considered objectivelyby
      reference to the particular circumstances of the case. If you are going to have an eye
      operation and the chances of going blind are 1:14,000, you should still be warned of
                                                                                                                   THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE | 84

      the risk because the outcome could be catastrophic even though the risk appears to
      be small. Why? Because this is what a reasonable person in the doctor's position
      would do?
   The burden of taking precautions to avoid the risk of harm. The magnitude of the
      risk and the probability of injury have to be balanced against the expense, difficulty
      and inconvenience of any action necessary to reduce the risk. Thus, if you are
      seriously injured when diving into an estuary from a bridge that had pictograms
      indicating `No Diving' and signs prohibiting diving, the court will probably say `No
      Diving' signs were a reasonable and adequate response and that the body
      responsible for bridge and road maintenance had not breached its duty of care given
      that there was a substantial cost for a new handrail and new fencing, and there was
      no guarantee it would have been effective.

The question to consider in trying to decide whether there is a breach is where the
responses reasonable and adequate in the circumstances or were they impractical?

The court may look at the social utility of the activity that caused the harm as it
might take the view that some activities are more worth taking risks for than others, such
as playing contact sports like rugby league or union. Why, you may ask. Playing sports
has benefits for the individual and for the community in terms of a healthier population. But
contact sports like Rugby League and Union also carry a higher risk of injury to a participant
than to someone who doesn't play sport. Therefore, the benefits have to be weighed against
the costs and a decision made accordingly.

All the above factors do nothave to be satisfied in order to establish breach. What they
provide is a framework for deciding what precautions the reasonable person would have
taken to avoid harm

There is a rule of evidence that allows the plaintiff to treat the actual facts of the case as
clear evidence of the defendant's negligence, that is, the facts speak for themselves. It
allows negligence to be inferred if three conditions can be satisfied:

   the plaintiff's injury was one that ordinarily would not happen if proper care had
      been taken; and

   the plaintiff was injured by something within the exclusive control of the defendant;
      and

   there is an absence of explanation and no room for inference. It is worth noting that
      if the cause of the occurrence becomes known, the plaintiff has to then prove it was
      the defendant's negligence.

Two examples may help you understand how this principle works in practice. In the first
85 | THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE

case (Gee v Metropolitan Railway Co (1873) LR 8 QB 161, an English case), the plaintiff fell
out of the defendant's railway carriage shortly after the train left a station. As the railway was
in control of making sure the carriage doors were shut, he succeeded against the railway
company because there was no explanation other than that the railway company had been
negligent because it failed to ensure the doors were properly shut.
In the second case (Mummery v Irvings Pty Ltd [1956] HCA 45, an Australian High Court
case), the plaintiff failed because he was unable to show that the injury was directly caused
by the negligence of the employee's foreman. The foreman was using a circular saw when
a piece of wood he was cutting flew off and hit the plaintiff in the face. The plaintiff's
case failed because there was no evidence to show that the occurrence was due to the
negligence of the employer's foreman.

                     Business tip
       Reducing the likelihood of injury
       A business must take steps to reduce the reasonable likelihood of injury. The onus is
       on the you as the plaintiff to show that it was reasonably practicable for the defendant
       to take precautions against the risk. Once you have done so, the burden of proof
       switches to the defendant to establish that it was unreasonable in the circumstances to
       take such precautions. Risk management principles suggest that constant monitoring
       of:

             the probability of risk
             the seriousness of the consequences if something were to occur; and
             the opportunities for, and cost of, eliminating the risk are all serious concerns of a

                responsible business manager if liability of the business is to be minimised.

                   Reflection question
                                                                                                                   THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE | 86

     Time for another break. Here are three more questions to check your understanding of the
     topic.

         1. What does the term `reasonable person' mean to you?
         2. What factors does a court take into account when judging the standard of care

             under common law.
         3. Do you think children should be treated differently to adults? (Now this is an

             interesting question but can you see why? This question is really testing your
             reading ability.)

Step 3: Has the plaintiff suffered damage (a limiting
factor)?

Causation

This is the last question that you, as the plaintiff, has to deal with in a negligence claim is the
question of causation. This is the bond between the defendant's behaviour and your
injury. The issue of harm or damage is central to a negligence action.

The onus of proof is still on you as the plaintiff and the good news is that this is the last step
that has to be established by you in addition to duty and breach. The bad news.... a pity it
is so complex.

There are two types of causation: factual causation and legal causation:

   Factual causation is also known as "but for" causation. This type of causation means
      that the result would not have happened if not for the act.

   Legal causation, on the other hand, requires that the act must be the proximate
      cause of the result, that is, the act must be the direct cause of the result without which
      the injury would not have happened.

Damage may be:

   economic (for example, lost or missed sales)
   to property (for example, damage caused by faulty plumbing or electrical wiring); or
   to the person (for example, a broken arm or leg as a result of a motor vehicle

      accident, psychological damage), as long as there is actual damage
87 | THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE

Do not assume that any kind of damage is recoverable in a negligence action. Only actual
damage is compensable, and this includes:

   damage to property or person
   economic or financial damage; and
   psychiatric damage (including `nervous shock')

Don't assume that any kind of damage you suffer will automatically create a potential
cause of action in negligence. Situations where you won't have a claim in negligence
include damage from criminal or fraudulent activities (on policy grounds), where the form of
damage is too vague (for example, expulsion from a social club, although the court will look
closely at how the expulsion may have been carried out to see whether natural justice was
followed), and even harm to reputation (where an action in defamation is appropriate).

In deciding liability for breach, you as the plaintiff must establish, on the balance of
probabilities, that there is some link between the damage you suffered and the defendant's
breach of their duty of care. In other words, you have to show that the defendant's
`negligence was a necessary condition of the occurrence of your harm' and is
effectively a restatement of the common law `but for' test; that is, would you as the plaintiff
have suffered this damage `but for' the defendant's negligence? The factual causation
component.

If the injury would have occurred anyway, the action fails. In an English case called
Barnett v Chelsea and Kensington Hospital Management Committee [1969] 1 QB 428 the
plaintiff failed to establish causation. The hospital doctor refused to examine the patient who
had attended an outpatient clinic after becoming ill from drinking tea containing arsenic. The
doctor's failure to treat the patient was a clear breach of duty, but the man would have died
anyway, even with medical treatment. The action of the plaintiff (the patient's wife) therefore
failed because she could not establish the necessary causal link between the defendant's
breach and the death of her husband.

In an Australian High Court case, Strong v Woolworths Ltd [2012] HCA 5, the High Court
suggested that it was enough if the appellant (Strong) could prove, on the balance of
probabilities, that the respondent's negligence was a necessary cause of his fall. In `slip and
fall' cases, a common problem is establishing a causal connection between the lack of an
adequate cleaning system (an omission) and the injury to the plaintiff (an occurrence) when
it cannot be established when the surface became slippery.

To establish proof of the causal link between the omission and the occurrence,
it is necessary to consider the probable cause of events had the omission not
occurred.For example, in Strong's case above, would she have fallen if Woolworths had
                                                                                                                   THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE | 88

a system of inspection and removal in place at 15 to 20-minute intervals, as CPT Manager
Limited did for the rest of the shopping centre?

The precise sequence of events does not have to be established by the plaintiff. The
question was whether Woolworths' failure to adopt an adequate system of inspection and
cleaning the cause of the appellant's injuries; that is, was the plaintiff (as this was an appeal,
we use the expression `appellant' rather than plaintiff as she is the person appealing and
Woolworths is the `respondent' because they are responding to the appeal) able to prove
causation?

The High Court found that it was enough for the appellant to prove, on the balance of
probabilities, that the respondent's negligence was a necessary condition of her harm. The
chip was dropped between 8.00 am and 12.10 pm rather than the shorter period of time
suggested by the Court of Appeal (between 12.10 pm and the time of the incident, which
was not long enough for it to be detected and removed). The longer length of time opened
the way for the court to find that the failure of Woolworths to adopt a reasonable system of
cleaning was the effective cause of Strong's fall.

In another Australian High Court case, Chappel v Hart [1988] HCA 55, a surgeon negligently
omitted to warn the respondent of a risk inherent in an operation on the throat of the
patient and, while he performed the operation without negligence, the risk materialised. The
respondent alleged that had she been warned she would not have had the operation at that
time and she would have had a different surgeon perform it. The High Court held that the
appellant's failing to warn of the risk, and not the actual operation, should be regarded as a
cause of the injury when the risk eventuated.

Causation is determined subjectively--that is, what the injured person would have done, in
the light of all relevant circumstances--as distinct from the objective test of the conduct of
a reasonable person. However, any statement made by the person who has been injured
about what they would have done is inadmissible, unless the statement is against the
person's interest.

It should also be noted that in this case, while the `but for' test was satisfied, other factors
were required to be established before a majority of the court were satisfied that the
surgeon should be liable in negligence. These factors included the timing of the operation
(waiting for a more experienced surgeon), the plaintiff's concern over how she might sound
after the operation (complications could occur without negligence and affect her voice),
and the fact that she was an anxious and persistent patient who was concerned about the
outcome of the operation.

In the case of exceptional circumstances, where a breach of duty is established but
does not satisfy the requirement of `factual causation', the court is required to consider,
89 | THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE

among other relevant things, whether or not and why responsibility for the harm should be
imposed on the defendant. And sometimes an intervening event involving the actions of a
third person might relieve a negligent defendant of responsibility.
The second part to causation that you have to establish is legal or proximate causation.
This is the legal principle that holds that a person who causes another person to suffer an
injury or loss is legally responsible for that injury or loss. To establish legal causation, you
are going to have to show that the person who caused the injury or loss did so through some
act or omission that was negligent, reckless, or intentional. Were the defendant's actions the
proximate cause of the injury or, to put it another way, would the injury not have occurred
but for the defendant's actions?

                   Reflection question

     Time for a break but before you stop, think about the following situation and you can find
     out what you have learnt so far.

     THE FACTS: Imagine you are involved in a motor vehicle accident caused by the driver's
     negligence. At the hospital you are given painkillers to help manage the pain but they
     were not helping. A friend visits you at the hospital and you tell them the pain medication
     given by the hospital is not working. They suggest trying heroin and you agree and it
     works but you become addicted to it. You sue the driver for negligence, seeking damages
     for your injuries and for the heroin addiction

     THE QUESTION: Is the negligent driver responsible for your addiction?

     YOUR DECISION: Well, what is your decision and why?

     HINT: Think about the conduct of the friend. Also think about whether responsibility for
     the heroin addiction should be imposed on the driver.

If there are a number of possible defendants and it is not possible to assign responsibility
for causing harm to any one of them, the courts may assign responsibility under existing
common law principles to all of the defendants, but in doing so it must consider the position
of each defendant individually and state the reasons for bringing the defendant within the
scope of liability.
                                                                                                                   THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE | 90

You are going to have to show that the damage was a foreseeable consequence of the
negligence of the defendant (similar considerations apply in the duty question), and whether
the damage suffered fell within the scope of foreseeability or was too `remote'.
What has to be foreseeable is the type or kind of injury suffered, one that a reasonable
person would describe as `real' rather than `far-fetched' and requires a value judgment
about the allocation of responsibility for harm.

The `egg-shell skull' rule

One final point. The `egg-shell skull' rule provides that a defendant must take you, as the
plaintiff, as they found you. This means that a defendant will be liable for injuries suffered by
you despite the fact that you have had a pre-existing condition, such as a medical condition,
which resulted in the injuries being significantly greater than might otherwise have been the
case.
This rule applies only to damage of the same kindas that which was reasonably
foreseeable. The doctrine is applied in all areas of torts (as well as in criminal law).

                   Reflection question

     Think about what you have read about causation.
         1. Can you explain the purpose of causation in relation to the liability of a defendant
         2. Having established duty, breach and damage, do you think the defendant should be
             liable for all the damage have suffered?

Step 4: What defences might a defendant raise?

This is a question really about the consequences for the defendant if they fail to convince
the court that they did not owe you a duty of care, or that they had not breached that duty,
or that they were not responsible for the harm or damage that you suffered. The onus now
shifts on to the defendant to establish any defences to reduce or eliminate their liability.
91 | THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE

The two most common defences under the common law are contributory negligence (see
also ss 40, 41 of the Wrongs (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1975 and voluntary assumption
of risk. Both defences involve consideration of all of the surrounding circumstances,
including the behaviour of you, as the plaintiff, and the issue of personal responsibility.

Contributory negligence

Contributory negligence is about apportionment of blameand you as the plaintiff
assuming some responsibility for your injuries or damage to your property. It needs to
be distinguished from voluntary assumption of risk which, if successful, may defeat your
claim in its entirety, depending on the circumstances; for example, that you failed to take
reasonable care for your own safety because you were drunk or under the influence of
drugs at the time of the accident.
The principles that are applicable in determining whether a person has been negligent also
apply in determining whether the person who has suffered harm has been contributorily
negligent--although it should be noted that it is not necessary that you as the plaintiff owe
the defendant a duty of care.
Essentially, the court looks at whether you failed to take reasonable care for your own
safety, with the standard of care being assessed on the basis of the reasonable person and
what they would have, or should have, known in the circumstances. This is consistent with
the courts taking the view that people need to take responsibility for themselves and then
considering whether you had fallen below that standard. Contributory negligence must
be pleaded and proved by the defendant.
To establish contributory negligence, the defendant mustbe able to establish that:

   you, as the plaintiff, was at fault or negligent in failing to look after yourself; a
      question of fact judged in light of all the circumstances
                                                                                                                   THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE | 92

   your conduct contributed to the injury or loss--this means looking at what was
      the cause of the damage (but remember that each case must be judged on its own set
      of facts and circumstances, such as intoxication, emergency or anticipation of a
      breach by others); and

   the damage was reasonably foreseeable and was contributed to you by your
      actions (or lack of them):a question of fact.

The standard of care is based on a reasonable person in your standing in place of
you, and the matter will be decided on the basis of what the person knew or ought to have
known at the time. If you were an infant, the standard of care would be that an infant.

In all jurisdictions there is a presumption of contributory negligence if the person who
suffers harm was drunk or if the person who suffers injury was relying on the care and skill of
a person, they knew to be drunk. In the case of intoxication, it is presumed that it impacted
on your ability or capacity to exercise reasonable care for your own safety at the time of
the breach. You will then attempt to rebut that presumption by arguing that you were not
intoxicated and that if you were, it did not impair your capacity to exercise reasonable care
for your own safety.
Apportionment of damages is based on what is fair and reasonable (`just and equitable')
between the parties however, as noted earlier, contributory negligence may defeat a claim.
Part IX of the Wrongs (Miscellaneous Provisions)Act 1975, s 40 provides that a plaintiff
such as yourself is entitled to recover a portion of the damages based on the negligence of
the defendant.

                   Online reference

     Apportionment of liability where contributory negligence is raised by a defendant is set
     out in Part IX, ss 38-40 of the Wrongs (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1975.

Voluntary assumption of the risk

Voluntary assumption of risk is a complete defence. It is very difficult for a defendant to
successfully raise as a defence because it has to be established that you knew there was a
93 | THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE

risk of injury and knowingly engaged in the activity which resulted in your injury, that is, you
had consented to the full risk of injury.

A defendant can minimise their exposure to risk in one of two ways:

   expressly, by signing an agreement in which you acknowledge the risk of injury and
      agree to accept or assume the risk. This is usually in the form of a written waiver or
      exclusion clause. By signing a liability waiver or a contract that contains an exclusion
      clause, you agree to accept the risk but as you will see when we look at contract law,
      waivers and exclusion clauses are construed strictly against the party relying on
      them;or

   by your conductwhere you knowingly and voluntarily engage in a risky or dangerous
      activity. You have impliedly assumed and assented to acceptance of the risk.
      Examples could include going rock climbing or water skiing with friends, or attending a
      sporting event such as football or cricket and getting hit by the ball. In each case there
      is always a risk of injury and the defendant would argue that a reasonable person
      would be aware of that risk.

Step 5: What may a plaintiff recover?

Generally, in a negligence action, you as the plaintiff, will be seeking monetary
compensationfor the damage or loss you have suffered. This could be a physical injury
to you or property damage, economic or financial damage, or psychiatric damage but just
note that damages are awarded on a case-by-case basis. It should also be noted that the
purpose of a damages award is compensation; that is, to put you in the position you would
have been in had the tort not been committed.Do not confuse damage, which is about
loss, with damages, which is about compensation.

Where two or morepersons have caused injury to you, the requirement that there be proof
of negligence of one of them can create difficulties, unless they were joint tortfeasors

Part 5: Other areas where the tort of negligence has an
impact

Just when you thought this was the end of negligence it is worth remembering that at the
beginning of the chapter we noted that there were other areas of tort law that had been
subsumed by negligence. There is not enough time now to explore them in any detail but
an awareness of each can still be a valuable tool in both personal and business disputes.
                                                                                                                   THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE | 94

The seven areas are: vicarious liability, occupier's liability, product liability, negligent
misstatements, strict liability, the rule in Rylands v Fletcher and breach of statutory duty.

Vicarious Liability

Employers can be held variously liable for the acts or omissions of their employees who
cause injury or property damage to a third party. In PNG, vicarious liabilityis governed by
common law principles.

The employer is not personally at fault but is held to be responsible for the actions of
an employee where the employee is under the control of the employer by way of a
contract of service. If the employee is an independent contractor, vicarious liability as
an action is not available as the employer has limited control over a contractor and acting
in the course of their employment. The independent contractor is said to be acting under
acontract for services.

Members of the community often ask why is an employer liable for the acts or omissions of
their employees when they have done nothing wrong? An employer can only be liable for
the wrongful acts or omissions of an employee that are undertaken in the scope or course
of employment, and the relevant act need not be authorised.

Vicarious liability may arise in relation to an employee's unauthorised acts that are "so
connected" with authorised acts that they may be regarded as modes, although improper
modes, of doing the authorised acts. The reason for the employer being held liable for the
actions of the employee is that the employer benefits from the activities of the employee
(called a `profit') and if the employee should injure a third party during the course of making
a profit for the employer, it is only fair that the employer should be prepared to compensate
the injured third party.

A point to note here is there is little benefit of an injured third party suing an employee as
they would rarely have the money to pay damages. On the other hand, the employer is
much more likely to be able to pay damages, either through the costs of the business or
public liability insurance.

                  Reflection question
95 | THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE

     Take a break and read the following scenario. Who would you sue and why?
     FACTS: Deatons operates a hotel. You were a customer at the hotel and after a few beers
     you acted offensively towards one of the hotel's employees, a barmaid. She asks you to
     sober up and go away. An argument developed and the barmaid threw a glass of beer
     over you, and then through the empty glass into your face.
     HINT: What is a barmaid employed to do? Were her actions within the course of her
     employment?

Occupier's Liability

Occupier's liability has been absorbed into negligence. You owe anyone who enters your
premises, including guests, those who enter by express or implied permission--such as
visitors and salespeople--and even those who are uninvited, such as trespassers a duty of
care. It means that if you are an occupier, and this could be an owner or a tenant, you must
take reasonable care of anyone who comes onto your premises that it is reasonably safe to
do so, although what is reasonable will vary according to the circumstances.

                   Online reference

     See ss 52-54 of the Wrongs Miscellaneous Provisions Act 1975 and Part 15.7.1 - Occupiers
     liability, of the Magistrates Manual.

Under the Wrongs Miscellaneous Provisions Act 1975, s 52(1) a `common duty of care'
applies to all visitors unless the occupier expressly restricts or excludes their duty. Because
of the control an occupier has over their premises it is important to understand the extent
of the occupier's ordinary duty under s 52.
To establish occupier's liability, you as a plaintiff must establish the defendant had
occupation or control of the land or structure (that is, own it, be a landlord or a tenant) and
then:
                                                                                                                   THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE | 96

   Would a reasonable person in your position as the defendant have foreseen that the
      conduct involved a real risk of injury to the plaintiff? and

   What would a reasonable person do in response to the risk? This could be any
      number of factors including the magnitude of the risk, the cost of removal of the risk,
      its degree of probability, whether the risk is ordinary, and whether it is obvious.

If you are a landlord, note that s 54 of the Wrongs Miscellaneous Provisions Act 1975 sets
out a landlord's obligations in relation to the maintenance or repair of their premises.
Do not assume that you must remove all hazards on the property you control as it is
not strict liability. What it is about is taking reasonable care to avoid exposing people to
unreasonable risk of injury.

                   Reflection question

     Read the following scenario and think about the issue of occupier's liability and why it
     is important
     FACTS: The plaintiff, a 53-year-old mother of three children, suffered an injury when she
     tripped and fell on the uneven surface of your driveway of your house while attending a
     garage sale. The driveway had a very uneven surface with a number of pot holes and was
     atypical of houses in the area. The mother had stated that at the time of her injury, she
     had been looking towards the goods on a table at the garage sale, and that she had not
     been paying attention to where she was walking.
     QUESTION: Do you owe the mother a duty of care?
     WHAT IS YOUR DECISION? Are you liable for the mother's injuries?
     HINT: Was the risk obvious? Should warnings have been given or the table put in a
     different location? Would you answer be the same if the sale had been a commercial
     venture at a market?

Product Liability

The decision of the English House of Lords in Donoghue v Stevenson[1932] AC 562
97 | THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE

(discussed earlier) established that manufacturers owe a duty to the consumer (which could
be you next time you get a ginger beer in an opaque bottle) to take reasonable care when:

   a product is sold, that it reaches you as ultimate consumer in the form in which it left
      the manufacturer

   there is no reasonable possibility of intermediate examination by you; and
   it is reasonably foreseeable that, in the absence of reasonable care by the

      manufacturer, you will be injured.

If a product is negligently manufactured, assuming it is locally manufactured, that company
or business is responsible for how the product is made. As Donoghue v Stevenson
illustrates, the manufacturer owes a duty of care to the consumer to take reasonable care
as absence of reasonable care in the manufacture of the product can result in injury to the
consumer's life or property (you), and liability common law liability for the manufacturer in
negligence. If the manufacturer is in another country then a whole host of problems arise,
not the least of which are whether it is even possible to sue them and the cost of litigation.
In fact, a problem with trying to sue a manufacturer, or a wholesaler or retailer, is money. A
legal action in negligence can be both costly and complicated when compared with litigation
under the Goods Act 1951, the Independent Consumer and Competition Act 2002and the
Fair Transactions Act 1973 which provide statutory protection for you as the consumer.

                   Reflection question

     Read the following fact scenario and think about your legal position if you were the
     consumer.

     FACTS: You have purchased a new outfit to wear for a job interview direct from the
     manufacturer (OnLine Clothing). You have not had time to wash it before the interview
     because you were worried it would not be dry in time for the interview. The garment
     contained chemicals that, it was found, had been left in them due to the lack of care of the
     manufacturer. When you complained to the retailer who sold you the outfit they said `Not
     our problem' Tell the manufacturer. The manufacturer then produced evidence that it had
                                                                                                                   THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE | 98

     manufactured nearly 10,000 similar outfits for PNG and Australian customers without a
     complaint and argued that no one could say that it was not a reasonably careful
     manufacturer.

     QUESTION: Does the manufacturer owe you a duty of care?

     WHAT IS YOUR DECISION?
     HINT: Is this just a tort action? It is important to always think about what other legal options
     that might be available to you?

Strict liability

To win a strict liability (or absolute liability) case you must be injured and be able to prove
that the defendant's product or actions caused the injuryregardless ofcarelessness or
fault regardless their intent or mental state, that is, a duty ensure reasonable care is
taken.

A defendant can be held liable for damages or losses without the plaintiff having to
prove intent or negligence. Strict liability or non-delegable situations typically arise out of
employer-employee relationships where there is an obligation on the employer to provide a
safe place of work, a safe system of work, competent staff and proper plant and equipment.
Aside from these obligations there are also duties imposed on employers by statute such
as the Occupational Safety, Health and Welfare Act 1991 and the Workers Compensation
Act 1978.

The employer can delegate their responsibility but cannot avoid their duty even if they
delegate performance to a third party. An example of strict liability where the court found
against employer is Edwards v Jordan Lighting and Dowsett Engineering (New Guinea)
Pty Ltd [1978] PNGLR 273 the plaintiff was inspecting some light fittings when the ladder
slipped and he fell injuring himself after the second employee let it go. The court held that
both the employer and second employee were liable for damages as the second employee
failed to warn the plaintiff in advance he was letting go of the ladder and the employer was
liable for failing to provide a safe system of work.

In addition to strict liability has been applied to activities including holding an employer
strictly liable for torts committed by their employees, the principle of strict liability has been
applied to product liability, damage caused by animals (distinguish between domestic and
wild animals. In the case of the former, the keeper is only liable if they had actual knowledge
99 | THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE

of the animal's propensity to cause harm while in the latter case the keeper of the animal are
strictly liable because they are known to be dangerous), and common hazardous activities
such as storing explosives.

Breach of statutory duty

A person who suffers damage from a breach of a statutory duty by a defendantmayhave an
action for breach of a statutory duty. In a claim for a breach of statutory duty it has to be
established that the defendant, whether a public authority or a private body, was under a
statutory duty to do something and did not, resulting in a breach of duty and damage to the
claimant.

A starting point for breach of a statutory duty is to read the legislation carefully to see
whether the statute expressly provides for a right of action for breach of its terms, in which
case the calculation of damages will be calculated in accordance with the Act. In most
cases however, a statute is silent on whether contravention will be actionable or not. In
this situation, the courts have to `discover' the intention of Parliament by applying rules of
statutory interpretation.

The rule in Rylands v Fletcher

While the rule in Rylands v Fletcher (1868) UKHL 1 has been absorbed into negligence in
Australia and some other common law jurisdictions, it still applies in PNG. It is a tort of strict
liability and a cause of action can arise if an occupier of land (the defendant) accumulates
or brings on to their land something which could be `dangerous' if it escapes in the course
of some `non-natural' use of their land to a place outside their occupation or control, they
must keep it in at their peril, and if they don't, are strictly liable for all the damage which is
deemed to be reasonably foreseeable.

The claimant must be able to establish that:

   that the defendant brought something onto their land
   that what the defendant made a `non-natural use' of the land
   that what the defendant brought onto the land was likely to do mischief if it escaped;

      and
   that there was an escape which caused damage of a reasonably foreseeable kind.

There are a number of defences available to a defendant including consent, statutory
authority, act of God, act of a stranger, and the fault of the claimant.
                                                                                                                  THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE | 100

                   Reflection question

     The last reflection question. If you are the claimant do you think you could win the
     case and why?
     Facts: you owned and operated a mine adjacent to the defendant's property. The
     defendant employed some independent contractors to construct a reservoir on his land.
     During the construction of the reservoir the contractors found a number of disused
     sunken mine shafts which, unknown to the defendant, they decided to leave as they
     appeared to be filled up with soil and rubbish. When the defendant's reservoir was filled
     for the first time it burst through the old shafts and flooded your mine and caused several
     thousand dollars damage.
     Question: What legal options, if any, are available to you?
     Decision: Explain your decision.

       Key points

An understanding of the following points will help you to better revise material in this
chapter.

   What is the nature of a tort?A tort is a civil wrong other than a claim for breach of
      contract and for which a right of civil action fordamages may arise.

   What is the difference between tort and crime, and tort and contract? The main
      difference between a tortious action and a criminal prosecution is one of purpose:
          In tort, the partiesare concerned with the resolution of a private dispute that may
            result in the award of some appropriate remedy, whereas in criminal proceedings
            the prosecutor is a representative of the public andconcerned with punishment
            and the repression of crime; while
          Contract law is concerned with the enforcement of promises, and compensation if
            there is a breach of contract. Tort, on the other hand, is concerned with the
101 | THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE

            protection of rights.
   What is negligence?Negligence is the omission to do something that a reasonable

      person would do, or doing something that a prudent and reasonable person would not
      do. It is the failure to exercise reasonable care and skill.
   What are matters of fact and matters of law? Matters of fact include:

          Resolving conflicts in evidence
          Evaluating the conduct of the parties
          Whether the defendant caused the damages, and what was its extent

                Matters of law include:
                All questions of duty
                The standard of care
                Questions of remoteness
   What are the elements necessary to establish negligence?The injured partymust
      establish, on the balance of probabilities, that:
          the defendant owed them a duty of care
          the defendant breached that duty of care to them; and
          as a consequence, the plaintiff suffered actual loss or damage recognised by the
            law
   Under what circumstances does a defendant owe duty of care to the plaintiff at
      common law? The duty question is a question of law and has to be established to the
      satisfaction of the judge. The approach to the question of the existence of a duty of
      care today is determined by application of the `foreseeability' test and includes
      consideration of whether there was a vulnerable or dependency relationship between
      the defendant and the plaintiff, as well as policy considerations.
      This is the duty owed by a defendant to a plaintiff and is based on the relationship
      between them; that is, to take reasonable care to guard against the foreseeable risk of
      injury to another. Duty of care is not just restricted to the question of negligence but
      other areas of tort as well such as vicarious liability, occupier's liability, strict liability,
      negligent misstatements, Rylands v Fletcher, and product liability.
   What is a breach of duty of care? Having established the existence of a duty of
      care, the plaintiff must then show, on the balance of probabilities, that the defendant
      was at fault. Determining whether there has been a breach of the duty of care involves
      a two-stage test:
          The first stage is to determine whether or not the risk was reasonably
            foreseeable. A person is not negligent in failing to take precautions against a risk
            of harm unless there was foreseeable risk, the risk was not insignificant and, in
            the circumstances, a reasonable person in the position of the defendant would
            have taken precautions.
          In the second stage, the court should consider the following factors: probability
            that the harm would have occurred if care had been taken, the likely seriousness
                                                                                                                  THE TORT OF NEGLIGENCE | 102

            of the harm (to be considered objectively by reference to the particular
            circumstances of the case), the burden of taking precautions to avoid the risk of
            harm, and the social utility of the activity that caused the harm.
   What is the concept of standard of care? The defendant's conduct is judged
      against an objective standard and is determined by the court measuring that conduct
      against the standard of care. The onus is on the plaintiff to show that the defendant's
      conduct fell short of the standard of care that a reasonable person in the defendant's
      position would have taken in response to the circumstances at the time in response to
      a reasonably foreseeable and not insignificant risk.
   What is the importance of causation? In deciding liability for breach, the plaintiff
      must establish on the balance of probabilities that the defendant's conduct caused the
      plaintiff's personal injury. Damage may be economic, to property or to the person, but
      there must be actual damage, and this raises two more questions for the plaintiff to
      prove:
          Was the loss or damage to the plaintiff `directly caused' by the defendant's
            breach of their duty of care (causation)? This is a question of fact and determined
            by weighing up the evidence through applying, as a general rule, the statutory
            `but for' test. Where a breach of duty is established but does not satisfy the
            requirement of `factual causation', the court is required to consider, among other
            relevant things, whether or not and why responsibility for the harm should be
            imposed on the defendant.
          If the plaintiff can prove that the defendant's conduct was a necessary condition
            of the injury that they have suffered, is it appropriate for the scope of the
            negligent person's liability to extend to the harm so caused (scope of liability)?
   What defences can a defendant raise to a negligence claim? Under the common
      law, the two main defences which may be pleaded by a defendant) are:
          contributory negligence, which can be up to 100 per cent and thus effectively
            defeat the plaintiff's claim for damages (but note the operation of the Wrongs
            Miscellaneous Provisions Act 1975); and
          voluntary assumption of risk, which would defeat the claim for damages, is a
            risk that in the circumstances would have been obvious to a reasonable person in
            the position of the plaintiff and would not be taken by them.
   Reasonable person - a hypothetical person who exercises what is considered to be
      the average care, skill and judgment that a reasonable person in the community or
      similar area of expertise would exercise.

INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW

       Learning objectives

On completion of this Chapter, you should be able to:

   describe what is a contract and its sources
   recognise the sources of contract law, and distinguish between a contract and an

      agreement
   define a contract and identify the essential elements of a contract
   explain the difference between a formal contract and a simple contract.

       Key terms

Here are some terms you will encounter in the text, which will help you further understand
this chapter:

          Acceptance: an unqualified assent given in response to an offer, which creates
            an agreement.

          Agreement: one of the requirements for the creation of a contract, normally
            consisting of an `offer' and an `acceptance', which may arise expressly or be
            inferred from conduct, between two or more people.

          Contract: an agreement containing promises made between two or more parties,
            with the intention of creating certain rights and obligations, which is enforceable in
            a court of law.

          Escrow: an assurance in the form of a deed, money or bond held by a third party
            on behalf of two transacting parties that the transaction can be completed.

          Formal contract or deed: a contract that has been signed, sealed and delivered,
            and does not require consideration.

          Simple contract: a contract that is made orally or in writing (or both) involving an
            agreement between parties with the intention of creating legally enforceable

            obligations and which requires consideration to be valid.

        Introduction

This chapter introduces you to what the sources of contract law are, what a contract is, its
creation and classification and concludes with a brief note on e-commerce. Chapters 4 -
12 introduce you to what is perhaps the most important area of law you will encounter in
business or your daily life. Contracts play a crucial role in business and society. Without
them, life as we know it could not exist. Contracts underpin all transactions involving
businesses, as well most transactions that you enter into as a consumer. An understanding
of contract law will help you understand not only how and when a contract has been
created, but also what are the rights and obligations of you and the other party to the
contract.

However, there are three things you need to be aware of before we begin:

 1. First, the contracting parties owe each other a duty of good faith, not just when
      entering into a contract but then when both parties are carrying out their contractual
      duties. PNG courts have legislative powers to review contracts that are unfair under
      (see s 1(a)) of the Fairness of Transactions Act 1993. But it should also be noted that
      although the duty of good faith exists in PNG contract law, it is still developing, so
      always be on guard when entering into a contract that you understand exactly what
      you are getting to (see s 4(1) of the Fairness of Transactions Act 1993). It will be one
      of the smartest things you will ever do).

 2. Secondly, if you have to prepare a contract, always try and write it in `plain English',
      that is, keep it simple. If I have to write a contract, I always get someone to check it to
      try and ensure that it makes sense and that there are no errors. The reason is that
      what you write and what you see are sometimes different.

 3. Final point, like Chapter 3 on negligence, this and subsequent chapters are all written
      with you standing in the shoes of the plaintiff. Why you ask? Because in real life, in
      the examples given in these chapters, you could be the injured party.

Why is it important to have an understanding of contract
law?

Contract law plays an important role in business and society generally, and an
understanding of contract law can be a very useful tool to have a basic knowledge of.
                                                                                                     INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW | 106

Contracts, along with negligence, are a fundamental part of everyone's daily life. They form
the basis of the daily business and consumer transactions that you enter into. Without
enforceable contracts, society as we know it could not exist. Voluntary agreements are
all very well but remember that agreements can never become binding without a legal
contract.

A contract brings a degree of certainty for both businesses and consumers that the parties
will fulfil the obligations that they have agreed to because of its legal enforceability in a court
of law. As you will see, voluntary agreements are not legally enforceable.

What are the sources ofcontractlaw?

PNG contract law is primarily derived from three sources:

   common law (case law)
   equity (case law)
   statute law.

Much of contract law, and the right of freedom to contract, that applies in PNG is based
in common law principles that were developed in the English, Australian and New Zealand
common law courts - that is, case law decisions. You will often find both English and
Australian cases still being cited as authority for a contractual principle even today and you
will find little statute law.

Equitable principles are, like common law, derived from case law, and have also played an
important role in contract law. For example, in the case of formation of a contract, two areas
where the courts have applied equitable or statutory principles are in the areas of:

   promissory/equitable estoppel, which allows a promise to be enforced even if there is
      no consideration (as you see when we look at consideration, this is normally an
      essential element in every simple contract)

   unconscionable contracts, where one party has taken unfair advantage of the other
      (note the purpose of the Fairness of Transactions Act 1993).

                   Online reference
107 | INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW

     If you have a chance, have a look at the Fairness of Transactions Act 1993. Its purpose is
     mainly to ensure overall fairness in any transaction.

What is the difference between a contract and an
agreement?

To a layperson, the terms `contract' and `agreement' are often used to mean one and the
same thing. In fact, one of the traditional definitions of a contract is that it is a legally
enforceable agreement. But while contracts involve an element of agreement, do not
assume that every agreement is going to turn into a legally binding contract.

                     Business tip
       Be aware, an agreement is not necessarily a contract.
       As just noted, while every contract involves an element of agreement, do not assume
       that every agreement will result in a legal contract, because:

             the parties may not intend to create legal relations (for example, many public
                competitions state that a contract is not intended, and going out with a friend on
                a social occasion is certainly not intended to create a contract); and/or

             one or more of the principles governing contractual relations may not have been
                satisfied (for example, the purpose of the agreement may be illegal or there is a
                lack of consideration).

Sometimes a contract exists irrespective of the wishes of the parties. An example is your
compulsory third-party insurance through Motor Vehicles Insurance Ltd (MVIL) as part of
the registration of your vehicle. This can hardly be seen as an `agreement' because neither
you nor MVIL has any choice about either the contents of the contract, or even about
whether you wish to make a contract for compulsory third-party insurance coverage.
                     INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW | 108

What is a contract?

To have any legal significance, the agreement must contain a promise, be supported by
consideration and have been intended by the parties to be legally enforceablein a court of
law. It is the performance of this promise and its legal consequences which are fundamental
to modern society and which form the basis of the study of contract law.

The person who makes the promise is called the promisor, and the person to whom the
promise is made is the promisee. Think about it. You make promises every day: to meet
someone, to go to the movies, to lend money, to obey certain rules and so on. However,
remember that not all of these `promises' are intended to create legal relationships, for
example, agreeing to meet someone or going to the movies. If you don't turn up, do you
expect to be sued?
What distinguishes contractual from non-contractual promises is the consequences of
failure to perform.A promisor who fails to perform a non-contractual promise has no legal
liability.For example, if you arrange to meet a friend at the movies and your friend does not
turn up, are you going to sue them? The failure to turn up is not considered to have very
serious consequences by the courts (other than to the friendship!).
If the promise is contractual, such as a promise by a repair person to fix your laptop and
when you pay them it still doesn't work, then you (as the promisee) are generally entitled
to treat the repairer's promise (as the promisor's promise) as non-performance and a
breach of contract. You can seek a remedy, usually damages, through the courts.

How is an `apparent' simple contract created?

The term `simple contract' refers to the manner of its formation, not the nature of its terms or
that it is `simple' to create. The creation of a simple contract (note that at this stage there is
no question of whether the contract is valid or enforceable), requires the presence of three
elements (or three steps if you like):

   Step 1: was there an agreementbetween the parties? There must be an offer by one
      party, and an acceptanceor some evidence of a final agreement by the other (see
      chapter 5 on agreement).

If you think there is an agreement, go to:

   Step 2: was there an intention to contract? The parties must intend that their promises
      create legally enforceable obligations (see chapter 6).

If you think there is an agreement and intention to contract, go to:
109 | INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW

   Step 3: was there valuable consideration? There must be something of value or
      benefit passing from one party to another in return for a promise to do something,
      unless the promise is made under seal or in the form of a deed (see chapter 6).

Once you have established that each of these elements is present, an apparent simple
contractcan be said to exist. But at this point you do not know whether it is valid, and
therefore enforceable. So don't stop checking yet.

Is the contract enforceable?

If you are satisfied that there is an agreement and that you and the other party intend to
create a contract supported by consideration (if you are entering into a deed, consideration
is not required), then you have successfully created a simple contract, but is it valid and
enforceable?

There are now three more steps you need to take before you can start to feel confident that
what you have created is a valid and enforceable contract, not an unenforceable one:

   Step 4: do the parties have legal capacity? Did both of the parties understand what
      they were doing? What if one or both of the parties had limited capacity, for example,
      were underage (that is, under 18), or under the influence of alcohol or drugs (see
      chapter 7 on `Capacity')?

   Step 5: is there genuine consent? What did the parties' consent to or, was there a
      mistake, a misrepresentation, duress undue influence or unconscionable conduct
      which could mean the contract may fail (see Chapter 8 on `Consent')?

   Step 6: was there legality of purpose and in the proper form? The purpose of the
      contract must be legal, notillegal.

   Step 7: was there any particular formthe contract needed to be in (that is, could the
      contract be oral, or did a statute require it to be in writing)? Are there any statutory
      requirements that must be satisfied? (see Chapter 9 on `Legality' and `Form').

As you will discover, how these questions are answered will help determine whether or not
the contract is enforceable in court should a dispute arise between you and the other party.

How are contracts classified?

Contracts may be classified in a variety of ways, including formation, enforcement,
performance and discharge. Knowledge of how contracts are classified will help you
understand what type of contract you are dealing with, what is required of you and the other
party, and the enforceability of the contract.
                                                                                                     INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW | 110

What are bilateral and unilateral contracts?

Contracts are either bilateral or unilateral, depending on what the offeree (the person
to whom the offer is made)must do to accept the offeror's (the person making the
offer)conditions of agreement. Most contracts are simple and bilateral.

Note the difference between a bilateral and a unilateral contract. The parties have different
obligations under a unilateral contract compared with a bilateral contract. This is why you
need to understand whether the language of the offer is creating a unilateral or a bilateral
contract.

   Bilateral contract: A bilateral contract involves a promise for a promise. It isthe most
      encountered form of contract because it is created every time someone buys goods or
      services. Both parties have obligations.As a buyer, you have an obligation to pay for
      the goods or services, and the seller has an obligation to provide them.

   Unilateral contract: A unilateral contract is where only one party assumes an
      obligation. There is no contract until the offeree performs the requested act, as they
      have the option of choosing whether or not to perform. It is a `promise for an act'.

An example of a unilateral contract involves reward cases where you lose something and
offer a reward to anyone who finds it. There is no obligation on anyone to go and look for the
item. But if someone is aware of the reward and they find the lost item and return it to you,
then there is an obligation on your part to pay the reward if the finder makes a claim for it. If
the offeree abandons their effort halfway through, they would not be in breach of contract.
Nor would they be entitled to payment for their efforts because they have not complied with
the conditions for payment of the reward (that is, they have not found the lost item).

Problems can arise if you, as the offeror of a unilateral contract, attempt to revoke an offer
afterthe offeree has begun performance. While there are no problems if you withdraw the
offer before the offeree begins performance, there may be difficulties where the offeree has
begun or substantially completed performance. As you will see in Section 4 of this chapter,
part-performance of the act called for may be regarded as sufficient consideration for you
as the offeror not to be able to revoke your promise.

What does classification according to enforceability mean?

As you read on, you will discover that there are references by the courts to the contract
being `valid', `voidable', `void', `unenforceable' or `illegal'. It is important to understand the
meaning and effect of each of these words on a contract because they are words used by
the courts to describe the enforceability of the contract between the parties.
111 | INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW

   Valid: a valid contract is one that the law will allow either party to enforce.The parties
      intend to enter into a legal relationship and have agreed on the terms, thus creating
      legal rights and obligations, which the parties can enforce against each other in court.

   Voidable: the contract remains valid and binding unless and until it is rescinded or
      terminated (ended) by the innocent party. The difference between recission and
      termination is important when looking at remedies, as we shall see in the chapter
      `Rights and liabilities of the parties, discharge and remedies', as they create different
      outcomes in relation to damages. Whether a contract is void or voidable can be
      particularly important where an innocent third party is involved. If the contract is
      voidable (that is, it is valid and binding unless and until repudiated by the injured
      party), the seller of an item may not be able to recover the item from a third or
      subsequent party in possession of it if the item was obtained fraudulently.

   Void: a person who enters into a void agreement cannot enforce it or be forced to
      comply with it because there are no legal rights or obligations to enforce or comply
      with from the beginning of the transaction. Nor could they pass on good title to a third
      party because they would have no title to give. For example, if you have your
      computer stolen by another person and they sell it to a third party, the contract
      between the thief and the third party is void or of no legal effect. The thief has no title
      to give to the third party. If third party subsequently sells the computer to a fourth
      person then that person gets the same title to the computer that the third party had -
      that is, no title. You could then force the fourth party to give back the computer or its
      value. Why? Because the fourth party has no title and they would have to seek
      compensation from the third party, and they would have to try to find the thief (good
      luck there) to get back the value of the computer.

   Unenforceable: while the contract appears to be valid,no legal action can be brought
      on it. This can happen because some procedural requirement is lacking - for
      example, a statute requires the contract to be evidenced in writing - for example,
      contracts for the sale of land. Correction of the defect will generally render the
      contract enforceable. This raises the issue of form (see below).

   Illegal: when the purpose of the contract contravenes a statute or the common law, it
      will be illegal and generally treated as being void -for example, something of a
      criminal nature, such as robbing a bank with a friend.

What is classification according to performance?

   Executed contracts: an executed contract is performed and completed at the time of
      making. For example, if I wash your car for K25 and you pay me as soon as I finish,
      the agreement has been fulfilled and the contract expires.

   Executory contracts: an executory contract arises when one of the parties promises
      to do, or refrain from doing,something in the future. For example, I agree to wash your
                                                                                                      INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW | 112

      car next week for K25. Here, both promises are yet to be performed.

What is classification according to formation?

   Express contracts: these are contracts where all the terms are agreed on by the
      parties and they may be:
          wholly in writing (if the contract is important to you, have it put in writing as
            evidence of what you have agreed to)
          evidenced in writing
          oral
          partly written and partly oral.

   Implied contracts: the contract is implied from the circumstances surrounding the
      acts or conduct of the parties. For example, if you catch a taxi, it is implied that you
      will pay the fare and the driver will get you (safely) to your destination.

   Quasi-contracts: The contract is the result of an `agreement' imposed by law, such
      as third-party car insurance and is imposed irrespective of whether there is agreement
      between the parties.

Is the contract a formal or simple contract?

Contracts may be classified into formal and simple contracts. Here the question is about
the way in which the contract is made (its `form')and not about its content(its terms). Of the
two, the simple contract is the one most often encountered in commercial and day-to-day
transactions, but it is still important to understand the difference between formal and simple
contracts because of the consequences that may follow if the wrong choice is made - that
is, the enforceability of the contract.

   Formal contracts: these are contracts that must comply with certain execution
      formalities usually imposed by statute, that is, be in writing and signed. They get their
      validity from their form alone.

Note that the Electronic Transactions Act 2021 has impacted on the statutory requirements
requiring certain contracts to be in writing and signed as set out in the Frauds and
Limitations Act 1988 and theCopyright and Neighbouring Rights Act 2000 by providing
that the Electronic Transactions Act 2021 will apply, with some exceptions, to any kind of
transaction whether it be commercial, non-commercial, domestic or international.

   Deeds (contracts under seal): these are promises that must be in writing on paper,
      parchment or vellum, and signed by the party or parties to the contract and delivered.
      There is no need for consideration. They are often used in a company arrangement (a
113 | INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW

      binding arrangement between a company and its creditors as to how the company's
      affairs will be handled). A deed that is delivered subject to conditions and does not
      come into operation until the fulfilment of these conditions is called an escrow.
   Simple contracts: this is a contract that is neither a formal contract or a deed, so to
      be enforceable, it musthave valuable consideration present for it to be valid.

Subject to statutory requirements, simple contracts can be created expressly, impliedly or
by quasi-contract. By way of an example, a receipt from the supermarket for groceries or a
service station for fuel which contains on its face the date and time of purchase, the items
and the price, as well as the total price paid by the purchaser is evidence of acceptance of
the items and would be more than enough to establish a contract.

                     Business tip

       If the contract is important, put it in writing

       As noted above, if the contract is important, put it in writing and have both parties sign
       it at the bottom of the last page, as well as signing or initialling the bottom of each
       page. This is because written evidence provides greater certainty as to what the
       parties agreed to than is the case with verbal contracts, where much of the evidence
       will be based on the recollections of the parties. Verbal contracts can lead to
       expensive litigation as the parties argue over what they really agreed to.

If the parties have taken the time to reduce the agreement to writing, the courts will assume
that it is a complete record of the contract. Hence the need to be careful when drawing up
a contract because the courts are generally reluctant to admit evidence of acts or words of
the parties before the execution of the document if this has the effect of adding to, varying
or contradicting the written agreement. This is known as the parol evidence rule(see the
chapter 6 `Construction of the contract').

When are contracts void unless in writing?

Certain simple contracts, to be valid and enforceable, are required by statute to be wholly
in writing. If they are not, they are void. Note that the Electronic Transactions Act 2021 now
satisfies the statutory requirement of `in writing' if the document is in electronic format.
                                                                                                      INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW | 114

What contracts must be evidenced in writing?

There is a second class of contracts that statutes require to be evidenced in writing. The
absence of writing does not affect their validity, but it makes them unenforceable in a court
of law.

The Sale of goods of K20 or more

Section 6 of the Goods Act 1951requires contracts for the sale of goods costing K20 or
more to have one of the following three requirements, or they will be unenforceable:

   the buyer has accepted part of the goods sold and actually received the same; or
   the buyer has given something in earnest to bind the contract or has given something

      in part-payment to bind the contract; or
   some note or memorandum in writing of the contract is made and signed by the party

      to be charged or by their authorised agent--for example, an auctioneer is the agent of
      the seller and, after the sale, also an agent of the buyer.

What is a note or memorandum?

A note or memorandum can take any documentary form--a letter, docket, invoice or even
an entry in an auctioneer's book--and it does not even have to be contained in one
document, but it must show all of the following (s 6(1)):

   the names of the parties
   the subject matter
   the consideration; and
   the signature of the party to be proceeded against or the party's authorised agent.

What is e-Commerce?

E-commerce is about individuals and businesses buying and selling goods and services
online, that is, over the internet. You can participate in e-commerce anywhere you can
find an internet connection. In PNG the formation of the e-contract is regulated under the
Electronic Transactions Act 2021 and, it provides that the law must treat electronic and
paper-based contracts, in terms of formation, equally.

It should be noted that the legal framework required to govern e-commerce in PNG for
products and services is a work-in-progress with the National Government yet to develop

a comprehensive e-commerce policy notwithstanding that e-commerce now makes up a
significant proportion of the PNG market.

                  Reflection questions

     It is the end of the chapter so a good time for a break. Here are some revision questions
     for you to think about as well as a problem question while having a break. Write down
     your thoughts as they form part of your notes.

     A. What elements are necessary for the creation of a valid simple contract?

     B. Explain the difference between a formal and a simple contract.

     C. Explain what sort of problems may arise in contract law for users of e-commerce?

     D. Explain whether an unaddressed proposal in an electronic communication to create a
     contract is an invitation to make an offer or is it an offer that others can accept?
     PROBLEM: You have decided to buy some land to build a house on. You made an offer on
     some land owned by Kone. An initial text from the defendant's agent advised you that the
     vendors would accept K410,000 on a 30-day settlement. It identified the land and the
     essential terms of the bargain. You confirmed acceptance of the terms and asked Kone to
     advise on the procedures for the contract and payment of the deposit.
     The agreement was not made subject to the signing of a contract and it was anticipated
     that you would pay a deposit forthwith and sign a contract in accordance with the terms of
     the agreement. On the same day, Kone's agent sent you a text which contained several
     attachments, which you downloaded, signed and scanned and returned to the Kone's
     agent.
     Kone subsequently refused to sign the contract. One of his arguments was that as the
     contract was for the sale and purchase of land, PNG law provided that no action could be
     brought on any contract for the sale unless an agreement or some memorandum or note
     of it was in writing and signed by Kone or his authorised agent.
     QUESTION: Is there a contract?
     WHAT IS YOUR DECISION?
     HINT: Do you think that an exchange of texts was sufficient to constitute a note or
                                                                                                     INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW | 116

     memorandum? Remember that the memorandum or note does not need to be contained
     in one document; it can be made up of several documents that can be connected.

       Key points

To help you have a better understanding of Chapter 4, here is a list of Key Points on some
introductory matters with respect to contracts.

   What is the difference between a contract and an agreement? A contract is a
      written or oral agreement containing promises made between two or more parties that
      create rights and obligations enforceable in a court of law. An agreement, while similar
      to a contract, is not legally binding and enforceable because it lacks one or more of
      the essential prerequisites that must be present for a legally enforceable contract.

   What is the definition of a contract? A contract is an agreement containing
      promises made between two or more parties that create rights and obligations that are
      enforceable in a court of law.

   What are the elements of a simple contract? Intention to create legal relations,
      agreement and consideration must be present to create a simple contract. There is no
      question of validity.

   What is required for a simple contract to be valid? Legal capacity, genuine
      consent, legality of objects, and compliance with form will determine whether the
      simple contract is not valid or enforceable.

   What is the difference between formal and simple contracts? A formal contract is
      signed, sealed and delivered, and derives its validity from its form alone (it does not
      need consideration). A simple contract requires the presence of all 6 elements
      (including consideration) and compliance with any statutory requirements (form), and
      may be oral, written, or partly oral and partly written.

        Key terms

Here are some terms you will encounter in this Chapter, which will help you to better
understand this chapter:

          Acceptance: an unqualified assent given in response to an offer, which creates
            an agreement.

          Agreement: one of the requirements for the creation of a contract, normally
            consisting of an `offer' and an `acceptance', which may arise expressly or be
            inferred from conduct, between two or more people.

          Contract: an agreement containing promises made between two or more parties,
            with the intention of creating certain rights and obligations, which is enforceable in
            a court of law.

          Counter-offer: an offer made in response to an offer which implies rejection and
            terminates the original offer.

          e-contract: a contract created electronically in the course of e-commerce,
            generally by email or SMS.
                                                                                                AGREEMENT: OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE | 118

          Formal contract or deed: a contract that has been signed, sealed and delivered,
            and does not require consideration.

          Objective test: a test that asks whether the words or conduct of the parties
            would lead a reasonable person to believe, on the balance of probabilities, that
            legal relations were intended - that is, whether they intended to create a contract.

          Offer: a communication amounting to a promise to do (or not do) something.
          Offeree: the one to whom an offer is made.
          Offeror: the one who makes the offer.
          Promisee: the person who is receiving, or the recipient of, the promise.
          Promisor: the person undertaking the promise.
          Simple contract: a contract that is made orally or in writing (or both) involving an

            agreement between parties with the intention of creating legally enforceable
            obligations and which requires consideration to be valid.
          Rejection: occurs where the party to whom the offer was made (the offeree) tells
            the party making the offer (the offeror) that they are not accepting the offer, which
            terminates it.
          Revocation: occurs where the offeror withdraws an offer, which then terminates
            it.
          Termination: bringing the contract to an end before it is fully performed.

        Introduction

In this chapter we are going to begin by looking at what the law requires to be established
for the creation of a simple contract: the agreement. The agreement is based on two
elements: offer and acceptance and each must meet certain criteria if there is to be an
agreement. Unless the parties agree, a contract cannot come into existence.

Step 1: Agreement between the parties

To find out whether there is a simple contract look at the facts to see whether you can
identify whether there has been an offer by one party and an acceptanceby the other to
form an agreement. If there is an agreement, that will form the basis for a simple contract.Or
to put it another way, no agreement, no contract.
119 | AGREEMENT: OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE

What constitutes a contractual agreement?

The agreement goes to the heart of a contract because, unless the parties agree, a
contract cannot come into existence.

So, what is an agreement? It is the culmination of a negotiating process between the
parties. Today, negotiations are often done electronically with the exchange of internet files
and the use of electronic communication tools such as Skype, Zoom, Team and other voice-
over IP programs.

But just note that it is not the negotiating process that creates legal rights and obligations
but, rather, the end of that process--the contract of which the agreement is a part (the other
parts being intention and consideration).
To determine whether an agreement exists, a traditional starting pointhas been to consider
three components:

   there is a minimum of two parties (but note that there can be more than two parties,
      which is known as a multipartite agreement)

   there is an offer; and
   there is an acceptance.

But that is not the end of the story because in addition to the three components mentioned
above there must be:

   an exact correlation between the two sides of the agreement--what is known as a
      consensus ad idem--that is, the parties must have exactly the same thing in mind

   an offer by one party (offeror) to be bound on certain terms; and

   an unqualified acceptance (not limited or restricted in any way) to that offer
      communicated by the other party (offeree) to the offeror

                     Business tip
       If the parties haven't reached an agreement, that is the end of the story. Where the
                                                                                                AGREEMENT: OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE | 120

       parties do appear to have reached an agreement, the following considerations should
       still be noted:

             Generally, only what is agreed between the parties during the offer and
                acceptance stages can become part of the contract. Terms the parties have not
                agreed on or have forgotten to include in the contract are not considered part of
                the contract. Such terms may require a new contract or result in expensive
                litigation to try to determine what it was that the parties agreed to.

             Changes cannot be made unilaterally - that is, by one party. Variations,
                alterations or additions must be agreed to by both parties.

             The terms and conditions that make up the agreement create legally
                enforceable rights and obligations, and if they are not carried out--that is, they
                are broken--then the matter may finish up in court.

Is there agreement between the parties? How do you determine
an agreement?

Traditionally, the courts have said that an agreement is reached when the conduct of the
parties can be characterised in terms of an `offer' by one party (offeror) and an `acceptance'
by another (offeree). This technique is certainly important in determining the time, place and
content of the agreement, and it is a useful tool in most cases, but it is not the only available
means of contract formation because there are cases where it is not easy to locate an offer
or acceptance.

The courts have not abandoned the traditional approach of using offer and acceptance to
determine agreement. It is just that in some cases the traditional approach is not helpful
in determining whether the parties have reached an agreement. As McHugh AJA, in the
Australian case of Integrated Computer Services Pty Ltd v Digital Equipment Corp (Aust)
Pty Ltd (1988) 5 BPR11 at 110, suggested that `contracts may be inferred from the acts and
conduct of parties as well as or in the absence of their words'. The question is whether the
facts, when viewed as a whole and objectively considering the surrounding circumstances,
show that, from the point of view of reasonable persons on both sides, a concluded
agreement has been reached. That may not be easy, particularly if the contracting parties
have used qualifying words in their agreement such as `the purchaser intendsto acquire...'
or `the proposedagreement will provide that ...'. The words in italics would suggest that an
agreement had not been reached if you think about the meaning of those words.

If the parties have not reached agreement on terms that they regard as essential for a
121 | AGREEMENT: OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE

binding agreement, there can be no binding agreement. But this doesn't consider the extent
to which the courts are prepared to go to hold that a contract exists in a commercial
transaction, if the essential or critical terms have been agreed on. Even a series of emails
may be enough to create a contract.

How do the courts approach commercial or business
transactions?

In the case of commercial transactions, the courts will try to ensure that the expressed
arrangements and expectations of the parties are carried out where they are satisfied that
the parties have reached agreement. This is judged by objective standards, notwithstanding
that the communications between the parties might have been uncertain and particular
terms had still to be worked out. But in the great majority of cases the traditional approach
of offer and acceptance will still suffice.

As far as agreement is concerned, note the following:

   Agreement is the result of negotiations by two or more persons of the substance of a
      contract. It may not necessarily be the contract.

   It is unusual for the parties to have discussed and agreed to every term of the
      agreement. In some cases, if the negotiations have been going on for some time, this
      may be true. However, in many commercial transactions there will only be broad
      agreement on the substance of the contract, with the details to be worked out later. It
      is the act of assent which gives rise to the agreement.

   In business today, many agreements are entered into based on standard form
      documentation. This consists of a set of pre-written, standard, non-negotiable
      provisions in the agreement between the parties and are commonly found in business
      transactions where there is high-volume distribution of goods and services between
      sellers and consumers - for example, consumer credit and insurance contracts, eBay
      user agreements and airline conditions of carriage. These type of `standard form'
      agreements are usually drawn up in advance by the person putting the agreement
      forward (usually the party with the most bargaining power), with the other party offered
      the terms on a `take it or leave it' basis. If there is an inequality in the bargaining
      power between the parties and this raises the question of not only ascertaining
      whether `agreement' has been reached but, in some business transactions, whose
      terms will prevail.

   The term `agreement' assumes that the parties are in an equal bargaining position.
      However, the reality is that in many consumer and commercial transactions, the
      inequality of bargaining power means that many contracts are not arrived at by
      `real' agreement. The weaker party, who is often a consumer, either accepts the
                                                                                                AGREEMENT: OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE | 122

      terms or goes without. It is only then where the pressure used by the stronger party is
      unconscionable that the courts may be prepared to set aside the contract (see
      Chapter 11, `Terms of the contract').
   Even if the agreement is considered to be non-contractual, it may still result in a
      statutory breach of, for example, the Fairness of Transaction Act 1993.

                     Business tip
       Agreement does not have to go into detail, if it can be said that a reasonable person
       would believe that an offer had been made and was accepted by the other party.

Can you have an agreement arising from conduct?

While offer and acceptance are, as a general rule, clearly expressed in an agreement, it is
still possible for an agreement to arise by way of implication as a result of the conduct of
the parties. For example, at a yacht club regatta, you and all the other competitors had to
sign an undertaking to be bound by the club rules as a condition of participation, but not
with each other. One the rules provided that a competitor should pay all damages if they
injured another competitor or their boat. Here, while there was no clear offer and
acceptance, the effect of entering the regatta and undertaking to be bound by a common
set of rules, suggests acceptance on your part to create a contractual obligation as a
condition of entry.
Mere participation will generally not on its own provide the basis of a contract between
participants and organisers. But in the example of you entering the regatta above, there is
evidence of intention to enter into a contract from the conduct of the parties. Signing the
undertaking meant you accepted that you would be bound by the rules as a condition
of participation--a multipartite transaction. The court looks at the conduct of the parties
and the documents that governed entry into the competition.

                Reflection question
123 | AGREEMENT: OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE

     Time for a break. But think about the questions below and how you would answer
     them. Write down your thoughts and add them to your notes:

         1. What problems, if any, can you see for consumers with the use of standard form
             contracts?

         2. What does the term `agreement' mean to you? How often do you think you enter
             into an agreement and what it means legally?

     PROBLEM:

     FACTS: You and another athlete were both boxers competing for Olympic selection but
     only one could be selected. To be selected, you had to sign a Selection Agreement, an
     Athlete Nomination Form and a Team Membership Agreement. The documents, which
     used expressions such as `Agreement' and `Form', covered a number of matters, including
     an exclusion clause accepting that the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) was the final
     court of appeal. You were initially nominated to represent PNG in boxing. The other
     competitor unsuccessfully appealed that decision to the Boxing Federation of PNG
     Appeal Tribunal, but then successfully appealed to the CAS. You then sought leave to
     appeal the CAS award and the matter was heard in the PNG Supreme Court.

     ISSUE: Could you win? Did the Supreme Court have jurisdiction?

     DECISION: ?

     HINT: How carefully did you read the facts because they contain the answer?

What are the rules relating tooffer?

In determining whether there is a valid offer or something else (for example, invitation to
treat, inquiry or supply of information which cannotbe accepted), there must be:

   an intention or willingness to be bound
   a firm promiseor clearly stated offer; and
   communication of the offer (preferably in writingif the transaction is important to you,

      though it can be oralor by conduct and by you as the offeror or a person
      authorised to make the offer or communicate it (as in, your agent).

The following rules apply to offers generally:

   They may be made to one person, a group or to the world at large
                                                                                                AGREEMENT: OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE | 124

   They may be kept open if supported by consideration (this is known as an option)
   All terms must be brought to the notice of the offeree and followed exactly
   They may be terminated.

What is the meaning of `offer'?

An offer is a clear expression of the termsunder which a person like yourself is prepared
to enter into a contract with another person and be bound by their acceptance of those
terms. There is a definite intention to be bound. But note only an offer can be accepted and
lead to agreement.

No particular form is requiredfor the making or delivery of an offer. This can be
contrasted with an acceptance, where the offeror may require the offereeto accept in a
particular form or way (for example, by accepting in writing, only by mail or only by email).

The offer creates for the offeree(a person, a class of persons or the world at large to whom
the offer is directed and who can accept the offer) the ability to subsequently create a
contract if they unconditionally accept the terms of your offer (the offeror is the person
making the offer) and all the other elements necessary to establish a contract can be
satisfied.

What makes a statement an offer depends on what the parties had in mind(as in, the
intention of the parties, which is considered in Chapter 6) at the time the statement was
made.

In many disputes it will be impossible to determine what the parties were thinking, so the
courts will rely on an `objective testof a reasonable person'. That is, would a reasonable
person have thought that the offer you made was with the intention of being bound
as soon as it was receive by the other party?

What the parties want to call the statement does not really matter. They may call it an `offer',
but in reality, it may indicate only a willingness to negotiate or be an indication of the price
that a person may be prepared to sell at, while at this stage they don't intend to be bound. In
other words, there must be an explicit offer. For example, you send Jax an email saying
`Will you sell me your property?' and Jax replies `Lowest price K900,000'. This will be taken
to be only a response to a request for information.

If it is clear in the circumstances that a party intends their words or conduct to constitute
an offer, then the courts will be prepared to construe it as such. An example of where
an advertisement was considered to be an offer rather than one inviting offers (called `an
invitation to treat') was Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co[1893] 1 QB 256 (`Carlill v Carbolic
125 | AGREEMENT: OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE

Smoke Ball Co'). The court found that the words used in the company's advertising were
sufficiently specific to show to a reasonable person that it intended to be bound.

                  Reflection question

     Case
     Read the case of Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co and see if you agree with the result?
     Look at a copy of the advertisement to help you decide whether you have a problem with
     the advertisement.
     Having read the court's decision, consider the following questions:

           who were the parties (the plaintiff and defendant)?
           Briefly summarise the facts.
           What were the issues before the court?
           Why did the court find the advertising could be construed as an offer?
           Just as a matter of interest, would you sue if you had bought a product that the

             seller guaranteed would work and it didn't?
     Similarly, the use of words such as `rain check' or phrases such as `until stocks run out' or
     `one per customer' suggests that the offeror intended the offer to be promissory rather
     than a calling for offers.

                     Business tip
       Look carefully at the words and/or conduct you use if you are the party making the
       offer (the offeror). Are they promissory or not? Could they amount to an offer? The
                                                                                                AGREEMENT: OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE | 126

       question you must ask is whether from the language used or the actions of the parties,
       was there an intention or willingness to be bound?

What is the importance ofcommunication?

How you as the offeror wants to communicate or make your offer is entirely up to you, but
only you (or your authorised) agent can communicate the offer. How else would the
other party know that you were intending to make an offer if you didn't tell them?
In the English case of Powell v Lee (1908) 99 LT 284, Powell applied for the position of
headmaster of a school and the board of the school passed a resolution appointing him. The
board didn't immediately notify Powell of its decision, but a member of the board privately
told him his offer of employment had been accepted. The board subsequently rescinded
its decision and appointed another person. In this case the court held that there was no
contract between Powell and the board as the resolution was not conveyed by anyone with
authority.
Communication can be in:

   writing (including via the internet or text message)
   orally; or
   by conduct.

Regardless of the method chosen, it is vital to the formation of a contract that the
offeror indicates an intention or a willingness to be bound by the offer, otherwise it will
be seen as an invitation to commence negotiations, or the soliciting of an offer.

                     Business tip
       Put the offer in writing if it is important
       If the proposed contract is important, then put the offer in writing for the purposes of
       certainty and reducing potential exposure to expensive litigation. The terms of the offer
127 | AGREEMENT: OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE

       must be clear enough for the offeree to be able to decide whether to accept or reject
       your offer, and should include at least the following:

             Identify who the parties are
             Identify the subject matter, and quantity if it is goods
             Consideration (usually in dollars) to be paid (how, when, and where)
             time of performance method of acceptance; and
             Method of performance.

Is an invitation to treat an offer?

An invitation to treat is not an offer. It is an invitation to a party to make an offer and cannot
be accepted by you if you are the other party. The party making the invitation to treat does
not intend to be bound. It is an expression of a willingness to start the offer and acceptance
process, which in time may produce an offer and acceptance but until that point is reached,
it cannot form a legally binding contract.

Even the use of the word `offer' may not be enough to demonstrate an intention to be bound.
In these circumstances, it is the party who responds to the invitation who will be the
party making the offer.

Invitations to treat are a part of everyday life more often than you think. Instances generally
considered to be invitations to treat include:

   auctions
   the advertisement of tenders
   goods placed on shop shelves and in shop windows
   goods/services advertised in catalogues or newspapers, or on radio, television or the

      internet; and
   price lists, circulars and catalogues.

For the purposes of commercial reality and commercial practicality, the courts have
accepted that goods on display in a shop or supermarket, advertisements or price lists
circulars and catalogues are to be treated as invitations to treat unless there is something
to clearly indicate otherwise, such as a sign making it clear that the goods on display are on
`sale' or a `one-off price'. Imagine if the goods on the shelves were treated as offers. If you
                                                                                                AGREEMENT: OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE | 128

took them off the shelves wouldn't that constitute your acceptance? Returning them could
then amount to a breach of contract!

Are self-serve situations invitations to treat?

Not all self-serve situations can be considered invitations to treat. Automatic vending
machines, such as drink, confectionery and ticket dispensing machines, as well as self-
serve petrol stations, are notconsidered to be invitations to treat. The reason is found in
commercial reality and practicality: How would you return the goods?

What about advertising of goods or services in the media or
online?

Generally, the advertising of goods or services in newspapers, on the radio, television or the
internet, as well as price lists, circulars and cataloguesshould be regarded as invitations to
treat. Generally, there is no indication of intention to be bound on the part of the advertiser.
But you need to read the advertisement carefully to determine whether it is an offer or an
invitation to treat.

However, while advertisements are generally regarded as invitations to treat, it is always
possible for the advertiser to make it clear in the advertisement that they intend to be legally
bound as Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co (an English case) illustrated above. In the case
the court considered that the wording of the advertisement was such that it could only
considered as an offer to the world at large because the company was guaranteeing to pay
100 to anyone who contracted influenza after purchasing the advertiser's smoke ball, and
it had deposited 1000 into the bank as an indication of its sincerity.

For online retailers of goods and services, generally the prices online are an invitation to
treat. If you shop online, where do you stand when a mistake arises? To avoid problems
arising with customers over pricing mistakes, the retailer's terms and conditions must clearly
outline that it is generally the customer who makes the offer and the retailer who accepts or
declines that offer.

Note that a statement is not an offer if it expressly provides that the person making it must
perform some further act before they are bound - for example, paying a deposit or signing
it. The offer must be unconditionalor else it will be an invitation to treat.

Are auctions invitations to treat?

An advertisement for an auction is not an offer to hold it but an invitation to treat
-that is, it is inviting people to come along and make offers or bids. If you go to an auction
129 | AGREEMENT: OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE

and it is cancelled, you have no remedy against the auctioneer as you have no contract with
them. The advertisement of the auction was not a guarantee that it would be held but simply
a declaration of intention or an invitation to treat.

When an auction is held with a reserve, as in, where the auction has a minimum sale price,
it is only when the hammer falls that a contract is formed. If that were not the case, every
time a higher bid was made there would be a breach of contract. Up until the hammer falls,
which formally signifies acceptance, the auctioneer can choose whether to accept a bid or
even indicate that a bid previously accepted is no longer valid. Where the auction is held
without a reserve, the auctioneer makes a unilateral offer which is accepted by the person
submitting the highest bid.

The vendor can withdraw the property from sale at any time before a bid has been accepted
and, likewise, a bidder can withdraw any offer they have made up until the hammer falls.
Remember, acceptance occurs on the `fall' of the auctioneer's hammer, and the
auctioneer then becomes the agent for the buyer.

What is the effect of a request for information?

Distinguish a counter-offer from a mere request for further information. Thelatter does
not destroy the offer. If there is nota firm promise, there is not a rejection of the original
offer by the counter-offer.

A party who supplies information that has been requested is not intending to be bound by
that response and, as a result, it is not usually viewed as an offer. For example, you see
a car parked in the street and you approach the owner and ask if the car is for sale. They
say, `Lowest cash price is K$42,500' and you reply, `I agree. That is a fair price.' You have
a problem as your initial enquiry is not an offer. The court will treat the owner's response as
nothing more than an indication of the minimum price they might sell the vehicle for.
Your response is not acceptance but an offer to buy (you are the offeror) and it is up to the
owner (who is the offeree) to accept or reject your offer. There is no contract.

The person providing the information can, of course, include words in their response which
make it clear that an offer is intended - for example, by saying, `I am prepared to sell my
car to you for K$12,500. Please confirm your acceptance by return mail.'

What is the effect of a statement of intention?

Generally, a statement of intention is nothing more than a declaration by a party that
they are prepared to buy, sellor trade.There is usually no intention that their statements
                                                                                                AGREEMENT: OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE | 130

or actions are to be legally binding, although in each case the statements mustbe viewed
in context.

What is the effect of words such as `subject to contract'?

It is possible to negate the effects of intention in an offer by including in any documents a
proviso that states the agreement is `subject to contract', or `not valid until signed' or some
similar requirement. But be careful because the court will make an objective assessment
of what the parties intended, taking into account the subject matter of the agreement,
the status of the parties to it, the relationship between them and other surrounding
circumstances, and whether a reasonable person would have concluded that a binding
contract had been made.

Some rules about offers: When does an offer become effective?

Common sense would suggest thatan offer is not effective until it is brought to the
notice of the person to whom it is directed. Knowledge of the offer by the offeree is
paramount. If the facts show that if a person has acted in ignorance of an offer, or that they
didn't do the act with the intention of accepting the offer, there will be no acceptance and
therefore no contract.

Who you make an offer to is up to you, but it can be:

   a particular person, in which case only that person can accept or reject it
   a group of people, in which case any person within that group may accept or reject it;

      or
   the whole world (frequently by way of advertisement), where any person who is

      aware of the offer may accept it by complying with the terms of the offer.

In Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co [1893] 1 QB 256 above, remember the Smoke Ball
Company published advertisements in newspapers during an influenza epidemic claiming
that anyone who used its `smoke balls' according to its instructions would not catch
influenza. If they did after using the company's smoke balls, they would receive 100.

The advertisement was an offer made to all the world. Acceptance took place when a
person came forward and, in reliance of the advertisement, performed the necessary
conditions (which Mrs Carlill did by her performance of the conditions contained in the
advertisement).

Carlill's case is an example of a unilateralcontract - that is, a contract constituted by an
offer of a promise for an act, rather than the usual exchange of promises. There is only one
131 | AGREEMENT: OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE

promisor, and acceptance is by performance. This can be compared with a bilateral contract
where there are mutual promises between the two parties.

What is an option?

The purpose of an option is usually to give the offeree time to consider whether they do in
fact wish to buy the item under consideration, or to raise the necessary finance. In such a
case, an option will arise if you as the offeror promises to keep the offer open for a specified
period.
An option will be unenforceable unless it is supported by the offeree's consideration.
Once consideration is given, the court is not concerned about the amount of the
consideration (its adequacy) as long as it existsand has some value.

Where there is an option in an agreement, if the parties have made no provision as to the
time during which the option must be exercised, the implication is that the option will be
executed in reasonable time--a question of fact depending on the circumstances in each
case. For example, 16 months to exercise a clause in a partnership agreement to acquire
the share of a deceased partner was not reasonable, even though the agreement did not
specify a time limit to exercise the share option.

                     Business tip
       Options and return of the consideration
       The use of an option supported by consideration by an offeree can prevent you as the
       offeror from revoking your offer for a specified period. It also means that you have also
       agreed not to sell the item to anyone other than the offeree within that period.
       However, you should specify in the option contract whether the offeree will recover
       the deposit money they may have given you if the option is not exercised. If you sell
       the item on which a deposit has been paid in the option period, then that would
       amount to a breach of contract and the offeree could sue you for damages.

Do any terms have to be followed exactly?

Any terms or conditions specified by you as the offeror must be met by the offereein
accepting theoffer, such as `reply by email only'. The key word is `only', as it suggests
                                                                                                AGREEMENT: OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE | 132

that you have a particular reason in mind for wanting a reply in this fashion. Any terms or
conditions should be brought to the notice of the offeree as they set out the parameters on
which you are prepared to be bound. Words like `only' (which means solely or exclusively),
must be exactly followed if there is to be a valid acceptance.

                     Business tip
       Notice of terms
       If you are making the offer, make it clear what the terms and conditions of the offer are.
       If a dispute arises, the question for the courts to consider will be whether the parties
       have, in fact, ever reached an agreement. This is always a question of fact to be
       decided objectively based on whether a reasonable person would have concluded
       that an offer had been made.

How can an offer be terminated?

Termination

Termination must be done before acceptance(except in the case of a `condition
subsequent'; see `Lapse by failure of a condition' later in this chapter) and can only be
revived by the offeror if you are the offeror.

Revocation (cancellation, withdrawal)

For a revocation to be effective, the offeree must be made aware that the offer has
been withdrawn before acceptance can take place. Generally, there is no required
method or special form of language required for revocation to be effective, if it is
communicated before acceptance takes place. What must be established is that:

   notice of revocation has been sent to the offeree; and
   the offeree has been made aware of the revocation before they have accepted the

      offer.

If you are the offeror, you can still withdraw the offer even if you said that it would remain
open for a specified period, but this is provided that the offer was not given under seal or
supported by consideration.
133 | AGREEMENT: OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE

If the offeree had become aware of the revocation of your offer from a reliable source,
which does not just have to be you, and it was therefore clear to the offeree that you no
longer wished to proceed, the offer is validly revoked. Communication of the withdrawal to
the offeree's agent can be effective if it is within the agent's actual or apparent authority to
receive such a communication.

Note the method used to communicate the offer because, unless the offer states otherwise,
acceptance should be communicated by the same or a faster method. Also note the date
and time of receipt of the offer and if there is revocation of the offer, when was it received
by the offeree (before or after acceptance by the offeree)?

Rejection or counter-offer

An offer may be terminated expressly by the offeree through their words or conduct.
It may also be terminated by implication by a counter-offer, which also amounts to a
rejection. A counter-offer is an express or implied rejection of the offeror's original offer
by the offeree - for example, the price for goods or services - and the introduction of a
replacement offer. If you offer to sell your car to a potential buyer for K10,000 and they offer
you K9000, which you reject, can the buyer then accept the original price of K10,000? The
answer is `No'.

The effect of the counter-offer is to permanently revoke the earlier offer by you and to
substitute a new one by the buyer in its place. Effectively, you, as the original offeror and
the buyer, as the original offeree, have changed roles. You are now the offeree, and you
have the choice of accepting or rejecting the `new' offer. The only way that the original offer
can be revived is if you choose to revive it. Otherwise, there is no agreement between you
and the buyer.

It is necessary to distinguish between a counter-offer and a request for information.
A request for information generally does not cause the offer to lapse as it is not
considered a counter-offer. In the case of your car, if the potential buyer asks, `Does
the car have a roadworthy certificate?', your original offer still stands. The buyer (the
offeree) has neither accepted nor rejected your offer, they have merely made a request for
information.

Lapse of time

If you (as the offeror) specify a time during which the offer will remain open, it
remains open only for that time. It may be withdrawn by you before that time by notifying
the people to whom the offer was directed that the offer has been withdrawn, but this must
occur before there has been an acceptance. Note that if the offer is made but there is an
                                                                                                AGREEMENT: OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE | 134

option to keep it open for a specified time that is supported by consideration, then the offer
cannot lapse (or be withdrawn) until the expiry of that time.

Where no time limit is specified, the offer remains open for a reasonable time. What
`reasonable' means will depend on the circumstances of each particular case, but it
includes the language used by the parties (including any stipulations contained in the offer
or which might affect its acceptance) and the subject matter.

Is there a time factor that needs to be considered? An offer will be short-lived in the case of
perishable goods or goods for which the price fluctuates quickly in the market (for example,
oil, gold or even the currency market). In the case of land, providing that there is nothing in
the offer to indicate a degree of urgency, the offer will remain open for a longer time but not
indefinitely.

                     Business tip
       Where no time has been specified for the acceptance of an offer, it must be accepted
       within a reasonable time. What constitutes a `reasonable time' will depend on what the
       offer is for. In the case of perishables, for example, the offer will remain open for only a
       short time. But just note that if a person accepts an offer after it has lapsed, while the
       acceptance itself will not give rise to a binding contract, there is no reason why you, if
       you are the original offeror, couldn't treat it as an offer and accept it.

Lapse by death of either party

The effect of death on the offer will depend on several factors, such as:

   the nature of the contract (for example, was it to be a contract of a personal nature?
      For example, to paint a portrait of your family); and

   the knowledge of the other party.

Death will terminate a contract only where it is for personal services. If there is no personal
involvement of the offeror in the offer, the estate of the deceased offeror may be liable in
contract.
If the offeree learns of your death (and you are the offeror) before acceptance of the offer,
then a purported acceptance will be ineffective because the offer will have lapsed. But
135 | AGREEMENT: OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE

where the offeree is unaware of your death, it is possible that a valid acceptance can still
bind your estate if the offer does not involve the personal involvement of the deceased
offeror.

Lapse by failure of a condition

If an offer is made subject to a condition and this condition is not fulfilled, then the offer will
lapse. For example, a clause or term in the offer stating `reply by email' indicates a degree
of urgency, and so acceptance by mail would not comply with the stipulation, thus causing
the offer to lapse.

A condition precedentis a clause or term in the agreement stating that the
agreementdoes not become a contract until the happening of a specified event.For
example, a `subject to finance' clause in an agreement, if not fulfilled, causes the offer to
lapse.

A condition subsequent clause in a contract may cause the contract to terminate, if the
parties have stated that the occurrence of a particular event will give the parties that right.
Just note that here the contract is already in operation.

                  Reflection question

     That is the end of the rules relating to offer. So, take a break but first have a look at the
     following questions and see if you can answer them for revision.

         1. Explain what an offer is
         2. List and explain the main rules relating to an offer
         3. Explain what is required for an offer to be validly accepted
         4. Explain why it is necessary to distinguish between an offer and an invitation to treat

             from the perspective of both a customer and a seller
         5. Under what circumstances will an apparent invitation to treat situation become an

             offer?
         6. Explain under what circumstances an offer can be terminated
         7. Explain the difference between a condition precedent and a condition subsequent

             and give an example of each in relation to the purchase of a car.
                                                                                                AGREEMENT: OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE | 136

What are the rules relating to acceptance?

An acceptance converts the promise or promises of you as the offeror (represented
by the offer) into an agreement. Before acceptance of the offer, neither party is bound to
the agreement;after acceptance, both parties are bound.
Acceptance contains two elements:

   a willingness to take exactly what is offered; and
   an agreement to pay the `price' required.

                  In brief

     Rules as to acceptance
     If there is to be agreement, the acceptance:

           must be made in reliance on the offer
           must be strictly in accordance with the terms of the offer
           must be communicated to the offeror orally, in writing or by conduct
           cannot be a cross-offer (discussed below)
           can be accepted only by the party to whom the offer was made
           must be absolute and unqualified; and
           once made, cannot be revoked without the assent of the offeror

When the offeree accepts your offer by either promising to perform (as in, a promise to do
or refrain from doing an act), thus creating a bilateral contract, or performance of the act
requested by you as the offeror creating a unilateral contract they become known as the
acceptor.

Methods of acceptance

Once you have got the question of offer sorted in your mind, you now need to turn to the
question of acceptance. Acceptance may be made:
137 | AGREEMENT: OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE

   in writing
   orally
   by a combination of orally and in writing; or
   by conduct.

However, if acceptance is to occur, it mustconform with any conditions that might be
required by you as the offeror. Again, the courts use an objective testto determine
whether an acceptance has taken place, as in, what would a reasonable person have
thought or done?In this case, would a reasonable person have thought there was an
acceptance of the offer?

Must acceptance be made in reliance on the offer?

The offeree must intend to accept your offeror there can be no agreement between the
parties. Acceptance must clearly be made in response to, and because of, the offer.

Where you specify a special or particular method of acceptance, it must be followed
exactly. So, if you are renting a unit, house, or business premises and the lease contains a
term about punctual payment of rent, then failure to pay regularly and on time means there
is little chance of the lease being renewed by the landlord because you are not carrying out
one of the conditions prescribed in the lease agreement.

Where no method of acceptance is indicated, the custom of the trade or what is reasonable
in the circumstances will be good acceptance. Thus, an offer by SMS suggests the need for
a prompt reply, so any method equally as fast or faster will be effective.

Must acceptance be communicated to the offeror?

As a general rule,acceptance must be communicated, either by words or conduct,
otherwise how will you know whether or not you are bound by your offer. In other words,
some positive act on the part of the offeree indicating an intention to accept is required.
Silenceon its own on the part of the offereeis generally insufficientto create a contract,
just as the imposition of an acceptance by you on the offeree is insufficient.

There are situations where silence can amount to acceptance which include:

   where the offeree has signed an agreement indicating continuing acceptance of
      delivery until further notification - for example, subscriptions to internet services or
      membership of a local gym debited on a monthly basis, where the offeree, by their
      conduct, has allowed work to go ahead and made progress payments and where you
      dispense with the requirement of communication, and acceptance is to be by
      performance of an act
                                                                                                AGREEMENT: OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE | 138

   where there is a history of prior dealings between the parties
   where it is just and equitable - for example, where the conduct of the proposed tenant

      led the owner to believe that the tenant would lease the premises and the owner went
      ahead and undertook major demolition and construction work in that belief
   by conduct, where the parties by their actions show that they intend to be bound; and
   where the postal rule applies (see below).

The ultimate issue is whether a reasonable bystander would regard the conduct of the
offeree, including their silence, as suggesting to the offeror that the offer has been
accepted.

Who can accept an offer?

Only the person or persons to whom the offer was directed, or their authorised agent,
can accept the offer.

If someone else tries to accept the offer, that `acceptance' is probably only at best an offer
itself, which you, if you are the original offeror, are now the offeree, can accept or reject as
they wish. Where the offer is made to the world at large, acceptance is by those members
of the public who perform the conditions set out in the offer.

Can cross-offers give rise to a contract?

The fact that the offers are identical is irrelevant. Contract law demands an acceptance,
and with cross-offers there is no acceptance. Going back to your offer to sell your car for
K10,000 (above), if the potential buyer, in ignorance of your offer, makes you an identical
offer of K10,000 for your car at the same time, then you have a cross-offer. There is not a
contract, because the promise or offer being made on one side in ignorance of the offer on
the other side cannot be construed as an acceptance of the other.

Does acceptance have to be absolute and unconditional?

A conditional assent is not an acceptance.For example, if a document contains a clause
to the effect that it is `subject to a formal contractto be drawn up by our solicitors', a contract
does not come into existence until a formal document has been drawn up and accepted by
the parties. The first document is merely a proposal to enter into a contract, a tentative
agreement that may be disregarded by either party. Whether the parties have reached final
agreement on the terms of their bargain is a question of fact in each case, and the basic
test is alwayswhether a reasonable person would regard themselves as being bound
by what they said and did.
139 | AGREEMENT: OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE

                  Reflection questions

     Time for a break. While you are taking a break think about the following questions on
     the topic of acceptance. Take some notes as you read through them.

         1. Does acceptance have to be made strictly in accordance with the terms of the
             offer?

         2. Can anyone accept an offer even if it is made to them?
         3. Can silence ever amount to acceptance?

Can you create a contract by post?

Today, a great many business negotiations, and even shopping, are handled via the
internet. In the case of business contracts, PDF files are often exchanged via emails by
the negotiating parties, who use software programs to amend them. Negotiations are often
handled by means of video-streaming services. Final versions of documents are agreed via
emails and are often signed by way of an electronic signature.
In the case of online shopping, the buyer sends an offer by clicking on an icon or a
button, which indicates agreement by acceptance of the terms and conditions (a `Clickwrap
Agreement'). Part III of the Electronic Transactions Act 2021sets out the rules on contracting
by electronic communication.
The use of the post office as the primary medium for the exchange of promises is rapidly
being replaced by technology such as electronic communication in the form of emails and
text messages. It is foreseeable that the traditional role of the post office, as a delivery
vehicle for letters, may become redundant in the not-too-distant future and that it will evolve
into a parcel delivery service to meet the delivery needs of online businesses as it is doing
in Australia. However, as that time has not quite come, it is still important for businesses to
understand the rules relating to contracts by post.

Using the post office

Where the parties contemplate the use of the post as a medium of exchange of promises,
                                                                                                AGREEMENT: OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE | 140

the offeror must have contemplated and intendedthat the offer be accepted by the act of
posting, in which case the rules as to the time of acceptance change. Thus:

   an offer made by letter is not effective until it is received by the offeree; and
   acceptance is effective as soon as it is posted.

If the letter is properly addressed, prepaid (it has a stamp) and put in a post box, a contract
is formed at the place when and where the letter of acceptance is posted. The post office
is your agent,and this means that communication to the post office is communication to
you.

The courts have decided that you have indicated a willingness to accept the risks of the
letter being lost, delayed or destroyed by using the post as your agent. You had the
opportunity to specify, in your offer, any other form of communication to reduce these risks
and you chose not to. By posting the acceptance, the offeree has done all that is
required of them.

If revocationof the offeris to be effective, it mustbe received by the offeree before they post
their letter of acceptance. How the offeree receives notification of the revocation of the offer
is irrelevant as long as it is clear that you, as the offeror, has withdrawn the offer before
acceptance has taken place.

What commonly occurs in business is that an offer is usually expressed in such a way as
to exclude the operation of the postal rule by requiring actual communication of the
acceptance - for example, by the offeror including a term in the offer stating `acceptance
shall only be effective on receipt at this office'.

                     Business tip

       In cases of contracts by post, there are three points to note:

             Read the letter of offer carefully. Does it exclude the operation of the postal rule?
                (Most contracts of insurance exclude the postal rule, so acceptance occurs on
                receipt, and even then, usually only on clearance of payment of the premium.)

             Revocation of an offer does not have to be by mail just because the offer was
                sent by mail. A reply by some other means that was just as fast or faster would
141 | AGREEMENT: OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE

                be sufficient. What is important is that the offeree receives notice of the
                revocation before they can accept.
             Check with the post office how long delivery will take if acceptance is an
                important condition of agreement and the postal rules are to apply for
                acceptance. Priority letters take one to four business days from posting,
                depending on place of lodgement and destination locations, while regular
                letters can take four to six days.
       If the delay is the fault of the offeree - for example, if the offeree has misaddressed the
       letter or failed to post it - then acceptance would occur on receipt (if the letter arrived
       at all).
       Once the offeree has accepted the offer, the normal rules of contract law apply, and
       the agreement is binding on the parties unless they agree to release each other.

How does electronic offer and acceptance work?

Email, the internet and contract formation

The use of electronic means to complete business transactions, rather than the traditional
method of doing business face to face and exchanging paper-based documents, is
becoming commonplace. Global e-commerce sales now account for sales worth billions of
dollars.
Broadly defined, e-commerce is business conducted by means of computer, the internet
and other telecommunications links such as electronic data exchange (EDI). The Electronic
Transactions Act 2021provides a legal framework to support and encourage businesses
and consumers to use e-commerce by providing that the law must treat electronic and
paper-based commerce equally.

                   Online reference
                                                                                                AGREEMENT: OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE | 142

     The Electronic Transactions Act 2021 can be found online on the National Parliament of
     Papua New Guinea government website.

The main features of the electronic transaction's legislation include the following:

   A transaction is not invalid because it took place wholly or partly electronically (s 9)
   A requirement to give information in writing can be satisfied if the person gives the

      information by means of an electronic communication (s 10)
   A requirement to produce a document in hard copy can be satisfied by producing the

      document in electronic form (ss 11, 12)
   A requirement to record information in writing, to retain a document in hard copy or to

      retain information that was the subject of an electronic communication can be satisfied
      by recording or retaining the information in electronic form (s 13)
   In relation to the time and place of dispatch and receipt of electronic communications
      ((s 15) provides that dispatch and receipt are at the originators and addressee's
      places of business), unless the parties agree otherwise, the following rules apply:

          the time of dispatch of the electronic communication occurs when the
            communication leaves an information system under the control of the originator
            or, if it has not left the information system under the control of the originator, the
            time when it is received by the addressee (s 16(1) (2)); and

          the time of receipt of the electronic communication is the time when the electronic
            communication is capable of being retrieved by the addressee or, if no system is
            designated, when the electronic communication comes to the attention of the
            addressee (s 16(3)).

What is the formation of an electronic contract?

The formation of an e-contractis no different from the formation of a conventional
contract.The uniform electronic transactions legislation attempts to clarify the rules on:

   the use of automated message systems for contract formation (s 6);
   the location of the parties (s 7); and
   updating the electronic signature provisions and default rules for:

          time of dispatch (s 16(1))
          time of receipt (ss 16(3), 17); and
          place of dispatch and place of receipt (s 16(6)).
143 | AGREEMENT: OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE

If you access an online supplier, you will usually be considered to be an offeror who
intends to buy a product or service and is generally assumed to be intending to contract.
The agreement generally arises between the parties when you make the offer by clicking
on the `Buy', `I agree' or `I accept' button or icon. The offer is sent when you click on the
`Send' button. Acceptance occurs when the supplier communicates an acceptance, and this
is received by you. To ensure unambiguous consent, most sellers will require you to change
the default setting from `I do not agree' to `I accept' or `I agree'.

Having established that agreement and intention to contract are present (the latter can be
implied because of the way the transaction is entered into), the final requirement for the
creation of a simple contract - consideration - can be done electronically.

It is then necessary, as it is with a conventional contract, to determine whether the simple
contract that has been created electronically is enforceable. This means consideration of
three more factors: do the parties have legal capacity to enter into a contract, is there real
agreement between the parties (called `consent') and is the e-contract legal? Form is not an
issue here.

A problem with e-contracts is legal capacity. You, as the buyer, are a minor and
the goods or services are for necessaries (goods and services that are necessary to a
minor, such as food and accommodation), then the contract will be binding. Whether it is
enforceable will depend on what country the seller lives in whether it is worth his/her time in
suing you. In other cases, involving the issue of capacity, such as buying `R' rated products
or services, the situation is more problematic.

Just as an aside, if each of the requirements is satisfied, a valid e-contract is created
between the parties, but what have the parties agreed to? This is an issue about contractual
terms (see chapter 11 `Construction of the Contract'). Often, clicking the `Buy', `I agree' or
`I accept' button will result in the terms set out in the website being incorporated into the
contract. But this raises two further issues:

   What terms have been implied in the e-contract? This can be a real problem where
      the contract is for software, where there is an annual renewal charge and the seller
      imposes a term that states that the contract will renew automatically unless the buyer
      expressly notifies the seller they are not renewing.

   Was notice of the terms given before or after the contract was formed? For example, if
      the e-contract contains an exclusion clause, notice of such a clause after the contract
      has been formed is ineffective in common law jurisdictions. Notice must be brought to
      the attention of the buyer before the contract is made.

                     Business tip
       Doing business by email or on the internet
       To minimise problems with contract formation where the method of transaction is
       email or the internet, the person controlling the transaction should make it clear what
       is to be taken as an offer or what is required for an acceptance, and when electronic
       communications are to take effect.

If the parties do not intend to be bound until the final agreement, this should be clearly
stated in your emails by including a statement along the following lines in each email: `No
binding agreement is intended to be formed unless and until a formal contract has been
executed'.
It is also useful, if the parties are in different jurisdictions, to include choices of jurisdiction
and law clauses. In the event that a dispute should arise between you and the other party,
by stating which jurisdiction and laws should deal with the matter if a dispute arises. It may
be much cheaper and more beneficial to have the matter dealt with in PNG under PNG law.

                  Reflection questions

     Your last break. While you are taking a break think about the following questions on
     the topic of acceptance. Take some notes as you read through the questions and you
     can add them to your revision notes.

         1. Could an offer sent by email be accepted by letter if the offeror had not specified a
             particular method of acceptance? Give reasons.

         2. Explain why the rules on acceptance should differ between contracts by post and
             contracts by instantaneous communication such as email.

         3. How can businesses that make offers over the internet protect themselves from the
145 | AGREEMENT: OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE

             risk of loss associated with the rules of offer and acceptance?
     PROBELM:

     FACTS: La Forrest (the appellant who lived in Queensland) had brought an action against a
     number of parties for injuries she suffered in December 2022 when staying at a Casino
     Hotel in PNG. Correspondence ensued between the various parties about settlement, with
     email a common form of communication between the parties in the later stages of this
     matter. On 24th December 2023, La Forrest sent an email at 5.42 pm, referring to an offer
     of settlement made on 22 December 2023, to solicitors of two of the defendants, advising
     them that she was prepared to accept their offer. At 6.08 pm on the same day (22
     December), the solicitors confirmed acceptance of the offer and indicated that they would
     prepare discharge papers on 5th January 2024. On the 6th January 2024 the defendants
     forwarded the discharge papers to La Forrest, who then found the terms unacceptable
     and declined to sign them.

     ISSUE: Did La Forrest accept the offer? Was acceptance by email capable of creating
     contractual relations?

     YOUR DECISION: What do you think would be the outcome? Why?

     HINT: The times are important.

       Key points

An understanding of the following points will help you to better revise material in this section
on agreement.

   Why is it important to establish whether the parties have reached an
      agreement?The agreement goes to the heart of a contract because, unless the
      parties are in agreement, there isn't a contract. Agreement represents the culmination
      of a negotiating process between the parties.

   What is an agreement in a traditional sense?Agreement arises when there has
      been an `offer' by one party and an `acceptance' by another.

   What other techniques may a court resort to in order to determine whether there
      is an agreement? The techniques that a court may resort to include assessing the
      conduct of the parties and a global approach looking at all of the correspondence
                                                                                            AGREEMENT: OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE | 146

   between the parties, their acts and conduct, to see whether there was agreement on
   all important terms.
 What are the rules relating to offer?The rules relating to offer include: distinguishing
   an offer from an invitation to treat (preliminary communications between parties at the
   negotiation stage are not considered offers.

       communicating the offer by writing, orally or by conduct, and bringing it to the
         notice of the person to whom it is directed (doing something without knowing of
         the offer is not acceptance)

       determining to whom the offer is made: an individual, a group of people or the
         world at large (Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co)

       determining whether the offer has an option attached to keep it open for a
         specified period and whether that option is supported by consideration; and

       ascertaining whether all the terms of the offer have been brought to the notice of
         the offeree and followed exactly.

 What is the difference between an offer and an invitation to treat?An offer is
   characterised by an intention or willingness to be bound. An invitation to treat is only
   an expression of a willingness to start the offer and acceptance process, which in time
   may produce an offer and acceptance. Unlike an offer, if you are making an invitation
   to treat it means you do not intend at that point in time to be bound. You are inviting
   someone to make you an offer.

 What are the ways in which an offer may be terminated?An offer that has not
   been kept open by an option supported by consideration may be ended by revocation
   or withdrawal.
       rejection or counter-offer
       lapse of time
       lapse by death of either party; or
       lapse by failure of a condition.

 What are the rules relating to acceptance?If there is to be agreement, the following
   rules relating to acceptance must be considered:
       must be made in reliance on the offer--that is, the offeree must intend to accept
         the offer
       must be strictly in accordance with the terms of the offer
       must be communicated to the offeror orally, in writing or by conduct, otherwise
         the offeror will not know whether or not they are bound - silence on the part of
         the offeree is not enough, unless agreed to by the parties
       can be accepted only by the party to whom the offer was made or their authorised
         agent (Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co)
       cannot be a cross-offer, as each party is ignorant of the promise of the other and
         acceptance presupposes that there is an offer by one party and an acceptance by
         the other
147 | AGREEMENT: OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE

          must be absolute and unqualified, or it may amount to either a counter-offer or a
            tentative agreement; and

          once made, cannot be revoked without assent of the offeror.
   How does the postal rule operate?Where the parties contemplate the use of the

      post to create a contract, the offer is effective only on receipt by the offeree, with
      acceptance occurring on posting by the offeree unless the offeror includes a term in
      the offer to the effect that `acceptance is only effective on receipt of notification of
      acceptance'. For revocation of the offer to be effective, the offeree must receive notice
      before they post their letter of acceptance.
   What rules apply to communication via the internet? Where the communication of
      acceptance is via the internet, the Electronic Transactions Act2021 applies in place of
      the postal rules.

INTENTION TO CREATE LEGAL
RELATIONS

       Learning objectives

On completion of this Chapter, you should be able to:

   Explain the need for legal intentions in contracts.
   Explain what intention to create legal relations means.
   Explain how the courts determine intention to create legal relations.
   Distinguish between non-commercial and commercial agreements.

       Key terms

Here are some terms you will encounter in this chapter, which will help you to better
understand this chapter:
domestic agreements - agreements made between family members and relatives where
there is no intention to create legal relations.

          Objective test: would the words or conduct of the parties lead a reasonable
            person to believe, on the balance of probabilities, that legal relations were
            intended.

          Presumption: a belief (as the word is used here it is a reference to what the
            courts assume).

          Social agreements: agreements made between friends or acquaintances.
          Voluntary agreements: agreements where the parties volunteer their services,

            usually for no money.
149 | INTENTION TO CREATE LEGAL RELATIONS

        Introduction

Chapter 6 introduces you to the second element that must be present in a simple contract
- that is, the question of intention between the parties to create legal relations.

The fact that you have reached an agreement with another party does not necessarily mean
that a contract has been created. It is this element of intention that distinguishes a legally
binding contract from other types of arrangements. Without intention, you can still have
an agreement but it is an agreement that is not enforceable in a court because it is not a
contract. The parties will have to rely on moral or social pressure for enforcement.

In this chapter we begin by looking at intention generally (express and implied) and then the
two main types of agreement: non-commercial, and commercial or business agreements.
In the case of a non-commercial agreement there is a presumption (or a belief) that the
parties do notintend to create legal relations while in the case of a commercial or business
agreement there is a presumption that legal relations are intended.

Step 2 - Intention to create legal relations

In Step 1 you were concerned with the issue of agreement. Was there an offer? Did the
other party accept? Once you are satisfied that an agreement has been reached, you need
to think about whether the agreement you entered into was legally enforceable. The fact you
and the other party have reached an agreementdoes not necessarily mean that a contract
has been formed.

For an agreement to be legally enforceable as a contract, you both must intend to create
legal relations. This can beexpress(words, writing or conduct) or implied; butif it is not
present, there can be no contract.

The question of intention is closely linked to the question of agreement which, together with
consideration (see Chapter 7), will determine whether the parties have entered into a simple
contract. But notethat even at this stage we don't know whether our contract that we created
is valid. That can only be determined after considering the elements of capacity, consent,
legality and form (these are dealt with Chapter 8, Chapter 9 and Chapter 10).

Is it difficult to determine intention?

The difficulty with determining intention is trying to work out what the parties really intended.
                                                                                            INTENTION TO CREATE LEGAL RELATIONS | 150

As you will discover, the parties to a contract rarely make express reference to the question
of intention.

It is only when a problem arises between the parties and one party wants to enforce their
`rights' that intention suddenly becomes an issue. Suddenly, the party that feels aggrieved
- usually because there is money at stake - will want to know what their rights are - that is,
whether there is an enforceable agreement or not.

In trying to find an answer to the question of intention, the courts (in the case of Australia,
up until the Australian High Court decision in Ermogenousv Greek Orthodox Community of
SA Inc [2002] HCA 8 (`Ermogenous') classified agreements into two categories:

   Agreements of a business or commercial nature. Here the courts had adopted an
      approach involving a rebuttable presumption (a legal principle that presumes
      something to be true until evidence is produced by the party who wishes to disprove it
      proves otherwise) that unless the contrary can be clearly established, it was
      presumed that the parties did intend to create an enforceable contract.

   Agreements of a social or domestic nature. Here there was a rebuttable
      presumption that the parties did not intend legal relations. For example, if you agree to
      meet a friend at the movies and they don't turn up, you might be upset but you don't
      usually intend to sue them for breaching their promise to you.

Where problems arise is where the consequences for the aggrieved party are much more
serious (for example, in a PNG Lottery win where a ticket holder claims they bought the
winning ticket with their money and the ticket bought by the group did not win anything),
because now the court has to try to determine what the parties intended when making their
arrangement. Did the parties intend their agreement to have legal consequences should
things go wrong? This can be quite hard to determine because the parties in these types of
arrangements rarely make express reference to the requirement of intention.

How do you determine intention?

Intention can be determined by considering the relevant context and the relationship
between the parties and determining what inferences can be drawn from that. Look at what
the parties have said, written or done as well as taking into `account the subject matter of the
agreement, the status of the parties, their relationship to one another and other surrounding
circumstances.
151 | INTENTION TO CREATE LEGAL RELATIONS

                  In brief

     Intention and contracts
     For an agreement to be legally enforceable as a contract, one of the conditions that must
     be satisfied is that the parties intended to create legal relations. Intention can be either
     expressed in words, writing or conduct orimplied,and requires an objective assessment of
     the state of affairs between them; if intention is not present, there can be no contract.
     Proving intention can be a difficult legal process.

What form can intention take?

What is express intention?

The parties rarely make any direct or express reference to the question of intention to
contract within the contract itself. Where references are made, they are generally found only
in commercial(or business) agreementsand they are invariably expressed in a negative way
- that is, by way of termsthat expressly and clearly state that the parties don'tintend to be
legally bound - for example, by including wording in the agreement such as:

   `binding inhonour only' (these are also known as `honour clauses'). In the English
      case of Rose & Frank Company v JR Crompton & Bros Ltd[1925] AC 445, a
      commercial arrangement contained the following clause which made it clear that the
      parties did notintend to create legal relations and that the agreement was not meant to
      be legally binding:

               This arrangement is not entered into, nor is this memorandum written, as a
               formal or legal agreement, and shall not be subject to legal jurisdiction in the
               law courts . . . but it is only a definite expression and record of the purpose
               and intention of the parties concerned to which they each honourably pledge
               themselves.

   An `honour clause' was effective in the English case of Jones v Vernon's Pools
                                                                                             INTENTION TO CREATE LEGAL RELATIONS | 152

      Ltd[1938] 2 All ER 626 (a case involving a lost lottery ticket) preventing any legal
      action being taken against Vernon's Pools:

               It is a basic condition of the sending-in and acceptance of this coupon that it is
               intended and agreed that the conduct of pools . . . shall not be attended by or
               give rise to any legal relationships, rights, duties or consequences whatsoever
               or be legally enforceable or the subject of litigation, but all such arrangements,
               agreements and transactions are binding in honour only.

or

   `This agreement is subject tocontract' or subject tothe preparation of a formal
      contract of sale which shall be acceptable to my solicitor'. In both examples there may
      be an agreement but until a formal contract is made, the parties are not bound. The
      key word is `subject' and it tells a court that there is still more to be done, as in, a
      formal contract has to be made.

Parties to a contract may be content to be bound immediately and exclusively by the terms
on which they had agreed. However, they may also decide to add some additional or further
terms at a later date. A legally binding contract can still exist even though there is an
intention to expand on it to substitute other terms if and when the need arises.

Can the parties exclude the jurisdiction of the courts?

The parties to an agreement can expressly declare that they don't intend to create legal
relations. What they cannot do is make a binding contract and expressly exclude the
jurisdiction of the courts as this is contrary to public policy - for example, by using wording
such as:

               In respect of any matter arising out of this agreement or any breach thereof the
               parties hereby acknowledge that the jurisdiction of the court is to be excluded.

                     Business tip
       Word your contracts carefully. The use of words such as `subject to contract' suggests
       to a court that the parties don't intend to be bound immediately. However, it is still
153 | INTENTION TO CREATE LEGAL RELATIONS

       important to look at the agreement as a whole when trying to determine whether the
       parties intended a binding agreement or not.

If either of the parties don't intend to create any legal obligations, then correspondence
between the parties should clearly state that legal relations are not intended.

Take care to avoid using terms that might be construed as an indication of a binding
agreement - such as `binding commitment'. Use expressions such as `subject to contract'.

What is implied intention?

As noted above, the parties rarely say anything about the issue of intention. It is usually
only when a dispute arises that the court tries to determine what the parties intended from
their words and/or actions. The central legal question is: Was the agreement intended to be
legally enforceable? Unfortunately, this is rarely obvious from the agreement itself.

The question to consider when trying to determine intention is what inferences would a
reasonable person have drawn from the words or conduct of the parties, having regard to all
the circumstances? If a reasonable person assumes that there is no intention by the parties
to be bound, then there is no contract.

To assist in trying to determine what it was that the parties intended, the law has treated
agreements as falling into one of two categories:

   social, family/domestic or voluntary agreements (non-commercial arrangements); or
   commercial or business agreements.

Traditionally, the determination of intention was then resolved by reference to rebuttable
presumptions of fact. In the case of social, family/domestic or voluntary agreements, the
law assumed, or presumedthat the parties didn't intendtheir agreement to have any legal
consequences if it was not performed as the agreement is unenforceable. In the case of
commercial/business agreements, it was assumed, or presumed, that the parties did intend
to create legal relations.

Figure 2: Chart explaining the presumption between parties. Image description.

Source: Gibson A (2024).
In both classes of agreement, in determining intention reliance was placed on applying a
presumption. The presumption would not apply if one of the parties could produce sufficient
factual evidence to satisfy a court, using an objective testinvolving a hypothetical person,
that the agreement was intended (or not intended, depending on the class of agreement) to
be binding. That is, what inferences would a reasonable person have drawn from:

   what the agreement says
   what the parties have said
   what the conduct of the parties was
   what were the consequences for the parties; and
   the surrounding circumstances.

If the reasonable person after considering these factors assumed there was no intention by
the parties to be bound, then there would be no contract.

How has the Australian High Court approached the use of
presumptions?

It is not clear whether the PNG National and Supreme Courts will follow the decision of the
Australian High Court in a case called Ermogenous v Greek Orthodox Community of SA
Inc[2002] HCA 8. In this case the High Court suggested that the use of presumptions was
merely a useful tool to identify who should bear the onus of proof and that in every case the
party asserting the existence of a legally binding agreement bears that onus of proof.
The question in every case was whether an objective assessment of the state of affairs
between the parties, in the context in which they were dealing, could be said to show an
intention to create legal relations. What would reasonable persons in the position of the
parties have understood to have been intended?
155 | INTENTION TO CREATE LEGAL RELATIONS

Where there is payment of money as consideration for a promise by the other to provide
some service or bestow some benefit, the conclusion that can be drawn is that each
intended the promise to be taken seriously.

In Ermogenous the question of whether the parties could objectively be seen to intend to
create legal relations could include:

   the subject matter or topic of the agreement
   the status of the parties
   their relationship to one another
   whether there is a consensus among the contracting parties
   the extent to which it is expressed to be finally definitive of their concurrence
   the way the agreement came into existence
   subsequent conduct or communications between the parties; and
   any other surrounding circumstances.

In a large number of cases the results will be the same as if the agreement had fallen into
the presumption categories: commercial/business or social, family/domestic, and voluntary
or Ermogenous.

Commercial or business agreements

Commercial or business agreements make up the majority of litigated disputes and there
is a strong inference in such cases that the parties intended to create legal contractual
relations. This is particularly true where the parties are both corporate entities. The
relationship between the parties then is going to be a relevant matterin determining whether
they had an intention to enter into legal relations.

While there is initially a strong inference that legal relations are intended in commercial or
business dealings, if the parties want to show that they didn't intend to create legal relations
they need to show, using clear wording such as `...subject to preparation of a formal
contract...'or `binding in honour only...', that they didn't intend to create legal relations
notwithstanding the commercial nature of the agreement.

What is the intention of the parties using a `letter of comfort'?

In order to secure a loan, a bank or lending institution will try to seek a guarantee from a
parent company and, if possible, from the subsidiary company to which the loan is made.
This is the only way the lender can be certain that assets of the group will be available to
meet the obligations of the borrower should there be a default on the loan. Where the loan
                                                                                            INTENTION TO CREATE LEGAL RELATIONS | 156

is supported by a contract of guarantee, there is no problem with intention. The liability of
the guarantor arises on default of the subsidiary.

But it often happens that a parent company will refuse to give a guarantee - for example,
because it does not want a contingent liability to show up on its balance sheet, or it might
just not want to be a guarantor. In such a case, a compromise is a letter of comfort.

A letter of comfort may take the form of an undertaking to maintain its financial commitment
in the subsidiary, or it may be one where the parent company agrees to use its influence
to ensure the subsidiary meets its obligations, or it may be nothing more than an
acknowledgment by the parent company that a subsidiary has entered into a contract.

In this type of commercial transaction, it is always going to be assumed that the parties
intended legal relations, unless it can be rebutted by a clear statement to the contrary.
However, whether a statement is seen as promissory or a statement of intention is a matter
of construction and taking into account the parties' acts and conduct, including statements
they made and documents they signed or dealt with, whether there is a clear indication of
what they intended.

Do government `contracts' always result in contractual relations?

While governments and government departments enter into contracts on a daily basis,
there are some types of government dealings that simply don't result in the creation of
contractual relations. These usually involve some aspect of the government's political or
administrative activities, and here the courts are more reluctant to infer an intention to create
legal relations.

Where government schemes or handouts are concerned, the better view is that there is no
intention to create legal relations.

What is the presumption in business advertisements?

Where advertisements are concerned, it is presumed that they are notintended to create
legal relations. As usual, each case should be looked at on its facts to see whether intention
is present. A good example where the courts found that the advertisements did create legal
relations was Carlilll v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company in Chapter 5. The 1,000 deposited
at the bank clearly evidenced an intention to pay anyone who performed the conditions of
the offer and who claimed the money.

Expressions such as `one per customer' or `rain check' by an advertiser in a newspaper
advertisement or brochure are intended to make clear to the world at large that if the
157 | INTENTION TO CREATE LEGAL RELATIONS

advertiser runs out of a product it will get more in at the advertised price for the customer.
In other words, there is an intention on the part of the advertiser to be bound by the wording
in the advertisement. This is where there is an offer, rather than there being an invitation to
treat.

                     Business tip
       Ensure that advertisements accurately reflect the intention of the advertiser
       In the case of advertisements, it is presumed that there is no intention to create legal
       relations. However, advertisers should make it clear in their advertising if restrictions
       are to apply use wording such as `subject to . . . availability'. Similarly, the use of
       expressions such as `one per customer' or `rain check', makes it clear to the world at
       large that the advertiser intends the customer to get the product at the advertised
       price if it runs out.

                   Reflection questions

     Time for a break. While you are taking a break think about the following questions on
     intention and again, make notes.
     A. Must intention to create legal relations be present in every contract?
     B. How can you tell whether an advertisement is an offer or an invitation to treat? Explain.
     C. Why do you think that in most agreements of a commercial nature the law assumes
     that the parties intend to create legal relations?
     D. Is it possible to avoid creating legal relations in a commercial/business agreement?
     Explain.
                                                                                            INTENTION TO CREATE LEGAL RELATIONS | 158

Do non-commercial agreements lack serious intention?

At common law it was possible to identify three types of agreements as generally lacking
serious intention on the part of the parties to create legal obligations:

   Social agreements made between friends or acquaintances - for example, in relation
      to competitions and lotteries.

   Family or domestic agreements made between family members and relatives, not just
      spouses, but note that also brings into play customary law; and

   Voluntary agreements, where the parties may volunteer their services without any
      consideration.

In these types of agreements, the parties don'tintend to create legal relations, even though
the `agreements' contained promises made by the parties, preferring instead to rely on
family or friendship ties of mutual trust and affection. The test is objective, based on the
reasonable person with the onus on the plaintiff to produce sufficient evidence to convince
a court, on the balance of probabilities, that a contract was intended.

In Australia, after Ermogenous, determining the question of intention is by way of
consideration of the relevant context and the relationship between the parties, and
determining what inferences can be drawn from that.However, whichever approach the
court chooses to use is probably going to be the same under either approach.

Are legal relations intended between social and domestic partners?

Traditionally, agreements made in a family context had been considered unenforceable.
Thus, for example, in the case of a domestic agreement made while the husband and wife
were still living together or in a continuing de facto relationship, it had been presumed that
the parties don't intend to create legal relations in relation to any promises they may make
to each other. If they are separated at the time the agreement was reached, it is much more
likely the parties intended to create legal relations.

Parties to domestic agreements are not restricted to situations involving couples in a
relationship. They can extend to other family members, including brothers and sisters, aunts
and uncles, nephews and nieces, and in-laws. In each case the onus is on the plaintiff to
produce evidence to show that a contract was intended, and the court will look at the words
and conduct of the parties to try to determine their intention. In that context, the court will be
more inclined to find that intention exists if the consequences of the promise are serious for
one of the parties and they have changed their position in reliance on the promise that has
been made to them.
159 | INTENTION TO CREATE LEGAL RELATIONS

If there is ample evidence that would indicate to a reasonable person that the parties did
intend legal relations, notwithstanding that the relationship between the parties was one that
could be categorised as social or domestic, then the courts seem more than prepared to
find that a binding and enforceable contract exists.
In PNG s 9(f) of the Constitution, customary law is recognised as an underlying part of the
legal system, and power to deal with family matters such as divorce and financial claims
can be dealt with through village courts applying customary law rather than the common
law.

Are legal relations intended in voluntary agreements?

Participation in charitable or other voluntary organisations, where a person provides their
services for free, is another situation in which the parties don't normally intend to create
legal relations.

While there is an agreement, it is usually clear from the surrounding circumstances that a
contract was not intended at the time of entering into the agreement. This may not appear
to be a problem at first glance, but if the person is volunteering their services for nominal or
no payment and are injured, they have no right to workers' compensation coverage under
the Workers Compensation Act 1978 because it is assumed that no contract of employment
was intended.

                   Reflection questions

     Time for the final break for this chapter. While you are taking a break think about the
     following questions on intention and again, make notes.

     A. Why aren't voluntary agreements contracts? Explain.

     B. Can you list any agreements that you could enter into daily that could result in an
     inference that contractual relations were not intended?

     C. Why do you think that in most agreements of a voluntary nature the law assumes that
     the parties do not intend to create legal relations?
                                                                                            INTENTION TO CREATE LEGAL RELATIONS | 160

     D. Is it possible to create legally binding agreement out of a social or family relationship?
     Explain why.

     E. In the agreements that you enter into, do you consider the question of intention? Explain
     why.

       Key points

An understanding of the following points will help you to better revise material in this section
on Intention.

   Why is legal intention needed in contracts? The issue of intention assists the court
      in determining whether or not the parties have reached an agreement that they intend
      to be legally enforceable.

   What is the effect of a lack of an intention to an agreement? Agreements without
      intention are agreements that are not enforceable in a court of law.

   Can the parties exclude the jurisdiction of the courts? The parties can expressly
      state that they do not intend to create legal relations, but they cannot make a binding
      contract and expressly exclude the jurisdiction of the courts.

   What is the difference between express and implied intention? Express intention
      is where the parties make direct or express reference to the question of intention in
      the contract by way of a term. Generally, express intention is found only in commercial
      or business agreements.
          Implied intention, on the other hand, arises where the intention of the parties is
            not expressly stated. Here, the court has to try to determine from their words and/
            or actions whether the parties intended legal relations.

   What is the difference between non-commercial agreements and commercial
      agreements? In non-commercial agreements - that is, family or social arrangements,
      or voluntary agreements - the type of agreement is usually lacking serious intention
      on the part of the parties to create legal obligations. The onus is on the plaintiff to
      establish that the parties did intend legal consequences from their agreement.
          In a commercial (or business) agreement the court assumes that, unless the
            contrary can be shown, the parties usually intend to create legal relations. Thus,
            the onus is on the plaintiff to show that legal relations were not intended.

   What is the Ermogenous approach to the use of presumptions? The question to
161 | INTENTION TO CREATE LEGAL RELATIONS

      consider is whether, on an objective assessment, reasonable persons in the position
      of the parties would have understood what was intended.
   What is a letter of comfort? A letter of comfort is a document of assurance issued by
      a parent company to reassure a subsidiary company of its willingness to provide
      financial support or use its influence to ensure that the subsidiary meets its
      obligations, or to acknowledge that a subsidiary company has entered into a contract.
   What is a voluntary agreement? A voluntary agreement is an agreement where the
      parties normally don't intend to create legal relations.

CONSIDERATION

       Learning objectives

On completion of this Chapter, you should be able to:

   Define consideration.
   Identify when consideration must be present.
   Explain the rules for consideration.
   Explain the distinction between past, present and future consideration.
   Explain what is promissory estoppel.

       Key terms

You will notice these key terms, which are listed throughout the chapter to help you
understand and remember the material:

          Consideration: the `price' paid to buy the other person's promise; it must be in
            every simple contract.

          Formal contract or deed: a contract that has been signed, sealed and delivered,
            and does not require consideration to be valid.

          Gratuitous promise: a promise undertaken voluntarily and lacking consideration,
            so is not enforceable in court.

          Joint promises: where two or more persons jointly agree to provide
            consideration jointly and both can be sued, that is, A and B promise to pay C
            K100.

          Joint and several liability: where two or more persons agree together, as well
            as having made separate agreements to repay the loan individually. You then
            have one joint and several separate obligations, which can mean performance by
            one person can discharge all the others of their obligations or they can be sued
            separately. For example, A and B jointly promise to pay K100 to C and
163 | CONSIDERATION

            separately you promise to pay K100 to C and B also separately promises to pay
            C K100.
          Promisee: the person who is receiving, or the recipient of, the promise
          Promisor: the person giving the promise
          Several liability: where two or more persons agree to provide consideration but
            each promises separately, that is, A promises to pay K50 to C and B promises to
            pay K50 to C.
          Simple contract: a contract that is made orally or in writing (or both) involving an
            agreement between parties with the intention of creating legally enforceable
            obligations and which requires consideration to be valid.
          Variation clause: often a clause within a contract (but can be oral) where both
            parties agree to change part of a contract from the way they originally agreed to
            while the remainder of the contract remains unchanged.

        Introduction

In this chapter we begin by considering what is consideration and then look at the rules for
consideration and we finish by looking the principle of promissory estoppel (an equitable
remedy that provides an exception to the rule that in a simple contract there must be
consideration).

In the last two chapters we looked at agreement or the offer and acceptance components
of agreement (Chapter 5) and intention to create legal relations (Chapter 6). In this chapter
we look at the third element needed for the creation of a simple contract: consideration.

Consideration is the last element that we need to consider for the creation of a simple
contract. Remember that we need three elements to be present: agreement, intention and
consideration. Also remember that at this stage, we are not considering whether what we
created is a valid contract or not. We are just focusing on the creation of the contract. We
deal with the question of validity in Chapters 8(capacity), 9 (consent) and 10 (legality and
form).

Step 3: Consideration

The final step in determining whether a simple contract exists or not is whether there is
consideration. Remember that in a simple contract, no consideration (or the `price' you are
paying for the other party's promise) means no contract. Note `price' does not have to be
money.
                                                                                                                                 CONSIDERATION | 164

You will sometimes find consideration referred to `executed' or `executory' consideration.
The former refers to the performance of an act rather than a promise of performance.
Executory consideration, which is found in most contracts, consists of a promise to do
something - for example, to buy and sell something.

Does consideration have to be present in a deed?

In the case of formal contractssuch asdeeds, there is no need for consideration
becausethe contract is valid because of its form - that is, the way it is made. In the
case of all other contracts, called `simple' contracts, valuable consideration is requiredif the
`agreement' is to become a contract.

Does consideration have to be present in a simple contract?

The answer is `Yes'. Simple contracts must contain a bargain - only bargain promises
or promises that are given because they are paid for, are enforceable.

The aim in defining consideration is to enable a distinction to be drawn between promises
which are gratuitous - that is, which are freely given (such as gifts where nothing is given
in return) - and those which are onerous, or `paid for' by the incurring of some obligation
(such as buying a video game for money, where you get the game and the seller gets the
money).

What is `Consideration'?                                             Video reference

Consideration is the price you pay to buy the other       This interesting online video
person's promiseor, as Lord Dunedin said in the           will help you understand what
English case of Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v            consideration is. There are
Selfridge & Co Ltd[1915] AC 847:                          references to several English
                                                          cases that you should take
               `An act or forbearance of one party, or
               the promise thereof, is the price for
               which the promise of the other is bought,
               and the promise thus given for value is
               enforceable'.

While this is oftenmoney, don't assume that this
always must be the case. It may involve a
`detriment' by the promisee. (The promisoris the
person undertakingthe promise, while the
165 | CONSIDERATION                   promiseeis the person who is receiving - or the
                                      recipient of - the promise.)
     note of as they are relevant to
     PNG law.                         Consideration is an integral part of the bargainthat
                                      forms the basis of most contracts and it maybe:

                                               money or involve a benefit given or detriment
                                                 suffered as the price for the promise

 something the promisee gives to the promisor
 the carrying out of some act, or
 not doing something that the promisee had a legal right to do.

Once this condition is met, a bargain will exist.

The question of the presence of consideration rarely causes a problem at the formation
stage of a commercial relationship because one party has agreed to sell goods or services
to another. As a matter of fact, there will be mutual consideration present because the
goods or services are being exchanged for money.

Where problems may arise in commercial arrangements is if the parties subsequently wish
to change the arrangement. This can be done by the parties making a new contract (this will
need new consideration to support it) or by a contract variation. clause. Variations refer to
any changes made to the original terms and conditions of a contract but don't fundamentally
change the contract. They are often changes that are unforeseen at the time the initial
contract is entered into, such asmodifications in project scope, budget constraints, higher
demand then expected for goods or services, or supply problems. Some contracts will have
a variation clause written into them and they don't have to be complicated, for example,
`no variation of this Agreement shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed by both
parties or their authorised representatives.' In this case, an oral variation would not be
legally effective.

Variations can be initiated by either party orally, in writing or by conduct, and they usually
must be agreed upon by both parties in order to be legally binding (you can have a unilateral
variation if the parties agreed to that in the underlying contract). To be valid there must
be agreement between the parties, consideration, compliance with the terms of the original
contract, and be in accordance with the requirements of the original contract.

                     Business tip
       Should I have a variation clause in my contract?
       You can have an oral variation but be careful if it involves a large contract variation
       because problems can arise about the terms of the variation and there can be
       unforeseen consequences that were not anticipated by either party as well as
       documentation issues. To avoid these problems, would it be better to make a new
       contract? It is a good reason why you should include a termination clause in the
       contract to reduce the chance of being sued for breach.

General rules for consideration

                   In brief

     Rules for consideration
     Consideration must be present in every simple contract. Consideration:

           should be present or future, but not past
           can be anything stipulated by the promisor (even a chocolate wrapper - see the UK

             case of Chappell & Co Ltd v Nestles Co Ltd [1960] AC 87)
           must move from the promisee. In the case of joint promisees, it is sufficient

             consideration if it moves from one of the parties.
           must have some value, although the court is not concerned with its adequacy
           must be something more than the promise of an existing obligation (see the UK

             case of Stilk v Myrick [1809] 2 Camp 317)
           must be more than part payment of a debt (see the UK case of Foakes v Beer (1884)

             9 App Cas 605)
167 | CONSIDERATION

           must be possible of performance
           must be definite
           must be legal but may take any form and need not be of comparable value to the

             promise, and
           must be referable to the other party's promise.

What is present (or executed) consideration?

Consideration is an essential element in every simple contract and can be present or
futurebut cannot be past (this occurs where the promise is made after the act).

Present consideration is wherean act is done in return for a promise. For example, in a
`reward' situation where you lose your wallet or purse and offer a reward and someone finds
the lost item and returns it for the reward, liability--that is, the payment of the reward--is
outstanding on your part only. This would also be an example of a unilateral contract.

What is future (or executory) consideration?

In the case of future consideration, the parties exchange promises, each promise being
consideration for the other. In this type of situation, consideration is intended to be
performed in the future. For example, a sale of goods by you with payment on delivery
would be an example of a bilateral contract. Here performance of the agreement remains in
the future, yet a contract has been made.

What is past consideration?

In the case of past consideration, the promise is given after an act has been performed.
This is generally not enforceable. For example, you purchased a horse from Amanda for
K5,000 and, afterthe sale was completed, you asked her about the temperament of the
horse. Amanda promised you that the horse was in good condition and not vicious, which
was not true.

To be enforceable, the act (or request in this case) must be donein reliance on the promise.
In Amanda's case above, as the contract was completed before your request, Amanda's
promise is not enforceable (see the English case of Roscola Thomas [1842] 3 QB 234).

The rule that past consideration is not valid consideration frequently means that a promise,
apparently made seriously, generally cannot be enforced by the promisee if it relates to past
acts. Of course, if the promise also relates to the future, then that part of the promise will
                                                                                                                                 CONSIDERATION | 168

be enforceable. For example, if you were promised higher wages, not only for the future but
also for a past period when you were being paid at an agreed lower rate. Your employer
later refused to honour their promise and, while they didn't have to pay you for the work
already done (as that was past consideration), the promise of future wages was enforceable
because you could provide consideration (as in, your labour).

Where the performance of a service and the subsequent promise to make payment for that
service become part of the one transaction, this can be viewed as good consideration. For
example, if you seek help from a friend and they incur K1,200 expenses in helping you
and you then promise to pay them for their trouble but subsequently go back on your word,
can you be sued on your promise? Were your friend's services originally performed at your
request?

As a general rule in the type of situation above, the court will find that a contract existed. The
request for your friend's services by you and the performance of those services, coupled
with a subsequent promise to pay, were all part of the same transaction. When you made
the request, there was an implied promiseto pay something to at least cover your friend's
expenses and this would suggest to the court that that you intended to create a legal
relationship. The subsequent promise of the amount quantified what would be paid. This
is sensible, as business is often conducted in what could be best described as an informal
way.

Is a gratuitous promise enforceable?

If you promise to give a friend K100, your friend               Business tip
cannot enforce the contract as there is no act or
promise in return. This is known as a gratuitous   Remember that, as a general

                                                   consideration.
While considerationmust move from the promisee,
it need not move to the promisor(although in most
contracts consideration will move between the two
parties to the contract).

The person who wants to enforce a promise (the promisee) must pay for the promise or
there is no contract to sue on. However, there is no need to pay for it in person; for example,
payment could be through an agent appointed expressly for the purpose of making the
payment or whatever other form of payment the parties agreed to.
169 | CONSIDERATION

Where a promise is made to two or more people jointly (joint promisees), and only one of
those persons provides consideration, the party who has not provided the consideration
can still enforce the promise because consideration is only necessary from one of the joint
promisees, not from each of them.

Does consideration have to have some economic value or just be
adequate?

While consideration must be valuable, it is left to the parties to decide at the time of making
the agreement what is adequate. Consideration does not need to be at commercial rates,
but it must have some legal or economic value even if it is a `peppercorn' or `token' value.

In Chappell & Co Ltd v Nestl Co Ltd [1960] AC 87, an English case, Nestl offered a music
record for one shilling and sixpence plus three wrappers from its sixpenny bars of chocolate.
The court had to consider whether used chocolate wrappers, which had no value, should
be included as part of the consideration required for the purchase of the record for the
purpose of determining what royalty Nestl should have to pay Chappell & Co (the copyright
owners). The court considered that the wrappers formed part of the consideration because
without them a person could not obtain the music record. The case illustrates the court's
reluctance to become involved in the question of the adequacy of value. As long as there
is something of value, the court will be satisfied.

The question of adequacy does not concern the courts except in cases of duress. This
would involve them in the task of examining every contract and trying to determine whether
the price was reasonable--an impossible task. The parties may have a very good reason
for establishing a particular contract price. For instance, one party may owe the other a
favour, or they may be hoping to get further business as Chappel v Nestle above illustrates
through a marketing promotion.

Must consideration be sufficient?

Sufficiency and adequacy are not the same thing. The issue of what is `sufficient', or of a
value recognised by the law as amounting to good consideration, is not always clear-cut,
particularly where the plaintiff is already under an existing legal duty to the defendant. But
as long as some legal value the courts can recognise, they will not be concerned about its
adequacy.

Can compliance with an existing duty imposed by the law be good
consideration?

The general rule is that a person cannot recover money that they have been promised in
return for performance of, or a promise to perform, a duty imposed by law because there
                                                                                                                                 CONSIDERATION | 170

would be no legal detriment. For example, a promise of payment to attend court when you
have been subpoenaed would be a promise without consideration as you have a legal duty
to attend.

An exception to this rule is where performance is beyond that which a person is legally
required to do, then that would amount to good consideration.

Can repeating an existing duty owed to the promisor be good
consideration?

Repeating an existing duty owed to the promisor is insufficient consideration because there
is no detriment. If you are already contractually bound to the promisor to complete a task,
the general rule is that in performing that task you are doing no more than you contractually
agreed to do. However, acts in excess of your duty would amount to good consideration to
support a new contract.

What happens if you promise to pay a lesser amount in discharge of a
debt?

For example, if you owe a friend K1000, the correct way of discharging the debt is to pay
the entire K1000 to your friend on the due date. However, if you come up to friend on the
date and offer to pay only K750, and they accept the amount your friend can later claim the
remaining K250. The implied promise is unsupported by consideration.

Can you avoid the difficulty of part-payment of a debt?

The debtor can avoid the difficulty of part-payment of a debt if they can show that the
creditor requested payment of a lesser sum:

   at an earlier date than originally promised
   at a different place (for example, Melbourne instead of Sydney)
   in a different currency (for example, gold rather than legal tender) -payment by cash is

      not sufficiently different from that which the debtor was already obliged to do to
      amount to good consideration
   where they performed some other act that they were not bound by the contract to
      perform
   by the signing of a deed of release
   by part-payment by a third party, or
   in reliance on the defence of promissory estoppel.
171 | CONSIDERATION

In each of these situations, if a creditor accepts payment of a lesser sum in full and final
settlement of their debt, they will be bound by their promise not to sue for the balance.

Can part-payment by a third-party amount to good consideration?

Where there is part-payment by a third party, the creditor (the second party) cannot claim
the balance from the debtor (the first party). For example, if you (the debtor) owe your friend
K1000 and a third party offers to pay your friend K500 in full settlement of your debt, your
friend cannot claim the balance from you.

If your friend subsequently brings an action against you for the balance of the debt, they
would fail as this would be viewed as a fraud on the third party because they had been led
to believe that their part-payment of the debt would extinguish the debt.

Can forbearance to sue amount to good consideration?

Forbearance to sue can amount to good consideration.A promise not to enforce a valid
claim and/or a promise to give up a claim entirely can be good consideration for a promise
given in return. It is good consideration even if the promise is to forbear only for a limited
period or to dispense with a doubtful, but reasonable, legal claim. The claim that is
promised to be relinquished must be:

   honestly held (there must be a genuine dispute); and
   one in which the claimant has a bona fide belief that the liability is real at the time of

      agreement.

It does not matter that the plaintiff may not actually have had an enforceable claim.

Are moral promises good consideration?

Moral obligations, as well as natural love and affection, will not convert a promise into
good consideration. Promises are only binding if they are part of a process of exchange.
A moral obligation, or natural love and affection, is not enough. Hence the requirement of
an additional factor that the courts could place a value on, however artificial that value may
be.

Does consideration have to be possible of performance?

If the promise of one of the parties is a physical impossibility - for example, to walk from
Port Moresby to Rabaul in a day - no real consideration would be present.
                                                      CONSIDERATION | 172

Does consideration have to be real and identifiable?

The consideration must be real and identifiable, and capable of expression in economic
terms. If it is indefinite in nature or too vague to be of any value, then it will not amount to
real consideration. For example, if you owed your father money and he promised you that
he would waive the debt if you stopped complaining, the court would hold that the promise
was too vague to be of any value and was therefore unenforceable.

Does consideration have to be legal?

Where the consideration is illegal, or a breach of public policy or the civil law, there will be
no consideration.

Does consideration have to be referable to the other party's promise?

If consideration is not referable to the other party's promise, the courts will not be prepared
to enforce it.

              Reflection questions

You are nearly at the end of `consideration'. Again, while you are taking a break think about
the following questions on consideration.

   1. Should consideration still be an essential element in a contract today?
       What does it achieve?

    2. Explain the distinction between executed, executory and past consideration.
   3. Why don't formal contracts, such as deeds, require consideration?
   4. Why is past consideration no consideration?
   5. Why is repeating an existing duty not good consideration?

Consider the following fact situation
FACTS:Schubert purchased a new car from Hercules Motors, and after a short time found
the paintwork faulty. Hercules Motors acknowledged that something would have to be
done, and it was agreed that Hercules Motors would repaint the car and restore it to `as
new' condition. It was also agreed that the work would be supervised by a paint company
173 | CONSIDERATION

     representative, who would determine if the work was satisfactory. His report was
     unfavourable.

    ISSUE: Was the promise to restore the car to `as new' condition to avoid being
    sued by Schubert capable of amounting to good consideration?

     DECISION: Well, what do you think?

     HINT: Do you think that the defendant's belief as to the validity of the claim in these types
     of cases is irrelevant? Does it matter that the plaintiff's claim is in fact bad in law?

Promissory estoppel

           Video reference      Promissory estoppel is an equitable remedy in

this video on promissory        and it operates when it would be inequitable for the

background on gratuitous        doctrine developed from the judgment of Denning
promises before looking at      LJ in Central LondonProperty Trust v High Trees
promissory estoppel (just note  House Ltd [1947] 1 KB 130. It operated where it
that this video is 27 minutes   would be inequitable, or unconscionable, for the
long).                          promisor not to be held to their promise where they
                                have made some representation about the future in
                                relation to their conduct. The defendant had to be
                                able to show that they relied on the plaintiff's
                                promise and changed their positions accordingly, so
                                that they would now suffer serious loss if the plaintiff
                                was allowed to return to their original contractual
                                position. But did you note that it was a defence for a
                                defendant?

In Australia, the High Court in Walton Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher [1988] HCA 7 decided
that held that promissory estoppel could also be used to commence an action.

When is promissory estoppel important?

The rule that there must be consideration present in every simple contract if it is to be
valid has sometimes allowed a person to break an agreement and leave the injured party
with no remedy. The principle of promissory estoppel may provide relief to an innocent
                                                                                                                                  CONSIDERATION | 174

party by preventing a party from going back on their word where they have made some
representation about the future in relation to their conduct. It is essentially an estoppel about
future conduct.
The aim of the innocent party is to avoid the detriment generated by the person who has
gone back on their promise or denied the truth of a representation. In this case, the only way
to achieve an equitable outcome was to enforce the assumed contract, despite the absence
of a concluded agreement.

                   In brief

    A promissory estoppel:

           operates as both a defence or shield for a promisee.
           can apply even in the absence of pre-contractual obligations.
           does away with the requirement that consideration is required in simple contracts

             and that it must move from the party suing to the party being sued.

                     Business tip
       Avoiding the operation of the doctrine of promissory estoppel.
       Application of the doctrine is really limited to only a suspension of the promisor's
       rights, not a termination of them. The promisor can withdraw the promise if reasonable
       notice is given to that effect to the promisee, and it is possible for a return to the
       position that the promisee occupied before the suspension of the promisor's rights.
175 | CONSIDERATION

       Key points

An understanding of the following points will help you to better revise material in this
Chapter relating to consideration.

   What is meant by `consideration'? Consideration is the price you pay to buy the
      other person's promise. It is what the promisor gives in exchange for the return
      promise.

   When does consideration have to be present in a contract? Consideration must
      be present in every simple contract. It must not be past and must move from the
      promisor.

   What are the rules for consideration? Consideration must be present in every
      simple contract. It must:
          be present or future, but not past
          be anything stipulated by the promisor
          move from the promisee. In the case of joint promisees, it is sufficient
            consideration if it moves from one of the parties.
          have some value, although the court is not concerned with its adequacy
          be something more than the promise of an existing obligation
          be more than part payment of a debt
          be possible of performance
          be definite
          be legal but may take any form and need not be of comparable value to the
            promise, and
          be referable to the other party's promise.

   What is the distinction between past, present and future consideration?
          Present (executed) consideration involves an act being done in return for a
            promise.
          Future (executory) consideration involves the parties' exchanging promises,
            each promise being consideration for the other. In this type of situation,
            consideration is intended to be performed in the future.
          Past consideration involves the giving of a promise after an act has been
            performed and is generally not enforceable. The act must be done in reliance on
            the promise.

   What does variation of a contract mean? If a party, or both parties, wish to change
      their contract this can be done by the parties making a new contract (this will need
      new consideration to support it) or by a contract variation. clause. Variations refer to
      any changes made to the original terms and conditions of a contract but don't
                                                                                                                             CONSIDERATION | 176

   fundamentally change the contract and are changes that are unforeseen at the time
   the initial contract is entered into. They can be oral changes but are better to be in
   writing to limit or avoid potential problems arising.
 What is `promissory estoppel'?Promissory estoppel will allow a promise to be
   enforced even though the promisee has not provided consideration for that promise. It
   operates where it would be inequitable, or unconscionable, for the promisor not to be
   held to their promise. It may be used as a defence or to initiate a cause of action if the
   promisee's position has been altered in reliance of the promise.

CAPACITY OF THE PARTIES

       Learning objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

   Explain the common law rules regarding contracts entered into by minors (infants).
   Outline the common law rules regarding capacity to contract corporations, the

      mentally ill and those under the influence of alcohol.

       Key Terms

You will notice these key terms, which are mentioned throughout the chapter, to help you to
better understand and remember the material:

          Beneficial contracts of service: contracts that are for the minor's benefit and
            are not oppressive, including employment, education, apprenticeship and training
            contracts.

          Corporation: a legal entity (also known as a legal person) created by the
            Corporations Act 2001 (Cth); also known as a `company'.

          Infant: a person under the age of 18 years; also known as a `minor'.
          Necessaries: goods or services that are reasonably necessary to the `station in

            life' of an infant and their actual requirements (defined in the Goods Act 1951, s
            4).
          Void: of no legal effect.
          Voidable: an agreement that may be affirmed or rejected at the option of one of
            the parties.
                                                                                                                   CAPACITY OF THE PARTIES | 178

        Introduction

In this, and the next two chapters on consent and legality, we look whether the contract that
you created is valid, voidable, void or unenforceable. In other words, is the contract you
created (or working with, valid?) This chapter will also introduce you to the rules regarding
the capacity of the parties to a contract and whether they fully understand the terms and
conditions of the contract. Under both common law and statute law there are certain types
of people who are considered to be incapable, either partly or completely, of understanding
the rules and obligations associated with them entering into a contract. However, this is not
the end of the story. You still need to know whether there is real consent to the contract
by one or both of the parties (Chapter 9) and whether the purpose of the contract is legal
(Chapter 10) before you can say with any confidence that the contract is valid. And even
though we might have a valid contract, don't assume that is the end of contract law because
problems can still arise as to exactly what have the parties agreed to (Chapter 11) and what
happens if one of the parties doesn't comply the terms of the contract, in other words, they
breach the contract (Chapter 12).

Step 4: Capacity to contract

Do the parties to the contract have full contractual capacity?

Only a normal, sane, sober adult person (s 17 of the Companies Act 1997 gives a company
the same legal capacity as an `individual' until it is deregistered) has full capacity to make a
contract. Only adult persons, as in, those persons over the age of 18 have the capacity or
ability to understand what it is they are entering into.
Under common law (and in some cases statute law such as s 3 of the Goods Act 1951but
notthe Infants Act 1956 as that deals only with guardianship and custody of infants), some
classes of people, such as infants, those with mental incapacity, and intoxicated
persons,are treated as not having that ability to understand fully what it is they are entering
into. Necessaries aside, this can affect the validity of any contracts that may involve them
because, if you think about it, even though there may be an agreement, is that agreement
a fair bargain if the individual doesn't understand what it is that they are getting into?

Having capacity is more than just having the ability to sign the contract. You need to
consider a number of factors concerning the party you are dealing with including:

   Do they understand all the facts?
   Do they understand what their rights and obligations are?
179 | CAPACITY OF THE PARTIES

   Are they able to weigh up those rights and obligations in coming to a decision?
   Do they understand the consequences of the choices they make?

So who are infants (or minors) in PNG?

The Constitution and Organic Law provides for full contractual capacity from the age of 18
years. This does not mean that an infant, as in, someone under the age of 18 cannot enter
into contracts. They can and the law will offer protection to them from exploitation.
For example, in the case of an infant getting a job, there is an employment contract between
the infant and the employer (see,for example, the Employment Act 1978 which prohibits the
employment of children under 11) which provides that children between 11 and 16 can be
employed as long as the employment doesn't interfere with school attendance, they have
parental permission and the infant gets paid for their services.

                  Online reference

       If you are interested in the employment of young persons and what the Employment
       Act 1978 says about terms of employment (s 103), working under injurious conditions (s
       104) or hours of employment (s 105) see sections 103 - 105 of the Employment Act 1978.

Classification of contracts for infants

Insofar as an infantis concerned, whether the contract is valid, voidableor voidwill depend
on what the contract is about.

What is a valid contract for an infant?

The general rule at common law is that a contract made by an infant is voidable except in
two instances (where it is valid and binding on both parties):

   contracts for necessaries
   beneficial contracts of service.
                                     CAPACITY OF THE PARTIES | 180

What are contracts for necessaries?

Thedefinition of necessaries includes articles and services essential for the
reasonable comfort of the infant, as well as basic food, medicine, education, clothing
and shelter. Goods supplied to the married infant's family, and goods supplied in
contemplation of marriage, are also regarded as necessariesat common law. This means
that lifestyle and the infant's situation must be considered when trying to determine whether
the goods or services are capable of being necessaries or not and the transaction may be
caught under s 4 of the Fairness of Transactions Act 1993 if the contract is unfair.

Section 4 of the Good Act 1951 defines necessaries as goods suitable to the condition in
life of a person (including an infant) and to their actual requirements at the time of sale and
delivery. In other words, the lifestyle and situation of the person or infant will determine what
are necessaries.

To successfully sue an infant, a business (the plaintiff) mustbe able to establish two
factors.

 Are the unpaid goods or services capable of being necessaries? The court has to first
   be satisfied that, in the circumstances, the goods or services are capable of being a
   necessary, and this is a question of law. The onus is on the plaintiff to prove that they
   are, and, if they fail, the case is dismissed. If the goods or services are capable of
   being considered to be a necessary for the infant, then the plaintiff needs to go on and
   establish the second point.

 Are the goods or services necessaries at the time of sale and delivery?This is a
   question of fact. Look at the actual requirements of the infant and decide whether
   the infant was adequately supplied with these goods or services at the time of sale or
   delivery. It may be necessary here to consider the social standing of the infant, their
   occupation, social conditions, whether they were already adequately supplied and
   other similar factors.

There seems to be no reason why services cannot also amount to necessaries if it can
be established that the contract is beneficial to, or a necessary service for, the infant - for
example, paying for tuition that the infant could subsequently use to obtain employment.

Even if a trader establishes that a contract with an infant is for the supply of goods or
services that amount to necessaries, the contract can still be void if it contains harsh or
onerous terms under s 4 of the Fairness of Transactions Act 1993. The contract must, on
balance, be fair. Note the words `on balance' because they suggest that the law recognises
that a contract can contain unreasonable terms without being invalid. There has to be a
181 | CAPACITY OF THE PARTIES

balance. If it is, the infant will be bound to pay but only a reasonable price for the goods
under s 4(3) of the Goods Act 1951.

                     Business tip

       Should I sell goods or provide services to an infant on credit?

       There is considerable risk for a trader to sell goods or services to an infant on credit. If
       the infant is already well supplied with those articles or services, then the supplier
       would not only be unable to enforce payment, but in the case of goods they may not
       be able to recover them (unless the goods were obtained by fraud). If the supplier
       hopes to be able to enforce the contract, they must ensure that:

             the goods or services are capable of being, and are, necessaries
             the contract does not contain any harsh or onerous terms; and
             the price is reasonable.

What is a beneficial contracts of service?

Beneficial contracts of serviceare the second exception to the non-enforceability rule of
a contract entered into by an infant at common law and there is limited protection under
legislation (for example, ss. 79-80 of the Child Welfare Act 1961, the Lukautim Pikinini
(Child) Act 2015, and ss 103-105 of the Employment Act 1978).
Beneficial contracts of employment are contracts of employment, apprenticeship, training
or education and can contain unfavourable terms but this does not necessarily mean the
contract will automatically be declared void. In these types of cases, the court will:

   examine the contract as a whole
   weigh the onerous (harsh) terms against the beneficial terms, and
   decide, looking at the contract as a whole, whether the balance is in favour of the

      infant.
                                                                                                                   CAPACITY OF THE PARTIES | 182

                  Reflection question

     Let's test your understanding of what is a fair contract of employment for an infant.
     FACTS: The defendant, while still an infant, had entered into an article clerkship with the
     plaintiff to become a solicitor. One of the terms in the agreement was that the defendant
     would not practise as a solicitor within 200 kilometres of Port Morseby, where the plaintiff
     had his practice. A year after the defendant had finished his articles, he commenced
     practice in Lae and the plaintiff sought an injunction to stop him.
     ISSUE: Do you think the clause was so onerous that it outweighed the beneficial terms
     and that therefore the contract was not valid?
     DECISION: So, what do you think?
     COMMENT: Look at the question from both points of view, as in, the infant and the
     employer. Also think about whether something like s 4 of the Fairness of Transaction Act
     1993 could apply here.

Where the contract is for employment, instruction or education of the infant, it will generally
be treated as binding by the courts as long as it is possible to identify that it provides, on
balance, benefits to the infant.
While benefit is the basis for the validity of this type of contract, this does not mean that
any contract that the infant enters into and obtains benefits from will be automatically
enforced against the infant. Thus, a trading contract such as a loan agreement with a
finance company may result in financial benefit to the infant but it may not be binding.

What types of contract are valid unless voided by an infant?

The class of contracts involved is limited to those through which the infant acquires an
interest in some subject matter of a permanent and continuous nature. For example,
purchase of shares in a company and partnerships. The contractual obligation then remains
until the infant decides to put an end to it.
183 | CAPACITY OF THE PARTIES

When an infant repudiates (rejects or ends) a voidable contract during infancy or within
areasonable timeafter becoming an adult (and what constitutes a `reasonable time'
depends on the circumstances in each case), under the common law the rights and
liabilities that accrue after repudiation cease. The infant will remain liable for any
obligations accrued up to the time of repudiation of the contract unless there has
been a total failure of consideration.

Money already paid by an infant under a voidable contract is irrecoverable unless the infant
has received no benefit from the contract whatsoever - that is, there has been a total failure
of consideration. However, no matter what the subject may be, the courts are reluctant to
find that the infant has received no benefit.

Does a corporation have thecapacity to contract?

Contracts can be made by both `natural persons' and `legal persons'. The latter are a
creation of the law but are treated by the law as having the complete legal capacity of a
natural person - for example, corporations.

In corporation under the Companies Act 1997 s 16 gives a company a separate legal
existencefrom that of its members. It should be viewed as an `independent person' with
its own rights and liabilities. As such, its contractual capacity is limited only by natural
impossibility when it comes to entering into personal contracts because it is an artificial
creation.

The fact that an act is not in the best interests of a company does not affect the capacity of
the company to do the act (s 18(3)). Under s 155, a company may be bound by contracts
(including deeds) entered into by its agents acting on behalf of the company with express
or implied authority.

Do bankrupts have the capacity tocontract?

Bankruptcy is a legal process that can occur when an individual cannot pay their debts as
and when they fall due. The process is governed by the Insolvency Act 1951.

A person can become bankrupt voluntarily while owing any amount - a debtor's petition.
However, creditors cannot make a person bankrupt unless the debt they are owed is K100
to one creditor, K140 to two creditors or three or more creditors K200 or more (s 25(2))(a
creditor's petition).

As a general rule, bankruptscan still contract, but their contractual capacity is
limitedduring the period of bankruptcy (which will normally last for three years: ss 131(c),
                                                                                                                   CAPACITY OF THE PARTIES | 184

Do mentally unsound and intoxicated persons have thecapacity
to contract?

Contracts with the mentally unsound or the intoxicated are usually regarded as being
voidableat the option of that person unless they are for necessaries. The Goods Act 1951,
s 4(3) requires that mentally unsound and intoxicated persons who purchase goods that are
necessaries must pay a reasonable price for them.
The Goods Act 1951 is silent where the goods are not necessaries. Under the common law
the person suffering the disability maybe able to repudiate the contract when they are again
of sound mind or sober, if at the time of contracting:

   they were suffering from such a degree of mental instability or were so inebriated that
      they were incapable of understanding the nature of the contract; and

   this was known, or ought to have been known, by the other party.

The onus of prooflies on the person wishing to repudiate the contract and must occur
within a reasonable time of regaining sobriety or soundness of mind. But it should also be
noted that it is not easy to have a contract set aside unless the lack of capacity was known
or was readilyobservable at the time of contracting.

     Well done. You have reached the end of another chapter. Here are some more reflection
     questions to test your understanding of what you have read. Don't forget to make notes of
     your answers as it will help you with your revision at the end of the Unit.

             for the shares. Can she recover the money? Explain why?

       Key points

An understanding of the following points will help you to better revise material on capacity.

   What are the common law rules regarding contracts entered into by infants, and
      when are such contracts valid, voidable or void?Contracts entered into by infants
      at common law are regarded as either:
          valid (if it can be established that they are for necessaries or beneficial contracts
            of service and that the price is reasonable)
          voidable (binding unless repudiated by the infant and involving the acquisition of
            an interest in property of a permanent nature or a continuing obligation), or
          void (they do bind the other party and cover purchases of non-necessaries and
            trading contracts, but are not binding unless ratified by the minor after attaining
            majority).

   What are the common law rules with regard to capacity to contract with respect
      to the following?
          Corporations.A company is an artificially created legal person, but has the
            capacity of a natural person. The contractual capacity of a corporation is
            exercised through individuals who have the company's express or implied
            authority and are acting on behalf of the company.
          The mentally ill and those under the influence of alcohol.If a person who was
            mentally ill or intoxicated at the time of contracting can establish that they did not
            understand what they were doing and that the other person was aware of their

       Introduction

In the last chapter we looked at the capacity of you and the other party to see whether you
understood both the rules and obligations associated with entering into a contract. In this
chapter we are going to look at exactly what it is that you would have consented to when
entering into a contract.
The basis of a contract is agreement or consensus ad idem(a meeting of the minds). In
this chapter we are looking at what happens if you or the other party has:

   made a mistake
   made a misrepresentation
   used duress (force)
   undue influence, or
   displayed unconscionable conduct,

then there is there is no genuine consent. Thus, the fifth question (or Step 5) we have to
consider is: Is there genuine consent between the parties? What have you and the other
party agreed to?

Step 5: Is there genuine consent?

If you are satisfied that there is no problem with the ability of you and the other party to fully
189 | GENUINE CONSENT

understand what you are entering into (as in, the question of capacity), then you can move
on and consider whether there is genuine consent between you and the other party.

what have the parties consented to?

If the contract has been entered into because of a mistake by you or the other party,
or because one of you may have a superior bargaining position and has made a
misrepresentation or used duress (force), undue influence or unconscionable conduct to get
an `agreement', then there is no genuine consent and therefore no valid contract.

The question you must ask yourself when considering the question of consent is: Was the
consent between us genuine? Is this what we have agreed to?

What is mistake?

So, let us begin with mistake. If you or the other party says that they have misunderstood
the situation, or they have made a mistake, has an agreement been reached or not? As a
general rule, if the partiesappearto have reached an agreement, the law assumes that they
have in fact reached agreement.

The law is reluctant to accept a mistake as grounds for voiding a contract as it would
provide an easy way out for a dissatisfied party to get out of an agreement and it would also
seriously undermine the certainty and reliability essential to commercial transactions. So,
what is the effect on the contracting parties if there is a mistake?

What is the effect of mistake on the contracting parties?

Where a mistake does operate, and the mistake is serious, one outcome is to make the
whole transaction null and void from the very beginning (they call that void ab initio). This
would put you and the other party in the same position as if no contract had ever been
made. However, if the mistake is trivial or does not go to the main purpose of the contract,
it may still be enforceable.

What is effect of mistake on third parties?

While you and the other party may not be concerned about being restored to your original
positions, innocent third parties may not feel the same way. Suppose you sell your car to
John who pays you by cheque, which is subsequently dishonoured. You want your car back,
but John has already sold it to Liz, a third party. You track down Liz and the question you
have to consider is whether you can recover your car from Liz or the money from John.
If the original contract between you and John is now                          GENUINE CONSENT | 190

ownership of the car and therefore cannot pass                         Business tip

kind of injustice that the courts place such stringent
limitations on the operation of mistake. The
question for the courts is, who is going to be the
loser because there has to be one. It is going to be
either you or Liz.

What is mistake of fact?

Two principles are clear:

   Only mistakes of factcan render a contract void. If one of the parties makes a
      mistake of law (for example, wrongly interpreting a statute), a mistake of judgement
      (for example, buying clothes and then not liking the style or colour) or a mistake as to
      quality, then that party generally cannot rely on the mistake to avoid the contract.
      However, money paid under a mistake of law may be recoverable.

   There are very few mistakes of fact that provide grounds on which courts can
      invalidate a contract.

                                                       agreement

What is the difference between common mistake, mutual
mistake, unilateral mistake and non est factum?

In the event of common mistake, there is a genuine agreementbetween the parties as they
are both agreed on the same matters. The offer and acceptance have corresponded, and
the parties are of one mind. However, owing to a common error as to some fundamental
fact, the agreement may have no legal effect. In the case of mutual mistake, unilateral
mistakeand non est factum, there is no genuine agreement, as there is no real
correspondence of offer and acceptance.

What is common mistake?

In the case of a common mistake, the parties acknowledge the existence of an agreement
(for that is admitted) but, because of a fundamental assumption as to the existence or
identity of the subject matter, they wish the court to set the agreement aside from the
beginning. In other words, the parties are asking the court to treat the agreement as having
no legal effect and for any money or property that the parties have paid or conveyed to each
other in reliance on that agreement to be recovered.

The courts have generally been reluctant to void contracts in which the common mistake
involves accidental qualities or attributes of the subject matter. For example, you purchase a
                                                                                                                             GENUINE CONSENT | 192

painting that you and the seller believe has been painted by a famous painter. However, you
later discover when you go to sell the painting that it is counterfeit and virtually worthless.
Can you rescind the contract and get back your purchase price from the seller?
Because there was no error as to what you were given, what you have is a common
mistake. You and the seller were agreed on the same terms on the same subject matter,
and that is sufficient to make a contract.
Mistake as to the existence of subject matter. A common mistake must involve the existence
or identity of the contract's subject matter. If you and the other party were both mistaken,
the transaction will be void from the beginning because of the absence of the thing on which
the contract was based. In each case it is a matter of construction. A common mistake as
to the quality, nature or value of the contract is not enough to render the contract void from
the outset.

                   Reflection question

     Take a break for a couple of minutes and think about this real-life fact situation.
     FACTS:The Commission advertised for tenders for the purchase and salvage of an oil
     tanker:

             Tenders are invited for the purchase of an oil tanker lying on Jourmaund Reef, which is
             approximately 100 km North of PNG. The vessel is said to contain oil. Offers to
             purchase the vessel and its contents should be submitted to the PNG Disposals
             Commission and should be lodged not later than 2pm March 31, 2024.
     You decided to tender for it and were successful based on information provided by the
     Commission as to where to find the tanker.

    You hired a ship, fitted it out and proceeded to the location given by the
    Commission. After a month of searching, no luck. Not surprising because there
    was never any tanker lying at or near the location given by the Commission.

     ISSUE: Has the Commission made an implied promise of the existence of the tanker?
     Have you acted in reliance of that promise to your detriment? Is the Commission bound?

     DECISION: What do you think?
193 | GENUINE CONSENT

Where the contract is for the sale of specific goods which have perished at the time the
contract is made, the Goods Act 1951 provides that `where there is a contract for the sale
of specific goods, and the goods, without the knowledge of the seller, have perished at the
time when the contract was made, the contract is void' (Goods Act 1951, s 8(1)). Thus, if
you sell your car to a friend, and unknown to you the car caught fire and was burnt out an
hour before the sale, the contract would be void and there would be no liabilities incurred
on either side (Goods Act 1951, s 8(2)).

Mistake in equity maygive relief where the mistake involves the quality or attributes of the
subject matter. Here, the court may treat the contract as voidable, however, as the remedy
is being sought in equity, it is a discretionary remedy. It is also worth noting that neither you
nor the other party can rely on their own mistake to say that the contract was a nullity from
the outset.

What is mutual mistake?

In the case of mutual mistake, as the parties are talking about differentthings, there is no
real agreement between them. For example, you decide to buy your friend's car. However,
you think you are buying his 2023 Toyota Corolla, but he thinks you are buying his 2023
Toyota Camry. Here you and the other party are talking about the same manufacturer but
different models. Each of you is unaware of the error and are mutually mistaken as to the
other party's intention. In other words, the offer and acceptance do not correspond and so
the contract is void ab initio.

Where mutual mistake has been pleaded, the courts apply an objective testof the
reasonable person to the words or conduct of the parties to determine whether or not any
agreement has been reached or whether you and the other party are at cross-purposes.

                  Reflection questions

     Take a quick break and think about these two questions.

     1. Explain why money paid under a mistake of law may be recoverable while a party who
     makes a mistake wrongly interpreting a statute, or a mistake of judgment (for example,
                                                                                                                            GENUINE CONSENT | 194

     buying clothes and then not liking the style or colour) or a mistake as to quality, generally
     cannot rely on the mistake to avoid the contract.

     2. You were in London when you received an order from a Middle East agent for
     `Moroccan horsebeans described here as feveroles'. Not knowing what the term meant,
     you asked the defendants, who replied that feveroles were the same as horsebeans,
     which they were in a position to supply. The plaintiffs then ordered a quantity of
     horsebeans from the defendants and the goods so described in the written sale
     document that was drawn up were delivered to the plaintiffs, who in turn shipped them to
     Egypt. When they reached Egypt, the plaintiffs refused to accept them since they were
     not feveroles. Had the plaintiffs any cause of action against the defendants?

What is unilateral mistake?

Like mutual mistake, there is a lack of agreement between the parties. However, here only
one party to the contract knows, or ought to be reasonably aware, of the mistake and does
nothing to correct it.Such cases usually involve a mistake as to the identity of the parties to
the contract, and while the majority of cases concern fraud, it should not be assumed that
this is the only way unilateral mistake operates.

A mistake of this type can arise, for example, when A contracts with B, believing B to
be C. In the English case of Boulton v Jones (1857) 157 ER 232 (`Boulton v Jones'), it
was Jones' intention to contract with Brocklehurst and no one else, as Brocklehurst owed
him money. But unknown to Jones, Brocklehurst had sold his business to Boulton. When
Jones sent a written order for goods expressly addressed to Brocklehurst, Boulton struck
out Brocklehurst's name and substituted his own and then completed the order. He did
not tell Jones of the change of ownership. When he asked for payment, Jones refused
to pay, arguing he never intended to contract with Boulton because he had a set-off with
Brocklehurst on which he intended to rely. As Jones had no intention of contracting with
Boulton, and Boulton knew this but assumed it didn't matter, there was no contract.

In such a situation there is no correspondence between offer and acceptance, and the
agreement can be avoided. Because the courts will not generally declare a contract void
from the outset (or void ab initio) for unilateral mistake under the common law, the mistaken
party will generally seek an equitable remedy of either rescissionor rectification. In a case
like Boulton v Jones, the court in its equitable jurisdiction will generally require some
improper conduct before granting equitable relief. In Boulton's case, Boulton knew that
Jones had no intention of contracting with him but did nothing about it.
195 | GENUINE CONSENT

What happens where the parties meet face to face?

Where the parties meet face to face, it is assumed that a contract was concluded between
the parties because the offer was accepted by the person to whom it was directed. The
onus of rebutting the presumption lies on the party pleading the mistake of identity. They
have to show all three elements:

 they intended to deal with C and no one else--personal identity is vital
 they never intended to deal with B, and to this end they took reasonable precautions

   to check B's identity; and
 B knew that they never intended to deal with anyone but C.

The courts will allow an action for unilateral mistake to succeed and treat the contract as
void. However, if the intention is to deal with the offering party, whoever they might be, then
the contract can only be treated as voidable.

             Business tip        Where the distinction becomes important is when

beginning). This means that a third party cannot get good title to your goods and you can
recover them from whoever has possession. The third party then has to try and recover their
money from the swindler. Actual knowledge of the mistake is not necessary.It is enough if
the party who is not mistaken ought to have known, or strongly suspected, that you had
made a mistake of a fundamental character.

             Business tip

When buying or selling goods always check the identity of any party with whom you
are dealing. Do not rely on what they say, do not rely on who they say they are and do
not hand over any goods until you have taken all reasonable steps to identify the
person with whom you are dealing. If you are the seller, this means getting the `cash'
before handing over the goods. If you are the buyer, it means making sure that you get
title with the goods when you hand over the money. Check the Personal Property
Security Act 2011 in the Personal Property Security Registry to see if the goods are

What is non est factum?                                             Online reference

Sometimes a person will sign a document and later        The Personal Property Security
discover that what they signed is fundamentally          Act 2011 is a very important Act
different from what they thought it was. Where this      as it impacts on virtually all
occurs, the party who signs the document knowing         commercial transactions in
that it contains contractual terms will generally be     PNG, whether by corporations
bound by those terms, whether they have read them        or individuals. The Act applies
or not. If they want to avoid the contract, the signing  to almost all types of property
party would have to argue that the agreement was         other than land including
voidbecause it was radically different from what they
thought it was. This is the defence of non est
factum, which means it is `not my doing' or `not my
deed'.

To succeed in a plea of non est factum, two
conditions must be met:

                                       negligence in the execution of the document.

                                    They have to establish that they acted carefully. It

                                    follows that if a party signs a document leaving

blanks to be filled in by a third party, the plea of non est factum would be unavailable owing

to the carelessness of the signer.

Signing without reading the document does not prevent the defence of non estfactum from
being raised. However, the classes of persons that can raise the defence are limited to two
groups:

 those who are unable to read owing to blindness, illiteracy or a congenital intellectual
   impairment and who must rely on others for advice about what they are signing; and

 those who, through no fault of their own, are unable to understand the meaning of a
   particular document.

Even if the plea of non estfactum is unsuccessful, there is generally an element of fraudor
undue influenceinvolved which would make the contract voidable. As long as there are no
innocent third parties involved, the injured party will still be able to avoid the contract.

What is the effect of mistake on a contract?

The effect of mistake, with the exception of unilateral mistake as to a term of the contract,
will depend on the remedy that you, if you are the plaintiff, are seeking. Remedies include:

 at common law: declaring the contract void ab initio (from the beginning) if the
   mistake affects the very existence of the contract (which means neither party can
   enforce the contract), an action in rescission to recover any money paid (if the
   contract is yet to be performed), or the tort of conversion (if the agreement has been
   performed)

 in equity: rescission (cancellation), restitution (unjust enrichment unless there are
   third-party rights), rectification (if the terms of the contract have been incorrectly
   written down), or specific performance, and

 by statute: under the Fairness of Transactions Act 1993.

                   Reflection questions

     Take another quick break and think about these three questions.

             1. Buka has a very poor understanding of English. When you approached him with a
             document for his signature, Buka was under the honest and mistaken belief that
             what he was to sign was only a letter of introduction to his agent. What he in fact
             signed was a lease of his shop premises to you --which at no time did Buka intend
             or want to do. You are now suing for specific performance (to force him to give you
             his shop) and damages for breach of contract. Advise Buka.

            2. Explain why you would prefer to base a case on unilateral mistake rather
            than common mistake or mutual mistake, if there is a third party involved.

             3. You own the Gold Star jewellery shop in Port Moresby. A well-dressed customer
             comes in one Friday lunch time and asked to look at some jewellery as a present for
             his wife. He selects a number of items, which add up to K59,750, and offered to pay
             you by cheque. He explained he would have used his debit card but it was
             damaged in a recent flood, and he is now waiting for a replacement from the bank.
             He told you he is Mr Wayne Bruce MP, sitting member for the seat of Rabaul, and
             gives you an address. As he was signing the cheque, he offered as a sign of good
             faith, to take half now and collect the other half when the cheque was cleared. You
             check online and finding details of Bruce, you take the cheque. Later that afternoon,
             Bruce pawned the jewellery to Brooks, a pawnbroker, for cash. When the cheque
             was dishonoured, you tried to recover the jewellery from Brooks.

                 Is there a contract between you and Bruce? Explain why/why not.

                   Do you think you have done enough to check on the identity of Bruce?

What is misrepresentation?

The apparent consent of the parties can be affected if it is subsequently found that one
party has misrepresented the facts to the other. If you, as the plaintiff, can establish that the
other party has made a false or misleading statement of fact which has induced you to enter
into a contract, this is called a misrepresentation. The misrepresentation can be fraudulent,
199 | GENUINE CONSENT

innocent, or negligent and can be made orally, in writing, by silence or by conduct. The
remedies available to an injured party will depend on the type of misrepresentation.

                                What is a representation?

although there may, depending on the circumstances, be an action in tort for negligence or
deceit, or an action under theFairness of Transactions Act 1993 based on unfairness.
Representations forming part of the contract are known as termsand if they turn out to be
untrue (as in, they are misrepresentations) the innocent party may be able to rescind the
contract and/or be able to recover damages. More on that in Chapter 11.
It is not necessary for the representation to be made directly to you if you are the injured
party as long as it is made with the intention that it should be acted on by you -that is, it must
produce a misunderstanding and be one of the reasons for you to enter into the contract. If
you had knowledge of the untruth of a representation before the contract was entered into
or signed, it is not possible to assert that the statement has misled you and any right to relief
for you would be lost.

What is fraudulent misrepresentation?

Fraudulent misrepresentationis distinguished from innocent misrepresentation by the
intentional deceit of one party by the other. Fraudulent misrepresentation refers to a
deliberate false statement made with the intention of inducing someone to enter a contract.
The contract, as it is induced by fraud, is voidable at your optionif you are the deceived party
because it does not represent the parties' true agreement.

Where false information is provided with knowledge, or the persons preparing the
information were reckless as to its truth or falsity, or if there is a reasonable expectation that
if information exists it will be disclosed (a duty of disclosure), if you are the deceived party,
you will have a remedy in damages and rescission.

Just as a matter of interest, while both fraudulent misrepresentation and the tort of deceit
share similarities, the standard of proof differs with the tort of deceit requiring a higher
standard of proof and the remedies may differ. Under the tort of deceit, the injured party
                                                                                                                            GENUINE CONSENT | 202

may seek compensatory damages, but include punitive damages to punish the defendant.

How do you prove fraudulent misrepresentation?

To amount to a fraudulent misrepresentation, the following elements must allbe
established:

   There must be a deliberate false statement of fact, not opinion, unless the person
      making the statement did not hold that opinion. The statement may be written, oral or
      by conduct. While, as a general rule, there is not a positive obligation on a person to
      disclose facts, exceptions to this rule include:

   contracts of utmost good faith (insurance contracts)
   statements which are only partially true or distort the truth
   statements which are true at the time of making but change before the contract is

      entered into
   where silence, having regard to all the circumstances, is likely to mislead or deceive
   the representation must be untrue
   the person making the representation must know that it is false, or not believe in its

      truth, or be recklessly careless
   the representation must be made with the intention that the other party acts in reliance

      on it
   the statement must actually induce entry into the contract. That is, you must act on it,

      although it does not have to be the sole reason for inducing the contract and it is no
      defence that you were able to check the accuracy of the representation and did not do
      so; and
   you, as the innocent party, must have suffered some loss, although you also have an
      obligation to mitigate your loss.

Just remember, the fraud must be distinctly pleaded, clearly proved and a
misrepresentation of fact going to the root of the contract or your claim for loss will fail.
Fraud must be shown. Carelessness on its own is not enough. An interesting question
here is whether an injured party today would be better bringing an action under - for
example, theFairness of Transactions Act 1993 rather than relying on the common law.

     Take another quick break and think about these two questions.

         1. The vendor of a farm that you are interested in buying told you that it had never
             been used to raise cattle but in his judgment the property would easily be capable
             of carrying 500 cattle. This proved to be untrue. Can you now avoid the contract?
             Explain how.

         2. Eddie had a 2023 Toyota Prado Land Cruiser, which he wanted to sell. He advertised
             it for sale for K100,000. Eddie eventually sold it to Maria, who took it away, after
             giving him K90,000 cash. Unfortunately, the notes were forgeries and when he took
             the money to the bank the following morning, the bank refused to accept it and
             called the police. In the meantime, Maria sold the car through a firm of car dealers
             to Intergalactic Finance, who had no notice that Maria had acquired the car
             fraudulently. You bought the car in good faith and without notice of the defect in
             title. Do you have good title to it?

Negligent misrepresentation

Negligent misrepresentation lies in the tort of negligence, not contract. It arises when a
person, not just a professional adviser, provides oral or written advice to another person in
`serious circumstances', knowing that the information or advice may be acted on, fails to
take reasonable care to ensure the accuracy of the information. `Serious circumstances' are
where it would be reasonable to expect that a recipient might act on such advice and could
suffer financial loss if the advice was given carelessly.
A negligent misrepresentation can include negligent pre-contractual statements between
one contracting party and another, which do not form part of the contract, as well as the
giving of information and advice. It is thus possible for a statement to be both a collateral
contract or warranty (in relation to representations made in a pre-contractual context) and a
negligent misstatement.
To succeed in an action for negligent misrepresentation, the plaintiff has to establish that a
`special relationship' existed between the parties and that they relied on the representation.

                   In brief
205 | GENUINE CONSENT

     Establishing negligent misrepresentation

     To establish negligent misrepresentation, the following guidelines are useful:

           A special relationship must exist between the parties such that the person providing
             the advice or information must be aware that the party seeking the advice or
             information trusts them to exercise a duty of care in the giving of that information.

           The subject matter of the representation must be of a serious or business nature.
           The person providing the advice or information must realise that the recipient

             intends to act on that advice or information.
           In the circumstances, it must have been reasonable for the recipient to rely on that

             advice or information.
           The person receiving the advice must suffer damage, usually in the form of

             monetary loss.

What remedies are available for misrepresentation?

In order to determine what remedies may be available to you as the innocent party, it is
necessary to first determine the type of misrepresentation: is it:

   fraudulent misrepresentation--if the misrepresentation is serious and goes to the root
      of the contract you can rescind the contract and may have a right to damages

   innocent misrepresentation--the innocent party under PNG law may have no
      recourse at it is treated as case of let the buyer beware; or

   negligent misrepresentation--damages only (but in the tort of negligence)?

The right to rescind returns the parties to their positions before entering into the contract,
but it can be lost irrespective of whether the misrepresentation is fraudulent or innocent in
at least the following situations:

   if the innocent party waits too long to commence an action
   if the innocent party does something to affirm the contract after learning of the

      misrepresentation
   if the parties cannot be restored to their positions before the contract
   if there is an innocent third party who purchased the goods for value and in good faith

      then the third party will gain good title
   if there is unconscionable conduct by the plaintiff; or
   rescission would be inequitable.

Statutory modifications to the law relating to misrepresentation

The inability of the common law to satisfactorily deal with, in particular, innocent
misrepresentations by not awarding damages has resulted in limited statutory intervention.
The Fairness of Transactions Act 1993 is relevant to certain transactions which are unfair
or where there is a misrepresentation. Such contracts can be reviewed by the courts.

What actions can constitute duressor undue influence?

Duress

        In brief

Types of duress

                                                                                           option of

Duress is the use of violence or illegal threats against a person, their goods or their
economic interests to force them to enter into a contract against their will. The duress does
not have to be the sole reasonfor the coerced party entering into the contract, it just has to
be one of the reasons. The onus is on the party who has made the threat to show that it had
no effect on the other party, and if they cannot do that, the contract is voidable at the option
of the coerced party because there is a lack of voluntary agreement.
207 | GENUINE CONSENT

   To the person

Duress to the person, such as yourself, can take the form actual or threatened violence to
one contracting party, or to their immediate family, by or on behalf of the other contracting
party. What is important is that the duress was a contributing factor. For example, getting
a party to enter into a contract on the threat of criminal proceedings against you or your
family.

To establish duress against you for example, it has to be established that:

          that the duress by the other forced you to do something against your will, or that
            was not in your best interests, because of the use of coercion or threats that
            seemed credible

          the duress prevented you and the other party from meeting and negotiating on
            equal terms; and

          as a result of the duress, you felt you had no other option but to enter into a
            contract that you would not normally have entered into.

   To goods

Duress to goods or property could occur where one party carries out or threatens to carry
out the detention, seizure or damage to goods or property of you in order to induce you
to enter into a contract with them. You, as the coerced party, would have to show that the
other party (the coercing party) used extreme pressure on you, thus leaving you with no real
alternative but to enter into the contract - for example, burn your business down and put
you out of business if you did not agree to enter into a contract.

   Economic duress

This type of action is restricted to commercial activities and the illegitimate use of economic
pressure to force a business into entering into a contract that it might not otherwise have
entered into. The difficulty here is distinguishing between legitimate commercial pressure,
where the parties are of equal bargaining power, and economic duress. It is not a tort per
se, and so gives rise only to an action for and avoidance of the contract, not to an action for
damages.

To succeed in this action, you would have to establish two elements:

   the pressure was one of the reasons the coerced party entered into the contract; and
   the pressure was such (for example, unlawful threats or unconscionable conduct) that

      it was beyond what could be accepted as reasonable commercial practice. But it
                                                                                                                            GENUINE CONSENT | 208

      should also be noted that overwhelming pressure, not amounting to unlawful threats
      or unconscionable conduct, will not necessarily constitute economic duress.

It is sufficient if you can establish that the illegitimate pressure was one of the reasons for
entering into the contract. The onus then shifts on to the other party applying the pressure
to show that they did not contribute to you entering into the contract.

Undue influence

Undue influence, which is based in equity, involves the improper use of a position of
influence or power possessed by one person over another in order to induce the latter to
act for the former's benefit. The contract is voidableat the option of the innocent party, and
the usual remedy is rescission.

         In brief

Types of undue influence

Can a special relationship be presumed to exist?

Undue influence is presumed to exist in situations where there is a special relationship of
trust and confidence between the parties. Examples of special relationships include:

   parent and child
   solicitor and client
209 | GENUINE CONSENT

   religious adviser and devotee
   doctor and patient
   guardian and ward.

The onus is on the weaker party to prove a special relationship exists. It is then up to the
dominant party - that is, the parent, the solicitor, the religious adviser, the doctor or the
guardian - to show that that the transaction was a voluntary one and that there was no
undue influence exercised over the weaker party.

What if no special relationship exists?

The onus is on the weaker party to prove that the other party (the dominant party and the
defendant) exerted influence over them, and thus obtained a contract that they would not
otherwise have made.

Examples in this class would include taking advantage of a person who makes a gift of the
whole or the bulk of their estate if they:

   suffer from religious delusions
   believe in messages from the dead through a medium
   have little or no education.

The effect of undue influence on the contract, like duress, makes the contract voidable,
leaving the innocent party with a right to rescind if they wish. However, the right to rescission
can be lost if:

   an innocent third party gets involved; or
   rescission does not occur within a reasonable time (what is a reasonable time is

      question of fact and depends on the circumstances - for example, whether the
      contract is for goods that are perishable.

             which she donated to the sisterhood. She left the sisterhood in 2024. Is Allcare
             entitled to get her goods and money back? Explain why.

What are unconscionable (unfair) contracts?

What is the position at common law?

While contract law assumes that the parties are in equal bargaining positions, the reality
is that this is often not the case. Many contracts today are what we call `standard form
contracts.' These are non-negotiated pre-written agreements and popular with sellers of
high-volume goods and services. Some examples you may have encountered include
lease/rental agreements, mobile phone agreements, bus and airline tickets, purchase of
white goods, televisions and computers from retail stores to mention but a few.

The problem with standard form contracts is that one party, usually the seller, has a
superior bargaining position and is able to force you as the buyer, because of a `special
disadvantage', into a contract which may be unfair, harsh or oppressive contract (and which
can be described as unconscionable).

The general rule at common law is that the courts will not interfere with such a contract.
However, in its equitable jurisdiction the court may set aside a contract as unconscionable
where there has been an abuse by the defendant of their superior bargaining position in
their dealings with the plaintiff.

Unconscionable conduct leading to an unconscionable contract involves questions of fact
and degree, and each case must be judged on its facts. If the facts show that the conduct
of the defendant was such that in its factual setting fairness and good faith could properly
be expected to be exercised, and it can be shown that they were not, then the conduct of
the defendant may be described as unconscionable.
211 | GENUINE CONSENT

However, it should not be assumed that every unfair contract is automatically also
unconscionable and should be struck down. You, for example, will make bad business
decisions which can prove to be disadvantageous to you, but it does not necessarily
mean that the courts will then automatically find in favour of the other party. Among other
things, the courts will look closely at whether the disadvantaged party has done anything
to help themselves - for example, by seeking, or being told by the dominant party to seek,
independent advice.

                   In brief

     What has to be established for a contract to be set aside as unconscionable?
     Not every unfair contract is going to be set aside on the grounds of unconscionability. For
     a contract to be set aside on the grounds that it was unconscionable, you as the plaintiff
     must prove that:

           you were in a position of `special disadvantage' at the time of the contract

          it must have substantially affected their ability to protect themselves

           the defendant must have known, or should have known, of the plaintiff's `special
             disability;' and

           the defendant had taken unfair advantage of it in such a way that the actions of the
             defendant were unconscionable (that is, unfair or unjust).

What is a special disadvantage?

What amounts to a `special disadvantage' is difficult to accurately define, but includes
poverty, need, sickness, age, sex, drunkenness, illiteracy or lack of education, or lack
of assistance or explanation where assistance or explanation is necessary. Disparity in
bargaining power would not be enough to constitute special disability.

Statutory modifications to the common law

Unfair contract terms

In addition to the common law position, s 4 of the Fairness of Transactions Act1993 also
                                                                                                                             GENUINE CONSENT | 212

addresses the use of unfair contract terms in contracts. Remember that the overall purpose
of this Act is to `ensure overall fairness of any transaction...' where one party for reasons
of economic or other advantage is in a superior bargaining position and the other is not
able to exercise a free choice...' or the transaction `...appears to be manifestly unfair or not
genuinely mutual' (Part 1, s 1(a)). If a court finds that the overall fairness of the transaction
is unfair under s 1(a), the court can re-open, review and rectify the transaction (s 1(b)).
The focus of the Fairness of Transactions Act 1993 is on fairness (s 4) and in the case of
a matter going to court, at first instance the court shall attempt a mediated settlement (s 7)
and should that fail, the court will then proceed to review the matter (s 8).

                     Business tip
       Steps to avoid claims of unconscionable conduct
       For businesses to reduce problems of unconscionability arising in equity or statute law,
       you should ensure that:

             there is equality of bargaining power
             there is an opportunity to negotiate
             if one of the parties is at a `special disadvantage' - for example, because of

                health, age, mental capacity, education, literacy or economic circumstances -
                they have time to consider the contract
             independent legal advice is available if one of the parties is at a `special
                disadvantage'
             the language of the agreement is in `plain English' (easy to understand)
             pamphlets are produced in several languages explaining the contract; and
             normal commercial practice has been followed.

                   Reflection questions
213 | GENUINE CONSENT

     Time for your last break. Again, reflect on what you have just read and think how you
     would decide the following questions based on real cases.

     Question 1

     FACTS: The Buttresses had known the Johnsons for some 20 years. When Mrs Buttress
     was dying, Mrs Johnson had helped look after her and her husband. After Mrs Buttress
     had died, Mr Buttress, who by this stage was elderly, illiterate and demonstrating
     `strangeness in disposition and manner', began to live a somewhat eccentric lifestyle,
     living in a shack which he built next to the cottage he had lived in with his wife. Mr Buttress
     said that he wanted Mrs Johnson to have the cottage after he died as thanks for looking
     after him and his wife. Mrs Johnson's solicitor prepared the necessary documents after
     ensuring that was really what Mr Buttress wanted. After Mr Buttress died, his son sought to
     have the gift set aside on the grounds of undue influence.

     ISSUE: Had Mrs Johnson exercised improper or undue influence over Mr Buttress? Who
     has the burden of proof?

     DECISION: What do you think? Why?

     NOTE: This was a very finely balanced case.
     Question 2

     FACTS: An elderly Italian couple, with little understanding of written English or formal
     education, signed a guarantee and mortgage over a block of shops to the Commercial
     Bank as security for payment of the debts of one of their son's companies. Their son was a
     property developer and builder. At the time of signing, they were led to believe by their
     son that the guarantee and mortgage were for up to K150,000 and limited to six months.
     They were also told by their son that the company was in a good financial situation, when
     in fact it was in serious financial trouble.

     When the bank manager brought the papers to the Amadios' home for them to sign the
     mortgage and guarantee, he corrected their misunderstanding about the length of time
     the guarantee was to run for, explaining that it was for an unlimited time and not six
     months. However, he did not explain the possible effects of the documents, which the
     Amadios could not read, and he made no mention of the fact that the amount was
     unlimited. When the son's company went into liquidation and the bank attempted to
     exercise its rights under the mortgage/guarantee, the Amadios attempted to have the
     contract set aside.

     ISSUE: Was the conduct of the bank such that it could be regarded as unconscionable?
                                                                                                                             GENUINE CONSENT | 214

     Had the bank taken unfair advantage of its superior bargaining position for its own
     commercial gain?
     DECISION: So, what do you think here?
     HINT: The test for unconscionable conduct is by reference to the special disability that
     may disadvantage a weaker party in a transaction, with the focus on the exploitation by
     one party of another's disadvantage.
     REFLECTION: Do you think that the conduct of the bank would still be unconscionable if
     the Amadios' had had the benefit of independent legal advice?
     Question 3
     FACTS: Diprose fell in love and became infatuated with Ms Louth, who did not have similar
     feelings towards him. When Ms Louth falsely told Diprose that she and her two children
     were going to be evicted from the house they occupied, Diprose gave her money to buy a
     house in her own name.
     ISSUE: Was Diprose under a `special disadvantage', in the sense that Ms Louth had
     exploited his feelings for her and manipulated him to her financial advantage, or was this a
     case of an imprudent gift?
     DECISION: And the final question. What do you think here?
     REFLECTION: Do you think that if the roles had been reversed, and Ms Louth was
     infatuated with Diprose, you would have arrived at the same decision?

        Key points

An understanding of the following points will help you to better revise and understand the
material in this chapter.

   What is the effect of mistake on a contract? The courts are reluctant to strike down
      a contract just because of mistake. However, if mistake is established, the contract is
      void in the case of common and mutual mistake, but in the case of unilateral mistake,
      and depending on the circumstances, the contract may be declared void or voidable.

   What are the different types of mistakes with contracts?
215 | GENUINE CONSENT

          Common mistake involves agreement, but there is a common error as to the
            existence or identity of the subject matter - for example, a contract to sell goods,
            which, unknown to the parties, were destroyed before the contract was made.

          Mutual mistake involves a mistake made by both parties concerning a material
            fact that is important to the subject matter of the contract, so there is no genuine
            consent - for example, you have agreed to sell your car, thinking it is a 2022
            Toyota Prado. The buyer has agreed to buy your Prado, but thinks it is a 2023
            Prado.

          Unilateral mistake involves only one party being mistaken about a material fact
            regarding the subject matter of the contract so there is no matching of offer and
            acceptance, thus there is no real agreement - for example, A contracts with B
            thinking B is C, and B knows of A's mistake.

   What is the effect of a mistake on a written document, and what is the operation
      of the non est factum rule? A successful plea of non est factum (it is not document
      or deed) will result in a court declaring the contract void for mistake. To succeed in
      such a plea, if you are the mistaken party must believe that the document you signed
      is radically different from what you believed it to be. That is, the mistake must go to
      the fundamental nature of the document and not its contents and there must be an
      absence of carelessness or negligence in the execution of the document.

   What is the difference between fraudulent and innocent misrepresentation, and
      what is their effect on a contract? Fraudulent misrepresentation is distinguished
      from innocent misrepresentation by the intentional deceit of one party by the other.
      Fraudulent misrepresentation is the basis of the tort of deceit, and the remedy for you
      if you are the injured party lies in tort. You, as the innocent party, can:
          raise the fraud as a defence and counterclaim for damages if the other party
            attempts to enforce the contract
          repudiate the contract and sue for restitution if the contract has not been
            completed; or
          carry on with the contract and sue for damages in tort. An innocent
            misrepresentation is one made honestly, but mistakenly, in believing the facts to
            be true, both at the time of making the statement and at the time of contracting.
            Because it is neither fraudulent nor negligent, there is no remedy in tort but there
            may be a remedy under s 4 of the Fairness of Transactions Act.

   What is required to amount to negligent misrepresentation? In order to succeed
      in an action for negligent misrepresentation, the plaintiff is going to have to establish
      that a `special relationship' exists between the parties in addition to the normal
      elements required to succeed in a negligence action - that is, duty, breach and
      damage.

   What is the meaning of the terms `duress' and `undue influence'?
          Duress is the use of violence or illegal threats against a person, their goods or
                                                                                                                        GENUINE CONSENT | 216

         economic interests to force them to enter into a contract against their will. Thus,
         there is a lack of voluntary agreement and the agreement is voidable at the option
         of the innocent party.
       Undue influence involves the improper use of a position of influence or power
         that one person has over another in order to induce the latter to act for the
         former's benefit. It is an equitable doctrine that makes the contract voidable at the
         option of the innocent party.
 What constitutes unconscionable conduct at common law? A transaction can be
   described as unconscionable when there has been an abuse by the defendant of their
   superior bargaining position in their dealings with you, if you are the plaintiff. If the
   facts show that the conduct of the defendant was such that in its factual setting
   fairness and good faith could properly be expected to be exercised, and it can be
   shown they were not, then the conduct of the defendant may be described as
   unconscionable. Again, the Fairness of Transactions Act 1993 might provide a
   remedy.
 What is the effect of the Fairness of Transactions Act1993 on unconscionable
   conduct? Look at s 4 of the Fairness of Transactions Act 1993 which sets out the
   concept of fairness based on principle of what is just and equitable and then look at
   the circumstances of the parties existing before, at and after entering into the
   transaction and consider whether there or not there has been a failure to observe the
   principles of fairness.

An understanding of the following terms will help you understand the material in this chapter
on legality and form:

          Form: in the sense it is used in contract law, those statutory procedural
            requirements that need to be satisfied for some contracts to be enforceable

          Restraint of trade: an agreement in which a party agrees to restrict or restrain
            their activities in the future to carry on their trade, profession or business with
            other persons who are not a party to the contract

          Void: of no legal effect
          Voidable: an agreement that may be affirmed or rejected at the option of one of

            the parties
                                                                                                         LEGALITY OF OBJECT AND FORM | 218

        Introduction

 1. In the last two chapters we looked at the questions of capacity to contract (Chapter 8)
      and genuine consent (Chapter 9). In this chapter we will look at the questions of
      legality and form and once we have answered these questions, we will know whether
      the contract we created in Chapters 5 to 7 is valid. If it isn't, then what is it? Is it
      voidable, void or unenforceable contract?

 2. In this chapter we are concerned with two questions:

          Was the purpose of the contract legal (the question of legality)? If it is not, we
            have a problem.

          Are there any statutory requirements that need to be met (form)?

In this chapter consider the legal position of the parties where the contract we created is
illegal or void by statute or common law. Because of the importance of restraint of trade
to business, it is very useful for you to have a knowledge of it in business. Of particular
importance are the restraint of trade clauses in contracts of employment and the restraints
imposed on the seller (vendor) of a business.

This chapter then completes the question about the validity of the contract that you created.
However, this is not the end of the story. You still need to know what has been agreed to,
that is, what are the terms of the contract (Chapter 11) and what happens if you, or the party
you contracted with, don't carry out what has been agreed to in the contract, as in, has there
been a breach (Chapter 12).

Step 6: Is the purpose of the contract legal?

If you are satisfied that there is no issue with the questions of either capacity or consent,
then the last of the factors you must consider is illegality and form. Are the objects, or
purpose, of the contract that we created legal, and are there any statutory requirements that
we need to satisfy?

Because some contracts, and certain clauses in some contracts, may be voidor illegalat
statute or common law, it is important to understand the distinction between void and illegal
contracts. Without that understanding, it is not possible to see the different consequences
that can flow from each at statute or common law.
219 | LEGALITY OF OBJECT AND FORM

What type of contracts are illegal by statute?

What is the extent ofinvalidity?

The extent to which Parliament may wish to ensure that neither party has any rights
or remedies at all under the transaction, or to go further and impose penalties for such
an agreement, will depend on the construction of the statute's terms in each case. This
requires the court to consider two questions:

   Did the statute mean to prohibit such contracts at all?

If the answer is `yes', then:

   Does the contract in issue belong to the class that the statute intends to prohibit?

Ultimately, the answer to the second question hinges as much on public policy as anything
else, with the court considering what mischief the statute is intended to prevent, as well as
the language used and the consequences for the innocent party.

What is the legal position of the parties where the contract is
illegal by statute?

There are a number of ways in which a contract may be affected by a statutory provision:

   The contract may be to do something that a statute expressly prohibitssuch as a
      type of contract or term such as prohibiting unlicensed dealing in goods

   The contract may be one where the statute expressly or impliedlyprohibits the
      making of the agreement itself and the contract is illegal as formed

   A statute may require that the contract must be performed in a certain way - for
      example, when providing a purchaser with an invoice, stating the percentages of
      certain chemicals contained in fertiliser. While the contract might be lawful in its
      formation, failure to performthe contract in the prescribed manner could result in the
      contract being illegaland unenforceable as performed, and therefore unenforceable.

The courts are reluctant to find that a contract is illegal by statute unless a `clear implication'
to that effect can be drawn from an examination of the statute. In trying to decide this, the
courts consider whether the statute means to prohibit the contract or regulate the way the
contract can be performed. What is the sole object of the statute? If the illegal behaviour
is only incidentalto the way the contract was completed, the court will notbe prepared to
find that the contract was unenforceable.
                                                                                                         LEGALITY OF OBJECT AND FORM | 220

To some extent, the approach of the courts in considering whether a contract will be
void or unenforceable based on illegality where a statute is involved is one of statutory
interpretation. What was the intention of Parliament? Did it intend a fine to be sufficient
punishment or did it intend the contract to be void or unenforceable as well?

What is the legal position of the parties where the contract is void
by statute?

While some contracts are illegal as formed or performed, whether they are unenforceable
depends on the intention of the statute. Other contracts may be made void by statute.

A contract void by statute will not be enforced by the courts and there are no rights that
can be enforced by either party - for example, gaming or wagering contracts, certain
money lending practices under the consumer credit legislation and some contracts with
minors/infants (see chapter 8). Sometimes, instead of striking down the whole contract, a
statute may declare that only part of the agreement is void, and the remainder valid.

Subsequent transactions directly related to the contract rendered void by statute, but
not illegal, may themselves be rendered void if that is the intention of the statute. If
the subsequent transaction is to get its validity from the earlier contract, which is now
rendered void by statute, then that transaction will fail because the consideration for the
later contract is the validity of the earlier one. As this no longer exists, there is a total failure
of consideration.

If the contract is rendered void, but notillegal, any money paid under the contract is
irrecoverable, irrespective of whether or not the party who has paid it can prove a total
failure of consideration. However, any amounts paid under a void contract maybe
recoverable in restitution.

                  Reflection questions

     First break. Reflect on what you have just read and think about the following question.

         1. Brass hired a roulette table, with all the ancillary equipment needed to play roulette,
             from ACME Hire. When they entered into the contract, neither party was aware of
221 | LEGALITY OF OBJECT AND FORM

             the provisions of their state's gaming and betting legislation that made the game
             unlawful but did not prohibit it. When Brass discovered the Act, he refused to pay
             the hire price. Can ACME Hire recover the hire charges?

What is the common law positionofcontracts that areillegal and
contracts thatarevoid?

                   In brief

     Contracts illegal at common law
     The main classes of contract illegal at common law are:

           contracts to commit a crime, tort or fraud against a third party
           contracts that promote sexual immorality or prejudice the status of marriage
           contracts that are to the prejudice of public safety or good relations with foreign

             countries
           contracts that are prejudicial to, or delay, the administration of justice
           contracts that promote public corruption
           contracts that defraud the state of revenue; and
           contracts that involve a breach of duty.

What type of contracts are illegal at common law?

Are contracts to commit a crime, a tort or a fraud against athird-party
void?

The courts will not enforce a contract that has as its object the breaking of the law. For
example, a contract between robbers to divide the proceeds of a robbery or commit tax
fraud would be void because the purpose of the contract is illegal.
                                                                                                         LEGALITY OF OBJECT AND FORM | 222

Are contracts that are sexually immoral unenforceable?

Contracts violating the social or moral attitudes of the community are prohibited as being
contrary to `public policy'. Of course, an interesting question here is what exactly does
`sexually immoral' mean?

Are contracts that are to the prejudice of public safety or of good
relations with friendly countries valid?

There are two types of agreement here:

   an agreement with an enemy alien
   an agreement that could endanger friendly relations existing between two countries.

In both cases, an agreement would be regarded as illegal and unenforceable.

Are contracts prejudicial to the administration of justice unenforceable?

Any attempt to affect the administration of justice is illegal and void.

Are contracts that tend to promote corruption in public life invalid?

Contracts which involve the corruption or bribery of a public official are illegal. A contract
that interferes with the impartial judgment of public officials, including Members of
Parliament are invalid because they involve corruption.

Are contracts to defraud public authorities of revenue invalid?

A clear infringement of public policy can be found in agreements that intend to defraud the
revenue of a country, whether at the national, state or local level are invalid because they
involve corruption.

Are contracts that involve a breach of duty by an employee invalid?

Contracts involving a breach of duty by an employee or agent are generally illegal. If the
breach of duty by the employee endangers others, then the contract is void. But what if the
contract, while it involves a breach of the employee's duty, has as its purpose to improve
the safety and protection of other employees?
223 | LEGALITY OF OBJECT AND FORM

What type of contracts are void at common law but not illegal?

                   In brief

     Contracts void at common law
     These three types of contracts (or clauses in contracts) are void, but not illegal, at
     common law:

           contracts prejudicial to the status of marriage, but see the Marriage Act 1963
           clauses in contracts that attempt to oust the jurisdiction of the courts; and
           clauses in contracts in restraint of trade.

Can you oust the jurisdiction of the courts?

If the parties try to create a legally binding contract but include a clause attempting to oust
the jurisdiction of the courts, in the event of a dispute the clause will be void and, if possible,
severed. If the clause cannot be severed, the contract will be void.
A contract with a clause providing for arbitration in the event of a dispute between the
parties will be valid only if it is to operate as a condition precedent to any recourse to the
courts. It cannot attempt to exclude review of the arbitrator's decision by a court if there
is, for example, a denial of natural justice or the application of the wrong law. Note that
an arbitration clause is common in commercial transactions because it provides the parties
with a quicker, cheaper and simpler resolution of a dispute than they will get through the
courts.
Problems can arise where courts are asked to distinguish between contracts that attempt to
oust the jurisdiction of the courts and contracts that are binding in honour only. In the latter,
the parties expressly declare that they do not intend to create legal relations.

Are contracts in restraint of trade void?

While a person should be bound by their contracts, one of the fundamental rights in contract
                                                                                                         LEGALITY OF OBJECT AND FORM | 224

law is a person's freedom to contract. Contracts, or clauses (called `covenants') in contracts,
that attempt to restrict or restrain the freedom of one party to contract are not illegal, rather,
they are unenforceable at common law because they are against public policy unless
it can be shown by the party relying on the clause is protecting a legitimate business
interest (such as goodwill, trade secrets or confidential information) and is reasonable.

It should not be assumed that issues of restraint of trade are restricted to just the common
law. Contracts (or clauses) that are in restraint of trade can also be caught by legislation
such as the Independent Consumer and Competition Commission Act 2002.

What is a restraint of trade?

What is the position at common law?

The common law view of clauses in restraint of tradeis that they tend to:

   injure the person involved by reducing their means of earning a livelihood (as in, by
      restricting their freedom to work)

   deprive the public of the services of persons in the capacities in which they may be
      most useful to the community as well as to themselves

   discourage industry and enterprise and reduce the products of ingenuity and skill,
      and

   restrict competition.

Even today, many contracts, and clauses (covenants) in contracts, attempt to restrict the
freedom of one party to the contract to do something in the future. For example, in contracts
of employment there is often a clause providing that, on termination of employment, if you
are an employee that you will not compete against your employer for a certain period. If you
are working, have you ever looked at your contract of employment to see what the terms
and condition of your employment are?

In the sale of a business, to protect the purchaser's goodwill, there will usually be a clause
prohibiting the vendor (the seller) from setting up a similar business within a reasonable
distance and for a reasonable time near you if you are the purchaser. In contracts between
manufacturers and traders, it used to be common to find clauses restricting the trader from
selling the manufacturer's goods below a certain price or to a competitor

A contract, or clause in a contract, is a restraint of trade if it limits freedom to trade. At first
sight it appears to be void because it is considered to be contrary to public policy. However,
this is a presumption and if the person relying on the contract or a clause in a contract
can show that the restraint is reasonable, the restraint may be enforceable.
225 | LEGALITY OF OBJECT AND FORM

What has to be shown for a restraint clause in a contract of employment to be valid?

Because employees often have access to confidential information, business contacts, trade
secrets and the like, it is not unusual for employers to try to incorporate a restraint of
trade clause or covenant into the employee's contract of employment. The reason for such
a clause is to attempt to stop employees who change employers from giving their new
employer confidential information about their previous employer.

Restraint of trade clauses in contracts of employment usually take two forms:

   restraints on the use of confidential information or trade secrets learnt during
      employment - for example, secret formulas (such as the recipe for Coca-Cola) and
      processes; or

   protection of trade connections, such as customer lists, but only to the extent
      where the employee has come into contact with the clients or customers and has
      acquired influence over them - a restraint against an employee who has had no
      contact with the employer's clients or customers would not succeed.

The following factors should be considered when trying to decide whether information was
`secret' and therefore protectable, or `general know-how' and generally not protectable:

   the extent to which the information is known inside and outside the business
   the value of the information to competitors
   the effort spent in developing the information; and
   the difficulty in acquiring or duplicating such information.

In the case of trade secrets, an employer may generally validly restrain an employee from
making any unauthorised use of that information both while working for them and for a
reasonable time after the contract of employment has ended. An employer is entitled
to protect and safeguard the confidential techniques they have developed. They could
therefore legally restrain a former employee from using the information while employed by
a rival firm. However, note that while an employer is entitled to protect their trade secrets,
they cannot prevent an employee from using their own skills and knowledge after they have
left the employment, even if those skills were learnt from the employer.

Even then, it is still very difficult to convince the courts that the restriction placed on the
employee by the employer is reasonable and not in restraint of trade. The reason for the
court's attitude is that frequently there is an inequality in the bargaining power between
the employer and the employee, with the employer dictating the terms on which the
employee may accept the position. As a result, the courts will look at the relative bargaining
power of the parties. One of the factors which would support the reasonableness of a
                                                                                                         LEGALITY OF OBJECT AND FORM | 226

restraint is if both sides took legal advice so there was no inequality in bargaining power
between the parties.
As a general rule, if there is an inequality of bargaining power between the parties, the
courts will interpret these clauses contra proferentem -that is, strictly against the party
relying on them (in this case, the employer). As a result, if the clause is merely an attempt
to limit competition, the courts will usually find little difficulty in striking down the clause.

                   In brief

     A person calling something `confidential' does not automatically make it confidential within
     the scope of what equity will protect. It must be something that is not public knowledge
     or public property.The matter of confidentiality is viewed at two points in time:

           For the purposes of determining whether the information is confidential and should
             be protected, look to the facts at the time the parties made their contract

           Whether an injunction should be granted is determined by looking at the facts at
             the time of the hearing.

When is a restraint clause valid in a contract of employment?
A restraint clause in a contract of employment that will be held to be valid in most instances
is one that goes to the employee's present employment and provides that the employee
must not compete directly or indirectly (either with a rival firm or even operating as a sole
trader) while still working for their current employer.
The primary duty of an employee is to the employer. This situation must be
distinguished from situations that relate to the position of employees after leaving their
present employment. The question that then should be considered is whether a former
employee should continue to owe a contractual duty to their former employer.
The case where the employee is going to be held to their contract is one which
isreasonable or fair, considering the interests of both parties.In A Schroeder Music
Publishing Co Ltd v Macaulay [1974] 1 WLR 1308 (an English case), the publishing
company had used its superior bargaining power over Macaulay (a young, unknown song-
227 | LEGALITY OF OBJECT AND FORM

writer) and a `take it or leave it' contract to exploit Macaulay's earning power for the next 10
years. As a result, the bargain between the parties was unconscionable, or not fair, since
the terms combined required a total commitment by Macaulay with a total lack of obligation
by the publishers.

                     Business tip
       Making an employer-employee restraint valid
       Because the parties in an employer-employee relationship are (usually) in an unequal
       bargaining position, restraint clauses in employee contracts will be struck down by the
       courts unless they:

             only protect intellectual property rights (such as trade secrets) or customer
                connections, or prevent an employee from working for a competitor during their
                current employment

             are of reasonable length in time (this is a question of fact in each case and will
                be determined by what is being protected); and

             are of reasonable geographical width (again, this is a question of fact in each
                case and will be determined by what is being protected).

       Care must be used, or the provisions of the Employment Act 1978 may be triggered.

                  Reflection questions

     Time for a break. But first, reflect on what you have just read regarding restraint clauses in
     contracts of employment, and apply that to these questions.

         1. Explain why a restraint clause in a contract of employment is most likely to be
             struck down by the courts. In what circumstances will a restraint clause be likely to
             be considered valid in a contract of employment?
                                                                                                         LEGALITY OF OBJECT AND FORM | 228

         2. Samson was employed as a computer salesman. Part of Samson's contract of
             employment contained the following clause:

                         The employee expressly agrees not at any time during one year after the

                              termination of his employment . . . either on his own account or as a
                              representative or agent of any person or company, to act as a computer
                              salesman. . . for any person or company who at any time during the last two
                              years of his employment shall have been a customer of the employer in the
                              course of his employment.

                   Is the restraint between Samson and his employer valid?

         3. Roberta was employed as a works manager with Littlewoods Recycling Works in
             Port Morseby. Her contract of employment contained a restraint of trade clause
             whereby she agreed that in the event of leaving Littlewoods she would not work in
             the recycling industry in PNG for five years from the time of leaving the company's
             employ. Roberta has been approached by a rival firm in Lae who has offered to
             double her existing salary if she will go and work for them. Roberta wishes to know
             whether the restraint clause in her contract of employment is valid. What advice
             would you give her?

Can you impose a restraint on the vendor of a business?

In the sale of a business, where there is an element of goodwill, it is reasonable to expect
that if you were the purchaser you would want to stop the seller from opening a similar
business to the one, they just sold to you within a certain area and time period. Here it is
assumed that the parties are dealing on a `more' equal basis, and there is a legitimate
commercial interest that requires protection (as in, goodwill), and as a result the courts
are generally prepared to uphold the validity of such clauses.

Each case should be treated on its own merits and it will be a question of fact as to
whether the restraint is reasonablein its protection of your interest as the purchaser but
not unreasonable in preventing the vendor from carrying on normal business activities. Look
closely at whether the length of time and the geographic extent of the exclusivity clause and
think about whether they were reasonable.
229 | LEGALITY OF OBJECT AND FORM

                  In brief

     Factors that determine whether a restraint on a business is reasonable
     Whether or not a restraint is reasonable in the interests of the parties and the public is
     determined at the date of the agreement after consideration of the following factors:

           the geographical extent of the restraint
           the time period involved
           the bargaining strengths and positions of the parties during the negotiations; and
           the type of business and the activity being restrained.

Where the sale of a business is concerned, note carefully the type of business, as the size
of the area and the length of time will vary with the type of business. For example, if you
buy a Toyota dealership you would expect that you would not want the seller setting up in
competition just down the road. Also, look carefully at the wording of the restraint of trade
clause in a contract. Ensure that it is clear and not vague. The question in each case is what
is reasonable to protect the parties. Not only must the restraint be reasonable in area and
time, but the size of the area and the length of time can vary with the type of business.
Keep in mind that the size of the area and the length of time will vary with the type of
business. Thus, a restraint imposed on the vendor of a caf will not be the same as the
restraint imposed on the vendor of a car dealership, although in both cases it will still be
valid if it is reasonable.
A restriction should not demand too much. Where a restrictive clause is held to be too wide,
the likely outcome is that the clause will be void. The courts are very reluctant to narrow it
to a reasonable scope.
While the courts will neither redraft nor narrow the operation of a restriction that is
unreasonable, they will sever an unreasonable restriction from one that is reasonable if
there are two restrictions. However, they must be two separate restrictions and the
severed restriction must not affect the meaning of the reasonable restriction.

What happens in trading agreements?

It is not unusual to find a manufacturer or trader who will want to exclude competition from
a market segment in which they operate in order to maximise their profits. This may take
the form of, for example, exclusive selling or exclusive purchasing agreements. At common
law, the validity of such agreements will depend on:

 whether the agreement is a reasonable restraint between the parties themselves;
   and

 whether it is in the interests of the public.

However, finding that such an agreement is reasonable at common law does not
automatically mean that the agreement will have the force of law, because such agreements
are also subject to statutory provisions such as the Independent Consumer and Competition
Act 2002, so it might still fail on grounds of publicpolicy.

Severance of illegal or void restraints of trade

If a clause is illegal or void by statute or common law, as may be the case with a restraint of
trade clause, it doesn't necessarily follow that the courts will strike down the whole contract.
As a general rule, the courts will not sever a clause from a contract which is illegally formed.
However, severance can be used in relation to restraint of trade clauses where the clauses
are void but not illegal as long as the court is able to delete the unreasonable parts and
enforce the reasonable parts without changing the fundamental nature, scope or effect of
the contract.

A common boilerplate clause is what is called a severance clausewhich documents the
intention of the parties that, should a contractual term such as a restraint of trade clause
be found to be void or illegal, it may be severed while the remaining terms of the contract
will remain valid. However, if the removal of the illegal or void clause makes the contract
unworkable, then the contract will still be void.

Reflection questions
231 | LEGALITY OF OBJECT AND FORM

     You are at the end but before you go on to the next chapter just make sure you
     understand what you have read about restraint of trade and make notes as you go.

         1. Do the courts apply the same criteria in assessing whether a restraint clause in a
             contract of employment is valid as they do in a contract involving the sale of a
             business? Explain why?

         2. We asked you above that if you were to buy a Toyota dealership you would expect
             that you would not want the seller establishing competition just down the road but,
             if you bought a milk bar or caf, for example, the geographic restraint might be just

            a couple of kilometres if it is in town (or more in the country). What we did not ask
            you is whether you would you use the same restraint clause in both
            purchases? Explain why or why not.

Step 7: Is the purpose of the contract legal?

The last step is establishing the validity of your contract. What you are doing here is
checking that there are no statutory requirements that need to be met.
Certain contracts, to be valid and enforceable, are required by statute to be wholly in
writing or they are void, such as bills of exchange, cheques and promissory notes (Bills
of Exchange Act1951, ss 8(1), 79, 93(1)), while other contracts must be evidenced in
writing. The absence of writing does notaffect the validity of the contract, but it makes it
unenforceable in a court, for example, Goods Act 1951, ss 4, 5.
The great majority of simple contracts that you will encounter in business or commerce will
not be subject to any statutory requirements for them to be enforceable. You may choose to
put a contract in writing if it is important for you or the other party to ensure some certainty
about what it is you have agreed to do. Think about why it might be important to have a
contract in writing, or at least evidenced in writing.

       Key points

An understanding of the following points will help you to better revise material in this
chapter.
                                                                                                     LEGALITY OF OBJECT AND FORM | 232

 What is the difference between contracts that are illegal and those that are void
   by statute?Contracts that are illegal by statute will be either:
       illegal as formedand unenforceable because they should never have been
         entered into; or
       illegal as performed - the contract is legal as formed but performed in an illegal
         way or for an illegal purpose, and is not necessarily unenforceable if innocent
         conduct is incidental to performance
       Contracts that are void by statute will not be enforced by the courts and create no
         enforceable rights between the parties - for example, gaming and wagering
         contracts.

 In what ways may a contract be illegal under statute law?Contracts that are illegal
   by statute may be illegal as formed because they are expressly forbidden by statute
   (for example, many licensing statutes) or illegal as performed, as the contract is
   performed in an illegal way or for an illegal purpose (for example, a taxi driver carrying
   more than the licensed number of passengers).

 What is the difference between contracts that are illegal and those that are void
   at common law?Contracts that are considered to violate social or moral attitudes of
   the community (for example, committing a crime or tort, or promotion of corruption)
   are illegal and may be subject to criminal penalties. Contracts (or clauses) that are
   void at common law - such as those that prejudice the status of marriage, oust the
   jurisdiction of the courts or are in restraint of trade (unless reasonable) - are
   unenforceable as a matter of public policy.

 What is the effect of a clause in a contract in restraint of trade, and in what
   circumstances will it be legally enforceable?A clause in a contract in restraint of
   trade will be unenforceable if it is not reasonable. Whether or not a restraint is
   reasonable in the interests of the parties and the public is determined at the date of
   the agreement after consideration of the geographical extent of the restraint, the time
   period involved, and the type of business and the activity being restrained. In the case
   of restraint clauses in contracts of employment, the restraint must be reasonable and
   there must be a protectable interest, such as confidential information or trade secrets.
   In the case of a vendor of a business, it is assumed that the parties are in an equal
   bargaining position, and the question then is: What is reasonable to protect the
   parties?

 Why is the question of `Form' important? If the contract does not any meet
   statutory requirements it may make the contract void or unenforceable.

CONSTRUCTION OF THE CONTRACT:
TERMS AND CONDITIONS

       Learning objectives

By the end of this Chapter, you should be able to:

   Identify terms in a contract and distinguish them from a representation.
   Discuss the parol evidence rule and the number of qualifications subject to it.
   Identify a collateral contract and explain the significance of its contractual effect.
   Recognise the importance of different terms, and identify conditions, warranties and

      statutory consumer guarantees.
   Explain the types of terms implied into a contract.
   Describe exclusion clauses, the approaches to their interpretation and the statutory

      protection available to consumers.

       Key Terms

You will notice these key terms, which are mentioned throughout the chapter, to help you to
better understand and remember the material:

          Condition: a stipulation going to the root of the contract, allowing the injured
            party the right to rescind and/or claim damages

          Condition precedent: a term in an agreement that delays the vesting of the right
            until the happening of the event

          Condition subsequent: a term in a contract that destroys the right on the
            happening of the event

          Exclusion clause: a contractual term that attempts to limit or exclude the liability
            of the person inserting the term into a contract

          Intermediate or innominate terms: contractual terms, the remedy for the breach
                                                               CONSTRUCTION OF THE CONTRACT: TERMS AND CONDITIONS | 234

            of which depends on the seriousness of the breach rather than on the
            classification of the term as a condition or a warranty
          Parol evidence rule: A rule of evidence which states that additional oral
            evidence is not considered by the courts to contradict, vary, add to or subtract
            from its terms when a contract is complete on its face
          Standard form contracts: contracts that incorporate terms of a standard nature,
            often in fairly wide terms, applicable to all persons making a particular type of
            contract
          Warranty: a term of lesser importance to the main purpose of the contract which,
            if breached, only allows the injured party to claim for damages

        Introduction

Congratulations on getting to this point. You now have an idea how a contract is created
and how we find out if what we have created is valid or not. But what is it you have agreed
to in your contract? This is what this chapter is about, that is, what are the terms of the
contract or to put it another way, what is the extent of the rights and obligations that you
and the other party have entered into? These `terms' can be expressed (as a condition,
warranty, innominate term, condition precedent or condition subsequent; and qualified by,
for example, an exclusion clause, or unqualified) or implied (or express and implied), or
meaningless.

Believe it or not, it can sometimes be unclear from what the parties have said, written or
done, what it is that they have actually agreed to. For example, they may disagree about
the meaning of words in their agreement that relates to what the exact goods or services
to be supplied are, what their condition is, where the goods might be delivered to, who is
responsible for any damage, when payment is to take place, the start date, the completion
date and so on.

The answer to what the parties have agreed can be found only by deciding what the
terms of the contract are, and then you need to determine what their relative meaning and
importance is. This often has to be done in the context of whether the terms that have
been agreed to have been qualified or limited by the inclusion of an exclusion or exemption
clause.
235 | CONSTRUCTION OF THE CONTRACT: TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                    Examples

     Ever wondered what an Employment Agreement might look like? To date you have just
     looked at the creation of the contract and what to look for to ensure its validity. In this
     chapter, we are looking at the terms you and the other party have agreed to.

     The Wonder Legal Australia website has an Australian Employment Agreement complete
     with all its terms and conditions for you to look at as an example of a finished contract
     (short of signing of course).

     There is a also a link to a Sale of Goods Contract used in New South Wales, Australia. Take
     a look and see what terms and conditions it contains.

     While both examples are Australian, PNG contracts contain similar terms and conditions.

What are representations?

Representations are statements of fact. They are made before the contractby one party
(an offeror) to induce(lead) the other party (an offeree) to enter into a contract. Unlike a
term, they do not form part of the contractand are not intended to be legally binding.
However, if the statements are pre-contractually misleading or deceptive, an action may lie
under statute law (for example, s 4 of the Fairness of Transactions Act 1993, s 105 of the
Independent Consumer and Competition Commission Act 2002), or under common law as
a negligent misrepresentation.
One way to minimise the problem with a pre-contractual representation is for a party to
include a `no representation/no reliance' clause (what is referred to as a form of
`boilerplate' clause, which is a standardised term in a contract) at the end of the contract. It
provides that the parties have not made any pre-contractual representations and, even if
they have, that neither party has relied on any representation made by the other that is not
contained in the contract.
                                                               CONSTRUCTION OF THE CONTRACT: TERMS AND CONDITIONS | 236

                   In brief

     The possibilities for a statement
     In summary, the possibilities are that a statement could be one of the following:

           a term: in which case the statement will create contractual obligations between the
             parties, breach of which will result in the injured party being able to sue

           a collateral contract: that is, a preliminary contract on which the main contract is
             entered into, breach of which will result in the injured party being able to sue

           a representation: that induces an offeree to enter into the contract but that is not
             part of the contract and so is not actionable in contract law; or

           a sales puff: that is not intended to have any legal effect, in which case no remedy
             is available.

A `no representation / no reliance' clause can also form part of another type of boilerplate
clause called an entire agreement clause. This type of clause provides that the contract
constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between the parties. It supersedes any
previous agreements and understandings that might have been made between them.
The promissory nature of a statement, and whether it is a representation or a term, depends
on the intention of the parties. The courts apply an objective test of a reasonable bystander,
taking into account the conduct of the parties, and their words and behaviour, to try to
distinguish between the two.

Why do the courts use objective tests?

In trying to ascertain the intentions of the parties from the particular facts before it and
whether a statement is a representation or term, the court takes into account:

   How much time has lapsed between the making of the statement and the final
      agreement? The longer the lapse of time between the making of the statement and
      the final agreement, the more likely it is to be treated as an inducement and not
      intended to form part of the agreement.
237 | CONSTRUCTION OF THE CONTRACT: TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   Where an oral statement precedes a written contract, then the terms of the contract
      tend to be contained in the written document, and all oral statements tend to be pre-
      contractual. However, it is important to look carefully at the time the oral statement
      is made in relation to the time the parties enter into a contract. If it is immediately
      before the contract is entered into, and subject to the importance of the statements
      and whether the person making it had special knowledge, a statement may form part
      of the contract.

   Was the innocent party asked to check or verify the statement? Here the
      statement is more likely to be an inducement - for example, a mechanic's report on a
      car.

   Was the statement made with the intention of preventing the other party from
      finding any defects, and did it succeed? If you as a buyer, on the basis of the
      statement by the seller just prior to your purchase that `The car is in excellent
      condition, you don't need to look it over', and you then don't bother to look it over,
      then the statement would most likely be an inducement or a misrepresentation, but
      just note it is important to look also at the context in which the statement was made.

   A vital factor in determining intention is whether the representation had been made at
      or immediately before the time of sale and the way in which it was made. If it is clear
      that it was intended to convince the other party not to bother checking and it could be
      shown that it was intended by the parties to be relied on, then the courts are prepared
      to find that the representation formed part of the contract and that there was a
      warranty. If the statement was made after the sale, then it was a representation
      and unenforceable, as the contract had already been finalised.

   What importance did the parties attach to the statement? If the parties placed
      considerable importance on the statement, the courts would be more willing to treat it
      as a term and not as a mere representation. If a party did not rely on the statement, it
      would be a representation - for example, where approval of a third party was
      necessary before the written agreement would become binding.

   Did one of the parties have special skills or knowledge? Where one of the parties
      had some special skill or knowledge not possessed by the other party with regard to
      the subject matter of the contract, then a statement would more likely be treated as a
      term. In the English case of Oscar Chess v Williams [1957] 1 All ER 325, Oscar
      Chess, a car dealer, in 1955 bought what he thought was a 1948 model car
      (confirmed by the registration papers) when in fact it was a 1939 model. Some 8
      months after the sale the dealer discovered the registration papers had been altered
      and the car was worth substantially less than what he had paid for it. The court held
      that the statement as to the age of the car was a mere representation that did not give
      rise to any liability for breach of contract. The dealer had special expertise as a motor
      vehicle dealer and should have taken steps to verify the age of the vehicle.
                                                               CONSTRUCTION OF THE CONTRACT: TERMS AND CONDITIONS | 238

The statement could also have been construed as an innocent misrepresentation but what
would have been the point as damages are not awarded for an innocent misrepresentation?
Oscar Chess could have had the contract set aside in equity if he had acted promptly but it
was 8 months before he did anything!

In trying to ascertain whether or not a statement is a term, the relative knowledge of the
parties should be considered. Which of the 2 parties is in the best position to know or
determine the truth about the statement? In Oscar Chess above, the majority view was
that Williams was in no better position than the dealer (Oscar Chess) to assess the age of
the car. Williams honestly believed, on reasonable grounds, that the statement as to age
was true.

Compare the decision in Oscar Chess with that in Dick Bentley Productions Ltd v Harold
Smith (Motors) Ltd [1965] 1 WLR 623, where a dealer sold a luxury car to the appellant
(Dick Bentley Productions) and stated that the car had done only 20,000 miles since a new
motor had been fitted. In fact, the car had travelled just under 100,000 miles. Here, the
court held that the statement was of a promissory nature, as the seller was in a much better
position to know the mileage, and so the representations amounted to a warranty rather
than a mere representation.

Where the person making the statement is in a better position than the other party to
assess the accuracy of the statement, it is probably a term. This is determined by trying to
establish the intention of the parties, objectively assessed on the basis of what an
intelligent bystander would infer from their words and conduct.

What is the parol (oral) evidence rule?

In the case of anoral contract, exactly what the parties said must be found as a matter
of fact, and to this end the courts will admit as evidence all facts known to the parties,
including both actions and wordsof the parties. Problems arise when the evidence is
conflicting. Each party may have a different view of what was agreed to, and the meaning
of what was said. This can raise difficult and costly problems of proof for you if you are the
plaintiff.

What is a written contract?

Where the contract is completely in writing, the courts assume that all the terms agreed
to by the parties are contained in the contract. However, problems may still arise in the
interpretation of particular terms that the court may need to resolve - for example, where
there is ambiguity.
239 | CONSTRUCTION OF THE CONTRACT: TERMS AND CONDITIONS

In the case of a written contract, the court generally will not admit evidence of acts or
words of the parties before the executionof the document if it has the effect of adding to,
varying or contradicting the written agreement. This is because the courts assume that the
parties' intention is contained within the `four corners' (the text) of the contract, known as
the parol evidence rule. However, this rule is subject to a number of qualifications to try to
avoid hardship or injustice.

                     Business tip
       To reduce exposure to litigation expenses, ensure that all of the relevant terms are
       contained in the document, and that there are no ambiguities. Another option is to
       include a `no representation/no reliance clause' or an `entire agreement' clause into
       the contract.

What has to be established for the parol evidence rule?

This is a rule of evidence which states that additional oral evidence is not considered by
the courts to contradict, vary, add to or subtract from its terms when a contract is complete
on its face unless it results in hardship or injustice, in which case the oral evidence can be
heard:

   to prove a trade custom or usage
   to show that the contract has not yet become effective
   where the court is of the opinion that the written document contains only part of the

      agreement
   to clarify any ambiguous language used in the contract
   where, due to a mistake of the parties, their agreement was not accurately expressed

      in the written contract
   to demonstrate that a description is false; or
   to determine how important the truth of the statement was.

Whether a warranty is intended depends on the conduct of the parties: on their words and
behaviour, rather than their thoughts. Thus, while a seller's statement may not be expressly
designated as a term of the contract between the parties - that is, either as a condition
or warranty - it can be intended by the parties to form a condition subject to which
                                                              CONSTRUCTION OF THE CONTRACT: TERMS AND CONDITIONS | 240

the contract was entered into - that is, it was a collateral warranty, and was of sufficient
weight to overcome the parol evidence rule.

What are the remedies for breach of a pre-contractual
representation?

Where pre-contractual representations are concerned, there are a number of remedies
available to an injured party at both common law and statute, as long as there is not a `no
representation/no reliance' or `entire agreement' clause in the contract of course, and these
can include:

   recission for misrepresentation
   negligence
   unconscionability at common law; and
   the Fairness of Transactions Act 1993.

                   Reflection questions

     Time for another break. Have a look at the following questions and test your
     understanding of what you have just read.

         1. Does it make any difference whether a statement is a representation or a term?
         2. Explain the purpose of the parol evidence rule and how it is applied by the courts.
         3. In trying to ascertain the promissory nature of a statement, and whether it is a

             representation or a term, what matters will the courts take into account in trying to
             ascertain the intention of the parties? Discuss.
     PROBLEM
     FACTS:Before signing a contract for the purchase of a house, you asked the seller
     whether there were any termites in the house. The seller told you there were none, and
     you immediately proceeded to sign the contract to buy the house. Some months later,
     you discovered extensive termite activity throughout the house which, according to an
     expert, showed that the termites had been in the house for at least 12 months. There was
     no reference in the written contract of the oral question relating to termites.
241 | CONSTRUCTION OF THE CONTRACT: TERMS AND CONDITIONS

     ISSUE: Could you rely on the oral statement made by the seller immediately before
     entering into the contract that there were no termites, even though it was not a written
     term in the contract?

     DECISION: What have you decided?

     CASE REFLECTION: Could you have argued that the vendor had fraudulently
     misrepresented the true position of the house when stating that it did not have termites
     since any reasonable inspection would have revealed their presence and the extent of the
     damage caused by them? Do you think that the seller's statement was made with the
     knowledge that it was false or recklessly, without caring whether it was true or false?

What are collateral contracts?

A statement which is not a term of the contract can sometimes be regarded as a collateral or
a preliminary contract if it can be shown that the main contract would nothave been entered
into in the absence of an earlier statement (look back at the problem question you have
just done). In such a case the courts maybe prepared to enforce the promises made by
the parties beforethey entered into the main contract. The consideration to support the
defendant's promise in the collateral contract is the making of the main contract.

In order to establish a collateral contract regarding a statement of fact it is necessary to
show that:

   the person making the statement intended it to be relied on; and
   the maker of the statement guaranteed its truth; and
   there was reliance by the person alleging the existence of the collateral contract.

Once a collateral contract is established, it is valid and enforceable if you are the plaintiff
and can establish each of the following:

   the statement relied on is promissory (and not descriptive or representational)
   it is not supported by past consideration (the promise is agreed before the statement

      is made; and
   it is consistent with the main contract.
                                                               CONSTRUCTION OF THE CONTRACT: TERMS AND CONDITIONS | 242

                   In brief

     The significance of the collateral contract

     Where a pre-contractual statement is not a term of the main contract, it may still have
     contractual effect as a collateral contract, thus providing the injured party with a remedy.
     Such a contract has an independent existence to the main contract and may be
     enforced by an action for breach of a promise. More importantly, the collateral contract
     is not caught by the parol evidence rule because it is oral.

If an inconsistency comes from the operation of an exclusion clause in the main contract,
the collateral contract or promise will override the exclusion clause because it is the
very thing that induces the injured party to contract. For example, the promise to you
by a parking attendant to park and lock your vehicle when an exclusion clause on the ticket
stated `all care and responsibility by the car park' could be viewed as a collateral promise
or contract that would be meaningless if the exclusion clause was allowed to prevail. The
parking attendant's statement that the car would be locked as soon as it was moved was
the very thing that induced you to enter into the contract. This was really a case about
principal and agent, and the ability of an agent to bind their principal. While the attendant's
promise was not within his actual authority, it was within his ostensible authority - that is,
the principal had, either by words or conduct, led a third party to reasonably believe that the
agent had authority to contract on the principal's behalf when this in fact was not the case
(we will cover this in more detail in Chapter 14).

Just note that a collateral contract is a contract in its own right and separate from
the main contract. This means that if for some reason the main contract is illegal and
unenforceable, the collateral contract maystill be enforced. A collateral contract may also be
enforced if the main contract is one that is required to be in writing or evidenced in writing
and the collateral contract is not.
243 | CONSTRUCTION OF THE CONTRACT: TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                   Reflection questions

     Time to take a break. Have look at the questions below and see what you think.
         1. Once a collateral contract is established, what does the plaintiff need to show for it
             to be valid and enforceable?
         2. Does a collateral contract or promise override an exclusion clause?

     PROBLEM 1
     FACTS: You entered into a contract with the defendants for the purchase of a boat. During
     the course of negotiations, you sought the written advice of the defendants as to what
     would be a suitable engine for the boat. They commented on three types and
     recommended one in a letter that included the statement that the boat would have an
     estimated speed of 23 knots. You accepted this recommendation, but the contract
     specification and quotation contained no reference to speed. After the motor was fitted,
     the boat failed to reach the speed estimated by the defendants and you wanted to reject
     the contract.
     ISSUE: Was the recommendation of the speed of the boat important?
     DECISION: What do you think? Which of the following three hints below do you pick and
     why?
     HINT: You have three things to consider here:

           You could have made the attainment of speed a condition in the contract, but you
             didn't.

           You could have made the defendants promise that the boat was capable of
             achieving 23 km/h, but you didn't. The statement must be promissory, not
             representational, if it is to be actionable.

           You could have used your own judgment based on what the defendants had said,
             which is what you did, and that statement was not promissory.

     PROBLEM 2
     FACTS: You leased a cinema which you decided to sublease to Cineplex for a period of 4
                                                               CONSTRUCTION OF THE CONTRACT: TERMS AND CONDITIONS | 244

     years. The written sublease contained a proviso that you could terminate the agreement
     at any time by giving 4 weeks' notice in writing to Cineplex. After 2 years you decided to
     terminate the sublease, which was before the end of the 4 year term. Cineplex then
     claimed damages for breach of a verbal promise given by you, before the sublease was
     signed, that you would terminate the lease only if you had been served with a similar
     notice by the head lessor which you hadn't been.

     ISSUE: Can you terminate the sublease? Can you terminate the sublease when the head
     lessor has not served you with a similar notice?

     DECISION: What do you think?

     COMMENT: In this case an assurance was given about how a particular clause was to
     operate. By reneging on the promise, are our actions unconscionable?

How important is the term?

When you enter into a contract you need to understand that a contract can contain both
express and implied terms:

   Express terms are terms that are incorporated into the contract in writing, orally,
      partly written and partly oral, or by a sign displaying the terms (such as at a car park).
      If the contract is important, better to have the terms in writing.

   Implied terms are incorporated into a contract by implication and intended to give
      effect to the presumed intentions of the parties when a contract's express terms have
      not fully covered the matter (see `What are implied terms' further down).

It is also important that that you can recognise the different type of terms, and identify
whether they are a condition, warranty, an innominate term, a condition precedent or
condition subsequent, as well as statutory consumer guarantees that form part of a contract.
The remedies available to the injured party differ according to the type of term you are
dealing with.

What is a condition in a contract?

A condition is a term that is vital to the contract. The parties consider it so important that
its non-performance may be considered by the injured party as amounting to substantial
failure to honour the contract at all and may be regarded as grounds for terminating
the contract (but note that any obligations still outstanding at the date of termination
continue)and/or suing for damages.

What is a warranty?

The parties consider a warranty to be a term of lesser importanceto the main purpose of
                                                              CONSTRUCTION OF THE CONTRACT: TERMS AND CONDITIONS | 246

the contract. If it is breached, injured parties must still perform their part of the contract, but
they only have the right to sue for damagesfor any loss that they may suffer as a result of
the breach.

How do you tell the difference between a condition and a
warranty?

Whether a term is a condition or a warranty depends on the intention of the parties,
looking at the contract as a whole. A problem is that the parties rarely indicate whether
a term is a condition or a warranty, or something else. And even if they do, there is no
guarantee that the courts will accept what they say.

In some cases, a party may expressly provide that a particular promise is essential to the
contract - for example, by a stipulation that it is the basis or the essence of the contract.
However, in the absence of an express provision the question is one of construction for
the court, once the terms of contract have been ascertained. In trying to decide on the
importance of a term, the courts may:

   look at what effect the breach had on the contract - if the breach has had a serious
      effect, it could be treated as a condition; or

   apply an objective test, looking at the case as a whole and considering the
      importance of the broken stipulation as an inducement to the plaintiff to enter into the
      contract. Is the stipulation essential to the contract? If the answer is `yes', then it is
      a condition and if `no', then it is a warranty.

                     Business tip
       Parties who wish to have a degree of certainty that a breach of a particular term will
       terminate an agreement should spell out the effect of such breach in their agreement,
       and the court will then give effect to their intention. If the parties rely on expressions
       such as `condition' and `warranty', whether a term is a condition, a warranty or an
       innominate term will ultimately depend on how the courts interpret the term.

Note it can be difficult in determining whether a term is a condition or a warranty. In each
case, the court looks at the contract as a whole and considers whether the promise was
247 | CONSTRUCTION OF THE CONTRACT: TERMS AND CONDITIONS

so important to the promisee that they would not have entered into the contract unless
there had been an assurance of a strict or substantial performance of the promise, and this
was apparent to the person making the promise at the time. If the breach does not have
a serious effect on the contract, then it will be treated by the courts as a warranty and the
injured party will be entitled only to damages.

What are intermediate or innominate terms?

It may happen that a term cannot be classified as a condition or a warranty until after a
breach of contract has occurred. The courts have identified a further class of terms that
fall between conditions and warranties called intermediate or innominate terms.

Here the court focuses on how serious the effects of the breachare on the contract,
rather than attempting to classify the term as a condition or a warranty. The question to
consider here is whether the breach has deprived the innocent party of substantially the
whole benefitthat they should have derived from the contract?

Labelling a term as a condition or warranty does not necessarily determine its legal effect.
In an English case called Hong Kong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd
[1962] 2 QB 26, Hong Kong Fir owned a ship, which it chartered to Kawasaki for 2 years.
The contract required Hong Kong Fir to provide a vessel, but Kawasaki forgot to include a
term in the contract providing the ship should be seaworthy. When the ship arrived, it was
unseaworthy and took 15 weeks to get it ready to sail, depriving Kawasaki of a substantial
part of the benefit of the contract. The court held that Kawasaki could not repudiate the
contract, as seaworthiness had not been included as a condition of the contract. Nor were
the delays - 15 weeks of a 2 year contract for service - considered so great as to frustrate
the commercial purpose of the charter. The defendant should have sought damages.

As Hong Kong Fir Shipping illustrates,nothing less than a serious breach entitles the
innocent party to treat the contract as at an end.

What is a condition precedent?

There are two possible meanings that can be given to the term condition precedent:

   As a condition precedent to the formation or existence of a contract - for
      example, acceptance `subject to finance' or, `subject to the approval of a third party'.
      In this case, unless and until the condition is fulfilled - that is, the finance or approval
      are forthcoming, there are no enforceable rights between the parties.

   Was the term a condition precedent to the performance of a party's obligations
      under a contract? For example, was there an obligation on the buyer not only to do all
                                                               CONSTRUCTION OF THE CONTRACT: TERMS AND CONDITIONS | 248

      that was reasonably necessary to fulfil the condition but also to complete within a
      reasonable time?

Non-fulfilment entitles the party not in breach to terminate. For example, in the case of
a sale of a property, you will often find the potential buyer including in the contract a term
stating that the sale is subject to the buyer completing the sale of their existing property or
getting finance approval in a reasonable time. In this case there is a binding contract, but
performance depends on the fulfilment of the condition precedent.

What is a condition subsequent?

A condition subsequent is a term in a contract that must be complied with after the
contract is made or the other party can terminate the contract for non-compliance - for
example, the death of one of the parties, or the seller of a vehicle tells the buyer that if they
are not completely satisfied to return the car in 30 days and get their money back.

What are implied terms?

In addition to its express terms, a contract may contain a number of terms that the parties
or the courts may `read' into the contract. These are called `implied terms' and to be implied
into a contract, the term must satisfy 5 conditionsset down by the Privy Council in BP
Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v President, Councillors and Ratepayers of the Shire of
Hastings (1978) 52 ALJR 20:

   reasonable and equitable; and
   necessary to give business efficacy to the contract, so that no term will be implied if

      the contract is effective without it; and
   so obvious that `it goes without saying'; and

   not in contradiction of any express term of the contract.

Can terms be implied by trade custom or usage?

Where there is no express provision to the contrary in a contract, and the trade custom or
usage relied on is so well known by everyone in that business they would have assumed
it to have been included as a term in the contract, then it may be implied by the courts by
considering:

   Whether there is the existence of a custom or usage - a question of fact.
   Evidence that everyone in the trade would reasonably be assumed to have imported

      that term into the contract.
   A term will not be implied on the basis of custom if there is an express term to the

      contrary; and
   That the term is of such notoriety in the trade that it was reasonable to assume that all

      persons dealing in the trade could easily ascertain knowledge of the custom.

Can terms be implied by statute?

A number of statutes imply terms into a contract. When considering the operation of such
terms, it is necessary to consider to what extent the parties may be able to modify or
exclude them. For example, look at the Fairness of Transactions Act 1993 and the Goods
Act 1951.
                                                              CONSTRUCTION OF THE CONTRACT: TERMS AND CONDITIONS | 250

When will the courts imply terms?

In some cases, the intention of the parties is plain but, owing to an oversight on the part
of the parties, the contract may not give effect to what the parties wanted or understood.
Where this occurs, the judge may imply terms into the contract in order to overcome this
omission and give effect to the intention of the parties - to give `business efficacy' to the
contract.

What happens where the terms are uncertain or unclear?

If there have already been dealings between the parties, or there are expert witnesses who
can give evidence to fill in missing pieces in the contract in order to interpret the parties'
intentions, the courts maybe prepared to enforce the contract. For example, if there have
been prior dealings between the parties, and the fact that reference could be made to what
was normal business practice, the contract may be enforceable as the courts accept that
there is sufficient intention present to bind the parties.

If there are no past dealings and no expert witnesses to assist the court in trying to
determine the intention of the parties, the court will have little alternative but to strike the
contract down as void for lack of certainty.

The court will imply a term by reference to the imputed intention of the parties only if it
can be seen that such a term is necessary for the reasonable or effective operation of
the contract. Otherwise, it will strike down `the contract' on the basis that there is no real
agreement between the parties.

What are meaningless terms?

Unlike an uncertain term, where there is no real agreement, with a meaningless term the
parties have agreed on something but it is unclear what it means. The difficulty is
that the terms may be worded in such a way that a reasonable person would be unable
to determine their meaning. In such a case, the validity of the contract will depend on
whether these terms can be severed from the rest of the contract and still leave it
valid. This is a matter of the construction of the whole contract.

If the courts cannot sever the term from the contract, then the contract will be found to be
void for uncertainty. However, it should be noted that if goods or services have already been
provided, the law of restitution provides that they must be paid for at a reasonable price.

                     Business tip
       Guide to construing the words of a contract
       When construing the words of a contract, regard should be had to the following
       principles:

             The meaning of the word/s is to be determined in the context of the contract as
                a whole

             With the interpretation of commercial contracts, a common-sense approach
                should be adopted

             It is presumed that the parties did not intend the terms of their contract to
                operate in an unreasonable way

             In determining the meaning of words, consider the legal effect of the term

What happens if the terms are ambiguous?

In the case of an ambiguous term that could have two primary meanings, each of which
could be adopted without distortion of the language, it does not necessarily mean the
contract is void for uncertainty. The court will pay regard to direct evidence of the intentions
of the parties, including evidence of the circumstances surrounding the making of the
contract and the admission of extrinsic evidence to resolve an ambiguity.
The extrinsic (including parol) evidence supplements or explains the written instrument
and may include direct evidence of the intention of the parties, including evidence of
negotiations between the parties, previous dealing between them, and direct evidence as
to what was in their minds at the time.

     Time for a break. Before you do, scribble down your thoughts to the questions below.

         1. Explain why it is important to know what type of term/s are contained in a contract?
         2. How do the courts decide on the importance of a term?
         3. What is the difference between a condition precedent and a condition subsequent

             in a contract? Explain, giving an example of each.
     PROBLEM 1
     FACTS: Poussard was engaged to play a leading role in an opera which was to last about
     three months. Owing to delays on the part of the composer, final rehearsals did not take
     place until the week when the first performance was to take place. In the final few days
     before the first performance, Poussard fell seriously ill and it was not clear how long she
     might be sick for. A substitute singer had to be found or the show faced financial ruin.
     Poussard was unable to take part in the show until a week after the season had
     commenced. The producers, who had been forced to find a substitute, then refused her
     services.

     ISSUE: Was Poussard's failure to attend the opening night sufficiently serious to entitle the
     producers to sack her? Was this a breach of condition or a warranty?

     DECISION: Would you sack her?
     HINT: Do you think the failure on Poussard's part to perform on the opening night went to
     the root of the contract and permitted the producers to fire her.
     PROBLEM 2

     FACTS: Bettini, an experienced opera singer, entered into a contract with Gye to sing in his
     opera. As part of the agreement, he agreed to arrive 6 days before the start of the opera
     for rehearsals two days in advance. Gye attempted to use the non-attendance as an
     excuse to terminate the contract.

     ISSUE: Was the late arrival a sufficiently serious event to warrant terminating the contract?
     Again, was it a breach of a condition or a warranty?

     DECISION: What would your answer be here? The same as question 4 above?
     HINT:The effect on the contract was only partial.

What are exclusion clauses orterms?

It is not unusual in business to find a party attempting to limit or exclude their liability in
253 | CONSTRUCTION OF THE CONTRACT: TERMS AND CONDITIONS

certain situations by including an exception, exemption or exclusion clause(also known
as a `limitation of liability' clause) in the contract. Such clauses are frequently found in
`standard form' contracts.These are contracts that incorporate terms of a standard nature,
often in fairly wide terms, applicable to all persons making a particular type of contract - for
example, when making a booking contract with an airline, a bus company or the railway for
a holiday, or parking your car in a car park. Their purpose is to limit the liability of the
person inserting the clause.

It is a matter of some practical importance to know whether or not these terms or clauses
form part of the contract. If they do, they bind the person entering into the contract, even if
that person does not understand the terms or has not even read them.

At common law, a party is bound to exercise reasonable care over the person or property
of another that has been entrusted to them under a contract. Failure to exercise reasonable
care may leave the entrusted person open to a claim for damages, and it is this type of
action that an exemption clause seeks to prevent. Its purpose is to relieve one of the
contracting parties from liability that they would otherwise have.

The courts look at exclusion clauses very critically. Often the parties are in unequal
bargaining positions, and this is particularly the case where consumers are concerned.
There is often very little opportunity for a consumer to negotiate the terms or to read (or
understand) the `fine print' on the document they receive or sign.

In the case of commercial contracts, the courts are more likely to assume that the parties
were in equal bargaining positions and able to seek legal assistance. However, in either
case theeffectiveness of an exclusion clause is a matter of construction of the
contract as a whole, taking into account the bargaining position of the parties.

In addition to the position at common law, consideration also needs to be given to the
impact that the Fairness of Transactions Act 1993 may have on the inclusion of exclusion
terms in consumer contracts, given its emphasis on fairness in ss 1 and 4.

What is the legal position where there is a signed document?

It has to be established at the outset that the particular document relied on as containing the
exclusion clause, which is often a ticket or receipt, is an essential part of the contractand
not a mere acknowledgment of payment for a contract already made.

If the document is found to be an integral part of the contract, much then depends on
whether or not it was signed by the acceptor. If you have to sign a document, do you read it
carefully before you sign it? Let's say you buy a washing machine from Graucob. You have
                                                               CONSTRUCTION OF THE CONTRACT: TERMS AND CONDITIONS | 254

it delivered and you are now running late for work, so you sign a document headed `Sales
Agreement' without first reading it. It contained the following clause:

      `This agreement contains all the terms and conditions under which I agree to purchase
      the machine specified above, and any express or implied condition, statement or warranty,
      statutory or otherwise, not stated herein is hereby excluded...'

When the machine failed to work properly, you brought an action against Graucob. As there
was no fraud or misrepresentation, at common law you are bound, irrespective of whether
you had read the document or not. You might have statutory remedies under the Goods Act
1951 and the Fairness of Transactions Act 1993 but what a pity you didn't read the Sales
Agreement first.

Just remember that a party signing a document knowing that it might have
contractual terms is generally bound by those terms, whether they have read the
document or not. It is worth noting, however, that this type of exclusion clause today may
contravene s 4 of the Fairness of Transactions Act 1993.

What if there is evidence of fraud or misrepresentation?

If fraud or misrepresentation can be established, the person signing will not be bound. If you
are asked to sign a receipt, always ask `what is the purpose of me signing this document?'
In a consumer transaction it will often be intended to exempt the seller from liability in which
case you had better hope that the Fairness of Transactions Act 1993 can help.

What if is there is no evidence of fraud or misrepresentation?

If you sign a document containing an exclusion clause you maynot be bound if you had
reasonable grounds for believing that the document was not contractual. In the case of
contractual documents that contain onerous terms, if such terms are to be effective then
they must be brought to your notice if you are the party against whom they are to be
enforced. This must be done before or at the time the contract is created.

However, where there is no disparity in knowledge or bargaining power, and no
misrepresentation, fraud or duress, yoursignature is a very strong indication of intention
to be bound because of the importance the court places on you signing a document. It is
difficult to argue unfairness to trigger the Fairness of Transactions Act 1993.

What happens with unsigned documents?

Where the document is unsigned, the question is whether you, if you are the `customer',
knew of and consented to the exclusion clause. If they did not, would a reasonable
255 | CONSTRUCTION OF THE CONTRACT: TERMS AND CONDITIONS

person have regarded the document as one that would contain contractual terms and not
represent a mere receipt or acknowledgment?

Have reasonable steps been taken to give sufficient notice of the
term?

Where the document is neither a receipt nor an acknowledgment - for example, tickets for
rail, sea or air journeys - should the customer have constructive notice of onerous clauses
in the document? Has the defendant taken reasonable steps to give sufficient notice
of the term to this class of persons? This is a question of factin each case.

                   Reflection questions

     Time for another break. Before you do, have a read of these 2 questions and see whether
     you think the exclusion clause is effective. It could be you one day dropping off your
     laptop or going on cruise.

         1. FACTS: You left your laptop with Browne Computer Services for repairs to the hard
             drive. When you came to collect the laptop, you noticed the screen was cracked.
             You claimed damages for breach of contract, and the business relied on provisions
             printed on a docket, handed to you when you left the laptop, which read: `No
             responsibility is accepted for loss or damage to laptops through any cause
             whatsoever'.
             ISSUES: What would be reasonably understood as being the purpose of the
             docket? Did Browne Computing make you aware that the docket might contain
             conditions?
             DECISION: What do you think? Would your answer be any different if you had to
             sign the docket?
             HINT: In this case, would you have a remedy under the Fairness of Transactions Act
             1993?

         2. FACTS: The Baltic Shipping Company owned the cruise ship Mikhail

             Lermontovwhich, eight days into her cruise, sank in New Zealand waters due to the
             negligence of the pilot. As a result of the ship sinking, you lost all your luggage and
             suffered personal injury. The booking form had stated that the contract for carriage
             for travel would be made at the time of the issuing of tickets. Some six weeks after
             payment for the cruise and two weeks before departure, a ticket containing
             conditions limiting the defendant's liability for loss of baggage or personal injury was
             issued to you.
             ISSUE: Could the shipping company rely on the limitation clause in the ticket to limit
             their liability?
             DECISION: What do you think?
             HINT: Was there a total failure of consideration? Why is that important? And what
             was the object of the voyage?

                     Business tip
       If the condition is particularly onerous or unusual, and one that would not be generally
       known to the customer, the party seeking to enforce the condition mustshow that it
       had been fairly and reasonably brought to the customer's attention - for example, by
       displaying a large sign in a prominent position or by marking the condition in red on a
       contract.

As a general rule, a party will be bound by displayed terms if they have either
knowledge or reasonable notice of the terms, regardless of whether they have read
them or not. If you go to park your car in a car park and you get a ticket from the machine,
do you read the ticket or do you just check the time on it? Should the car park give
reasonable notice that a ticket contains an exclusion clause? What is reasonable notice?
Printing the clause in red ink with a red hand pointing to it?
If there are unusual conditions, these must be brought to the customer's notice or
they may be struck down as being unconscionable.A good example is an unreasonable
clause.
257 | CONSTRUCTION OF THE CONTRACT: TERMS AND CONDITIONS

             Business tip

Where onerous or unusual terms form part of the contract, special notice should be
drawn to them. It is not sufficient to incorporate an onerous condition on a delivery note
without first discussing with, or drawing to the attention of, the customer the fact that a
heavy penalty will be imposed for a breach of the term. The crucial test is whether
reasonable notice of the term has been given on or before the contract was
created.

Where the contract has been made, any subsequent introduction of an exclusion clause will
be ineffective and the exclusion clause will not operate as the termsmust be introduced
while the contract is being formed so that theother contracting party has the opportunity of
accepting or rejecting them.

   contract.                                       clause will not operate.
 Interpretation according to the express
   agreement. the effectiveness of an
   exclusion clause is purely a question of
   construction of the contract as a whole in
   each case. Is the term or clause wide enough
   to exclude an action for the alleged breach?

What is the position with commercial contracts?

Commercial contracts may be allowed to stand because of the equality of bargaining
positions that can exist between the parties (although the presumption of equality
of bargaining positions in commercial contracts is a rule of construction based on the
presumed intention of the contracting parties in each case).

How are indemnity clauses and guarantees dealt with?

They are to be construed strictly in the context of the contract as a whole. If the indemnity
clause or guarantee contains any ambiguity, it will be construed in favour of the party
providing the indemnity.

              Reflection questions

Take another break. Before you do, have a read of these three problem questions and see
whether you think the exclusion clause is effective. Each one is based on an actual case.
PROBLEM
FACTS: Visiting Sydney, you decide to take a ferry from Circular Quay to Manly. The ferry
company operated a service between Circular Quay and Manly in Sydney. Entry to the
ferry is through a set of turnstiles, operated by payment by cash (K7) or card at a vending
machine next to the turnstiles at Circular Quay. Above the turnstiles was a sign stating: `A
fare of K7 must be paid on entering or leaving the wharf. No exception will be made to this
rule whether the passenger has travelled by ferry or not'. You paid K7 to gain admission and,
259 | CONSTRUCTION OF THE CONTRACT: TERMS AND CONDITIONS

     finding that you had just missed the ferry, attempted to leave without paying another K7.
     You were stopped and forced to pay by the attendants.

    ISSUE: As this is your first time to Sydney, could knowledge of the terms and
    conditions of travel be implied? Would your answer be different if you had used
    the service on a number of occasions while in Sydney?

     DECISION: What do you think?
     PROBELM
     FACTS: You hired a bike from John Warwick & Co. The contract contained a clause stating:
     `Nothing in this agreement shall render the owners liable for any personal injury to the riders
     of the machines hired'. The bike was supplied with a defective seat, which caused you to
     fall off and injure yourself. You sued John Warwick in contract for breach of warranty on
     the basis that the bike was not fit for the purpose for which it was hired, and in tort for
     negligence in supplying a defective bicycle.

     ISSUE: Did the exemption clause operate to protect the defendants in both contract and
     negligence? If the clause had read: `Nothing in this agreement shall render the owners
     liable for any personal injury to the riders in negligence or contract of the machines hired',
     would that make any difference to your answer?

     DECISION: What do you think?

     NOTE: In this case you could argue John Warwick owed concurrent duties in contract and
     tort (negligence) to you. Read the exemption clause carefully and think about what it
     covers.
     PROBLEM
     FACTS: Before you parked your car at Eazi Car Park, you were issued with a ticket that
     contained on the back of it the following clause: `Eazi Car Park the Council does not accept
     any responsibility for the loss or damage to any vehicle . . . however such loss . . . may arise or
     be caused'. It also stated: `This ticket must be presented for time stamping and payment
     before taking delivery of the car'.
     A car park attendant allowed a thief to driveaway in your car after the thief claimed that he
     had lost his original ticket and presented another ticket on which was written a different
     registration number from that of your car. You sued for breach of contract and in the tort of
     detinue (this is a common law action available to a person claiming either the return of the
     goods wrongfully kept by another or their value).

     ISSUE: Was the car park attendant, in allowing a thief to take the car, acting outside the
     terms of the contract so that the exclusion clause didn't operate?
                                                              CONSTRUCTION OF THE CONTRACT: TERMS AND CONDITIONS | 260

     DECISION: What do you think?
     HINT: The validity of the exclusion clause is a matter of construction. Exactly what were
     the terms of the contract.
     NOTE: This was actually a bailment case where the bailee (Eazi Car Park) was seeking to
     rely on an exclusion clause

Can you delete unreasonable terms?

Where the court is faced with a wholly unreasonable term, the position of the common law
appears to be that the court has no power to delete that term. Sections 4 and 5 of the
Fairness of Transactions Act 1993 attempt to remedy what was an unsatisfactory common
law situation by enabling a court to review an unfair contract.

                     Business tip
       A precisely drafted exclusion clause in a business contract may protect a party relying
       on it as long as it can be shown on a proper construction of the contract that the
       parties intended not to be liable on the happening of the events envisaged in the
       contract. But note that the clause generally will not operate:

             if there is any deviation from the contract
             if the conduct of the party relying on the clause falls outside the scope of their

                obligations under the contract
             if it is an unfair term of a consumer or small-business contract and caught by s 4

                of the Fairness of Transactions Act 1993.

What is the standing of third parties?

Third parties will be protected because they are not a party to the contract unless it is clear
in the contract that they are to be covered.
261 | CONSTRUCTION OF THE CONTRACT: TERMS AND CONDITIONS

A third-party exemption clause (known as a `Himalaya clause', from the name of a ship)
can provide protection to a third party who is not a party to the contractand is widely
used in transportation contracts. For example:

      `The company will not be responsible for and shall be exempt from all liability in respect of
      any injury to the person of any passenger'.

For a third party to gain the protection of an exclusion clause (remember that a third party
is not a party to the contract), they must satisfy the 4 conditions:

   the contract makes it clear that it was intended to benefit third parties; and
   it was clear that the defendant was contracting for itself and third parties; and
   the defendant had the authority of the third party to make the contract on their behalf -

      as this is an agency relationship, ratification can take place after the contract has
      been made; and
   consideration has moved from the third party - the performance of an existing duty is
      good consideration if it is owed to a third party.

                   Reflection questions

     Take a break and have a look at these 3 questions and think about how you would answer
     them.

         1. Explain the operation of the contra proferentem rule. Is such a rule defensible today?
         2. In order for a party to rely on an exclusion clause, what must they show?
         3. In the case of a signed contract, can the party signing limit their liability in both

             contract and tort?

        Key points

An understanding of the following points will help you to better revise material in this
chapter.
                                                           CONSTRUCTION OF THE CONTRACT: TERMS AND CONDITIONS | 262

 What is the difference between a representation and a term?A representationis a
   statement of fact, made by one party before or at the time of the making the contract,
   which leads the other party to enter into the contract. The representation is pre-
   contractual and does notform part of the contract, and isnot intended to be legally
   binding. Thus, they are not actionable in contract law.
       A term, on the other hand, is a statement of fact that is intended to be legally
         binding and is part of the contract.

 What is the importance of a collateral contract?Where a pre-contractual statement
   is not a term of the main contract, it may still have contractual effect as a collateral
   contract, thus providing the injured party with a remedy. Such a contract has an
   independent existence from the main contract and may be enforced by an action for
   breach of a promise. More importantly, the collateral contract is not caught by the
   parol evidence rule because it is oral.

 What types of terms are found in a contract?Terms found in a contract will either
   be express or implied. An express term is either oral or written, while implied terms
   are those terms `read' into the contract by the parties or the courts.

 What is the difference between a conditions warranty and innominate term?A
   condition is a term that is essential to the contract, breach of which allows the injured
   party to rescind or seek damages (or both). A warranty is a term of lesser importance
   and allows the injured party only to recover damages. An innominate term is an
   intermediate term that falls between a condition and a warranty and may allow the
   injured party to terminate the contract.

 When are terms implied into a contract, and what is their effect? Five conditions must
   be satisfied for a term to be implied into a contract:
       the term must be reasonable and equitable
       necessary to give business efficacy to the contract - that is, produce the result
         that the parties intended, so that no term will be implied if the contract is effective
         without it
       so obvious that `it goes without saying'
       capable of clear expression; and
       not in contradiction of any express term of the contract. Note: Implied terms are
         intended to give business efficacy to the contract and may be implied from
         custom or usage, by statute, previous dealings or by the courts.

 What is an exclusion clause, and what is its effect on a contract? An exclusion
   clause, also known as an `exemption clause', `exception clause' or `limitation of liability
   clause', attempts to limit or exclude the liability of the person inserting it. In the case of
   signed documents, unless fraud or misrepresentation can be established or there is
   statutory protection available, the signor is bound. In the case of unsigned documents,
   would a reasonable person have expected to find such a clause in that type of
   document? Have reasonable steps been taken to give sufficient notice of the term
263 | CONSTRUCTION OF THE CONTRACT: TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      and, if not, can they be implied by trade usage or custom trade? If the clause has
      been properly incorporated into the contract, the courts will construe the clause contra
      proferentem (strictly against the party relying on it). Generally, a third party is not
      protected by an exemption clause unless there is express intention by the contracting
      parties to cover third parties. If an exemption clause excludes liability for all terms in a
      contract, there is nothing left in the contract and it will be struck down by the courts.

        Introduction

Well done. This is the last chapter on Contract Law. You now know what is involved in
creating a contract, how to determine its validity, and what are the terms of the contract that
the parties have agreed to. However, this is not quite the end of the story. It is not unusual
for one of the parties to want to assign their rights or obligations under the contract to a third
party. Also, under what circumstances can a contract be ended? And what remedies are
available to an innocent party if the other party breaches the contract?

In this chapter we will begin by looking first at the position of third parties and how they can
acquire rights and incur liabilities under a contract before moving on to the circumstances
under which the obligations of the parties to a contract can be discharged or dissolved,
including the issue of breach and remedies at common law and equity. We finish with a brief
overview of ethical considerations in contract law.

Section 1: Privity of contract

A basic rule of contract law is that only the parties to a contract can:

   acquire rights under it, and
   incur obligations under it (the doctrine of privity of contract).
267 | DISCHARGE AND BREACH OF CONTRACT

The doctrine of privity only applies to contractual rights and obligations for the immediate
parties to the contract. A point to remember about contracts is that they are considered
to be private arrangements between the parties (the offeror and the offeree) and that the
arrangements that they have made only affect them.

Other people who are not parties to the contract, that is, third parties or strangers, cannot
acquire any rights or incur any liabilities under the `contract'. Remember that the basis of a
contract is the `bargain' that the parties have struck between themselves, where each party
has bargained for or given something in return for the promise or performance of the other
party. However, this may produce unfortunate consequences for a person who was not a
party to the contract, but for whom the contract was intended to benefit.

While no right of action in a contract exists against a person who is not a party to a contract,
a third party who induces a breach of contract may find that they have committed a tort
called inducement of breach of contract (an economic tort).

What is an assignment?

The term `assignment' in contract law is a term frequently used by contracting parties in
commercial contracts where there is a transfer of rights, obligations, or property from one
party (the `assignor') to a third party (the `assignee' who was not a party to the original
agreement). For the assignment to be enforceable, the original parties to the agreement
must consent to the assignment.

The effect of assignment is that the assignor is no longer entitled to any benefits under the
original agreement because they have all been passed to the assignee but check that there
is not a negative clause that restricts the original parties' rights to assign.

Common examples where you might encounter an assignment is in an asset sale where a
corporation might sell part or all of its company, where a contractor subcontracts their work,
or a borrower offers as security to a lender an interest in their assets.

Can you assign rights?

As we noted above, generally, only the persons who are parties to a contract can acquire
rights and incur liabilities under it: Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v Selfridge & Co Ltd
[19156] AC 847. Strictly speaking, it is not possible at common law for a third party
to overcome the doctrine of privity. However, there are some exceptions to the privity
rule including agency, assignment and novation, rights held on trust for a third party,
leases, estoppel, and unjust enrichment. Equity,on the other hand,permits the assignment
                                                                                              DISCHARGE AND BREACH OF CONTRACT | 268

of contractual rights, including debts. An equitable remedy is not available if the contract
requires the performance of a personal service.

Can you assign liabilities?

Generally, a party who has contracted to perform obligations (liabilities) under a contract
cannot transfer those obligations to another. The promisee cannot be forced to accept
performance or a promise of performance from any person other than the promisor.

However, if the parties to the contract consent, liability may be transferred by way of
`novation'. Generally, an assignor who has contracted to perform obligations (liabilities)
under a contract cannot transfer those obligations to another unless the non-transferring
party and the potential assignee agree. The parties should then enter into a novation
agreement (which is a new contract between the non-transferring party and the assignee).

Section 2: What are the different methods of discharge of
a contract?

What amounts to performance?

Performance is how most commercial contracts are discharged. A party's duty under
a contract is to discharge their obligations, or their promises, in full, that is, by total
performance. Once they have done that, they are excused from further performance under
the contract.

Performance may be:

   actual performance: where the promises by the parties under the contract have been
      properly performed. This rule is strictly interpreted at common law. If the variation is
      only minimal or trivial, then generally the courts will not worry about it. But each case
      is determined on its facts, and in each case, the question to ask is whether there has
      been a substantial departure from the contract. In the English case of Re Moore & Co
      Ltd and Landauer & Co [1921] 2 KB 519 an order was placed for canned fruit in cases
      of 30 tins but when the goods arrived, the correct quantity of tins arrived but they were
      packed 24 tins per case. The buyer was entitled to reject the order as the packaging
      method was an essential part of the contract description.

Does the decision in Re Moore & Co Ltd and Landauer & Cosound trivial? In this case,
think about the storage costs and the profit margin. If cases containing 24 tins take up more
269 | DISCHARGE AND BREACH OF CONTRACT

storage room doesn't that add to the buyer's costs? And if the profit margin is small, the
extra storage space could turn a profit into a loss.

   partial performance: where there has been a partial performance, payment does not
      automatically follow unless:
          the contract is divisible, that is, capable of being divided into separate parts which
            is a question of construction
          there has been a free and willing acceptance by the party receiving the benefit
          that there has been substantial performance, and
          the actions by the non-performing party prevent performance - for example, in
            building contracts where work and payment are done in stages.

If the contract is divisible, that is, it can be divided into parts which is atypical of many
building contracts, it may be possible for the builder to seek payment for the work already
done (called a quantum meruitclaim or `what the person deserves'). This is based on an
implied promise to pay a reasonable sum for work done.

If the contract is not divisible, that is, it is entire and cannot be divided into parts,
entitlement to payment only happens upon completion of the task. The reason is that the
consideration for the right to demand payment is based on the promise to complete the
work. In this type of case, where there is still an express contract in force to pay the full
amount, a quantum meruit claim will fail because the express promise takes precedence
over the implied promise to pay a reasonable sum for work completed.

What if there is a free and willing acceptance of partial performance by the party receiving
the benefit? In this case, the parties are agreeing to abandon their original agreement and
substitute a new agreement. This is based on the partial performance of the original contract
and the payment of a lesser amount than would have been due under that contract. But
note, if the party accepting the changed circumstances has no option but to accept, then
there is no free and willing agreement and therefore no acceptance of partial performance.

If one party is preventedfrom carrying out their part of the contract, the other party may
regard the contract as at an end. But the party being prevented from performing will be
released from any further obligations and can repudiate the contract, and/or claim damages
for breach. If work has commenced under the contract but has not been completed, they
may claim on a quantum meruit.

If the breach is minor, so that the cost of rectification is small when compared with the
contract price, the doctrine of substantial performancemay still permit the defaulting
party to obtain the contract price. This is a question of factand can be assessed by
considering the nature of the defects and the difference between the cost of rectification and
                                                                                              DISCHARGE AND BREACH OF CONTRACT | 270

the contract price, the benefits obtained by the owner, whether the work is entirely different
from that contracted for, and whether the contractor has abandoned the job.

In an ordinarylump sum contract, unless there is a clause in the contract to the contrary, a
party cannot refuse to pay the full amount because there are defects in the work performed.
In this case, the innocent party must pay the contract price less a deduction for the costs of
rectification through a set-off or counterclaim.

   Performance and delivery of goods: If one party to a contract offers to perform their
      obligations under the contract and the other party refuses to accept the offer, the
      person offering the service will be discharged from further performance and the
      contract dissolved, provided that the attempted performance was exactly following the
      terms of the contract.

   Performance and the payment of money: where a contract is to be completed by
      the payment of money, it is necessary that the payment be made correctly. This may
      be by way of absolute discharge, that is, payment to the right person, at the right
      place, at the right time, and by legal tender (which includes a bill of exchange,
      promissory note, cheque, payment order, or online), as absolute satisfaction of the
      debt (payment in full). Payment should be made at the creditor's normal place of
      business and during business hours.

Where payment is by cheque (this is a conditional discharge), the debtor will not receive
an absolute discharge unless the creditor has asked for payment by cheque. A cheque is
a conditional payment. The bank must honour the cheque before the creditor can get their
money. If the creditor didn't ask to be paid by cheque and the cheque is dishonoured, then
the creditor can sue on the contract or the cheque.

If payment is made by post, then you need to ascertain whether the post office was an agent
for the creditor, or the debtor should the cheque get lost. If the creditor requests payment
by post, the post office is the agent of the creditor and if the letter is lost in transit, that is
the creditor's problem. If the creditor has not asked for payment to be made by post and the
letter gets lost, then it is the debtor's problem.

What is termination?

This is a self-help remedy available to an innocent party and is used if there has been a
repudiation of the contract by the other party.
271 | DISCHARGE AND BREACH OF CONTRACT

What is mutual agreement?

Here both parties abandon their original agreement while there is still something to be done.
There are several ways this could take place including:

   alteration is where the parties agree to change the terms of the contract.
   merger is where two companies come together and operate as a single legal entity,

      combining their assets and liabilities.
   novation is where a new contract is created between the non-transferring party and

      the assignee without changing the obligations agreed to in the original contract. The
      assignor agrees to forgo any rights afforded to them in the original contract.
   remission occurs when one party voluntarily agrees to accept a lesser amount or
      lesser performance of the promise made by the other party - for example, when a
      creditor agrees to accept less than the full amount they are owed (perhaps to avoid
      going to court).
   rescission is a discretionary remedy in equity used by the courts when they have
      determined that a reason for one of the parties entering into the contract was unfair.
      This could be due to mistake, misrepresentation, duress, or error by the other
      contracting party.

What is repudiation?

Repudiation is where one party to a contract decides to terminate the contract because they
no longer wish to carry out their obligations. This often takes place before the repudiating
party has breached their obligations. This then leaves the other party with the choice of
ending the contract (what is known as an anticipatory breach) or continuing and waiting for
the repudiating party to fail to carry out their obligations and be in breach of the contract.

What is release?

This is similar to waiver (see below) but here, one party has performed their obligations but
the other hasn't. Such a release amounts to a unilateral discharge of the contract and will
not be effective unless it is:

   under seal (often referred to as a deed of release); or
   supported by further consideration by the party who is yet to complete their

      obligations; or
   subject to the principle of promissory estoppel (which was covered in Chapter 7).

If a third party offers a smaller sum in the discharge of the whole debt, and the creditor
                                                                                              DISCHARGE AND BREACH OF CONTRACT | 272

accepts it, the creditor can't then maintain an action for the balance from the debtor because
they are bound by the agreement with the third party when they accept the smaller amount
in discharge of the whole debt. It would be a fraud on the third party to proceed for the
balance owed by the debtor.

How does waiver differ from release?

A waiver of contract occurs when one of the parties to the contract deliberately gives up
their rights and leads the other party to reasonably believe that while strict performance can
still technically be demanded, it will not be strictly insisted on. To constitute a waiver, the
action of the party giving up their rights must be intentional, voluntary, and depend on what
is outlined in the contract.

What is accord and satisfaction?

When one party has performed their obligations under a contract and the other has not, the
defaulting party can be relieved of their obligations in return for doing something different
from what they were bound to do originally (the `accord' refers to the new agreementand
the `satisfaction' to the considerationfor it which will be the performance of the new terms
according to the agreement). You will often find an accord and satisfaction occurring in debt
negotiations.

What is a substituted agreement?

This applies where the parties wish to continue with their contractual relationship but on
different terms. What can be done by the parties with one agreement can be undone by
them with another agreement (novation). Interestingly, the new agreement need not be in
the same form as the old one, and a written contract, including a deed, can be discharged
or varied orally, but make sure that the intention to rescind the original contract is clear.

What is the operation of law?

Here the contract is terminated independently of the wishes of the parties, for example, by
bankruptcy, or the death or injury of either party if it is a contract for personal services.

When is time important?

An offer cannot remain open indefinitely and in most commercial contracts there will be
a time stipulated, or the offer will only remain open for a reasonable time. The length of
273 | DISCHARGE AND BREACH OF CONTRACT

time depends on the type of contract - for example, are the goods perishable and what is
reasonable will be determined by the reasonable person or industry practice.

What is the difference between a condition precedent and a
condition subsequent?

A condition subsequent (or a `reversal clause') is a term often found in commercial and
property agreements or contracts that allow a party to terminate the agreement or contract
at any time in the future, even where there may be no fault by the other party. It is a term
that is often found in leases and loan agreements, for example, the lender reserves the right
to terminate the loan agreement and demand repayment in full if the borrower fails to make
their agreed repayments on the loan on time on prescribed in the contract. Just note that
in the case of a condition subsequent, the contract is in existence but if the condition is not
met, then the contract is void. The onus is on the defendant to demonstrate that conditions
subsequent were met.

A condition precedent is a term in the contract thatmustbe fulfilled before the contract can
come into existence and is used, for example, in real estate dealings to avoid a binding sale
arising without the buyer's express consent during the negotiation process. Two points to
keep in mind where a condition precedent is concerned:

   either party can withdraw from the agreement at any time before the condition
      precedent is fulfilled

   a party that fails to perform the condition precedent is not in breach of contract
      because there is no contract at this stage.

Does breach end a contract?

Where one of the parties does not fulfill their obligations under the contract within the time
required by the contract - for example, by failure to comply with a term of the contract. This
is an actual breach and can be contrasted with an anticipatory breach which is where
one party threatens not to perform. An anticipatory breach entitles the innocent party to
repudiate the contract, sue for breach immediately, and treat the contract as at an end.
It also allows the injured party to mitigate or minimise their loss by making alternative
arrangements.

                   Reflection questions

     Take a break a break, but read these questions first, and think about how you could
     answer them.

         1. If the creditor has not expressly indicated that payment must be by post - for
             example, if the account reads `Payment within 7 days' rather than `Payment within 7
             days by post' - loss of the letter and its contents is borne by the debtor, irrespective
             of what past practice has been unless payment is in another city or a great distance
             away. Explain why.

         2. Where there has been partial performance of a contract, does payment still
             automatically follow for the party in breach? Explain why.

         3. The seller agreed to supply 4500 tonnes of wheat to the buyer. The contract
             allowed a variation of 2% on weight and a further 8% on contract quantity. The seller
             delivered 25 kg more than the maximum allowed under the contract but never
             claimed payment for the surplus. Can the buyer reject the whole cargo solely on the
             ground that the quantity tendered was 25 kg over the contract quantity? Explain.

         4. Hoenig was employed to redecorate and furnish Laura's flat for K1500, to be paid as
             follows: `Terms of payment are net cash, in three instalments of K300 as the work
             proceeded; and balance of K600 on completion'. Laura paid K600 to Hoenig. The
             work was done poorly, and the cost of rectification was K350. Hoenig was not happy.
             Can he recover the balance of K900 from Laura?

What is the doctrine of frustration?

If a party promises to carry out a particular act, the law will hold them to their promise. This
principle is commonly known as the doctrine of absolute liability. Because of the potential
harshness of this doctrine, the doctrine of frustrationwas developed.
If the object or purpose of the contract is no longer attainable owing to something beyond
the control and contemplation of the parties - for example, if you promised to sell your
house to a friend and, unknown to either party, the house burns down making the contract
impossible to perform, would it be unreasonable to hold the parties to the contract as it is no
longer attainable owing to something beyond the control of either party? Just note that the
275 | DISCHARGE AND BREACH OF CONTRACT

event has to be unforeseen and make a radical change to the contract making it impossible
to perform - it can be said to be frustrated. It is probably best to approach the question of
frustration on a case-by-case basis given how uncertain it is.

Note that if a contract has two objectives, one of which becomes non-attainable because of
a frustrating event while the other objective can be attained, the contract is not discharged.

                                                    There are situations where it is not possible to plead
                                                    frustration, and these include:

                                an unforeseen event outside the control of the

                                       contracting parties (a supervening event) has

                                       significantly or radically changed the obligations of

the parties from their original intentions; and

 neither party caused the `supervening event'; and

 neither contemplated nor anticipated the supervening event, so there was no

provision in the contract for it; and

 the new circumstances would make it unjust to hold the parties to their original

contract because the obligations of the parties have become impossible or radically

different to perform.
                                                                                              DISCHARGE AND BREACH OF CONTRACT | 276

As noted above, theeffect of a frustrating event is to discharge a contract immediately,but
only in the future. The contract is not void ab initio, but void only from the time of the
frustrating event. For the period that the contract is valid, any obligations that arise must
be fulfilled.Money paid under the terms of the contract before the frustrating event occurs
(for example, a deposit) cannot be recovered because at the time the money was paid the
contract was valid. You would need to establish a total failure of consideration to be able to
recover the money.

When can the doctrine of frustration apply?

Delays, hardship, fault, foreseeable events and inconvenience cannot frustrate a contract.

Cases that could involve the doctrine of frustration include:

   Physical impossibility because of the destruction of the subject matter -where the
      subject matter of the contract, whether for goods or services, is dependent upon the
      existence of the subject matter, the non-existence of the subject matter after the
      contract is entered into is sufficient to frustrate the contract.

   Physical impossibility under a contract of personal services -if the promisor dies,
      becomes sick, or incapacitated then performance is rendered impossible, and the
      contract is frustrated.

   Change in the law rendering performance impossible,such as the outbreak of war,
      terrorist attacks, or state intervention such as the imposing of an embargo on the
      export of certain goods or services of the parties.

   Impossibility owing to the non-occurrence of an event basic to the contract- where the
      entire basis of the contract is the occurrence of some event that doesn't happen. In
      the English case of Krell v Henry [1903] 2 KB 740 Krell had hired a room specifically
      to watch the coronation of Edward VII. The procession was postponed because of the
      illness of the King and Krell successfully claimed the contract was frustrated by the
      non-occurrence of the event.

       Note that in the case of Krell, the contract only had one objective. But if there are two
       or more objectives, one of which becomes non-attainable because of an unforeseen
       or frustrating event, the contract is not discharged.

   Where the particular state of affairs ceases to exist- if the circumstances upon which
      the contract is based cease to exist or have been substantially changed without the
      fault of either party, making performance radically different from that originally
      contemplated by the parties, the contract can be said to be frustrated.
277 | DISCHARGE AND BREACH OF CONTRACT

What is the effect of frustration on a contract?

The effect of frustration on a contract is to discharge the contract immediately, but only as
to the future. The contract is not void ab initio (void from the beginning) but void only from
the time of the frustrating event and this distinguishes it from a force majeure clause.

For the time that the contract is valid, any obligations that may have arisen must be fulfilled.
Money paid under the terms of the contract, such as a deposit, before the contract is
frustrated cannot be recovered. Why? Because at the time the money was paid, the contract
was valid and if you wish to get your deposit back you are going to have to establish that
there has been a total failure of consideration, and you got nothing under the contract.
Assistance may be available under the Frustrated Contracts Act 1978 (NSW).

Force majeure

A better option for an innocent party than frustration may be to include a force majeure
clause in the contract. This relieves a party from performing their contractual obligations
and possibly being sued for breach of contract where they are unable to perform their
contractual obligations because of an unforeseen and disruptive event that is beyond the
control of one or both parties for the period of the event, includes, for example, COVID-19,
war, `acts of God' such as fires, earthquakes and cyclones.

Unlike frustration, which discharges the contract from the time of the frustrating event,
a force majeureclause suspends the operation of the contract until cessation of the
unforeseen event. The force majeure clause is interpreted objectively based on what a
reasonable person would have understood at the time the contract was made. It can provide
the parties to the contract with an option to suspendthe operation of the contract for the
period of the event or terminate the contract if the event looks as though it is going to be
drawn out.

A force majeure generally requires three conditions to be met if it is to be effective:

   it could have occurred with or without human intervention.
   it could not have been reasonably foreseen by the parties; and
   it could not reasonably have been prevented by the parties because it was completely

      beyond their control.

A problem with a force majeure clause is the need for care in its drafting. The wording must
be precise and clear so that the parties understand what events will trigger the provision
and then what steps you are required to follow. The clause should set out specific details on
                                                                                              DISCHARGE AND BREACH OF CONTRACT | 278

notification (by the affected party), specific details of the event, anticipated length of time,
mitigation, obligations of the parties, and suspension or termination of the contract.

                    Example

     An example of a force majeure clause
     This force majeure clause is from a Property Management Framework Agreement by
     China Southern Airlines Company Limited and China Southern Airlines Group Property
     Management Company Limited in 2017:
     Force Majeure

             1. In the case of failure to perform this Agreement due to any force majeure, neither
             party shall be liable for such failure, and this Agreement shall be terminated
             automatically. In the case of failure to perform any part of this Agreement due to any
             force majeure, the party suffering from such force majeure may be exempted from
             corresponding liability to the extent of the impact of such force majeure. However, such
             party shall continue to perform other obligations under this Agreement which have not
             been affected by such force majeure. If such force majeure occurs after such party
             delays to perform this Agreement, it shall not be exempted from its corresponding
             liabilities.
     Force Majeure may refer to an unforeseeable, unavoidable and unconquered objective
     situation, including but not limited to war, plague, strike, earthquake, flood, etc.
             2. Any party failing to perform this Agreement due to any force majeure shall notice the
             other party within forty-eight (48)hours so as to reduce the possible loss caused to the
             other party and provide the proof of such force majeure within fifteen (15)working days.
             If it fails to perform its such obligations within the required time for rational reasons,
             such required time may be extended according to the actual conditions.'

Fairness of Transactions Act 1993 in Papua New Guinea

Section 4 of the Fairness of Transactions Act 1993 attempts to ensure that no party is
279 | DISCHARGE AND BREACH OF CONTRACT

unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged as the result of entering into a contract (s 4(1)), and
to this end, the court has been given wide powers to ensure an equitable adjustment is
achieved between the parties.

                  Reflection questions

     Take a break and attempt these 2 problems (that are already decided cases):
         1. An English firm agreed to sell and deliver machinery to a Polish company, which
             paid 1000 (approximately K5000) in advance. The English firm commenced work
             on the machine, but because of the outbreak of war and the German occupation of
             Poland, the contract was frustrated. The question of frustration was not in issue; the
             Polish company claimed the right to recover the deposit it had paid before the
             frustrating event. The English firm claimed that it had done a considerable amount
             of work on the machine. What is the effect of frustration in this case?
         2. Imagine you wanted to hold a concert and an express term as to the purpose for
             which the hall you wanted to use was that it was in a fit state for a concert. Unknown
             to the parties the hall burnt down without their knowledge while they were still
             negotiating. A contract was subsequently entered into and both parties at the time
             of entering into a contract believed that the hall still existed. Has the contract been
             frustrated? Explain why or why not.

Section 3: What remedies are available for breach of
contract?

The usual remedy for a breach of contract is an award of damages, which is a common
law remedy. However, if a monetary remedy is not satisfactory, the court mayexercise its
discretion and order any one of several equitable remedies, including restitution, specific
performance, an injunction, quantum meruit,or an Anton Piller order. It should be
remembered that equitable remedies are based on the concept of fairness and are
discretionary.
                                                                                              DISCHARGE AND BREACH OF CONTRACT | 280

What are the steps in determining an award of damages?

Five (5) steps mustbe taken to determine whether the injured party will recover damages:

 Step 1: the onus is on you if you are the injured party (the plaintiff), to first establish
   that there has been a breach by the other party, which may be a breach of:
       condition (sometimes referred to as an `essential term')
       warranty (sometimes referred to as a `non-essential term'); or
       innominate term.

 Step 2: having proved breach, the onus is on you as the plaintiff, to now establish
   causation, that is, that the loss or damage that you suffered was caused by the
   defendant's breach of contract. That is, the loss or damage would not have been
   suffered `but for' the defendant's breach, and is established by reference to
   documents, records, and so on, and as this is a civil case, proved on the balance of
   probabilities.

 Step3:remoteness of damage, that is, losses suffered by you must be a reasonably
   direct consequence of the breach of contract, and this is a question of fact. Losses
   that are too far removed from the wrongful act are regarded as not reasonably
   foreseeable and therefore too remote from the breach to be recoverable.

 Step 4: amount and type of damages, that is, the general principle concerning
   damages is that you as the injured party should be to put you in a position you would
   have been in had the breach never occurred. You mustbe able to show that they have
   suffered some loss if you are to recover ordinary damages. If you can't, then at best
   you may be able to recover nominal damages(a sort of token loss because while there
   has been a breach of contract, the loss you have suffered is minimal). But you also
   need to be careful, because while you may have won the case, the judge may be
   annoyed that you have wasted the court's time and order you to pay the costs of the
   other side which may be much higher than the token award you received).

The courts will allow claims for damages by a plaintiff (assume you are the injured party)
for:

 expectation damages (losses) arising                       Business tip
   from your expectation of prospective        Saving litigation costs:

                                        amount representing the value of any failure to

take reasonable steps to find new employment. The burden of proof is on the

defendant to show that you failed to mitigate your losses, and this is a question of

fact.

 Whether there is a need to mitigate is a question of law. Thus, if a person such as

       yourself is wrongfully dismissed from your job, you must take reasonable steps to

       find other employment.

                     Business tip

       Minimise the loss:

       Whether it be anticipatory or actual breach, as the injured party, you should take
       immediate steps to minimise the loss or face the prospect of having the court reduce
       the amount of damages that you can recover.

What types of damages are available to you if you are an injured
plaintiff?

Once it has been established that you are as the plaintiff entitled to compensation, it will
have to be determined what type of damages you will be awarded. This means looking at
two issues:

   the seriousness of the breach; and
   whether the contract has specified the amount of damages to be paid in the event of a

      breach.

Nominal damages are awarded where the court feels that your legal rights have been
infringed, but you have suffered no actual loss. The court may therefore decide to award
you a token amount.
Ordinary damages (as they are typically called) are the usual remedy in contract law. This is
the amount awarded by the court on its assessment of the loss suffered by you as a result
of the breach. They are a means of compensation for you and can take two forms:

   general damages: in contract they follow as a general consequence from the breach
      and include the difference between contract and market prices for the goods or
      services or the value of goods delivered and services carried out and as warranted.

   special damages: are asked for in addition to general damages. If they are to be
      claimed, they must be specially proved in court - for example, loss of profits that
      result from the failure of the seller to deliver goods to a buyer.

Exemplary damages are generally notawarded in contract (although they may be awarded
283 | DISCHARGE AND BREACH OF CONTRACT

in tort) unless the court feels that it should punish the party in default, for example, where
the breach of contract has resulted in inconvenience, disappointment, or discomfort to you
(the innocent party), such as cases involving holiday packages where, for example, the
facilities or accommodation have been misrepresented by the travel agent or the person
they represent. Here, the courts have been prepared to award what are termed `aggravated
damages for non-pecuniary losses'.

What is the difference between liquidated damages, unliquidated
damages andpenalty?

In brief

Liquidated and unliquidated damages and penalty

TYPE          DESCRIPTION
Liquidated    Fixed amount. Must be a genuine or reasonable pre-estimate of actual loss flowing
Unliquidated  from the breach or, the court may treat it as a penalty and then there will be no
Penalty       remedy.
              Left to the court to determine. Not fixed in the contract as the loss cannot be
              accurately determined.
              A clause, intended to deter, penalise or threaten a party, which is out of proportion
              with the loss that could be suffered from a breach.

              Reflection questions

Time for a break and, a good time for you to check on how you are doing by reflecting on
these questions
                                                                                              DISCHARGE AND BREACH OF CONTRACT | 284

         1. Why do the courts refuse to enforce penalty clauses in contracts?
         2. Explain the difference between liquidated and unliquidated damages and a penalty.
         3. Explain why an injured party to a contract should have to mitigate their loss.
         4. Joad Tyres sold car covers and other motor accessories to Casey under a contract

             which provided that Casey would not sell any of the items below certain listed
             prices. In the event of breach of the agreement, Casey agreed to pay K50 in
             liquidated damages for every item it sold below the listed price. Casey
             subsequently sold a tyre below the listed price and was sued by Joad Tyres. Would
             you classify the sum as a penalty or liquidated damages? Explain why.
         5. You arranged a 2-week holiday in Switzerland through a brochure from Swans Tours.
             The brochure claimed the accommodation was close to the ski fields, its owner
             spoke English, and there would be a welcome party on arrival and a farewell party
             on departure at the bar. However, few of the statements proved to be correct and
             the trip turned into a disaster. What would you do?
         6. The defendant leased a racehorse to you for 3 years. After 6 months, the defendant
             took the horse back. As part of the damages claim for breach of contract, you sued
             for loss of potential prize money and profits that you would have made from betting
             on the horse. Do you think you would succeed in your claim? Why?

Equitable remedies

In addition to the common law remedies mentioned above, there are a number of equitable
remedies available to address breach of contract. These are remedies awarded at the
court's discretion (called discretionary remedies) and include:

   Rescission: it is a remedy that the court grants if it orders that the transaction be set
      aside. The court has a discretion whether to grant it or not. It may be sought on
      grounds including undue influence, unconscientious bargains, innocent
      misrepresentation, and mistake.

   Specific performance: an order directing a person to carry out their obligations under
      the contract and is only ordered when damages are not an adequate remedy, and it is
      just and equitable to do so under the circumstances. It is not usually awarded in
      contracts that require personal services for another party because of problems with
      supervision.

   Rectification: a court order altering or amending a written contract where the parties
      have used words that do not express their intention.

   Injunction: a court order restraining a party from breaking their contract or from
285 | DISCHARGE AND BREACH OF CONTRACT

      committing a wrongful act. It will not be awarded if damages are an adequate remedy.
      Interestingly, an injunction is often used to enforce contracts of personal services by
      enforcing a negative promise - for example, employment contracts that contain a
      restraint of trade clause in them.
   Anton Piller order: an order that is available only where it can be shown that the
      defendant has incriminating evidence that is necessary to the plaintiff's case and
      which may be destroyed before `discovery' can be made.
   Quantum meruit (`as much as the person has earned'): an equitable claim for
      restitution for the unjust enrichment of the defendant and means, and often used by
      contractors. Essentially, it is an action for payment of the reasonable value of services
      performed.

The contract may be discharged by breach, but where the contract is for goods or services
there is a new implied contractimposed by law on the party taking the benefit that they will
pay a reasonable amount for the quantum or portion given. It is not available to the party in
breach.

When an innocent party chooses to sue on the quantum meruit, and the claim is assessed
only based on work done, the party is obliged to:

   prove the value of the work
   show that the work was completed with proper skill; and
   show that it was completed within a reasonable time.

The amount recovered depends on whether the contract price is divided between stages or
on completion. If you as the plaintiff only partially fulfill your obligations under the contract
and payment is made based on the completion of each stage, then there will not be a total
failure of consideration and quantum meruit is usually only available to recover payment for
what you have done. For the incomplete stages, there will be a total failure of consideration.

What is the importance of the Statute of Limitations?

As an injured party, you must remember you only have a certain period of time to bring your
action. To prevent the possibility of civil actions remaining open indefinitely, the Frauds and
Limitation Act 1988 determines the time limit within which you must commence your action
for breach of contract. You have 6 years commencing on the date which the cause of action
arose (s 16(1)).
                                                                                              DISCHARGE AND BREACH OF CONTRACT | 286

                   Reflection questions

     Take a look at these questions to assess your progress. Plus, the good news is that you
     are almost finished the Contracts section.

         1. Explain under what circumstances a quantum meruit claim would arise.
         2. Henrietta engaged a firm of solicitors to obtain an injunction to prevent a former

             friend from visiting her and making a nuisance of himself. An unqualified litigation
             clerk was given the matter to handle, but his incompetence created further
             embarrassment for Henrietta. Does Henrietta have any claim against the firm for
             `mental distress and upset'?
         3. Josef, a well-known film actor, entered into a contract with Frre Bros for a period of
             5 years, where he agreed to give his services exclusively to them and not act in films
             for any other company during this period. During the first year of the agreement,
             Josef entered into a contract to star in a film being made by Pretty Pictures. Do Frre
             Bros have any remedy? Explain why.

Section 4: Is there a place for ethics in contract law?

Before we leave contract law, it is worth reflecting on those aspects which contain an ethical
element. We can see that the common law of contract provides strict rules relating to the
creation and construction of contracts but, at the same time, there are areas of contract
law that allow remedies to people where a strict interpretation of those legal rules would be
unfair.
We saw that, in a limited way, contract law allows people who may not truly understand
the terms and nature of the contract they have entered into, to be released from that
contract. So, people under the age of 18 have rights to avoid their legal obligations in
certain circumstances. And people who have been affected by drugs or alcohol or have
an intellectual impairment, and where the other party sought to take advantage of their
situation, also have rights to avoid their legal obligations.
We can see too that contract law will consider the circumstances in which a contract has
been entered into to see if there was equality between the parties and that there was
287 | DISCHARGE AND BREACH OF CONTRACT

a fair bargain created by a contract. The law recognises where one weaker party may
have been threatened with actual or possible physical or verbal violence, or where the
relationship between the parties may have been such that one has a powerful influence over
the other. Contracts created under these circumstances may be cancelled. Then there can
be the extreme situation where the behaviour of one party is so bad that the law allows the
more vulnerable party to be excused from an unreasonable contract. In many jurisdictions,
including Papua New Guinea, there is legislation which will consider the essential fairness
of a contract.

The equitable remedies of specific performance and rectification are further examples
where the law will try to `right' what might be an injustice where a party to a contract is not
standing by his or her side of the bargain.

All of these factors are areas where we would say that there is an overlap between law and
ethics; where the law is looking beyond what appears to be legal from documents or on a
strict application of the common law, to see what the right and ethical outcome should be.

So, when considering legal problems in this subject, as well as identifying and applying
relevant legal principles, we should also examine these to question their underlying fairness
and whether their application will provide an ethical outcome.

       Key points

An understanding of the following points will help you revise material in this chapter.

   What is the doctrine of privity of contract? Under the doctrine of privity, only a
      party to the contract gains rights and incurs liabilities under it. Obligations cannot be
      transferred to a third party unless all of the parties agree (novation).

   What circumstances permit rights and obligations under a contract to be
      transferred? At common law, assignment of rights is not possible. However,
      assignment of rights is possible under equity where the intention of the parties is
      clear, by statute and by operation of law.

   What are the methods by which a contract is ended?
          By termination.A self-help remedy used by an innocent party if there has been a
            repudiation of the contract by the other party.
          By performance.Where the promises made by the parties under an agreement
            have been properly performed by the parties - that is, completely and precisely
            performed - the contract is said to be discharged by performance. Note that there
                                                                                          DISCHARGE AND BREACH OF CONTRACT | 288

         are exceptions to the rule of precise performance - for example, where the
         contract is divisible, where there has been acceptance of partial performance,
         where performance is prevented by the other party, and where there has been
         substantial performance.
       By agreement.The original agreement can be cancelled by mutual discharge,
         release (or abandonment), waiver, substituted agreement, accord and
         satisfaction, or failure of a condition precedent or condition subsequent.
       By frustration. Performance of the contract may become impossible because of
         the occurrence of something over which the parties have no control.
       By operation of law. A contract may be terminated by operation of law, including
         bankruptcy, material alteration, merger, death of either party (if it is a contract for
         personal services), or within the time specified by relevant state and territory
         statutes of limitation legislation.
       By lapse of time at common law. A contract doesn't remain open indefinitely
         but will remain open for a reasonable time.
       By virtue of a term in the contract. These terms may have the effect of either
         preventing the contract from coming into force (condition precedent) or bringing
         the contract to an end on the occurrence of a certain event (condition
         subsequent).
       By breach. Where a party fails to perform their obligations as agreed, they are in
         breach. This may be actual breach, where there has been a failure to perform at
         the time required by the contract, or anticipatory breach, where there is a
         threatened failure to perform at the time required by the contract.
 What is the doctrine of frustration, and what are its effects on a
   contract?Performance of the contract may become impossible because of the
   occurrence of something over which the parties have no control. As a result, the
   parties are discharged from further performance as regards future liability.
 What is force majeureand why might it be a better option for a party than
   frustration? A force majeure clause relieves a party from performing their contractual
   obligations where they are unable to do so because of an unforeseen and disruptive
   event beyond the control of either party. Unlike frustration, which discharges the
   contract from the time of the frustrating event, a force majeureclause suspends the
   operation of the contract until cessation of the unforeseen event, leaving the parties to
   terminate if they should so desire.
 What are the remedies for breach of contract?The main remedies for breach of
   contract include the common law remedies of rescission, restitution and damages,
   and, in equity, specific performance, injunction (including a Mareva injunction), an
   Anton Piller order and quantum meruit.
 What remedies are available to an injured party at common law?The normal
   remedy at common law is damages. However, two other more limited remedies are
289 | DISCHARGE AND BREACH OF CONTRACT

      rescission, where the injured party can set aside the contract for breach of
      condition, and restitution, which is based on the concept of unjust enrichment. These
      remedies are also available in equity.
   On what principles are damages decided? For an innocent party to recover
      damages it must be established by them that there has been a breach of contract that
      has resulted in them suffering an amount of losses reasonably related to the contract,
      and that they have taken immediate steps to try to minimise the loss.
   What are the types of damages? Damages may be classified as nominal (where no
      actual loss is suffered by the plaintiff), ordinary or `real' (where the innocent party has
      suffered an assessable loss - and which may take the form of general damages,
      following as a general consequence from the breach or special damages that have
      been specially proven in court), or exemplary (where the court feels that it is
      necessary to punish the party in default, although these are very rare).
   In which situations may an equitable remedy be used? An equitable remedy,
      which is discretionary, may be used where monetary compensation is not an
      adequate remedy for the innocent party. Contracts of personal service aside, the
      innocent party may wish to compel performance of the contract because the subject
      matter is unique (specific performance), or they may wish to restrain a party from
      breaking their contract (an injunction). If the innocent party believes that the defendant
      is going to remove or dispose of assets in the jurisdiction before the court can decide,
      they may seek a Mareva injunction to prevent that from happening. Similarly, if the
      innocent party believes that the defendant has incriminating evidence in their
      possession that supports their case and they believe that the defendant will destroy it,
      they may seek an Anton Piller order. Where there has been part performance of a
      contract involving goods or services, the party not in breach may be able to recover a
      reasonable amount from the party receiving the benefit (quantum meruit).

             Summary

       Congratulations, you have made it through the large volume of material that makes up
       contract law. You have progressed from learning how to make a contract, how to
       check that it is valid, what it is that you and the other party to a contract have agreed
       upon, and now assessed what happens at the end of a contract: You then finished with

looking at the remedies available to the innocent party for breach and we concluded
with a brief overview of some of the ethical considerations involved in contract law.

What's next?

In the next, and last 2 chapters, we will look at something related to contract law,
contracts for the sale of consumer goods and services, and agency. A basic
understanding of both topics is very useful for you, not only when you go into business
but in your personal lives as well.

        Introduction

At last, you have nearly reached the end. Consumer Law, which is the second last chapter
of this unit, has a connection with Contract Law and is an important topic in business and
commerce, as well as to you as a consumer. Consumer protection laws in PNG at the
time of writing are under review. Current consumer legislation is focused on the Goods Act
1951, the Independent Consumer and Competition Commission Act 2002, the latter having
a focus on industry regulation but it does provide some protection to consumers with regard
to the price, quality, and reliability of goods and services, the Fairness of Transactions Act
1993, the Packaging Act 1974 and the Commercial Advertisement (Protection of the Public)
Act 1976. The future may see the introduction of specific aspects of Australian Consumer
                                                                                                                    CONSUMER PROTECTION | 294

Law and we shall make brief reference to specific aspects of the Australian Consumer
Law at the end of this chapter to provide a sense of what may be the future of consumer
protection.

Consumer protection

This chapter deals with particular types of contracts - contracts for the sale and supply
of goods and services. As we noted in previous Chapters, the common law has always
recognised inequalities that can occur in contractual relationships because of factors such
as misrepresentations, unequal bargaining power, and unconscionable conduct. However,
the remedies available to the innocent party were often limited (for example, rescission,
damages) and were applied by the courts with caution, so as not to threaten the general
principle of freedom to contract.

This principle was epitomised in the Latin phrasecaveat emptor(`let the buyer beware'),
which may have been adequate in its time, but the situation is different today, with advances
in transport and technology providing suppliers of goods and services with almost unlimited
markets. Supermarkets carry thousands of mass-produced items, many of which are
packaged in sealed containers with little or no chance of pre-purchase inspection by
the buyer. Advertising is increasingly used as a means of informing (or in some cases
misleading) potential customers about the attributes of the goods or services that they are
urged to buy.

Over time, consumers and governments have become more concerned with the imbalances
between the bargaining power of suppliers and consumers. During the last 50 years,
countries around the world have been introducing legislation aimed at prescribing minimum
quality standards and increasing protection for consumers like us.

It is worth noting that the PNG Government commissioned a Consumer and Competition
Review (completed in 2017) which appears to be based on the Australian Consumer Law,
so we will spend a short time looking at specific aspects of that as at some point in the future
it may form the basis of new PNG consumer laws as the current Independent Consumer
and Competition Commission Act 2002needs updating when you compare it with what the
Australian federal government has done with the introduction of the Australian Consumer
Law. And, to ensure that businesses comply with the legislation, the fines for a breach of
the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth), which includes the Australian Consumer
Law as Schedule 2, were increased in 2022 from A$10 million to A$50 million per breach
for a body corporate, and forindividuals it is A$2.5 million (now take a deep breath and
work out what that is in PNG Kina when A$1 = K2.59 at the time of writing).
295 | CONSUMER PROTECTION

What are the current consumer protection laws in PNG?

Like most countries, PNG has recognised that consumers need protection in entering into
certain types of contracts and has enacted legislation to provide an easier basis to bring
actions, rather than having to rely on common law principles, and the Goods Act 1951 as
an early form of consumer protection.

The current consumer protection laws in PNG include:

   the Goods Act 1951, but note it's application is limited to goods, not services
   the Independent Consumer and Competition Commission Act, 2002 , administered by

      the Independent Consumer and Competition Commission (note that the Independent
      Consumer and Competition Commission Act 2002 only provides limited protection to
      consumers, mainly in relation to consumer product safety)
   the Packaging Act 1974
   Commercial Advertisement (Protection of the Public) Act 1976, and
   the Fairness of Transactions Act 1993 which offers some protection to a consumer
      with its emphasis on the overall fairness of any transaction so that `no person suffers
      unduly because he is economically weaker than, or is otherwise disadvantaged in
      relation to, another person.' But it is also limited in what it can do to protect the
      consumer.

Part 1: The Goods Act 1951

We will review the Goods Act 1951 but it will not be in great deal. Hopefully, it will give you
an overview of what it does and the protection it offers you as a consumer.

The underlying principle of the Goods Act 1951 is that contracts for the sale of goods have
certain terms in common that do not need to be expressly stated every time a contract for
sale is entered into to protect the consumer. Implied terms are terms that are not expressly
stated in a contract but which the law implies are included in the contract - for example,
when we are buying something, we presume that the seller owns the goods and has a right
to sell them, that they are of merchantable quality (that is, they are saleable) and fit for
purpose.

We will begin considering the formation of the contract, what terms are implied by the
Goods Act 1951, the distinction between propertyand possession, the different
classifications of goods, the rules to determine when property passes, the effect of transfer
of title by a non-owner, the duties of the seller and the buyer, and the remedies for breach.
We will then look at the duties of the buyer and the seller to complete a contract for the sale
of goods, and the remedies that are available to the parties if there is a breach.
                                                                                                                    CONSUMER PROTECTION | 296

The Goods Act 1951 is an example of the application of all the principles that we looked at
in the previous chapters on the creation and validity of a contract.

What are the requirements for the                        In brief
formation of the contract?

For the Goods Act 1951 to apply to a transaction,
there are some things you need to know first. These
include:

   what exactly are we buying - goods and/or            What is the difference
      services? Note it only applies to goods.           between the words `property'

What are `goods'?

Goods are broadly defined to include all chattels personal other than things (or choses) in
action such as a personal property right such as a car, boat or furniture, and money (s 1(1)).
This generally includes only physical and movable things. It doesn't include:

 land or things attached to land (although it does include timber and growing crops
   that are to be harvested before sale or under the contract of sale)

 choses in action or rights, for example, debts, negotiable instruments, shares or
297 | CONSUMER PROTECTION

      patents that can be sold but that are not goods (`choses in action'); or
   services, such as work and labour, or repairs.

What is the price paid for the goods?

The price paid for the goods is the money consideration. If no money is present, there can
be no sale of goods contract; there is either a barter or exchange.

What is the importance of transfer of ownership?

There must be transfer of ownership (what in law is called `property' or `title') in the goods
if the transaction is to be caught by the Goods Act 1951. The importance of transfer of
ownership is that risk of loss of the goods goes with the person who has the ownership in
the goods. If you go and buy something; you get ownership (the property in the goods) and
possession...and the risk of loss or damage to the goods becomes your responsibility.

Is the contract a contract for sale of goods or for work and materials?

Once it has been determined that a transaction falls under the Goods Act 1951, it is
necessary to be able to decide whether a contract is for the sale of goods (where the Goods
Act 1951 will apply) or for work and materials or repair (where Goods Act 1951 will not apply
and the buyer will have to rely on contract law).

Here problems can arise because a large number of contracts involve both an element
of service and an element of goods - for example, the supply and fitting of an oil heater,
washing machine or air-conditioner, or the service on a car. What is the main purpose of
the agreement? Is it to transferownership of goods? If it is, it is a contract for the sale of
goods.

                                The definition of a `contract for the sale of goods'
                                includes two types of contracts:
   a sale of goods, where ownership (or                             CONSUMER PROTECTION | 298

There are no special formalities to be observed.
The normal rules of contract law apply and the
contract may be in any form--oral, written, partly oral and partly in writing, or implied from
conduct (s 5(1)). Just note though that if the goods are of any value to you, and this can
either be in price or sentimental value, put the contract in writing because if something goes
wrong with the contract, you have written evidence to support your claim.

A contract for the sale of goods to the value of K20 or upwards is unenforceable unless you,
as the buyer:

 accepts part or all of the goods and has received them; or
 has paid a deposit or given something in part payment of the price - for example, the

   trade-in of a car on another car; or
 there is a written note or memorandum of the contract signed by the party to be

   charged or their agent showing:
       the names of the parties
       the identity of the subject matter
       the price and terms of payment if they have been agreed on, and
       the signature of the party to be charged or their authorised agent.

The note or memorandum need not be contained in one document but may be contained in
a series of documents, provided that they can be read together to satisfy Goods Act 1951.
Furthermore, they may be obtained after the sale has taken place.

                   Reflection question

     Take a break for a couple of minutes and test your understanding of what you have just
     read.

     PROBLEM:
     The plaintiff verbally agreed to paint the defendant's portrait for K1500. In a dispute over
     payment, the defendant argued that it was a contract for the sale of goods and was
     unenforceable because it had not complied with a statutory procedural requirement. Did
     the painting of the portrait involve the supply of goods or skill and labour?

     Just as a matter of interest, if you think the contract is not a contract for the sale of goods,
     does that mean it is not a contract at all and therefore no rights are created? And what
     would you say if one of the parties died? Explain why.

What are the terms of the contract?

The implied terms found in the Goods Act 1951 are framed as conditions or warranties
and, as noted above, where business-to-business contracts are concerned, they may be
excluded by the parties to the contract. However, this is subject to the usual rules of
common law relating to exclusion clauses and s 4 of the Fairness of Transaction Act
1993. Remember when we looked at exclusion clauses in Chapter 11, if the document
was unsigned, would a reasonable person have regarded the document as one that would
contain contractual terms? And even if sufficient notice has been given of the term, did it
cover the breach?

Is the term a condition or warranty?

Where it is possible to discover, by inspection, the quality and condition of the goods and
their fitness for a particular purpose, at common law the buyer may lose any legal rights
that may have existed against the seller if the goods are not satisfactory providing each
party is negotiating on equal terms and so the maxim `caveat emptor' (let the buyer beware)
prevails. Buyers have only themselves to blame if they fail to make a careful inspection
                                                                                                                    CONSUMER PROTECTION | 300

of the goods before they purchase them. The reason we say `may' is because s 4 of the
Fairness of Transactions Act 1993 may apply.

Under the Goods Act 1951, it should be noted that where a contract of sale is subject to a
condition to be fulfilled by the seller, the buyer can waive the condition, or treat the condition
as a breach of warranty which will then mean the contract cannot be repudiated (s 12(1)). If
a contract is not severable and the buyer has the goods or part of the goods, or the contract
is for specific goodsand the property has passed to the buyer, the breach of a condition can
only be treated as a breach of warranty and the goods cannot be rejected (s 12(4)).

However, while the idea of caveat emptor is to encourage buyers to take care, there are
circumstances in which the application of the common law rule would prove unjust. Two
examples would be:

   when there is no reasonable opportunity for inspection (for example, goods packaged
      in containers, tins, or wrapping); and

   when the buyer must rely on the special knowledge or expert judgment of the seller.

As a result, where the buyer is at a disadvantage, theGoods Act 1951 implies several terms
into contracts as either conditions or warranties.

Whether or not a term in a contract is a condition or a warranty depends in each case on
the construction of the contract.A term may be a condition, even though it is referred to as
a warranty and vice versa in the contract by the parties.

What are the terms implied in the Goods Act 1951?

In a contract for the sale of goods, unless a different intention appears from the terms
of the contract, for example, a clause excluding the operation of the Goods Act 1951 under
s 12, the following terms, which are exceptions to the caveat emptor rule (let the buyer
beware), are implied into consumer and non-consumer contracts for the sale of goods.

       From this point on, we are assuming that `you' means the buyer.

What does the term `title' mean? (s 13)

There is an implied condition in both the case of a sale and an agreement to sell that the
seller has a right to sell the goods. But note that there is only an implied warranty if you are
301 | CONSUMER PROTECTION

the buyer that you will have and enjoy quiet possession of the goods, and that the goods
are free from any charge or encumbrance in favour of any third party not declared or made
known to you before or at the time when the contract was made.

What is a sale by description? (s 14)

There is an implied condition that goods sold by description will correspond with that
description, and, if the sale is by sample and description, the bulk of the goods must
correspond with both requirements.

What does fitness for purpose (s 15(2(a)) and of merchantable quality (s 15(2)(b))
mean?

There is no implied condition or warranty as to the quality or fitness for a particular purpose
unless you make known to the seller:

   the particular purpose for which the goods are required and can show that you relied
      on the seller's skill or judgment, and they are goods that the seller normally sells.
      Then there is an implied condition that the goods are reasonably fit for that purpose (s
      15(2)(a)), and

   where the goods are bought by description from a seller who deals in goods of that
      description (whether or not he is the manufacturer), there is an implied condition that
      they will be of merchantable quality (s 15(2)(b)).

Two further points to note. First, if the goods are bought under a patent or trade name, there
is no implied condition (s 15(3)). Second, if the buyer has examined the goods, again there
is no implied condition if there were defects that the examination should have revealed (s
15(4)).

What is a sale by sample? (s 16)

In the case of a contract of sale by sample, where there is an express or implied term in the
contract, Goods Act 1951 implies three conditions:

   that the bulk will correspond with the sample in quality
   that the buyer will have a reasonable opportunity to compare the bulk with the sample,

      and
   that the goods will be free from any defect, rendering them unmerchantable, which

      would not be apparent on any reasonable examination and would cause the goods
      not to be of acceptable quality.
                                                                                                                    CONSUMER PROTECTION | 302

Can you exclude the implied conditions and warranties? (s 55)

The implied conditions and warranties may be excluded by the parties under the Goods Act
1951 by express agreement, or while dealing with the parties, or usage if the usage binds
both parties.

Why is the distinction between property and possession important in
business?

Many people assume that if a person has possession of goods,that person must also be
the owner. But this is a presumption and is based on appearance and one that can lead to
serious problems for an unwary buyer such as yourself.

There is a vast difference between the meaning of the terms `property in' and `possession
of' goods:

   `Property in goods' means the same thing as `ownership' or `title' and is a legal
      relationship. It means you have the legal right to control and use the goods however
      you want. But remember that getting `property' in the goods also means that
      riskpasses to you when the contract is made. If you have the property in the goods
      and they get damaged or destroyed, that's your problem.

   `Possession of goods' refers to thephysical control or custodyof the goods. While
      possession can create a strong presumption of ownership as it gives you immediate
      physical control or occupancy, it does not transfer ownership rights and there is a duty
      on you to take reasonable care of the goods or property while they are in your
      possession.

For example, if you leave your car to be serviced at a garage, ownership or title of the
car remains with you. The garage has possession. A change in possession has occurred
without a change in ownership. But equally, a change in ownership may occur without a
change in possession - for example, where you sell your car to a leasing company and then
lease it back from them.

                     Business tip
303 | CONSUMER PROTECTION

       `Property' and `possession' do not mean the same thing: `property' means ownership,
       while `possession' means control.

When does property pass? (ss 17, 20)

Under the Goods Act 1951, provision is made for determining when property in goods is
transferred to the buyer in the absence of intention by the parties. Unless the buyer has
agreed to bear the risk, the general rule is that any damage or loss suffered to the goods
before property passes to you as the buyer is borne by the seller (s 20).
There are no problems where the goods are sold over the counter, but when delivery is
to take place at a later date, and the goods are damaged before delivery, it would often
be difficult, in the absence of rules, to determine who should bear the loss. Even when
the property has passed to you as the buyer, but possession remains with the seller, it
doesn't necessarily follow that the seller must automatically deliver the goods to you unless
credit has been agreed between you and the seller. The seller is entitled to payment before
delivery. However, the fact that you have property in the goods usually means that you
also bear the risk, but the seller may still be liable for lost or damaged goods as a result of
negligence if they are acting as a bailee because they are bound to take reasonable care.

                     Business tip

       When does risk pass?

       Unless the buyer has agreed to bear the risk, the general rule is that any damage or
       loss suffered to the goods before property passes to the buyer is borne by the seller. If
       problems arise, it is usually when delivery is to take place at a later date, and the
       goods are damaged before delivery - who has the risk? An appropriate clause should
       be inserted in the contract between the parties stating who is to bear the risk, and
       appropriate insurance arranged by the party at risk.

What does classification of goods mean?

Goods that are the subject of a contract of sale can be divided into several classifications
under the Goods Act 1951:

 existing
 future
 specific
 unascertained; or
 Ascertained.

Although, it will be apparent that there is an overlap. The distinction is important for
determining when the property, and hence risk, in the goods passes to you as the buyer.

What are existing goods? (s 7(1)(a))

These are goods owned or possessed by the seller at the time of the contract - for example,
a dealer who has for sale and in stock a 2024 white Toyota Prado.

What are future goods? (s 7(1)(b))

These are goods `to be manufactured or acquired by the seller after the making of the
contract for sale' - for example, the purchase of a new Toyota Prado that is yet to be
manufactured by Toyota.

What are specific goods? (s 1)

These are goods identified and agreed on at the time of the contract of sale - for example,
a 2022 white Toyota Prado.

What are unascertained goods? (s 17)

These are goods that are defined by description only. They are not identified when the
contract is made and they may or may not be future goods. Until the goods are ascertained,
it is merely an agreement to sell - for example, a sale by a dealer of a new Toyota
Prado that is yet to be made - until that particular car comes off the assembly line and is
earmarked for you, the car is a future and unascertained good.

How do ascertained goods differ from unascertained goods? (s 18)

These are goods that, in a contract for the sale of unascertained goods, have become
identified and agreed on by the parties. For example, if you order a new white BMW 520i
car and the dealer has a number of that make, model and colour in stock, the goods are
305 | CONSUMER PROTECTION

unascertained until a particular car from that dealer's stock is selected and identified (or
ascertained) to your contract.

When does property pass where the goods are ascertained goods?

When does property pass? (s 18)

   the conduct of the parties,
   the circumstances of the case; and
   the terms of the contract. If it is unconditional and the goods are in a deliverable state,

      property passes to you when the contract is made. But if the seller must do something
      to put the goods in a deliverable state, property doesn't pass to you until the thing is
      done and you have notice of it. If the goods are delivered to you on approval or `on
      sale or return', property passes to you when you signify your approval.

Where property (ownership) has passed, and remember that risk passes with property (s
20), you as the buyer can elect to treat a breach of condition as a breach of warranty and
sue for damages, rather than treating the contract as at an end (s 12(4)). If the intention of
the parties isn't clear, the following rules need to be looked at to determine the time at which
the property in the goods is to pass to you as the buyer. Sections 18(3)(a) to (s 18(3)(d)
deal with contracts for the sale of specific or ascertained goods, while s 18(3)(5) applies to
a contract for the sale of unascertained or future goods by description.

Unconditional contract for specific goods (s 18(3)(a))
Property passes to you as the buyer if the following requirements have been met:

   there is an unconditional contract
   the contract is for the sale of specific goods, and
   the goods are in a deliverable state.

The time of delivery or payment, or both, is immaterial if property and risk have passed.

                     Business tip

       Take care where property, but not possession, has passed to the buyer
                                                                                                                    CONSUMER PROTECTION | 306

       Where there is an unconditional contract for the sale of specific goods in a deliverable
       state, property and risk pass you as the buyer when the contract is made, and the time
       of delivery is immaterial. If the goods are not to be picked up immediately, you should
       take steps to protect against damage to your goods while they are out of your
       possession - for example, with insurance or a clause to the effect that they remain with
       the seller at the seller's risk.

Conditional contract for specific goods (s 18(3)(b))

Where the seller must do something to the specific goods to put them into a deliverable
state, property in the goods doesn't pass until it is done, and you have notice of it. For
example, if you buy a new car but it must be registered by the dealer, the car is not in a
deliverable state until registered.

Contract for specific goods that require pricing (s 18(3)(c))

Where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods ready to be delivered, but the seller
must weigh, measure, test, or do some other thing to the goods to work out the price,
property doesn't pass until this has been done and you have been notified - for example,
where wheat is sold at a certain price per kilogram, and the seller first has to weigh it to
determine the price.

Contract for goods on approval (s 18(3)(d))

Where goods are delivered `on approval' or `on sale or return', property passes to you:

   when you give approval through words or conduct - for example, by using the goods
   when you do any other act adopting the transaction (for example, lending the goods to

      a third party); or
   if you retain the goods for more than the agreed time or beyond a reasonable time.

      This is a question of fact in each case--for example, if you accept goods under an
      agreement of sale or return within 14 days and keep them longer than this, they would
      be considered to have adopted the agreement.

Contract for unascertained or future goods sold by description (s 18(3)(e))

Where there is a contract for the sale of unascertained or future goods by description,
and goods of that description in a state ready for delivery are unconditionally appropriated
307 | CONSUMER PROTECTION

(selected) to the contract by either party with the assent of the other, the property passes
at once to you. Assent can be either express or implied. Once the seller notifies you of an
appropriation, unless you object within a reasonable time the property in the goods, and the
risk, will be deemed to have passed to you.

Why should a business reserve a right of disposal? (s 19)

Where the seller has delivered the goods to you, or a carrier for the purpose of delivery
to you, and the seller doesn't reserve the right of disposal, delivery is an unconditional
appropriation of the goods to the contract.

When the seller reserves the right to retake possession of the goods if certain conditions are
not fulfilled (for example, as to payment), the property in the goods won't pass until those
conditions have been met. In such cases the appropriation is not unconditional.

In an attempt to preserve the property(or ownership) rightsin their goods until they had been
paid for, a seller would often include a reservation of title clausein the contract of sale. This
created an equitable interest or charge in favour of the original seller. If you fail to pay for the
goods, went into receivership, or became insolvent, it could be argued that the seller can
repossess the goods because they still have property and title in the goods. Risk passes to
the buyer upon delivery. These clauses are also called `Romalpa clauses'.

What is the purpose of the Personal Property Securities Act 2011?

The Personal Property Securities Act 2011 covers security interests over personal property
other than land. A security interest is an interest in personal property that in substance
secures payment of a debt or other obligation. In addition to covering standard forms of
security such as chattel mortgages, the definition also covers retention of title clauses in
contracts under which a purchaser has possession of property but does not acquire title
from the vendor until the full purchase price is paid.

Under the Personal Property Securities Act 2011, retention of title suppliers become
secured parties with a security interest, called a `purchase money security interest'. This
type of security interest gives the secured party a superior status over other secured
interests. To take full advantage of the protections offered by the Personal Property
Securities Act 2011, the secured party must register their security interest on the Personal
Property Securities Registry. By registering a security interest, the retention of title supplier
takes priority over all others. Registration also means that the property will not be available
to a trustee in bankruptcy or to a liquidator.

  Preserve ownership rights by a reservation of title clause under the Personal Property
  Security Act 2011.
  It is in the seller's interest to preserve their ownership rights where you as the buyer
  have possession but have not paid in full for the goods. If you default, or go into
  receivership or liquidation, the seller may lose the goods if they haven't used a
  `reservation of title' or `Romalpa' clause to reserve title or legal ownership over the
  goods and registered their interest in the goods with the Personal Property Securities
  Registry. If you default, the seller may be able to get the goods back from an innocent
  third party.

            3. unascertained goods.

    2. Into which classification would the following goods be placed?

            3. a second-hand blue Toyota Camry car.

   3. Explain the purpose of a Romalpa clause in a sale of goods contract. What impact, if
309 | CONSUMER PROTECTION

             any, has the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 (Cth) had on Romalpa clauses?

     PROBLEM:
     A carrier was sent by the buyer, Wardar's (Import and Export), to pick up 600 cartons of
     kidneys that were being held by the seller, Norwood & Sons, in cold storage. The cartons
     were part of a larger consignment held in the cold store. When the carrier arrived at 8 am,
     he discovered the cartons had been stacked on the pavement ready to be loaded. The
     carrier handed over the delivery note and started loading. He didn't turn on his truck's
     refrigeration unit until 10 am. By 11 am some of the cartons had started to defrost. Loading
     was completed at noon. By 1 pm the refrigeration became effective. By the time the buyer
     received the cartons they were unfit for human consumption. He refused to pay for them,
     arguing that they were not of merchantable quality, and the seller counterclaimed for the
     price. Does the buyer have to pay for the kidneys?

What happens if the sale is not by the owner? (s 21)

In some cases, the conduct of the owner may be such that the owner is estopped (or
prevented) from denying the authority of the seller to sell the goods. The owner of the
goods, by their words or conduct, must make a third party believe that another person has
the right to sell the goods--for example, a sale by a car dealer of a car, where the car is in
fact owned by a finance company or you get no better title then the seller had.

What is market overt? (s 23)

Usually, these are markets controlled by municipal councils. Where goods are purchased
in market overt, a buyer acquires a good title provided that the goods are on open display,
and are bought during market hours in good faith, and without any knowledge of the lack of
title of the seller.

What is a sale under a voidable title? (s 22)

If a seller has a voidable title (that is, a title that is valid and binding until and unless it is
repudiated by the true owner) at the time of sale, the buyer acquires a good title:

   provided that the goods were bought in good faith, and
   without notice of the seller's defective title.

The most common situation of this kind is one where the seller has been induced to enter
into an agreement by a misrepresentation, made innocently or fraudulently, by you.
                                                                                                                    CONSUMER PROTECTION | 310

What is the position of a buyer or seller in possession after sale? (s 25)

If a seller continues in possession of the goods or holds the documents of title after a sale,
and then they (or a mercantile agent acting for them) transfer the goods or the documents
of title to a third party, who buys them in good faith and without knowledge of their previous
sale, the second sale is considered good.

Where you, with the seller's consent, are in lawful possession of the goods or the
documents of title after sale of either the goods themselves or the documents of title to the
goods that are still subject to some lien or charge in favour of the seller, you can give a good
title to a third person who receives the goods or documents of title in good faith and without
notice of the rights of the seller.

What is the position with factor or mercantile agents? (ss 61 - 64)

Where a factor or mercantile agent is entrusted with the possession of goods or documents
of title to any goods from a principal for consignment or sale, they will be regarded as the
true owner for the purpose of any sale, pledge, lien or other disposition of the goods they
make in the ordinary course of their business, provided that the consignees:

   act in good faith; and
   are unaware of the limitation placed on the agent.

What are the rights and duties of the parties in performance of the contract?
(ss 27, 29(1))

To complete a contract for the sale of goods (s 27):

   the seller must be ready to deliver or give possession of the goods; and
   you, as the buyer, must be ready to accept and pay for them in accordance with the

      terms of the contract.

Delivery takes place when there is a voluntary transfer of possession from the seller to you
but whether you take possession, or the seller sends the goods to you, depends in each
case on the terms agreed to between the parties. This need not be the physical act of
handing over; it may be symbolic, as in the delivery of a key to the warehouse where the
goods are stored, or in handing over a document of title, such as a bill of lading.

What is the duty of the seller in respect of delivery? (ss 29-37)

The Goods Act 1951 sets out a number of general rules as to delivery (see ss 29 - 37).
These will apply if the contract between the parties doesn't say anything about delivery:
311 | CONSUMER PROTECTION

   Putting the goods into a deliverable state (s 29(7))

The expense of putting the goods into a deliverable state lies on the seller.

   Delivery (s 29(2))

This is usually the seller's place of business. However, in the case of specific goods that the
parties know are in another place at the time of contract, that place is the place of delivery.

   Third parties (s 29(5))

If the goods at the time of sale are in the hands of a third party, there is no effective delivery
until the third party acknowledges to the buyer that the goods are held on the buyer's behalf.

   Time (s 29(4))

If no time is fixed for delivery, the seller is bound to send the goods within a reasonable time.
What is a reasonable time is a question of fact in each case. Thus, it would be expected
that perishable goods would be delivered more quickly than non-perishable goods.

   Quantity (s 30)

It is the duty of the seller to deliver the exact quantity of goods ordered by you. However,
a trifling difference doesn't give you the right to reject the goods, although this is subject to
trade usage, special agreement, and the course of dealing between the parties.

   Instalments (s 31)

You are not bound to accept delivery of goods by instalments, unless you and the seller
have agreed to this. If the agreement is that the instalments are to be paid for separately,
and the seller makes defective deliveries, the seriousness of the breach and the likelihood
of it being repeated must be considered in the context of the contract as a whole when it
comes to termination.

   Delivery to a carrier (ss 32(2), 33)

Unless otherwise authorised by the buyer, any contract a seller makes with a carrier for you
must be in your interest. If the seller doesn't do this, and the goods are lost or damaged in
transit, you may:

   decline to treat the delivery to the carrier as a delivery to you; or
                                       CONSUMER PROTECTION | 312

 hold the seller liable for damages.

If the carrier is the agent of the seller, effective delivery occurs when the goods have been
delivered to you. However, if delivery is to a distant place - for example, another state - the
risk of deterioration of the goods is then with you.

                   Reflection questions

     Take a break and quickly review the 2 questions ahead to see how much you can recall.

         1. The seller agreed to supply 4950 tonnes of wheat to the buyer. On delivery,
             the buyer discovered that it had received only 4895 tonnes, a shortfall of 55 tonnes,
             and so refused to accept delivery. Can the buyer reject the whole delivery? Advise
             the buyer.

         2. Coca-Cola purchased 200,000 yo-yos, to be delivered in instalments. They were to
             be used in conjunction with an advertising program by Coca-Cola. Of the first
             85,000 yo-yos delivered, 65,000 were returned as defective. Coca-Cola wants to
             terminate the contract. What percentage of yo-yos do you think Coca-Cola should
             have to accept delivery of?

When must you as the buyer accept and pay for the goods? (s 28)
Once the seller has delivered the goods, your duty as the buyer is to accept and pay for
them in accordance with the terms of the contract. If no price is stated, you must pay
a reasonable or customary price for the goods. If no arrangement has been made as to
subsequent payment, you must be ready and willing to pay for the goods on delivery.

When does acceptance occur? (s 35)
You will be deemed to have accepted the goods when:

   you advise the seller you have accepted the goods, or
   you have performed any act that is inconsistent with the ownership of the seller when

      the goods have been delivered (for example, the re sale of goods by you, or use or
      consumption of the goods), or
313 | CONSUMER PROTECTION

   after a reasonable time, you retain the goods without telling the seller that the goods
      have been rejected--what is considered a `reasonable time' is a question of fact, but
      problems can arise where the defect is latent and considerable time passes before it
      is discovered.

Remedies for breach of contract?

Who is an unpaid seller? (s 38)

An unpaid seller includes any person who is in the position of the seller, such as an agent
for the seller, and who:

   has not been paid the full price; or
   has been paid with a bill of exchange or cheque as conditional payment, but which

      cheque or bill of exchange has been dishonoured.

What are the unpaid seller's rights? (ss 39 - 43)

The unpaid seller's rights depend on whether or not the property or possession of the
goods, or both, have passed to you as the buyer:

   Where property and possession have passed to you, the unpaid seller has rights only
      against you personally.

   Where the unpaid seller has possession of the goods or they are still in transit to you,
      the seller may:
          exercise a lien on the goods for the price - that is, the right to retain possession
            until the price is paid
          in the case of insolvency, exercise the right of stopping the goods in transit,
            notwithstanding that the goods are no longer in the possession of the seller; and
          have a right of resale.

   Where property in the goods has not passed to you, the unpaid seller has, in addition
      to the other remedies, the right to withhold or stop delivery of the goods.

   Where the seller has property and possession, the goods may be resold without the
      seller committing a breach of contract.

What are the seller's remedies?

What is the seller's right to be paid? (s 49)

The seller may sue the buyer for the price of the goods if the property in the goods has
passed and you are wrongfully neglecting or refusing to pay for the goods according to the
terms of the contract.
                                                                                                                    CONSUMER PROTECTION | 314

The seller may also sue for the price, even if the property has not passed, if the terms of the
contract stipulate that the payment is to occur before the passing of the property, and this
has not occurred.

Can the seller recover damages for non-acceptance? (s 50)

The seller may sue you for damages arising from non-acceptance where the property has
not passed. This is reasonable, since the seller still has the ownership of the goods and may
resell them. Of course, if the seller has actually resold the goods, the measure of damages
will be the difference between the contract price and the market price at which the goods
were sold. The seller is in no position to sue you for the price because delivery is no longer
possible.

What are the buyer's remedies?

Your remedies as the buyer against the seller depend on whether the goods have been
delivered or not.

Can you recover damages for non-delivery? (s 51)

Where the seller wrongfully neglects or refuses to deliver the goods to you then you may
sue the seller for damages for non-delivery. This is the equivalent of the seller's remedy in
the previous section.

The general measure of damages will be based on the loss that directly and naturally results
from the seller's default, usually being the difference between the contract price and the
current market price. Thus, if the market price is the lower, no damages can result. Just
note that the onus is on you to minimise your loss.

Can you enforce specific performance? (s 52)

Where the seller fails to deliver the specific goods and they are of a rare kind or quality
where damages would not be an adequate remedy, the court has discretion (as this is an
equitable remedy) to award a decree of specific performance and direct the contract be
specifically performed.

What is breach of warranty of quality? (s 53)

Where there has been a breach of warranty by the seller, or where you have elected (or
have been compelled under the sale of goods legislation) to treat a breach of condition as
a breach of warranty, you may either:

   set up against the seller the breach of warranty as a ground for the reduction or
315 | CONSUMER PROTECTION

      extinction of the price asked by the seller; or
   bring an action for damages. The damages that you can recover are the difference

      between the value of the goods at the time of delivery to you and the value they would
      have had if the seller had complied with the warranty.

To determine the measure of damages, a distinction is maintained between the situation
where:

   the seller's breach caused economic loss - in which case the test is whether at the
      time of contract the seller could reasonably have contemplated the loss as a serious
      possibility in the event of a breach; and

   it caused physical injury to the person or property of you as the buyer - in which case
      it is whether the loss could be reasonably foreseen at the date of breach as a possible
      consequence of the breach.

                   Reflection questions

     The last few questions on the Goods Act 1951 before we have a brief look at some other
     consumer legislation:

         1. Who is an unpaid seller? Briefly explain.
         2. Where an unpaid seller exercises a lien over goods, what is the seller doing?
         3. Discuss whether the unpaid seller has a right of resale of goods under a contract for

             the sale of goods. What rights do you have as a buyer under the Goods Act 1951 if
             the goods you purchase are faulty?

Part 2: Independent Consumer and Competition Commission

The current consumer protection law in Papua New Guinea is theIndependent Consumer
and Competition Commission Act 2002, administered by the Independent Consumer and
Competition Commission. The Independent Consumer and Competition Commission Act
2002 has provided limited protection to consumers, mainly in relation to consumer product
                                                                                                                    CONSUMER PROTECTION | 316

safety. There are also other Acts which seek to protect consumers' rights in relation to
specific industries.

                   Online reference

     Read the About Us page on the Independent Consumer and Competition website for
     more information about the Independent Consumer and Competition Commission and its
     role and function in regulated industries and consumer protection.

     Also read about the Independent Consumer and Competition Act 2002 on the Papua New
     Guinea Consolidated Legislation website.

    The Consumer and Competition Framework Review (the Review) was initiated by
    the Department of Treasury in 2014 and its findings were made public in 2017. Of
    most interest to us is Part II of the Review dealing with consumer protection.
    Currently the Independent Consumer and Competition Commission's consumer
    protection provisions are found in Part 7 of the Independent Consumer and
    Competition Commission Act 2002 and, only include product safety and
    information (ss 107 - 121).

     For further information on the Independent Consumer and Competition Commission's
     current role on consumer protection see the Consumer Protection page on the
     Independent Consumer and Competition website.

In brief, in terms of better consumer protection, the Review recommended several changes
to the Independent Consumer and Competition Commission based on the Australian
Consumer Law including:

   Codes of Practice for business
   better product safety standards and product information
   prohibit conduct in trade that is misleading or deceptive (the same as Australian

      Consumer Law s 18)
   prohibit unfair conduct including pyramid schemes (Australian Consumer Law ss 44 -

      46), bait advertising (s 35 Australian Consumer Law), coercion or harassment of
      consumers by traders (Australian Consumer Law s 50), and where recipients receive
317 | CONSUMER PROTECTION

      unsolicited goods and services (Australian Consumer Law ss 40 - 46), recipients can
      treat them as gifts; and
   replacing conditions and warranties with consumer guarantees (Australian Consumer
      Law ss 51 - 63).

Part 3: Other consumer protection legislation

What is the Commercial Advertisement (Protection of the Public) Act 1976?

This Act protects the public from any commercial advertisement that may contain untrue,
inaccurate, misleading, misrepresentative or unreasonable statements used in describing
the size, quality, quantity or nature of goods or services. Enforcement is the responsibility
of the Independent Consumer and Competition Commission.

The Packaging Act 1974

                   Online reference

    For your interest, read about the Packaging Ac 1974 and the Packaging regulation 1975 on
    the Papua New Guinea Consolidated Legislation website.

What is the Packaging Act 1974?
The Packaging Act 1974 is responsible for ensuring that goods contain an approved brand
by the Minister for Commerce and Trade and are properly labelled, or contain the name and
address of the person on whose behalf the article was packed, or the name and address of
the packer. The purpose of the legislation is to protect the consumer who buys labelled or
packaged goods to ensure that the goods are properly labelled by making it an offence for
a person who is not authorised to mark a packagethat it is an approved brand, or to mark a
package with a copy of an approved brand (s 10).
The Packaging Regulation 1975 specify certain products must have specific packing
requirements including medicinal products, plants, dairy products and cooking oils.
                                                                                                                    CONSUMER PROTECTION | 318

Schedule 8 of the Regulations sets out goods exempted from Packaging Regulation
1975 and is quite interesting to look at the range of products that are exempt.

The Fairness of Transactions Act 1993

The purpose of the Fairness of Transactions Act 1993 is to ensure the overall fairness of
any transaction operates fairly and not be manifestly unfair or not be genuinely mutual. Or
as s 4(1) of the Fairness of Transactions Act 1993 puts it:

       For the purposes of this Act, the concept of fairness relates to the principle of the
       just and equitable distribution to and among parties to a transaction of the rights,
       privileges, advantages, benefits and duties, obligations and disadvantages of the
       transaction in proportion and relative to a party's standing in or contribution to the
       transaction, and according to business principles and practices appertaining to the
       particular transaction in question and the provisions of this Act shall be read liberally
       and applied accordingly.

`Transaction' is broadly defined in s 3 and `means any contract, promise, agreement,
dealing or undertaking of an economic or commercial nature whether supported by
consideration or not entered into between parties,' and includes both informal and complete
or incomplete transactions as well transactions governed by customary law.

The emphasis of Fairness of Transactions Act 1993 is to try and arrive at an amicable
settlement first (s 7) and if that fails, the court shall hear the matter and make such order as
it thinks is fair (s 8).

Part 4: Australian Consumer Law

So, what does the Australian Consumer Law look like if something similar were to be
legislated for in PNG? Here is a brief overview.

                   Online reference
319 | CONSUMER PROTECTION

     If you want to see what the Australian Consumer Law looks like, see Schedule 2 on the
     Australian Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) website.

What is misleading or deceptive conduct?

The Australian Consumer Law contains one section (s 18) where the wording relating to
misleading or deceptive conduct is very wide. The wording is:

       A corporation shall not, in trade or commerce, engage in conduct that is misleading or
       deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive.

Courts have interpreted the meaning of misleading conduct to be conduct that would lead
an ordinary member of the public who reads the statement be led into error. Furthermore,
misleading conduct is more than conduct that could simply result in confusion.

Note also the use of the word `or'. It is a splitting word (`and' is a joining word). If the section
read `misleading and deceptive conduct' then to have a breach of s 18 the conduct would
have to be both `misleading' and `deceptive' for a breach of the section. But using the word
`or' means that s 18 will catch conduct that is misleading `or' deceptive and is much wider in
its application. It sets a norm of conduct. The misleading or deceptive conduct must either
induce error or be capable of producing error.

Under the wording of s 18, it is not essential that anyone is actually deceived or misled; it is
sufficient that the conduct islikely to mislead. For this reason, this section of theAustralian
Consumer Lawis known as the `umbrella section' as it can cover most situations where
an aggrieved consumer wishes to take action under theAustralian Consumer Law and it is
perhaps the most litigated section of the Australian Consumer Law.

The main functions of the Australian Consumer Law can be summarised as follows:

   protects the interests of consumers against:
          unfair practices of traders (things traders do to consumers)
          unconscionable conduct of traders
          misleading or deceptive conduct
          specific false representations; and
          unfair practices;

   provides consumer guarantees relating to the supply of goods and services
   provides safety and information standards
   establishes manufacturers' liability; and
                                        CONSUMER PROTECTION | 320

 establishes product liability.

It is not uncommon to find that proceedings under the Australian Consumer Law involving
allegations of a breach of a specific section will also involve a breach of the more general
s 18. However, there will also be cases where there will be a breach of s 18 without
necessarily involving a breach of the more specific sections. It is worth noting here that,
under the rules of statutory interpretation, where both a general and a specific section apply,
the more specific section usually applies.

The reason the Australian Consumer Law has both general and specific sections, is that
stricter penalties apply if you can prove a breach of one of the more specific provisions. We
will consider penalties a little later.

What is unconscionable conduct?

You will recall that unconscionable conduct was one of the factors which could affect the
validity of a contract at common law. The Australian Consumer Law contains provisions that
confirm this. In Chapter 8 we noted that unconscionable conduct was conduct that was
unreasonable, unscrupulous, or excessive. And remember it often involves situations where
there is a serious difference in the commercial competency of the parties. Sections 20-22
of the Australian Consumer Law deal with unconscionable transactions between a business
and a consumer, and between businesses (but not listed public companies).

What are consumer guarantees implied in contracts? (51-64)

The Australian Consumer Law created a new concept in consumer protection law when
it was introduced and that was the replacement of conditions and warranties with non-
excludable consumer guarantees. This was considered by the Review Committee that
could be incorporated into new consumer protection legislation in Papua New Guinea.

The matters covered by these guarantees are considered to be so fundamental to a
consumer contract that they don't have to be put in writing or even stated by the parties, for
them to be considered as part of the contract. While the notion of a consumer guarantee
is new, the underlying principles are not, as previous consumer protection legislation
in Australia provided for what were known as implied conditions and warranties. What
theAustralian Consumer Lawdoes, though, is simplify the law and create language that is
more readily understood by contemporary consumers.

These implied guarantees relate to contracts for the provision of both goods and services.
For goods, the main implied guarantees are:

 Goods must be of acceptable quality.
321 | CONSUMER PROTECTION

   Goods must be fit for their purpose, when you have made their purpose known to the
      seller.

   Where goods are sold by reference to description, it is implied that the goods will
      correspond with that description (and also correspond with a sample, if a sample is
      also provided).

For services, the three implied guarantees are that services will be:

   Rendered with due care and skill.
   Fit for a disclosed purpose.
   Supplied within a reasonable time (if no specific time for supply is stated).

Section 64 of the Australian Consumer Law expressly prohibits the consumer and the
supplier from agreeing to exclude the operation of the consumer guarantees. Such term will
be void. However, s 64A does provide exceptions to the rule in s 64 in business-to-business
dealings and situations where the consumer can establish that it was not fair or reasonable
for the supplier to rely on that term of the contract.

What remedies, penalties and defences are available under the
Australian Consumer Law?

Don't get too bogged down in the detail here. Remember this section in only intended to
show you what the Australian Consumer Law covers and possible remedies and penalties
that could apply for breaches of consumer protection laws. The essential things to note
are that some of the sections of the Australian Consumer Law attract fines as well as civil
remedies for consumers. Note though that the courts will try to award civil penalties - that
is, award damages by way of compensation, rather than impose fines. Currently, fines are
A$50 million per breach, and for individuals (including directors and managers involved in
a contravention) A$2.5 million per breach for making false or misleading representations,
for unfair sales practices such as bait advertising, harassment and coercion, and for
unconscionable conduct. As an exercise, try converting these fines into Kina.

Remedies available to a consumer, and a court or tribunal, include damages, compensation
orders, undertakings, substantiation notices, public warning notices, injunctions, disclosure
of information, orders for non-party consumers, and non-punitive orders.

Defences to alleged breaches of any of the sections attracting criminal penalties are:

   reasonable mistake
   reasonable reliance on information supplied by another person
   the breach was due to the act or default of another person or beyond defendant's
          CONSUMER PROTECTION | 322

control.

Defendants must be able to show that reasonable precautions were taken not to mislead or
deceive consumers and it is not a defence to blame an employee, director or agent.

        Key points

An understanding of the following points will help you to better understand and revise the
material in this chapter.

   What are the current consumer protection laws in PNG?: the Goods Act 1951,
      the Independent Consumer and Competition Commission Act, 2002 , and the Fairness
      of Transactions Act 1993.

Part 1: The Goods Act 1951

   What are implied terms?: implied terms are terms that are not expressly stated in a
      contract but which the law implies are included in the contract and are enforceable.

   What are the requirements for the formation of the contract? - three elements are
      required:
          goods; and
          money consideration (called the price); and
          transfer of property

   What are `goods?: goods are broadly defined to includeall chattels personal other
      than things in action and money' (s 1(1) and generally only includes only physical and
      movable things).

   What is the importance of transfer of ownership?: risk of loss of the goods goes
      with the person who has the ownership in the goods.

   What is the difference between a sale and an agreement to sell?: in a sale of
      goods,ownership (or property) transfers from the seller to the buyer at the time of the
      contract, (an executed contract) while in an agreement to sell, property in the goods is
      to be transferred at some later date, or when some condition has been fulfilled.

   Are there any formalities to be observed in making a contract of sale?: there are
      no special formalities to be observed but for the Goods Act 1951 to operate the goods
      must be of a value of K20> and you, as the buyer, have accepted part or all of the
      good, or paid a deposit, or there is a written note or memorandum of the contract
      showing the names of the parties, the subject matter, the price and the buyer's
      signature.
323 | CONSUMER PROTECTION

   What are the terms of the contract?: the implied terms contained in the Goods Act
      1951 are framed as conditions or warranties.

   What are the terms implied in the Goods Act 1951?
          title (s 13): in the case of a sale and agreement to sell, an implied conditionthat
            the seller has a right to sell the goods and implied warrantythat you will enjoy
            quiet possession of the goods and that the goods are free from any charge or
            encumbrance in favour of any third party.
          sale by description (s 14): an implied condition that the goods will correspond
            with the description, or if a sale by sample and description, that the bulk of the
            goods will correspond with both requirements.
          fitness for purpose (s 15(2)(a)) and of merchantable quality (s 15(2)(b)):
            where you rely on the seller's skill or judgment, and they are goods the seller
            normally sells, an implied condition that the goods are fit for purpose. If the goods
            are bought by description, an implied condition that the goods are of
            merchantable quality.
          sale by sample (s 16): an implied condition that the bulk will correspond with the
            sample in quality, that the buyer will have a reasonable opportunity to compare
            the bulk with the sample, and that the goods will be free from any defect,
            rendering them unmerchantable, which would not be apparent on any reasonable
            examination and would cause the goods not to be of acceptable quality.

   What is the distinction between property and possession?: `property in goods'
      means `ownership' or `title' and is a legal relationshipwhile `possession of goods'
      refers to thephysical control or custodyof the goods.

   When does risk pass? (s 20): risk passes when property (or ownership) passes from
      the seller to the buyer depending on the intention of the parties and whether the
      goods are:
          existing
          future
          specific
          unascertained, or
          ascertained.

   When does property pass? (s 18): ifthe sale is forascertained or specific goods,
      property transfers to you when you and the seller intend it to pass (s 18(1)). To
      ascertain intention, look at:
          the terms of the contract
          the conduct of the parties; and
          the circumstances of the case.

   What is the purpose of the Personal Property Securities Act 2011?: The Personal
      Property Securities Act 2011 covers security interests over personal property other
      than land that in substance secures payment of a debt or other obligation.
                                                                                                                    CONSUMER PROTECTION | 324

   What is a sale under a voidable title? (s 22): If a seller has a voidable title at the
      time of sale, the buyer acquires a good title:
          provided that the goods were bought in good faith; and
          without notice of the seller's defective title.

   What are the rights and duties of the parties in performance of the contract? (ss
      27, 29(1)): delivery takes place when there is a voluntary transfer of possession from
      the seller to you but when that takes place depends in each case on the terms agreed
      to between the parties.

   What is the duty of the seller in respect of delivery? (ss 29-37): where the
      contract says nothing about delivery you need to look at a number of factors including:
          are the goods in a deliverable state? (s 29(7))
          when and where is delivery? (s 29(2))
          are there third parties involved? (s 29(5))
          is delivery in a reasonable time? (s 29(4))
          is the correct quantity being delivered? (s 30)
          is delivery by instalments? (s 31)
          who authorised delivery to a carrier? (ss 32(2), 33).

   When must you accept and pay for the goods? (s 28): your duty as the buyer is to
      accept and pay for them in accordance with the terms of the contract

   When does acceptance occur? (s 35): acceptance occurs when you have:
          advised the seller you have accepted the goods; or
          performedany act that is inconsistent with the ownership of the seller after
            delivery; or
          waited a reasonable time.

   What are the seller's remedies for breach of contract?: an unpaid seller is a
      person who has not been paid the full price or has been paid with a cheque or bill of
      exchange that has been dishonoured. The seller's rights will depend on whether
      property or possession of the goods has passed. If they have possession, exercise a
      lien on the goods, or stop the goods in transit in the case of insolvency, resell the
      goods. If property has not passed, sue you for damages for non-acceptance.

   Can you recover damages for non-delivery? (s 51): sue the seller for damages for
      non-delivery or sue for specific performance if damages are not an adequate remedy.

Part 2: The Independent Consumer and Competition Commission Act 2002

   The Independent Consumer and Competition Commission Act 2002 provides limited
      protection to consumers, mainly in relation to consumer product safety.

Part 3: Other consumer protection legislation
325 | CONSUMER PROTECTION

   The purpose of the Commercial Advertisement (Protection of the Public) Act
      1976 protects the public from commercial advertisements that are inaccurate or
      untrue.

   The purpose of the Packaging Act 1974 is to protect the consumer who buy labelled
      or packaged goods that the goods are properly packaged and labelled, making it an
      offence for a person who is not authorised to mark a package statingthat it is an
      approved brand when it isn't, or to mark a package with a copy of an approved brand.

   The purpose of theFairness of Transactions Act 1993 is to ensure the overall
      fairness of any transaction is fair and not manifestly unfair or not genuinely mutual.
      The emphasis of the Fairness of Transactions Act 1993 is to try and arrive at an
      amicable settlement first and if that fails, the court shall hear the matter and make
      such order as it thinks is fair.

Part 4: The Australian Consumer Law

This section is only intended to give you an overview of what Australia has done to try and
give consumers a single national law for greater consumer protection and fairer trading by:

   protecting the interests of consumers against:
          unfair practices of traders (things traders do to consumers)
          unconscionable conduct of traders
          misleading or deceptive conduct
          specific false representations; and
          unfair practices

   providing consumer guarantees relating to the supply of goods and services
   providing safety and information standards
   established manufacturers' liability
   established product liability; and
   providing heavy fines for breaches of the Australian Consumer Law. The question to

      consider here is whether, and when, the PNG National Government will adopt
      changes to the current consumer protection laws.

        Key Terms

You will notice these key terms, which are mentioned throughout the chapter, to help you to
better understand and remember the material:

          Agent: a person employed to act on behalf of, or represent, another person (the
            principal).

          Broker: a person who buys and sells things for other people for a commission
            and are common in the financial world.

          Del credere agent: a person as a broker for the principal but who also
            guarantees payment by a third party to the principal after the transaction is
            completed and who may become liable for that amount.

          Estoppel: a legal principle that prevents a person from going back on an action
            or statement that they made in the past.

          Factor: a type of trader who takes possession of goods, or the documents of title
            to the goods, on consignment for a principal for commission and sell them in their
            own name.

          Mercantile agent: a person who buys, sells and consigns goods for their
                                                                                                                                          AGENCY | 328

            principal (usually in their name) for a commission but who does not have
            possession or ownership (documents of title). If the mercantile agent is given
            possession of the goods he is known as a factor.
          Principal: a person who gives authority or capacity to another person (the agent)
            to act on the principal's behalf and create legal relations with a third party.
          Ratification: the legal confirmation of the adoption of a transaction by a principal
            of an act of their agent.
          Secret commission: a commission or profit which has not been accounted for by
            the principal and which is like a bribe and may result in both a criminal and a civil
            law action.

        Introduction

The is the last chapter. You have learned about some of the key areas of commercial
law that are very important in business, but also equally important in a lot of your day-
to-day activities, starting today. In Chapter 12 we began by looking at the doctrine of privity
of contract and learnt that only those persons who were immediate parties to a contract
acquire rights and liabilities under it. However, what you are about to discover is that
agency is an exception to the rule, and hence it is important a have a basic understanding
of it. Because of the complexity of commercial dealings today, it is often necessary to
deal through others including at the very least bankers, financiers, accountants, managers,
partners, and solicitors. Where these persons negotiate on your behalf with third parties,
they will often be your agents and they may make you liable for their actions. Just
understand that the law of agency exists in specific situations where one person (the
agent) acts on the authority of another (the principal) to enter into legal obligations such as
contracts. The agent will have some express or implied authority as well as certain rights
and duties, with the duty to act in good faith being the most important. There are various
specific types of situations where a relationship of agency exists.

What is an agency relationship?

Where there is an agreement, which may be oral or in writing, between you as a principal
and another person (an agent) to do something for and on your behalf,that creates a
potential agency situation. It gives an agent the authority to act on your behalf, but with the
benefits going to you as principal.

There is also a contract made by an agent in the exercise of their authority with a third party
329 | AGENCY

which is enforceable both for and against you as principal (if an agent has acted within their
authority). So, what you are looking at here is a three-party situation - you as aprincipal
who passes authority to an agent to act on your behalf when dealing with a third party. A
good example of an agency situation is a real estate agent in the purchase and sale of real
estate.

Who are the parties to an agency agreement?

An agency agreement involves three parties:

   a principal who gives their authority to.
   an agent who, in turn, through the authority given to them by the principal creates the

      legal relations with.
   a third party.

What common types of employment relationships can you get?

Can an agency situation be created between an employer and
employee?

A common type of agency situation is employer and employee. The employee is subject to
the control and direction of the employer (a contract of service) and generally does not
have the power to make contracts with third parties. However, if there is evidence of an
intention on the part of the employer to give an employee managerial power - for example,
a shop manager may be authorised to buy goods or services for the business, or has the
power to hire and fire staff, then there is evidence of an intention on the part of the employer
to give the employee power to make contracts that could bind the employer.

Can an agency situation arise from an employee-independent
contractor relationship?

Generally, an employer-independent contractor relationship will not create an agency
relationship. The contractor performs an agreed task specified by the employer for an
agreed price, but the contractor, not the employer, controls the manner, methods, and
materials needed to complete the task. Unlike the employer-employee relationship, there
is usually no evidence of intention to create an agency agreement. However, there is an
exception where an agent can be an independent contractor and that is in the case of an
auctioneer.

Other examples of where you will come across an agency relationship include real estate
                                                                                                                                          AGENCY | 330

agents, partnerships, agents in the entertainment industry, brokers, factors, and del credere
agents.

Knowing what kind of agent relationships exists is important, particularly in commercial
arrangements as it determines what rights and obligations the parties have with one
another.

What are the different classes of agents?

TYPE        DESCRIPTION
OF
AGENT       An agent is authorised to only make a particular type of contract or carry out a
Special     particular transaction on behalf of the principal - for example, you ask a friend to bid no
or limited  more than K15,000 at a car auction and they bid K20,000 you as the principal are not
General     bound because they have exceeded their authority.
Universal   An agent can make contracts of a certain class that are normal for this type of agency
            or do some act for a principal which is part of the agents ordinary course of business -
            for example, a manager has implied power to carry out those duties necessary for the
            running of the business.
            An agent can do almost anything a principal can do and are usually appointed under a
            power of attorney - for example, a person who knows they are getting dementia might
            appoint a friend to pay debts, collect moneys as though they were a principal.

How can an agent be appointed?

                                                                       ratifies the contract.

In cases of necessity or emergency,four conditions must be satisfied:
331 | AGENCY

   there must be a genuine emergencywhere the principal's property is in physical
      danger;and

   it must be impossibleor extremely difficult to get the principals instructions; and
   the person must be entrusted with another's property; and
   A must act bona fide in the principal's interests, and not merely for an agent's own

      convenience.

In the case of ratification, the following conditionsmust all be satisfied, or an agent may
find themselves liable to a third party for breach of warranty of authority:

   An agent must clearly be acting as an agent; and
   An agent must have a known principal in mind. It is not necessary that principal be

      named; however, principal should be capable of being ascertained at the time of
      making the contract; and
   A principal must have contractual capacity at the time of making the contract, and
   there should be an act capable of ratification. A contract that is void from its inception
      cannot be made good by ratification, and
   A principal must have full knowledge of all the facts at the time of ratification, and
   ratification must occur within a reasonable time of the contract being entered into,
      and
   ratification may be express or implied by the conduct of the principal. The only time a
      special form is required is for the ratification of a deed, and
   ratification must apply to the whole contract, and
   ratification can only be retrospective.

What are the sources of authority for an agent?

                   In brief

     The sources of authority of an agent can be conferred either:

           expressly or by action by principal
           implied actual, which is inferred from the conduct of the parties, or
                                                                                                                                           AGENCY | 332

           by way of apparent or ostensible authority which leads a third party to believe that
             an agent has authority to contract on a principals behalf when this is not the case.
             Thus, for example, a transaction by one partner can bind the other partners if the
             transaction is part of normal partnership business as each partner is an agent for the
             other partners.

What is actual authority?

Actual or express authority of the agent will be found in the powers:

   expressly given by principal to agent
   implied in the agency agreement, or
   arise from the operation of law.

What is implied actual authority?

An agent has the authority to do anything that is incidental to or necessary for the carrying
out of acts within their actual authority - for example, where a person acts as an agent of
necessity.

What is apparent or ostensible authority?

Apparent or ostensible authority arises where principal, either by words or conduct, leads
a third party to reasonably believe that agent has authority to contract on their behalf when
this is not true.
The impression of conferral created by principal must be conveyed to the third party. Agent
and principal may be held liable based on apparent authority if their conduct is such that it
could reasonably lead a third party to believe that they could rely on that authority. Thus,
in the case of a partnership, for example, look closely at the business and see whether a
transaction by one partner can bind the other partner/s because each partner is an agent
for the other partners.

The courts use objective evidence to establish apparent or ostensible authority including:

   the words or conduct of principal
   custom or trade usage
333 | AGENCY

   situations where principal has appointed agent to perform a task that implies a certain
      amount of authority; and

   whether the position creates an impression of authority.

A good example of the use of objective evidence is Tooth & Co v Laws (1886) 9 LR (NSW)
154, an Australian case, where Laws was estopped (prevented) from denying that the
purchaser of his hotel was not his agent by allowing his name to remain on the sign above
the entrance to the hotel, with his name on it as the principal. Third parties such as Tooth
& Co had not been told the business had been sold, so they had no reason to believe that
they were dealing with anyone but Laws.

                   Reflection questions

     Time for a break. Have a go at answering these 3 questions from real cases:

         1. A racehorse was consigned by rail to Swaffield at one of the plaintiff's railway
             stations. Swaffield was not at the station when the horse arrived, as it arrived late at
             night. The railway company didn't have his address, so there was no way it could get
             in touch with him to tell him the horse had arrived. As the horse couldn't be kept at
             the station, it was sent to a stable at the company's expense. When the railway
             company sought to recover the expenses for the upkeep of the horse, Swaffield
             refused to pay. Do you think the railway company will succeed in their claim?

         2. Lambert made an offer to buy land from an agent who in fact was manager and
             agent of the property on behalf of Bolton Partners. The agent had no authority to act
             for Bolton Partners, but he accepted the offer on their behalf. Lambert then sought
             to revoke the offer. Bolton Partners subsequently ratified the acceptance of the
             agent. The question here is whether the unauthorised actions of the agent could be
             ratified by the principal. What do you think?

         3. Laws sold his hotel to a third party. After the sale, he allowed his name as licensee
             to continue to be displayed over the front door to the hotel. The persons who
             bought the business continued to purchase their liquor supplies, as Laws had done,
             from Tooth & Co on credit. Tooth & Co were not aware of the change of ownership.
             After several months of the new owners failing to pay their bills, Tooth & Co sued
             Laws for the cost of the liquor supplied. Who do you think would win - Tooth & Co
               AGENCY | 334

or Laws? Why?

What are the obligations of an Agent to the Principal?

The duties of an agent are based in contract law and must include:

   following principal's instructions exactly: Failure to follow these instructions will,
      unless an agent is prepared to ratify the transaction, not only not bind the principal but
      may result in an agent being in breach of contract (and quite possibly negligent),
      leaving an agent open to being sued for any losses that may arise.

   act in person: If personal confidence or skill is required, delegation is generally not
      possibleunless the delegation is sanctioned by the principal, it arises out of necessity
      or an agent's duties are purely administrative.

   exercise due care, skilland diligence: But, the standard of care will vary according
      to whether an agents services are free or paid for. If the agent charges a fee, then
      they are expected to exercise such care, skill and diligence that an agent in that
      business would have.

   act in the principal's interest:As the agent stands in a fiduciary relationship with the
      principal. If the duty of the agent clashes with the principal's interests, proper
      disclosure should be made. The test of what should be disclosed is what a
      `reasonable' person would consider material in the ordinary course of business.

   maintain confidentiality.
   keep separate proper accounts.
   not make secret profits or take secret commissions: An agent is entitled only to

      the agreed or customary commission as payment for services that have been
      performed, and to nothing else. If the principal is aware of an agent being paid an
      additional commission by a third party and sanctions it, there is not a problem.
      However, often the secret commission is nothing more than a bribe, the agent may
      face criminal charges by the police (see, for example, Div 2A, ss 97E-97P of the
      Criminal Code Act 1974) and civil action by the principal. Under the civil law the
      principal may:

          claim the commission
          claim the commission and cancel the agency agreement
          recover damages for any loss suffered from the actions of the agent or the party

            that has paid the bribe, or
          recover the secret commission.

                                 What are the obligations of the
                                 principal?

              Business tip       An agent has the following rights against a
                                 principal:

Note that the care agents         Right to payment: which can be fixed or implied

carrying out the principal's instructions. An agent loses the right to indemnity and

reimbursement where agents acts are not authorised or ratified by the principal, there

is a breach of duty by the agent, or the loss is due to the unlawful or negligent acts of

the agent.

 Right of lien: is available to the agent to retain the goods of the principal until

reimbursement of expenses and commission if applicable. A lien is lost if the agent

voluntarily parts with possession or principals pays what they owe the agent.

 Right of stoppage in transit: is available for an agent where they are personally

responsible for the price of goods bought on the principal's behalf because the seller

is placed in the position of an unpaid seller if the principal were to become insolvent

(broke or bankrupt). In such a case, an agent may be able to exercise the seller's right

of stoppage in transit if the goods are still in possession of a carrier (see the Goods

Act 1951, ss 44-48). If an agent can recover possession of the goods, then the right of

lien can be exercised.

What is the liability of Agents and Principals to Third
Parties?

When you think about it, agency involves two contractual situations. The first is between
principals and agents while the second is the contract formed by the agent between the
                                                                                                                                          AGENCY | 336

principal and the third party. What is interesting here is that generally an agent cannot sue
or be sued on a contract between the principal and third party.

                   Reflection questions

     Take a break and think about how you would answer these two questions. Both are real
     cases.

         1. Lunghi had a block of land he wished to sell. He approached Sinclair, a real estate
             agent, to sell the land for him. Sinclair informed Lunghi that his (Sinclair's) wife was
             an interested buyer, and after some time, and little buyer interest, Lunghi eventually
             sold the land to her. Lunghi subsequently discovered that Sinclair's wife was a
             partner in the real estate agency and that no real attempt had been made to sell the
             land. It was, in fact, worth substantially more than he was told, and Mrs Sinclair had
             resold the land for a significant profit. What would you advise Lunghi of his options,
             if any?

         2. Pow appointed McCann & Co, a firm of real estate agents, to sell his flat. Without
             Pow's knowledge or consent, the agents gave details to a sub-agent, who
             subsequently sold the property. While McCann & Co were instrumental in arranging
             the sale, were they entitled to any commission?

                   In brief

     As a general rule, an agent cannot sue or be sued on a contract between the principal
     and a third party where:

           an agent discloses the agency relationship and names of the principal, or
           an agent discloses the agency relationship but does not name the principal.
337 | AGENCY

     If an agent does not disclose the agency relationship or name the principal, an agent will
     be personally liable on the contract. A similar outcome will occur where the agent will be
     liable for breach of warrant of authority if the agent exceeds their authority (express or
     implied) given to them by the principal.

What is the legal position where there is disclosure of an
agency relationship?

The general rule where agent contracts for a named principal is that agent is completely
discharged from the agreement. End of story. But having said that, an agent can still incur
liability if:

   they have executed a deed in their own name
   usage or custom makes them liable
   A principal is non-existent
   they agree to be liable, or
   they are in breach of warranty of authority by acting beyond the scope of their actual

      or apparent authority.

If an agent makes a contract with a third party without naming the principal, to avoid being
personally liable, the agent should expressly disclose that an agency relationship exists. It
is then up to the third party if they are prepared to accept an unknown principal. If they are,
the agent is discharged from the contract.

If the agent does not disclose the existence of the Principal, then they may find that the
third party treats them as the principal and a party to the contract or, if the third party
discovers the principal's identity, sues principal (this is actually called the doctrine of the
undisclosed principal). But the third party cannot sue both the agent and principal unless
given permission by the court because to do so would potentially allow two judgments for
the one debt.

What is a breach of warranty?

If an agent expressly or impliedly represents that they acted with the authority of the
principal, and the third-party acts based on that representation, an agent is taken to
warrant that the representation is true. If it is untrue - irrespective of whether it was
                                                                                                                                          AGENCY | 338

done fraudulently or innocently (and even if the authority had been terminated without the
knowledge of an agent) - agent has committed a breach of warranty of authority. The third
party can then sue the agent for damages to the extent of the actual loss suffered.

committed for the benefit of the principal.                         commit.

If an agent was doing something outside the scope
of the agency agreement when the tort was
committed, the principal would be relieved of any
liability.

How can an agency agreement be terminated?

An agency agreement can be terminated by:

   acts of the parties, or
   operation of law.

In relation to termination, any rights vested before the termination, such as an agent`s right
to commission or indemnity, are not affected.

If the agency is terminated by agreement, the principal is under a duty to notify those third
parties with whom an agent may do or has done business. The notice can be from the
principal or some other recognised source such as agent.
339 | AGENCY

Termination ends agent's actual authority to act on the principal's behalf. However, if the
principal fails to give proper notice of the termination to a third party, an agent still has
apparent authority to bind the principal to a contract with a third party who is not aware
of the termination. The contract would be enforceable against the principal, and principal's
only recourse then would be to sue the agent for damages caused by the unauthorised
contract.

                     Business tip

       To avoid problems arising for the principal when the principal terminates:
             The principal should give direct notice of termination to the parties who deal
                with an agent, preferably in writing.
             The principal must give direct or give constructive notice to any third parties
                who has knowledge of the agreement but with whom the agent has not yet
                dealt with - for example, notice in the Public Notices section of the local
                newspaper. It is irrelevant whether third party sees it or not as this is constructive
                notice of termination of the agency to avoid liability.
             Generally, a principal is not liable to parties who have no knowledge of the
                agency agreement. However, if there is written authority of an agency
                relationship, to avoid possible problems arising with a third party subsequently
                relying on an agreement to establish liability of the principal, put a notice in the
                Public Notices section of the local newspaper.

What acts can the parties take to terminate an agency
agreement?

Mutual agreement

While the agreement between a principal and agent is still in force, they may mutually agree
to its termination.

Revocation of the agent's authority

Revocation can be done at any time by the principal without an agent's consent, even
                                                                                                                                          AGENCY | 340

though the work of an agent may not be completed. However, this could lead to a breach
of contract and an agent bringing an action for wrongful dismissal. Third parties should be
notified by the principal to avoid any problems arising from an apparent agency.

Withdrawal of the agent from the agreement

This can be done at any time, but an agent will need to make good any loss that the principal
may suffer. An agent is not liable for any loss where the agency is a gratuitous one - that
is, there is no commission involved.

Secret commission

An agency may be terminated by the principal if the principal discovers an agent has
accepted a secret commission.

Completion of a specific purpose or act agency

Where an agent is appointed for a specific purpose and that purpose has been completed,
the agency agreement will be terminated by performance - for example, the sale of a house
by a real estate agent.

Time limit

If there is a time limit involved in the agency agreement and the act is not achieved within
that time limit, the agency agreement will be terminated - for example, a real estate agent
who has 60 days to achieve the sale of a house.

Operation of law

Performance

An agent's authority continues only up until the purpose for which the agency agreement
was created has been completed.

Lapse of time

Where an agent has been appointed for a specific time, then the authority of an agent
ceases when the time period expires.
341 | AGENCY

Death

The death of the principal brings the authority to an end. But where the agent is acting in
good faith under the scope of a power of attorney, any acts done after the death of the
principal, but before notice of the death reaches the agent, are valid and the agent will not
be held liable.

In the case of the death of an agent, whether the agreement is terminated will depend on
whether the agreement is for the provision of personal services or not. If it is for personal
services, then the agency is terminated.

Insanity

Insanity of either the principal or agent terminates the agency agreement.

Bankruptcy

In certain cases, bankruptcy of either the principal or the agent under the provisions of the
Insolvency Act 1951 will terminate the agency agreement.

Frustration

Where it becomes impossible for the agent to carry out their obligations owing to the
destruction of the subject matter, or by any event that makes the agency illegal or
impossible to perform, this will terminate the agency agreement (see also Chapter 12).

What remedies are available to a principal for breach by
an agent?

The major remedies available to the principal for a breach by the agent of an agency
contract are the same as a breach of any contract. These include:

   rescission (see Chapter 12 `Discharge and breach of contract')
   refusing to pay a commission (check the agreement carefully because the agreement

      with the agent will often contain a term entitling an agent to their commission even
      when the purpose of the contract is not carried fulfilled)
   suing for damages (see Chapter 12 `Discharge and breach of contract'), and
   suing the agent for recovery of a secret commission.
                                       AGENCY | 342

What are some common types of agency?

This is for your information to illustrate the types of situations where an agency arrangement
is commonly found:

 employer-employee (where there is evidence of intention to give an employee power
   to make contracts and it is within the scope of their employment)

 auctioneer
 mercantile agents
 Brokers - for example, insurance brokers, stock brokers, financiers
 del credere agents
 partners
 real estate agents; and
 partners in a partnership.

It is worth noting that where an auctioneer is concerned, they are the selling agent of land/
property or goods for the owner. There may be a `reserve price' on the land or goods and
this is the minimum price below which the seller is not prepared to sell. In other words, the
auctioneer's authority is limited by the setting of a minimum price and at some point, either
before or during the auction, those in attendance at the auction will be advised there is a
minimum price.

If the auction is `without reserve', that means there is no minimum price and the auctioneer
must accept the highest bona fide bid on the fall of their hammer.

              Business tip

An auctioneer is an agent of the vendor (the seller), but after the fall of the hammer
they become the agent for the purchaser. If attending an auction as a buyer note
carefully whether the auction has a `reserve' or `no reserve' on it.
343 | AGENCY

                   Reflection question

     Take your final break, as this is the last chapter. Reflect on how you would answer this last
     question.
     Harrison, an auctioneer, advertised an auction of horses as being `without reserve'. This
     meant that the highest bona fidebidder should have been the successful bidder, whatever
     the price bid. At the auction, Warlow submitted a bid but the owner of the mare he bid on
     submitted a final higher bid that the auctioneer accepted. The plaintiff then sued the
     auctioneer, alleging a breach of the auctioneer's contractual obligation to sell the horse to
     the highest bona fide bidder. Do you think the plaintiff would be successful in an action
     against the auctioneer? Explain why.

        Key points

An understanding of the following points will help you to better revise material in this
chapter.

   What is the purpose of agency?
          An agency is a relationship whereby one person (the agent) is authorised by the
            other person (the principal) to do certain acts that affect the principal's legal rights
            and duties to third parties.
          Only those persons with full contractual capacity can employ an agent.
          An agent cannot have greater powers than the principal possesses.
          If the principal is under some legal disability, an agent is equally limited.

   How is an agency relationship created?
          Expressly:
                by necessity
                by emergency; or
                by holding out or estoppel.
          Impliedly:
                                                                                                                                       AGENCY | 344

             by necessity
             by emergency; or
             by holding out or estoppel.
       Ratification: The principal may accept liability for the agent's actions after the
         agent has acted.
 What is the authority of an agent?
       Actual authority: if the agent follows instructions and acts within the authority
         delegated by the principal, an agent will be acting within actual authority. When
         an agent acts within actual authority, an agent will bind the principal to third
         parties and never be personally liable to the principal or the third party.
       Apparent (or ostensible) authority: by appointing a person to a particular position,
         the principal may give an agent the appearance of greater authority than has
         actually been delegated to the agent. If an agent acts outside the actual authority
         but within this appearance of authority, an agent will bind the principal to the third
         party and be liable to the principal for any loss the principal suffers as a result of
         the agents failure to follow instructions.
       Warranty of authority: no one is liable for acts done on their behalf without their
         actual or apparent authority. If a person claims to act as an agent, they impliedly
         warrant that they have authority from the person for whom they claim to act. If in
         fact the agent is acting without any authority or in excess of their authority, they
         will be liable to the third party in damages for breach of warranty of authority. An
         agent isn't liable where the third party is aware of the lack of authority, or where
         the agent has told the third party that they didn't warrant their authority.
 What is the agent's duty to the principal?
       Agent's duty is to:
             follow instructions
             act in person
             act in the interests of the principal (fiduciary duty)
             take care of the principal's property
             keep separate accounts; and
             keep proper accounts
 What are the agent's rights against the principal?
       Agent's rights are:
             remuneration
             reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses
             indemnity against legal action; and
             lien and stoppage in transit.
 What is the liability of agents and principals to third parties?
       The liability of the agent:
             Where the agent contracts for a named principal, an agent is completely
345 | AGENCY

                  discharged and cannot incur either liabilities or rights.
                Where there is a named principal, an agent is discharged.
                Where there is a disclosed but unnamed principal, an agent is again

                  discharged.
                In the case of an undisclosed principal, as an agent has contracted in their

                  own name and the third party may not be aware of the existence of a
                  principal, an agent may be personally liable. When the principal is
                  discovered, the third party may sue either principal or agent.
                While an agent is saved from personal liability where any actions were within
                  authority, actions outside authority can expose an agent to an action of
                  breach of warranty of authority by the third party.
                An agent is liable for tortious acts, such as negligence, but where those acts
                  are committed within the course of the agent's employment, the principal will
                  also be liable.
          Where anagent is liable to third parties:
                when contracting under seal (the contract is in the form of a deed) in their
                  own name
                when professing to act as an agent, when in fact they are the principal
                where it is the custom or trade practice for this to apply
                where there is a declaration that agent is acting personally
                where the agent is acting on behalf of a principal who does not exist
                where the agent has some interest in the contract other than commission; or
                in the case of wrongful acts known to be wrongful and not within the scope of
                  authority.
          When principal is liable:
                to perform what an agent has promised to a third party when acting
                  according to an agents authority
                to third parties where an agent has acted beyond authority, but in the
                  ordinary course of the agency; and
                for frauds and wrongs of an agent committed in the ordinary course of
                  employment.
   How can an agency be terminated?An agency can be terminated by:
          mutual agreement
          revocation of the agent's authority by principal
          the agent terminates by notification
          serious misconduct by agent
          expiry of the agreed term
          performance
          the death of the principal or agent
          bankruptcy of an agent
                                                                                                                              AGENCY | 346

REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS

       As you read through the Chapters, you will find several Revision Questions in each
       chapter for you to attempt. They are revision questions for you to find out whether
       what you have read, you understand. Attempt as many as you can as they will help
       you in your understanding of the law.
       You will find that some of the questions do not have a detailed answer. That is because
       they are what are called `Opinion' questions. That is, they are questions where there is
       no right or wrong answer. What these questions are trying to do is to get your thoughts
       on a particular topic and, importantly, why you think the way you do.
       Note: The answers to the questions will follow the order in which they appear in
       each chapter.

        Chapter 2

Think about your country for a moment. Do you think PNG is a
highly regulated country? Look at the type of regulatory
framework currently in place.

This is really an opinion question asking you `What do you think?' Is PNG a highly
regulated country, can you explain why.

Common law ceases to be common law when it becomes
codified. What does this mean?

Begin by explaining what common law and statute law are, and then what codified
means.
Parliament and the courts are independent of each other. Common law is law that is derived
from judicial decisions of the courts by judges using precedents and statutes.
357 | REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS

Parliament can create and change the law by way of statutes and statutory regulations.
Parliament can override or codify the common law, which means collecting and arranging
judicial decisions and pre-existing legislation according to topic matter into codified or
statutory form. In law, the effect of codification is to replace existing common law rules, not
creating new laws.

Common law can exist without equity, but equity cannot exist
without common law. Can you explain why?

In this question begin by explaining what common law and equity are. Then explain
whether equity can exist with/without Common law.

Common law is the law developed from custom and out of the decisions (case law or
precedent) of judges in the `superior' courts. In PNG, this would be the National and
Superior Courts.

Equity is a system of law in its own right. It accepts common law principles and rights but it
overrides them where it would be unjust or unconscionable to rely on the common law.

What is the main remedy in a common law action?

Damages.

In the event of a conflict between statute law and common law
which takes precedence and why?

Statute law takes precedence over common law. Common law has its source in the
decisions of judges who are independent of Parliament and the people. The common law
will only be maintained to the point where it conflicts with a statute.

Statute law is law made by Parliament in the form of Acts and regulations. Unlike the
judiciary, Parliament is made up of politicians who are people elected by, and answerable
to, the people who elect them through the electoral process. If people don't like the laws
that the politicians make, they can vote them out at election time. There is an element of
accountability, as far as politicians are concerned, which is absent in the case of judges.

What is Organic Law and why is it important in the PNG?

Explain what `Organic Law' is first and then explain why it is important.

Organic law is a set of foundational laws or regulations that have the status of constitutional
                                                                                                 REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS | 358

laws and along with the Constitution are the supreme law-making law of PNG. subject to
section 10 of the Constitution (construction of written laws), all acts, whether legislative,
executive or judicial, that are inconsistent with these documents are, to the extent of the
inconsistency, invalid and ineffective.

Organic Laws are defined in s. 12 of the PNG Constitution as laws made by Parliament that
are:

`(a) for or in the respect of a matter provision for which by way of an Organic Law is
authorized by this Constitution; and

(b) not inconsistent with this Constitution; and

(c) expressed to be an Organic Law'.

The Constitution and the Organic Law together regulate the legislative powers of the
national, provincial and local-level governments with each level having its own distinct law-
making powers. The law-making powers of the National Parliament law-making powers are
covered in s. 41 of the Organic Law, the provincial legislatures are outlined in s. 42, and
local government powers can be found in s. 44.

What is customary law and why is it important in PNG?

First, explain what customary law is and then explain its importance.

Custom or customary law is the rules and practices that govern the native people in society
in their way of life and their rules and responsibilities that they must abide by in their society.
Schedule 1.2 of the PNG Constitution, s 1 of the Interpretation Act 1975, and s. 1 of the
Underlying Act 2000 all use the same definition of custom as "the usages of indigenous
inhabitants of the country existing in relation to the matter in question at the time when and
the place in relation to which the matter arises, regardless of whether or not the custom or
usage has existed from time immemorial".

The Constitution and the Underlying Act 2000 both provide that in the absence of written
law, the courts must develop the underlying law, drawing first on customary laws and
usages, and only then on common law and equity. The reason lies in the very diverse
society that exists in PNG with over 1,000 customs found in different areas, each with its
own customary laws that guided them in their way of life. Schedule 2 of the Constitution
gives formal recognition to the importance of the role custom play in PNG society in the
development of an underlying law, particularly in areas of Family Law and property.

What does the phrase `Ignorance of the law is no excuse' mean to
359 | REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS

you?

Just note that this question is asking you for your opinion. So there is no set answer.
So begin by explaining what you think the expression `ignorance of the law is no
excuse' means and then go on and explain what it means to you.

Is it reasonable to expect that everyone knows the law? Do you?
How do you overcome this problem?

Really, another opinion question, so no right or wrong answer. Do you think it is
reasonable to expect everyone to know `the law'? Remember the question is asking
you how much law you do know. Then comment on whether the problem can be
overcome, for example, by education, or by the government carefully explaining what
the purpose of an Act is. Will that solve the problem? What do you think?

Explain why an understanding of different legal systems around
the world might be useful for you in business.

Again, a question asking for your opinion if you are in an import/export business.
What do you think are the benefits of having an understanding of other legal systems
is?

Understanding other legal systems you might be considering doing business with can help
you avoid liability and at minimise, risk. It is very important to understand the environment
in which you are planning to do business because minimizing liability exposure and avoiding
legal disputes must be a primary concern for those in business.

Legal systems vary widely around the world in their aims and the way they resolve disputes.
For a business to succeed, it is important to understand how other legal systems law apply
the law, how each country's legal system presents its own unique set of rules, and how the
political systems of each country work, as they make the law.

Why do you think it important to know what the term `person'
means in law?

Begin by explaining what the term `person' means and from that you should be able
to go on and explain its importance in law

`Person'in law means any human being but also includes any entities or legal persons
that are created by statute that are capable of suing or being sued such as companies,
partnerships, trusts, and even government agencies, and who have certain rights and
                                                                                                 REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS | 360

responsibilities under the law. They have the ability to enter into contracts, own property,
sue and be sued, and can be held accountable for their actions.

Why is it important to understand the difference between
international and domestic law in business?

Begin by explaining what the terms `international business law' and `domestic law'
mean and then explain why it is important to understand the difference.

International business law governs business between countries on a global scale and as
no two states have identical legal systems, it is important to understand what the legal
differences are between jurisdictions. Depending on what the business intends to do, for
example, to enter into a trade agreement to import and/or export goods or service, or to set
up a business in another country, businesses must understand and comply with the various
legal systems to ensure not only trade laws and regulations compliance, conventions,
and treaties, but also domestic legislation and commercial customs which together govern
international business transactions.

Domestic business law refers to the legal framework established within a country and how
it regulates how business is to be conducted within a country. It regulates the behaviour of
individuals, organisations, and governments within its borders and is primarily concerned
with maintaining order, protecting individual rights, and resolving disputes within the
country.

Together, and understanding of, and compliance, with international business law and
domestic business law helps businesses minimise exposure to legal exposure in the form
of litigation, and avoid trade disputes.

Why do you think an understanding of the main principles
underlying each source of law is important when trying to
understand how the law and business interact?

Note that the question is asking what your opinion is as to why an understanding of
the main principles underlying each source of law in PNG is important. So begin with
what you think are the main sources of law and then how it helps you understand
how law and business interact.

An understanding of the main principles underlying each source of law provides a
framework for understanding how and why each source of law has evolved, ensuring
consistency and predictability in legal outcomes and shaping the way business is
conducted. For business, an understanding as to the how and why of each source of
361 | REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS

law helps businesses comply with applicable laws and regulations, as well as providing
guidance on risk management issues.

What reasons can be put forward to explain why the PNG
National Constitution has undergone change at least 43 times
since its inception in 1975?

This is a Discussion Question with no set answer. It is seeking your opinion. Why do
you think there have been 43 amendments?

Why do you think the PNG Constitution has changed at least 43 times since it was
formally adopted in September 1975, the last time in 2016? Is it a `living' document that
is still evolving as PNG is evolving? Look at the Constitution (http://www.paclii.org/pg/
legis/consol_act/cotisopng534/). In 1975 was PNG ready for self-government and political
independence from Australia? Did the highland tribes need more time to grasp the idea of
nationhood. But has that changed?

What do you think is the purpose of having a Constitution? Do we
even need one?

Another opinion question. Think about why you have a Constitution and then think
about whether it is really necessary.

PNG's Constitution is what is called a codified constitution because it is incorporated into
a written document, and its purpose has historically been to limit the power of government.
It is simply a set of rules that set out how power is distributed between the Executive,
Parliament and the judiciary. These rules structure the government of a state. Without such
a set of rules, the state could not function and anarchy would reign. Without a constitution
the power of government is unlimited. It can be argued that what a constitution produces is
order but does it? Look at the PNG Constitution and see what it covers.

Is the Constitution too complicated and should it be simplified?
Explain why?

Yet another opinion question and with no `right' or `wrong' answer. What do you
think? The PNG Constitution certainly covers a lot of topics.

This is a Discussion Question with no set answer. Why do you think the PNG Constitution
has changed at least 43 times since it was formally adopted in September 1975, the last
time in 2016? Is it a `living' document that is still evolving as PNG is evolving? Look
at the Constitution (http://www.paclii.org/pg/legis/consol_act/cotisopng534/). In 1975 was
                                                                                                 REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS | 362

PNG ready for self-government and political independence from Australia because its
people, especially in the highlands, needed time to grasp the idea of nationhood. But has
that changed?

If you had the power, what would you change in the Constitution?
Explain why?

An opinion question and there is no `right' or `wrong' answer. The question is asking
you what YOUR opinion is on the Constitution. Is it too broad, too narrow, does it
adequately deal with the problems PNG currently have.

        Chapter 3

If you are injured because of the actions of another person, would
your preference be to take action against the person who injured
you in tort law or criminal law? Explain why.

Begin by explaining what each action involves, that is, tort law and criminal law,
and that will answer the question. Remember that tort law is about a civil action and
criminal law is about punishing the wrongdoer.

Both tort law and criminal law seek to impose duties on people, but they do it in different
ways and with different outcomes. Tort law is private in nature in the sense it is brought by
you as you are the person who has suffered some form of loss or damage and you are now
seeking compensation, usually in the form of monetary compensation (or damages) from
the person who caused that loss or damage.

Criminal law, on the other hand, is principally public in nature, as breaches are enforced
and `prosecuted' by the state, and the outcome for the wrongdoer is punishment, generally
imprisonment and/or a fine.

I would assume that normally you would want compensation and so bring a tort action such
as trespass to the person - assault and battery.

Problem answer

A problem question and note carefully what you are being asked to do. Note that the
question is asking you who owes a duty of care when there is an activity involving
363 | REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS

a recreational activity- the resort? The lifeguards? No-one? Begin by explaining that
this is a possible negligence action and that to succeed you need to establish duty,
breach and damage. At this point, the case is really about the question of who owes
a duty of care, so explain what a duty of care means and apply the facts. The facts
raise a couple of other issues that are dealt with later - the vicarious liability of the
resort and their defence of contributory negligence.

Negligence is omitting to do something that a reasonable person would do, or doing
something that a prudent and reasonable person would not do, to prevent harm. It is the
failure to exercise reasonable care and skill that results in unreasonable risk of foreseeable
injury.

In a negligence action you, as the plaintiff, have the onus of proof to establish 3 elements
- duty of care, breach of that duty and causation (damage caused by the defendant). If
any of those elements cannot established in your favour, no action. So begin with the duty
question.

In this case, as the plaintiff, you must first establish that the defendant owes you a duty of
care (here the focus is on the foreseeability of causing harm to you as the plaintiff.) This is
essentially a question of law that the judge decides based on common law principles. To
establish a `duty of care', you as the plaintiff, must show that the kind of harm you suffered
was reasonably foreseeable and was a result of the act/s or omission/s of the defendant.
One way you can do this is by showing that you were one of the class of people who would
foreseeably be at risk of injury if the defendant failed to take reasonable care. Duty will only
be imposed when it is reasonable in all the circumstances to do so.

From the facts we are told that the lifeguards on duty could see the sandbars and should
have been aware that diving into the water without checking its depth was dangerous. The
lifeguards sole purpose was to ensure the safety of swimmers and they owed them a duty
of care to ensure that the flags were properly place so as not to endanger their safety. They
failed to do this and so have satisfied the first element for a negligence action. You would
argue that this type of accident can be said to be well established because the facts fall into
a well-recognised duty category involving dangerous beach conditions.

Who would you sue? From the facts were are told that the resort employed the lifeguards.
That makes the lifeguards employees of the resort and at the time of the accident we are
told they were on duty. Now, who do you sue? It is highly unlikely the lifeguards would have
nay money to pay the amount of damages you would be seeking, so don't bother. However,
as the lifeguards were on duty at the time of the accident, it would be possible to sue the
resort under a principle called vicarious liability. That is where an employer can be held
liable for the actions of their employees. More on this later in the chapter.
                                                                                                 REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS | 364

The resort will argue that they have a defence called contributory negligence. This is a
defence where they will argue that a beachgoer would understand that diving into the water
first without checking it was safe was negligent, that is, that a reasonable person would
check the water depth before diving. You would argue that the purpose of the flags put into
the sand by the lifesavers indicated to all swimmers that it was safe to do so.

What does the term `reasonable person' mean to you?

Begin by defining what is a `reasonable person' and then explain what the term
means to you.

A reasonable person is a hypothetical person created by the courts who is of normal
intelligence, credited with such perception of the surrounding circumstances and such
knowledge of other pertinent matters as an average person would possess.

What factors does a court take into account when judging the
standard of care under common law?

Begin by explaining what the term `standard of care' means and then explain the
factors that a court takes into account when judging the standard of care.

The standard of care is the level (standard) that the defendant's conduct is measured
against objectively. It is a question of law, not fact. The question to consider is: What would
the reasonable person have done if they had been in the defendant's position?

It will vary from situation to situation, and is flexible depending on the circumstances of
the case--for example, is it an emergency?--as well as the personal characteristics of the
defendant, including age (young children are not expected to exercise the same degree of
care as adults), fitness, health, disability, skill, and knowledge. In the case of children, the
reasonable person test gives way to a different standard, that is, the standard of a child of
similar age and experience.

Do you think children should be treated differently to adults?

A personal opinion question. What do you think? Should children be treated
differently to adults?

In the case of children, you need to understand that they are less capable than adults in
taking care of themselves. So the reasonable person test gives way a different standard,
that is, the standard of a child of similar age and experience.
365 | REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS

If you are placed in a position of responsibility for children, directly or indirectly, you must
make the children's safety your foremost concern. This carries a more onerous duty of care
because children don't perceive danger or risk in the same way you do as an adult. There
is a duty of care placed on you but your obligation is to exercise reasonable care, not a duty
to prevent conduct that could be potentially harmful.

Problem answer

Another problem question and while it is a negligence question, this time you are
looking at the question of causation, so begin by explaining what causation is and
then look at the facts again and consider whether the driver should still have to bear
the consequences for your injury.

Remember that in a negligence action you, as the plaintiff, have to establish three elements
- duty, breach and damage. Drivers of vehicles owe a duty of care to their passengers and
other road users to exercise care at all times whilst driving. So the first step is satisfied.
There has been an accident and so the driver has breached their duty of care. But is the
driver responsible for heroin addiction?

The answer to the third question, that of causation, is that on the balance of probabilities
the answer is probably no. Causation is determined subjectively--that is, what the injured
person would have done, in the light of all relevant circumstances--as distinct from the
objective test of the conduct of a reasonable person. In this case, an intervening events
involving the actions of a third party giving you heroin to ease the pain, responsibility for the
harm, that is, the heroin addiction, should not be imposed on the driver.

Can you explain the purpose of causation in relation to the liability
of a defendant.

The question is only asking you to explain the purpose of causation, so define it.

Without causation, a defendant cannot be held financially liable for damages. The plaintiff
not only has to prove that the defendant owed them a duty of care and they breached that
duty, but also that the breach of duty caused the damage that led to the injury.

Having established duty, breach and damage, do you think the
defendant should be liable for all the damage have suffered?

An opinion question, so not necessarily a right or wrong answer. Explain the purpose
of causation and then whether you think it is fair or unfair that a defendant has to
                                                                                                 REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS | 366

pay the plaintiff's claim for the occurrence of a physical injury which the plaintiff was
prepared to accept?

It only seems fair that a defendant should only be liable for the damage that was
foreseeable and which was attributable to that which made their act wrongful. Why should
a plaintiff be compensated for the occurrence of a physical injury when he was prepared to
accept the risk?

Problem answer

This is a vicarious liability question. Begin by explaining why you probably would not
sue the barmaid and why you would look to trying to sue the employer on the basis
of vicarious liability. So explain what vicarious liability is, what has to be proved (the
elements) and whether you think you could win.

The barmaid is unlikely to have any money to pay for damages and legal costs, so vicarious
liability seems to be the only choice. This is where an employer can be held vicariously
liable for the acts or omissions of their employees who cause injury to a third party. The
barmaid was working at the time and that involved serving drinks to customers, so her
actions in serving the customer were in the course of her employment. However, by her
actions then of throwing the beer over you and followed by the glass were not what
a reasonable person would do. Vicarious liability is a sub-set of negligence and having
established that she was acting the course of her employment, discuss the four elements
of negligence - duty of care (of a barmaid), breach of duty (when barmaid throws contents
of glass and then the glass in your face), damage to your face (`but for test' and factual
causation), and damages (or compensation). Do the employer or the barmaid as the
defendant, have a defence such a contributory negligence?

Problem answer

Another problem question. Note from the facts where the injury to the mother
occurred and how it occurred. It was on a property she was at where there was a
garage sale (not a commercial market) and there was an uneven surface on the drive,
a typical of houses in the area,. And she was distracted by the goods on display. This
is a question then about the responsibility of the owner of the house as the occupier.

In this case the Wrongs (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1975, Part XII s 52 have replaced
the common law relating to the liability of occupiers for damages that are suffered on
premises. An occupier under the Wrongs (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1975 owes the
same duty as they would have in common law, that is, to exercise a duty of care to all
367 | REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS

visitors that are reasonable as in all the circumstances, so that it will be reasonably safe in
coming on to the premises to view the goods on sale.

In this case, would a reasonable person in your position as the occupier have seen that
there was a real risk to the mother as an uneven surface was atypical for that area? What
would a reasonable person have done in response to the risk? Was the risk obvious?
Should the mother have been more careful as she would have been aware of the risk?
Put up a sign maybe? Remember, what you are looking at is what is reasonable in the
circumstances.

If this was a commercial market, then there would be a much higher duty of care. Can you
see why?

Problem answer

Another problem question where you need to read the facts carefully. It concerns the
liability of a manufacturer of defective goods, so that should tell you this is about
product liability and negligence. So explain what product liability is and what needs
to be established to win the case. (It could also involve the Goods Act and fitness for
purpose and merchantable quality but that is week 6)

Manufacturers owe a duty to the consumer to take reasonable care when:

   a product is sold, that it reaches you as ultimate consumer in the form in which it left
      the manufacturer; and

   there is no reasonable possibility of intermediate examination by you; and
   it is reasonably foreseeable that, in the absence of reasonable care by the

      manufacturer, you will be injured.

If a product is negligently manufactured, assuming it is locally manufactured, that company
or business is responsible for how the product is made. As the case of Donoghue v
Stevenson illustrates, the manufacturer owes a duty of care to the consumer to take
reasonable care as absence of reasonable care in the manufacture of the product can
result in injury to you as the consumer, and liability common law for the manufacturer in
negligence.

Problem answer

The last problem question in this chapter. Here the facts tell you that there has
been an escape of water that has flooded the neighbour's mine caused by the
negligence of some independent contractors who were constructing a reservoir on
                                                                                                 REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS | 368

the defendant's property. The defendant knew nothing about the old mine shafts.
Should a person be held strictly liable? So begin with an explanation of strict liability
and then outline the elements that need to be satisfied and apply to the facts.

From the facts it would seem that the only cause of action available to you is strict liability,
or the rule in Rylands v Fletcher. In such a case the defendant is responsible for damages
that result from their act, whether they were negligent or not. It is a cause of action that can
arise if an occupier of land (the defendant) accumulates or brings on to their land something
which could be `dangerous' if it escapes in the course of some `non-natural' use of their
land to a place outside their occupation or control. They must keep it in at their peril, and
if they don't, they are strictly liable for all the damage which is deemed to be reasonably
foreseeable.

To have a cause of action in strict liability, you must be able to establish that:

   that the defendant brought something onto their land (a reservoir to store water);
   that what the defendant made a `non-natural use' of the land (the defendant was

      having a reservoir built to store water which is not a natural use of the land);
   that what the defendant brought onto the land was likely to do mischief if it escaped

      (where the water escaped on to your land, that is, you mine); and
   that there was an escape from the defendant's land over which the defendant had

      control or occupation to a place over which he had no control or occupation on to your
      land which caused damage of a reasonably foreseeable kind.

        Chapter 4

What elements are necessary for the creation of a valid simple
contract?

Agreement (consisting of offer & acceptance) plus Intention to Create Legal Relations plus
Consideration = Contract

Explain the difference between a formal and a simple contract.

Just note that the difference between this question and the one above is that this
question asks you to `Explain' and so you are going to have to write a more detailed
answer. The first question is asking you to list the elements, nothing more.
369 | REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS

Essentially, the difference between a formal and simple contract is consideration. A formal
contract is signed, sealed and delivered, and derives its validity from its form alone (it
does not need consideration). A simple contract requires the presence of all six elements
(including consideration) and compliance with any statutory requirements (form), and may
be oral, written, or partly oral and partly written.

Explain what sort of problems may arise in contract law for users
of e-commerce? Discuss.

Begin with an explanation of what you think an e-commerce is. Then you can go on and list
what you see are problems using e-commerce.

E-commerce, or electronic commerce, is about the buying and selling of goods and
services, and the transmission of money and data, over the internet.

While there are a number of advantages of e-commerce, we are being asked to consider
what are the disadvantages. While you may think of more, here are some:

   Online identity identification - is the visitor to a site who signs up, a legitimate
      customer?

   Limited face-to-face interaction - customers can't try before they buy and this can
      lead to buying indecisions and refunds.

   Product return and refund
   Technical challenges - this can include technical glitches such as software failure,

      website crashes.
   Data security concerns - cybersecurity attacks and spam are the biggest e-commerce

      challenge. E-commerce websites often store customers' card information to allow
      faster purchases in the future, so if a site is hacked, the hackers can acquire
      personnel information on you. Customer data is compromised, and the web sites of
      affected businesses lose sales from a damaged reputation.

Explain whether an unaddressed proposal in an electronic
communication to create a contract is an invitation to make an
offer or is it an offer that others can accept?

Note that the question says `Discuss'. Explain what invitation to treat is.

The Electronic Transaction Act 2018 applies to any kind of data message and electronic
document in the context of commercial and non-commercial activities. Section 19(2) of the
Electronic Transaction Act 2018 provides that where the proposal is not addressed to one
or more specific parties, but is generally accessible to parties online, it is to be treated as
                                                                                                 REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS | 370

an invitation to treat, that is, a party who receives an invitation to treat can make an offer to
enter into an agreement which anyone who receives it can do. They are not binding.

Problem answers

A problem question. Just note what you are being asked to do, that is, comment on
whether there is a contract based on an exchange of texts.

The exchange of texts is sufficient to constitute a note or memorandum to allow the court
to draw the conclusion that the documents are connected and intended to create a contract
as long as they contain the names of the parties, the subject matter and terms of the
agreement.

        Chapter 5

What problems, if any, can you see for consumers with the use of
standard form contracts?

Begin by explaining what a standard form contract is and then look at potential
problems with the use of standard form contracts. Remember that if you sign or
initial the contract, you are going to be bound by the fine print, whether you have
read it or not.

Standard form contracts are a commonly used and cost-effective option when conducting
business, as they avoid the transaction costs associated with negotiated contracts. They
are pre-prepared contracts where most of the terms are standard terms and conditions
issued on a repetitive basis to multiple people, set in advance with little or no negotiation
occurring between the parties and blank spaces for filling in names, dates and signatures.
Standard form contracts can be found everywhere including airline travel, terms and
conditions governing electricity and gas service, gym membership, online service contracts,
catching a bus, furniture and electrical retailers, and so on.

Problems for consumers (and even small businesses) are that they often lack the resources
and bargaining power to effectively review and negotiate terms in standard form contracts,
that is, you get them on a `take it or leave it' basis. These types of contracts contain a lot
of legal `fine print' that you as a consumer might not understand, you are often not given
time to read it anyway, and if you ask a salesperson what it means you are often told not
to worry. Standard form contracts also tend to be one-sided and benefit only the party who
371 | REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS

prepared the contract because they will want to shift as much of the risk with the contract
onto you.

What does the term `agreement' mean to you? How often do you
think you enter into an agreement and what it means legally?

Begin by explaining what the term `agreement' means and then think about how
often do you enter into an agreement and then comment on what you think it means
legally.

An agreement should not be confused with a contract. While a contract is based on an
agreement, not all agreements are going to become legally binding, enforceable contracts.
While both a contract and an agreement involve a meeting of the minds and an exchange of
promises, a contract is a more formalised agreement and, unlike an agreement, comes with
legal consequences and enforceable rights and obligations. An agreement is much more
informal and doesn't come with legal consequences.

An agreement is the first requirement for a valid contract. It is usually broken down into two
parts: an offer by one party and an acceptance by another party (or parties) and while there
is `a meeting of minds', an agreement generally lacks definitive elements like intention and
consideration that together make an agreement a contract.

How often do you enter into an agreement? For most people, including yourself, it would be
several times a day unless you never leave home, go online, answer the phone, or answer
the door to a stranger. But if you are an average person, then catching a bus to get to Uni,
buying lunch, just spending money on something, or promising a friend after class would all
constitute agreements.

Problem answer

A problem question. Just note that there are two parts to the question - could you
win? And did the Supreme Court have jurisdiction (or the power to hear the matter)?

What do you think the effect of the CAS arbitration agreement between the parties was? Is
there evidence of intention to enter into a contract from the conduct of the parties with each
athlete promising, in favour of the others, to abide by the rules, among other things, to the
selection process?

Because there was an exclusion clause contained in the documents, the Supreme Court
would not have jurisdiction to hear the matter, and the appellant's appeal would be
                                                                                                 REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS | 372

dismissed. So, you wouldn't win. It is worth noting that several interlocking documents may
be evidence of or constitute a multipartite contract.

Who were the parties (the plaintiff and defendant)?

The Plaintiff was Mrs Carlill and the defendant was the Carbolic Smoke Ball` Company

Briefly summarise the facts

The facts briefly were that the Carbolic Smoke Company had placed an advertisement in a
newspaper for their products, stating that any person who purchased and used their product
but still contracted influenza despite following the instructions would be entitled to a 100
pound reward. The company claimed that they had deposited 1,000 pounds in their bank
to meet any claims. Mrs Carlill saw one of these advertisements and bought the product.
However, despite using it properly, she still caught the flu. The defendant comapny refused
to pay the money promised in the advertisement claiming it was an invitation to treat.

What were the issues before the court?

The main issue before the court was whether the advertisement was an offer or an invitation
to treat.

Why did the court find the advertising could be construed as an
offer?

The Court of Appeal found for Mrs Carlill, finding that the advertisement amounted to a
unilateral offer by the defendant company. In complying with the conditions stipulated in the
advertisement, Mrs Carlill had accepted the offer. The Court also found that a reasonable
person reading the wording of the advertisement, and who acted in accordance with the
terms, would think that the company intended to be legally bound; an offer could indeed be
made to the world; wording need only be reasonably clear to imply terms rather than entirely
clear; and consideration was identifiable in the use of the smoke balls.

Just as a matter of interest, would you sue if you had bought a
product that the seller guaranteed would work and it didn't?

Well, what do you think? There is no right or wrong answer. This is just asking for your
opinion but briefly explain why.
373 | REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS

Explain what an offer is

The following are straightforward questions, but just note what they are asking. Is it
to explain, discuss or nothing? Don't ever just say `Yes' or `No' but always give an
explanation for saying `Yes' or `No'. Does it ask for an example? Or are there parts
that you have to answer. So it is important to carefully read the question.

An offer is a clear expression of the terms under which a person is prepared to enter into a
contract with another person and be bound by their acceptance of those terms.

What makes a statement an offer depends on what the parties had in mind (that is, the
intention of the parties, which is considered in the next section) at the time the statement
was made. In many disputes this will be impossible to determine, so the courts will rely on
an `objective test of a reasonable person'. That is, would a reasonable person have thought
that the offer was made with the intention of the person making it being bound as soon as it
was accepted by the person to whom it was addressed?

List and explain the main rules relating to an offer

Just note with this question there are two things you need to do: list the main rules
relating to an offer and explain them as you write them down.

In determining whether there is a valid offer or something else (for example, invitation to
treat, inquiry, or supply of information which cannot be accepted), there must be:

   an intention or willingness to be bound;
   a firm promise; and
   communication of the offer (preferably in writing if the transaction is important to the

      parties, though it can be oral or by conduct and by the offeror or a person authorised
      to make the offer or communicate it (that is, an agent of the offeror).

The following rules apply to offers generally:

   They may be made to one person, a group, or to the world at large.
   They may be kept open if supported by consideration.
   All terms must be brought to the notice of the offeree and followed exactly.
   An offer can be terminated or revoked before acceptance as long as there is not an

      option to keep the offer open for a certain period of time.
   A counter-offer or rejection terminates an offer.
   Lapse of time if the offeror specifies how long the offer will remain open.
   Death of either party if it is for personal services.
                                                                                                 REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS | 374

   Failure of a condition, that is, a condition precedent or subsequent.

Explain what is required for an offer to be validly accepted.

Here is a list of what is required for an offer to be validly accepted but you would
need to explain each.

If there is to be agreement, the acceptance:

   must be made in reliance on the offer
   must be strictly in accordance with the terms of the offer
   must be communicated to the offeror orally, in writing or by conduct
   cannot be a cross-offer
   can be accepted only by the party to whom the offer was made
   must be absolute and unqualified; and
   once made, cannot be revoked without the assent of the offeror.

Explain why it is necessary to distinguish between an offer and an
invitation to treat from the perspective of both a customer and a
seller.

Here is a question where you need to read carefully because there are two parts to
it. You have to comment on why it is necessary to distinguish between an offer and
acceptance from the perspective of a customer and a seller. So, begin by explaining
what is an offer and then what is an invitation to treat. Then look at how a customer
and seller view them.

An invitation to treat is not an offer and, unlike an offer, cannot be accepted. It is only an
expression of a willingness to start the offer and acceptance process, which in time may
produce an offer and acceptance, but the party making an invitation to treat never intends
to be bound. An offer, on the other hand, is a clear expression of the terms under which
a person is prepared to enter into a contract with another person and be bound by their
acceptance of those terms. What makes a statement an offer depends on what the parties
had in mind (that is, the intention of the parties, which is considered in the next section) at
the time the statement was made.

Now comment on how you think a customer and seller view an offer and invitation to treat.
Perhaps they don't think about it but what do you think?
375 | REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS

Under what circumstances will an apparent invitation to treat
situation become an offer?

In this question note the word `circumstances'. It is plural, so don't think you only
need to mention one circumstance.

If it is clear in the circumstances that a party intends their words or conduct to constitute
an offer, then the courts will be prepared to construe it as such. An example of where
an advertisement was considered to be an offer rather than one inviting offers (called `an
invitation to treat') was Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co [1893] 1 QB 256, where the court
found that the words used in the company's advertising were sufficiently specific to show
to a reasonable person that it intended to be bound. Similarly, the use of words such as
`rain check' or phrases such as `until stocks run out' or `one per customer' suggests that the
offeror intended the offer to be promissory rather than a calling for offers.

Just note that it is important to look carefully at the words and/or conduct of the party making
the offer (the offeror) to determine whether they are promissory or not, in order to see
whether they could amount to an offer. Is there an intention or willingness to be bound?

Explain under what circumstances an offer can be terminated.

Again, the question uses the plural `circumstances', and the word `explain'. So, two
points to note. As in the last question, don't think you only need to mention one
circumstance BUT in addition, this time you have to explain what each circumstance
is.

The circumstances under which an offer can be terminated include:

   Revocation - withdrawal of the offer by the offeror before the offeree's acceptance.
   Rejection or counter-offer - where the offer is rejected by the offeree's words, conduct

      or a counter-offer.
   Lapse of time - where the offeror has specified a time during which the offer will

      remain open. If no time limit is specified, then the offer will remain open for a
      reasonable time and this depends to some extent on the life span of the goods, that
      is, how long will they last?
   Death by either party - If the offeree learns of your death (and you are the offeror)
      before acceptance of the offer, then a purported acceptance will be ineffective
      because the offer will have lapsed. But where the offeree is unaware of your death, it
      is possible that a valid acceptance can still bind your estate if the offer does not
      involve the personal involvement of the deceased offeror.
   Lapse by failure of a condition - the offer could be subject to a condition, a condition
                                      REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS | 376

precedent or a condition subsequent.

Explain the difference between a condition precedent and a
condition subsequent and give an example of each in relation to
the purchase of a car.

Just note that the question is not only asking you to explain what conditions
precedent and subsequent are but also to give an example of each.

A condition precedent is a clause or term in the agreement stating that a term in the
agreement must first be satisfied for a contract to come into existence. For example, a `I will
buy the car subject to finance' clause in an agreement, if not fulfilled, causes the offer to
lapse.

A condition subsequent clause, on the other hand, is a term in the contract that may cause
the contract to terminate if the parties have stated that the occurrence of a particular event
will give the parties that right. For example, I will return the car in 7 days if fuel consumption
exceeds 15lt per 100kms.

Just note that the essential difference between the condition precedent and the condition
subsequent is that in the latter the contract is already in operation.

Does acceptance have to be made strictly in accordance with the
terms of the offer?

Here is a question where you can start with a `Yes' or `No' and then explain why.

An acceptance converts the promise or promises of the offeror (represented by the offer)
into an agreement. Before acceptance of the offer, neither party is bound to the agreement;
after acceptance. The effect of acceptance is that the offeree agrees to take exactly what is
offered and to pay the price required.

Can anyone accept an offer even if it is not made to them?

Note here that the key word is `not'. As in the last question, you can start your answer
with a `Yes' or `No' and then explain why.

No. Only the person or persons to whom the offer was directed, or their authorised agent,
can accept the offer. If someone else tries to accept the offer, that `acceptance' is probably
only at best an offer itself, which the original offeror, who is now the offeree, can accept or
377 | REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS

reject as they wish. Where the offer is made to the world at large, acceptance is by those
members of the public who perform the conditions set out in the offer.

Can silence ever amount to acceptance?

This question could be answered with a `Yes' or `No' but don't fall for that trap.
Give an explanation. You could begin your answer with a statement that generally
acceptance must be communicated to the offeror but there are situations where
silence can amount to acceptance and then explain what they are.

There are situations where silence can amount to acceptance and they include:

   where the offeree has signed an agreement indicating continuing acceptance of
      delivery until further notification--for example, subscriptions to internet services or
      membership of a local gym debited on a monthly basis, where the offeree, by their
      conduct, has allowed work to go ahead and made progress payments and where you
      dispense with the requirement of communication, and acceptance is to be by
      performance of an act;

   where there is a history of prior dealings between the parties;
   where it is just and equitable - for example, where the conduct of the proposed tenant

      led the owner to believe that the tenant would lease the premises and the owner went
      ahead and undertook major demolition and construction work in that belief;
   by conduct, where the parties by their actions show that they intend to be bound; and
   where the postal rule applies

The ultimate issue is whether a reasonable bystander would regard the conduct of the
offeree, including their silence, as suggesting to the offeror that the offer has been accepted.

Could an offer sent by email be accepted by letter if the offeror
had not specified a particular method of acceptance? Give
reasons.

Just note here that you need to give reasons for your answer. It really means the
same as `Explain'.

The answer is `probably' because to some extent it is going to depend on what the offer
was. If it was something perishable or goods in a volatile market, it can be implied that
the offeror would have intended that acceptance be in the same mode or quicker than the
way the offer was delivered. If the item was not perishable or it was clear to a reasonable
                                                                                                 REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS | 378

person that a fast reply was not of the essence, then acceptance by mail would probably be
acceptable.

Explain why the rules on acceptance should differ between
contracts by post and contracts by instantaneous communication
such as email.

The difference lies partly in technology. Contracts by post have been overtaken by
instantaneous communications and it has impacted on when agreement may be reached.
Where the parties contemplate the use of the post as a medium of exchange of promises,
the offeror must have contemplated and intended that the offer be accepted by the act of
posting, in which case the rules as to the time of acceptance change. Thus:

   an offer made by letter is not effective until it is received by the offeree; and
   acceptance is effective as soon as it is posted.

But postal acceptance is much slower as a contract is formed when the letter goes in the
post box. The fact that the offeror is not aware of the posting of the letter, or even if the letter
is lost in the post, or is wrongly addressed to the offeree or is even never delivered does
not matter. The post office is the agent of the offeror (unless the offeror states otherwise)
and this means that communication to the post office is communication to the offeror but
the offeror will not know whether the offer has been accepted until it arrives in his letter box
some days after it was posted by the offeree. By posting the acceptance, the offeree has
done all that is required of them and even if time is of the essence, it could take days for the
acceptance to reach the offeror.

The main reason for different rules between acceptance by post and instantaneous
communication or e-commerce is the benefit of speed of acceptance. The time of receipt
of the electronic communication is the time when the electronic communication is capable
of being retrieved by the addressee or, if no system is designated, when the electronic
communication comes to the attention of the addressee. In other words, almost
instantaneously.

How can businesses that make offers over the internet protect
themselves from the risk of loss associated with the rules of offer
and acceptance?

Just make sure that you discuss offers over the net and not offers generally.
379 | REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS

To minimise problems with contract formation where the method of transaction is email or
the internet, the person controlling the transaction should make it clear:

   what is to be taken as an offer or what is required for an acceptance
   when electronic communications are to take effect from, for example, when

      subscriptions are to end, as well as
   specifying that property in the goods will not transfer to the buyer until payment has

      been processed.

Problem answer

Another problem question. What is important here is what time did the acceptance
take place? In addition, you need to comment on whether La Forrest accepted
the offer and whether it was possible to have an acceptance by email to create
contractual relations. So, if you are smart you will refer to the Electronic Transaction
in your answer.

Yes, acceptance had taken place and La Forrest would be bound. An acceptance by email
was capable of creating legal relations under the Electronic Transactions Act 2021, and in
this case the parties had reached a binding agreement. While the Electronic Transactions
Act provides times for receipt and dispatch, there was not a clear indication of the time
at which the contract was formed. An acceptance by email was capable of creating
legal relations under the Electronic Transaction Act 2021, and in this case the parties
had reached a binding agreement. Formation of the contract occurred when the offeror
received the offeree's acceptance at the server they had stipulated. This was either when
the electronic message entered the designated information system because the offeror
has designated their email address; or the place where the addressee had their place of
business.

It is also worth noting that a series of emails together are capable of creating legal relations
as they embody all the terms that are legally necessary to form a contract.

        Chapter 6
                                                                                                 REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS | 380

Must intention to create legal relations be present in every
contract?

Even though it appears the questions could be answered with a simple `Yes' or `No',
still explain why you answer `Yes' or `No'.

The fact that the parties have reached an agreement is only the start of determining whether
there is a contract. The next step in determining whether there is a contract is what the
parties intended. Did the parties must intend to create legal relations? This can be express
(words, writing or conduct) or implied; but if it is not present, there can be no contract.
It must be present in every simple contract.

Most commercial agreements inherently possess this intention. However, it can be difficult
to establish in domestic or social agreements. The courts will check to see if the parties
meant to make a legal contract by looking at their objective intention.

How can you tell whether an advertisement is an offer or an
invitation to treat? Explain.

Begin by explaining what an offer and invitation to treat are. Then explain how you
tell the difference.

Intention can be determined by considering the relevant context and the relationship
between the parties, and determining what inferences can be drawn from that; that is, by
judging the parties on what they had said, written or done as well as taking into `account the
subject matter of the agreement, the status of the parties, their relationship to one another
and other surrounding circumstances'. The parties rarely make any direct or express
reference to the question of intention to contract within the contract itself. Where references
are made, they are generally found only in commercial (or business) agreements and are
invariably expressed in a negative way; that is, by way of terms that expressly and clearly
state that the parties don't intend to be legally bound.

Why do you think that in most agreements of a commercial
nature the law assumes that the parties intend to create legal
relations?

Begin with an explanation of what an intention to create legal relations means. Then
go on and explain why there is a presumption of an intention to create legal relations
in a commercial arrangement.

Intention to create legal relations is defined as an intention to enter a legally binding
381 | REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS

agreement or contract. In social or domestic agreements, the parties do not usually
contemplate legal relations because if one party fails to honour their promise, the
consequences are not usually financially significant.

In business or commercial arrangements where the relationship is not personal and is
based on a business or commercial transaction, it is presumed that the parties intend to
create legal relations. This is generally because of the financial consequences involved in
doing business together. Each party involved in the contract is accepting the terms and
providing consideration with the intention for the contract to be enforceable by the law. It
gives the parties an element of certainty for the parties to the contract that in the event of
a breach, there will be legal consequences. In determining if there is intent, the courts take
an objective approach.

Is it possible to avoid creating legal relations in a commercial/
business agreement? Explain.

While it would be easy to just say `Yes', don't. The question asks you to `Discuss', so
that means writing an answer to support `Yes'.

The parties can negotiate on the principal terms of a proposed business or commercial
transaction but intend to enter into a formal contractual document at a later date. In such
a case, even though there may be offer and acceptance, the parties may make their
agreement `subject to contract' or `subject to preparation of a formal contract', thus avoiding
creating legal relations until the execution of a formal agreement.

The parties to a commercial agreement may also avoid a binding agreement by including
an "Honour clause", indicating that the agreement is binding in honour only and not legally
binding.

Why aren't voluntary agreements contracts? Explain.

Quite simply, there is no evidence of an intention to create legal relations by the parties
in the agreement. Where there is an agreement, it is usually clear from the surrounding
circumstances that a contract was not intended at the time of entering into the agreement.
There is a lack of mutual intention to create a legally binding agreement. Compare this with
a commercial situation where a reasonable person looking objectively at the facts would
conclude that the parties would have intended an intention to create legal relations.

Can you list any agreements that you could enter into daily that
could result in an inference that contractual relations were not
           REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS | 382

intended?

Up to you to answer this one. The question is asking you to list any agreements that
you could enter into daily.

Why do you think that in most agreements of a voluntary nature
the law assumes that the parties do not intend to create legal
relations?

Begin by explaining what a voluntary agreement is, and then why the law assumes
that the parties do not intend to create legal relations.

A voluntary agreement can be defined as an agreement where the parties normally do not
intend to create legal relations. While there might be an agreement between the parties,
it is usually clear from the surrounding circumstances that the parties did not intend at the
time of entering into the agreement to create a contract, for example, where the work of one
party was voluntary and they did not want payment for their services. Judged objectively,
a reasonable person would conclude that the agreement was a voluntary one, and that the
parties did not intend to create relations, so no contract.

Is it possible to create legally binding agreement out of a social or
family relationship? Explain why.

While you could answer this as `Yes' or `No', just note the question is asking you to
`Discuss' so you need to add your reasons why you said `Yes' or `No'.

It is presumed that the parties in a social or family relationship do not intend to create
legal relations, even though the agreements may have contained promises made by the
parties. In these cases the court objectively determines whether the parties intended to
create legal relations. If no such intention exists, the agreement will be no more than
an unenforceable promise. This is because it is generally unusual for an arrangement
between family members or social outings to be thought of in terms of legal consequences
if something goes wrong, for example, you agree to go to the movies with a friend and your
friend forgets to turn-up, are you going to sue them?

Agreements made in family or social relationships can sometimes be legally binding. It
depends on the merits of each case and to determine whether there is the required
intention, the plaintiff has to produce evidence to show that a contract was intended. The
court will then look at the conduct of the parties and decide whether a reasonable person,
in the same position as the plaintiff, would have intended to create an enforceable contract.
If the consequences for the plaintiff were serious, then the plaintiff will probably succeed
383 | REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS

in their claim. However, if you are considering suing your friend for not turning up at the
movies, forget it.

Agreements made in a domestic relationship are considered unenforceable, for example,
agreements made while the husband and wife still live together or in a continuing de facto
relationship, it is assumed that the parties don't intend to create legal relations. However,
if the parties are separated at the time of the agreement, then the agreement will be
enforceable.

In the agreements that you enter into, do you consider the
question of intention? Explain why.

While you could answer this as `Yes' or `No', just note the question is asking you to
`Discuss', but also note that this time the question is focussing on whether you think
about the question of intention when entering into an agreement.

        Chapter 7

Should consideration still be an essential element in a contract
today? What does it achieve?

Begin with an explanation of what consideration is and then explain whether you
think it should still be considered an essential element.

Explain the distinction between executed, executory and past
consideration.

Define each of the terms and to you should have answered the question.

Executed or present consideration is where an act is done in return for a promise.

Executory or future consideration is where the parties exchange promises, each promise
being consideration for the other. In this type of situation, consideration is intended to be
performed in the future.

Past consideration (or past performance) is where the promise is given after an act has
been performed and is generally not enforceable.
                                                                                                 REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS | 384

Why don't formal contracts, such as deeds, require consideration?

Begin by explaining what a formal contract is and then explain why consideration is
        not needed.

A formal contract is a written agreement between two or more parties that outlines the
        terms of their relationship and is legally binding. A deed is a written agreement that
        confirms an agreement

between parties which does not require consideration, but must be signed, sealed and
        delivered. It must state that there is an intention to be a deed. It derives its validity
        from itsform alone.

Why is past consideration no consideration?

Note the question is asking you what is past consideration, so define it and explain
why it is no consideration. A good question to answer with an example after your
definition.

Past consideration (or past performance) is where the promise is given after an act has
been performed and is generally not enforceable. Let's say you agree to clean your friend's
car. After you have finished he says, "Great job! I'll pay you K$50." Is there a contract?
Your ex-friend does not have a contractual obligation to pay you because your act occurred
in the past. It was never agreed that you should clean your friend's car. They might be
grateful and could feel a moral obligation towards you but there is no contract. To have legal
consideration the parties must reach an agreement prior to cleaning as to what each party
will give and what each party will get.

Why is repeating an existing duty not good consideration

Repeating an existing duty owed to the promisor is insufficient consideration because there
is no detriment. If you are already contractually bound to the promisor to complete a task,
the general rule is that in performing that task you are doing no more than you contractually
agreed to do. However, acts in excess of your duty would amount to good consideration to
support a new contract

Problem answer

Another problem question. The questions is about forbearance to sue, so begin by
explaining what it is and then whether it can be used here. Interestingly, the claim is
probably bad in law but that will not matter.
385 | REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS

Forebearance to sue can amount to good consideration. It is good consideration even if the
promise is to forbear only for a limited period or to dispense A promise not to enforce a valid
claim and/or a promise to give up a claim entirely can be good consideration for a promise
given in return. with a doubtful, but reasonable, legal claim. The claim that is promised to
be relinquished must be:

   honestly held (there must be a genuine dispute); and
   one in which the claimant has a bona fide belief that the liability is real at the time of

      agreement.

In this case there appears to be a genuine dispute between the parties as to their respective
rights and obligations, and the agreement to repair the car was a compromise of that
dispute. The compromise was good consideration for a new contract. If a party choose to
compromise a claim, there must be a genuine dispute and the bargaining aspect of the
agreement must be evident between both parties. It does not matter that the plaintiff may
not actually have had an enforceable claim.

        Chapter 8

Problem answer

A problem question concerning infants. Just remember that the law looks at
beneficial contracts or service where infants are concerned as still being valid if they
contain unfavourable terms. So begin by explaining what is a beneficial contract of
service, then what the courts look at and apply to the facts above.

When looking at covenants in contracts of employment, look at the contract as a whole. In
this case, even though the clause about not practising within 200kms of Port Moresby may
be onerous, the contract taken as a whole is probably okay. As the original contract was
for the defendant for education and employment, while it contained onerous terms, weighed
against the benefits, looking at the contract as a whole it was for the benefit of infant.

Discuss how a court decides whether goods or services
purchased by an infant will result in a valid contract.

Note the question is asking you how a court decides (not how you decide) whether goods
or services are capable of being necessaries. Don't comment on beneficial contracts of
                                                                                                 REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS | 386

service. So begin by defining necessaries, and then what the courts look at to establish if
the goods or services are necessaries.

The definition of necessaries includes articles and services essential for the reasonable
comfort of the infant, as well as basic food, medicine, education, clothing and shelter. This
means that lifestyle and the infant's situation must be considered when trying to determine
whether the goods or services are capable of being necessaries or not looking at the
transaction as a whole. Are the goods capable of being necessaries and if they are, are
the goods or services necessaries in the particular circumstances (a question of fact)?The
court will also contract consider whether, on balance the contract is favourable for the infant,
which means that the infant should only pay a reasonable price for the goods or services.

Samantha, an infant, obtained a loan of money from Lucy by
telling her that she was 19 when in fact she was only 16. Samantha
subsequently defaulted on the loan repayments and Lucy wants
to know whether she can recover her money. Advise Lucy.

Ignore the criminal law issue here. As a rule of thumb, infants normally do not have the
capacity to obtain a loan because they lack the ability to understand what they are getting
themselves into and they can lack a capacity to repay.

As this appears to be an unsecured loan to Sam who has obtained a load for no known
purpose, the contract would appear to be unenforceable and Lucy would be unable to
recover the money.

Ryan, a 78 year old-alcoholic who, during a drinking session with
Bromley, was induced to sell his farm to him for much less than its
market value. A written contract was drawn up at the Bar and
signed by both parties. Ryan later refused to go through with the
sale.

Is the contract that Ryan signed enforceable by Bromley? Discuss.

Note that Ryan is a 78 year-old alcoholic, so the question here is whether Ryan would
understand what he was signing.

Contracts with a mentally unsound or intoxicated person are usually regarded as being
voidable at the option of, in this case, Ryan unless they are necessaries. From the facts,
the sale of his farm would not be regarded by the courts as being something that fell within
the ambit of necessaries. So where the goods are not necessaries, Ryan may be able to
387 | REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS

repudiate the contract if and when he sobers up. The onus of proof is on Ryan and must
occur within a reasonable time of him regaining sobriety or soundness of mind. In this case
Bromley would have realised Ryan was seriously affected by alcohol and that his judgment
would have been seriously affected as a result. The disability was present at the time of
contracting.

Steinberg, a minor, applied for and was allotted shares in a
company when she was 16. She received no dividends and
attended no company meetings. Before she turned 18 she
repudiated the contract and tried to recover the money she had
paid for the shares. Can she? Discuss.

In this case, just note her age when Steinberg repudiated the contract and what the
contract was about. Unlike question 2 above, in this case she has acquired an interest in
subject matter of a permanent and continuous nature, that is, the purchase of shares.

This is a contract that is valid unless and until it is avoided, that is, it is voidable. When
an infant repudiates a voidable contract during infancy, which in this case she did before
she turned 18, the rights and liabilities that accrue after repudiation cease. This means that
Steinberg will remain liable for any obligations accrued up to the time of repudiation of the
contract unless there has been a total failure of consideration.

Money paid under a voidable contract is not able to be recovered unless the Steinberg
has received no benefit from the contract what so ever; that is, there has been a total
failure of consideration. In this case, while Steinberg could have her name removed from
the company register and she could rescind the contract, she would not be able to recover
the money she had paid for the shares. The allocation of the shares had conferred a benefit
on her, so there was not a total failure of consideration.

        Chapter 9

Problem answer

In this fact situation, you need to work out first what area of law may apply. Read
the facts carefully and you should realise that there has been a mistake by the
Commission as to the whereabouts of a tanker. What type of mistake? What are
elements that need to be established to establish the mistake. Apply to the facts.
                                                                                                 REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS | 388

From the facts it appears that this would be a case of mistake as to the existence of
subject matter. A common mistake must involve the existence or identity of the contract's
subject matter. The Commission, by calling for tenders has impliedly promised that there is
a tanker and that it can be located at Jourmaund Reef, leading you to believe that the tanker
existed. On the strength of this promise you have successfully tendered for the salvage
of the tanker, then you hired a ship, fitted it out and proceeded to the location given by
the Commission and spent a month fruitlessly searching for a ship that didn't exist. The
acceptance of the tender by the Commission created a contract which the Commission has
broken by its failure to perform, that is, to provide a salvageable tanker. The Commission
cannot now not accept its responsibilities.

Explain why money paid under a mistake of law may be
recoverable while a party who makes a mistake wrongly
interpreting a statute, or a mistake of judgment (for example,
buying clothes and then not liking the style or colour) or a mistake
as to quality, generally cannot rely on the mistake to avoid the
contract.

Begin by explaining what a mistake is and that only mistakes of fact can render a
contract void.

Only mistakes of fact can render a contract void. If one of the parties makes a mistake of law
(for example, wrongly interpreting a statute), a mistake of judgment (for example, buying
clothes and then not liking the style or colour), or a mistake as to quality, then that party
generally cannot rely on the mistake to avoid the contract. `Buyer beware'. However, money
paid under a mistake of law may be recoverable if the money was paid by the payer under a
mistaken belief that they were under a legal obligation to pay it or that the payee was legally
entitled to payment of it and is recoverable from the payee (on the basis of restitution).

You were in London when you received an order from a Middle
East agent for `Moroccan horsebeans described here as feveroles'.
Not knowing what the term meant, you asked the defendants,
who replied that feveroles were the same as horsebeans, which
they were in a position to supply. The plaintiffs then ordered a
quantity of horsebeans from the defendants and the goods so
described in the written sale document that was drawn up were
delivered to the plaintiffs, who in turn shipped them to Egypt.
When they reached Egypt, the plaintiffs refused to accept them
since they were not feveroles. Had the plaintiffs any cause of
389 | REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS

action against the defendants?

Another case of mistake. Read the facts again. The order was for `feveroles', not
`Moroccan horsebeans' and the plaintiff was given the wrong information by the
defendant. The buyer refused to accept delivery as they were not what they ordered.

This would appear to be a case of mutual mistake where the parties are talking about
different things, so there is no real agreement between them. Each of the parties is unaware
of the error and are mutually mistaken as to what the other party wants. In other words, the
offer and acceptance are not the same, so the contract is void ab initio.

Buka has a very poor understanding of English. When you
approached him with a document for his signature, Buka was
under the honest and mistaken belief that what he was to sign
was only a letter of introduction to his agent. What he in fact
signed was a lease of his shop premises to you --which at no time
did Buka intend or want to do. You are now suing for specific
performance (to force him to give you his shop) and damages for
breach of contract. Advise Buka.

In this fact situation, note that Buka has a poor understanding of English and doesn't
understand what it is he is signing. A classic case of non est factum (it is not
my deed). Begin by explaining what non est factum means and then apply your
understanding of the term to the facts.

Non est factum (Latin for "it is not [my] deed") is a defence that allows a signing party such
as Buka to escape performance of the agreement as it is fundamentally different from what
he thought or intended to execute or sign, making the contract void.

Buka, as the signing party, would have to argue that the agreement was void because it
was radically different from what he thought it was. To succeed in a plea of non est factum,
two conditions must be met:

   Buka must believe that the document he signed was radically different from what he
      believed it to be--the mistake must go to the fundamental nature of the document and
      not its contents. From the facts, Buka thought he was signing a letter of introduction to
      his agent, not a lease of his shop; and

   there must be an absence of carelessness or negligence in the execution of the
      document. Buka appears to have signed the `document in good faith and did not
      understand it was for the lease of his shop because of his poor understanding of
      English.
                                                                                                 REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS | 390

Buka could successfully argue this was a case of non est factum and that you will not get
either damages or an order of specific performance.

Explain why you would prefer to base a case on unilateral mistake
rather than common mistake or mutual mistake, if there is a third
party involved.

In this question, begin by explaining what unilateral, common and mutual mistake are
and then which of the three mistakes is your preference if a third party was involved.

In the case of a common mistake, the parties acknowledge the existence of an agreement
(for that is admitted) but, because of a fundamental assumption as to the existence
or identity of the subject matter, they wish the court to set the agreement aside from
the beginning. A common mistake that goes to the very root of the contract will
potentially render the contract void ab initio (from the outset).

In the case of mutual mistake, as the parties are talking about different things, there is no
real agreement between them. If the conflicting understanding is so severe that the courts
cannot find an agreement, the contract is generally treated as void initio (from the outset).

In the case of unilateral mistake, there is a lack of agreement between the parties. However,
here only one party to the contract knows, or ought to be reasonably aware, of the mistake
and does nothing to correct it. The contract is usually voidable which means the innocent
party, when they act, can rescind the contract or continue with the contract and hope it is
okay (remember what voidable means).

So, what is your preference?

Is there a contract between you and Bruce? Explain why/why
not. Do you think you have done enough to check on the identity
of Bruce?

Read the whole situation and questions carefully and note that you are asked to do
two things: consider whether there is a contract and then whether you did enough
to check the ID of the person whom you dealt with. You are led to believe that the
customer is someone else. Is this because of a mistake or a misrepresentation over
identity? But only one party is mistaken, so this is a case of unilateral mistake. So,
begin by explaining what unilateral mistake is and then what the situation is where
the parties meet face-to-face.

This a case of unilateral mistake as you are led to believe by the customer that he is Bruce
391 | REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS

Wayne, an MP. A unilateral mistake involves a lack of agreement between the parties. Here
only one party knew of the mistake as he created it and was obviously not going to do
anything about correcting it. A case of fraud but ignore the criminal law in this question.

Where the parties meet face-to-face, the onus is on you (because you are the plaintiff
pleading the mistake of identity) and you are going to have to show that you intended only
with Bruce and no-one else, that you never intended to deal with whoever the customer
was, and that you took reasonable precautions to check the customer's details, and the
customer knew you never intended to deal with anyone but Bruce.

If these points can be established the court will treat the contract as void. However, if the
intention is to deal with the customer, whoever they might be, then the contract can only
be treated as voidable. That would not be a problem if it was a two-party situation but here
you have Brooks, a third party and a voidable contract. If the swindling customer can sell
the goods before you realise you have been swindled and can rescind (remember it is a
voidable contract and that means it is valid and binding until rescinded), a purchaser buys
the jewellery for value in good faith gets good title and you are left with the problem of
finding the swindler if you want to get your money back.

The question you need to consider here is whether you think you have done enough to
establish that the customer was a fraudster and not Bruce?

The vendor of a farm that you are interested in buying told you
that it had never been used to raise cattle but in his judgment the
property would easily be capable of carrying 500 cattle. This
proved to be untrue. Can you now avoid the contract? Explain
how.

From the facts you have been given, this is probably a case of innocent
misrepresentation. The vendor has told you the property had never been used to
raise cattle but in his opinion it could carry up to 500 cattle. Think about the three
possibilities for misrepresentation - fraudulent, innocent or negligent. Briefly explain
each and then suggest which is likely to apply.

From the information given, it would appear to be a case of innocent misrepresentation. An
innocent misrepresentation is a misstatement of a material fact, but made without intention
to mislead, that is, in good faith by the farmer and not known by them to be false. You are
told the farmer had never used the property to raise cattle but, in his judgment, thought it
could easily carry 500 cattle. It can't be a fraudulent misrepresentation because the farmer's
statement was not one of fact made knowingly to be untrue. Note he said he had never
raised cattle but in his judgment thought it would carry 500 cattle. And probably not a
                                                                                                 REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS | 392

negligent misrepresentation, again because of the qualifications in the farmer's reply, that
is, he has told you he never raised cattle and so his judgment is suspect because he has
never raised cattle. This would alert a reasonable person to make further enquiries.

Eddie had a 2023 Toyota Prado Land Cruiser, which he wanted to
sell. He advertised it for sale for K100,000. Eddie eventually sold it
to Maria, who took it away, after giving him K90,000 cash.
Unfortunately, the notes were forgeries and when he took the
money to the bank the following morning, the bank refused to
accept it and called the police. In the meantime, Maria sold the
car through a firm of car dealers to Intergalactic Finance, who had
no notice that Maria had acquired the car fraudulently. You bought
the car in good faith and without notice of the defect in title. Do
you have good title to it?

In this case, the facts tell you that this is more likely a question of unilateral mistake
than fraudulent misrepresentation, so begin by explaining why it is not fraudulent
misrepresentation and why unilateral mistake. Then explain what sort of title did
Intergalactic get and then what sort of title do you get?

A representation is a statement of past or present fact made by one party either before or
at the time of making the contract that induces the other party to enter into the contract.
Fraudulent misrepresentation refers to a deliberate false statement made with the intention
of inducing someone to enter a contract. The contract, as it is induced by fraud, is voidable
at your option if you are the deceived party because it does not represent the parties' true
agreement. The problem you have here from the facts is that it doesn't appear that Maria
has made any false representations.

Is it a case of unilateral mistake then? In the case of a unilateral mistake one party to the
contract knows, or ought to be reasonably aware, of the mistake and does nothing to correct
it. Eddie has accepted the K90,000 under the mistaken belief that the notes were good
currency and was not aware of a problem until he went to the bank the following day.

The importance of unilateral mistake is that it makes the contract void ab initio (void from the
beginning). This means that a third party such as, in this case, Intergalactic Finance, cannot
get good title to Toyota. This means they cannot pass on good title to you as they don't
have a good title. Eddie still has ownership and can claim his car back from whoever has
possession, which is you. You will have to get your money back from Intergalactic Finance
as you bought the vehicle from them. They, in turn, have to find Maria, and try and recover
their money from her.
393 | REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS

What would you need to establish if you were the plaintiff in order
to succeed in an action involving a negligent misrepresentation?
Explain why.

Explain what a negligent misrepresentation is and what you need to establish a case
in negligent misrepresentation.

Negligent misrepresentation lies in the tort of negligence, not contract. It arises when a
person provides oral or written advice to another person in `serious circumstances', knowing
that the information or advice may be acted on, and fails to take reasonable care to ensure
the accuracy of the information.

To succeed in an action for negligent misrepresentation, you have to establish that a
`special relationship' existed between you and the other party and that you relied on the
representation, trusting the other party to exercise a duty of care in the giving of the
information, realising that you intend to act on that advice or information, that it would be
reasonable for you to rely on it and that you did suffering damage as a result.

Explain the meaning of the term `duress' and distinguish it from
`undue influence'.

Explain duress and undue influence and then you should be able to explain the
difference between the two actions.

Duress is the use of violence or illegal threats against a person, their goods or their
economic interests to force them to enter into a contract against their will. The duress does
not have to be the sole reason for the coerced party entering into the contract, it just has
to be one of the reasons. The onus is on the party who has made the threat to show that it
had no effect on the other party, and if they cannot do that, the contract is voidable at the
option of the coerced party because there is a lack of voluntary agreement. In the case of
economic duress, restitution and avoidance of the contract are the only options to a plaintiff.
Damages are not available.

The difference between duress and undue influence is the latter has its origins in equity and
involves the improper use of a position of influence or power possessed by one person over
another in order to induce the latter to act for the former's benefit. The contract is voidable
at the option of the innocent party, and the usual remedy is rescission.
                                                                                                 REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS | 394

Cases of undue influence fall into one of two classes. Briefly
explain what the two classes are and give examples.

Begin by explaining what undue influence is and then explain what the two classes
are.

It can exist in two types of situation: where there is a special relationship of trust and
confidence between the parties such as parent and child and doctor and patient, but it can
also exist where there is no special relationship but only if the weaker party is able to prove
that the other party (the dominant party and the defendant) exerted influence over them,
and thus obtained a contract that they would not otherwise have made, for example, where
the plaintiff has little or education, or where one party occupies a position of dominance or
influence over the other party. The contract is voidable at the option of the innocent party,
and the usual remedy is rescission.

Allcare joined a religious order in 2019 aged 19 as a novice nun. In
taking her vows of chastity, obedience and poverty she had to
give away all her goods and money which she donated to the
sisterhood. She left the sisterhood in 2024. Is Allcare entitled to
get her goods and money back? Explain why.

In this fact situation, do you think there is a special relationship of trust and
confidence between Allcare and the religious order? Is this an example of a special
relationship of religious adviser and devotee involving undue influence? What do
you think a religious adviser does? Was the transaction a voluntary one? Is the age
of Allcare important? So begin by explaining what undue influence is and then what
has to be established. Don't forget to say whether you think Allcare can get her
goods back?

Undue influence, which is based in equity, involves the improper use of a position of
influence or power possessed by one person (the dominant party) over another (the weaker
party) in order to induce the latter to act for the former's benefit. The contract is then
voidable at the option of the innocent party, and the usual remedy is rescission.

Is this a case where there is a special relationship between the parties though? From the
facts it appears to be a case where it can be argued that a special relationship might be
presumed to exist. Note the use of the word `might'. Undue influence is presumed to exist in
situations where there is a special relationship of trust and confidence between the parties
such as religious adviser and devotee.

Are the roles of religious adviser and religious order sufficiently similar to create a special
395 | REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS

relationship that the law might recognise as a special relationship for the purposes of undue
influence? A religious order is akin to a spiritual family within the church, its members living
by a specific set of rules and giving up what we might consider to be a `normal life' like
marriage and personal property which, in the case of the latter, Allcare gave up when she
joined.

If we accept that this is a case where a special relationship can be presumed to exist, then
the onus is on the sisterhood to prove that Allcare's giving up of all her money and property
was a voluntary one and there was no undue influence exercised by the religious order.
Given the Allcare was 19 at the time she made the decision to join a religious order, she
would be considered to be an adult and there is a lack of evidence to show that the decision
to join was anything but voluntary, Allcare would seem to have little chance of getting her
goods or money back.

Problem question

In this fact situation you are given a head start in terms of what area you need to
consider. Here begin by explaining whether you think improper influence and undue
influence are. Do they have different meanings or are they one and the same. Or
could both apply? Note the question also has two parts because you need to make
sure you also explain who has the burden of proof.

Improper influence is a term used to describe a situation where a person exerts influence or
pressure or influence an another in a way that is considered unfair or unethical and includes
undue persuasion and nepotism. Undue influence, on the other hand, looks at the quality
of the consent given to the contract, that is, did one party influence the other party so much
that consent was not freely or voluntarily given? The two are closely related.

From the facts, this case appears to be more about undue influence where no special
relationship existed, so it must be proved as a fact. Was there, before the transfer of the
cottage, a relationship of trust and confidence between Buttress and Johnson, such that it
could be said that the presumption of undue influence arose? Johnson was in a position
where she had influence over Buttress. From the facts, the gift could be presumed to be the
result of that influence and as a result Johnson would have to rebut the presumption that
Buttress had not exercised his free will unhindered by her influence.

Just as a matter of interest, this was an actual case (Johnson v Buttress [1936] HCA 41),
and the decision could have gone either way. There was a long standing friendship between
Johnson and Buttress and during that time there many acts of kindness by Johnson,
but it was not enough to rebut the factors that may constitute a special disadvantage in
                                                                                                 REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS | 396

establishing unconscionable conduct which in this case include his illiteracy, ignorance of
what was happening, and his disposition which together suggested vulnerability.

Problem question

Another problem involving unconscionability but in this case about the bank
manager's behaviour and whether it was unconscionable. Begin by explaining what
you think unconscionable conduct means and then go on and apply it to the actions
of the bank manager.

In its equitable jurisdiction the court may set aside a contract as unconscionable where
there has been an abuse by the defendant bank of their superior bargaining position in their
dealings with the Amadio's. Unconscionable conduct leading to an unconscionable contract
involves questions of fact and degree, and each case must be judged on its facts. If the
facts show that the conduct of the defendant was such that in its factual setting fairness and
good faith could properly be expected to be exercised, and it can be shown that they were
not, then the conduct of the defendant bank may be described as unconscionable.

Not every unfair contract is going to be set aside on the grounds of unconscionability. For
a contract to be set aside on the grounds that it was unconscionable, the Amadio's must
prove that:

   They were in a position of `special disadvantage' at the time of the contract.
   It must have substantially affected their ability to protect themselves.
   The bank must have known, or should have known of the Amadio's 'special disability.'
   The bank manager had taken unfair advantage of it in such a way that the actions of

      the bank manager were unconscionable (that is, unfair or unjust).

There are two questions to think about. Was the conduct of the bank such that it could
be regarded as unconscionable? Had the bank taken unfair advantage of its superior
bargaining position for its own commercial gain?

Here the bank was in a superior bargaining position to the Amadios', as it knew both the
financial position of the son and that his parents didn't fully understand what they were
entering into. The parents were, in fact, in a position of special disadvantage because they
didn't understand the extent of their liability under the agreement. Nor did they understand
the financial position of their son's company, which was being propped up by the bank.
Essentially, there was an abuse by the bank of its superior bargaining position in its dealings
with the Amadios as they were clearly under a serious disadvantage (lack of English and
no formal education). Once it was established that the Amadios' were under a serious
397 | REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS

disadvantage, the onus shifted on to the bank to establish that the transaction was fair, just
and reasonable.

From the facts, it appears that the actions of the bank manager in his dealings with
the Amadio's would amount to unconscionable dealing due to their lack of knowledge or
education and the consequent imbalance in bargaining power between the parties and as a
result would be set aside. If the Amadio's has sought independent legal advice, or the bank
had provided or suggested they got independent legal advice, then the unconscionability
argument probably would not have succeeded.

Section 4 of the Fairness of Transactions Act 1993 would, in addition to the common law
would be available here for the Amadios.

Problem question

Another case involving the question of unconscionability. Read the facts again
and note the actions of Ms Louth in relation to Diprose and don't forget t think
about whether you would have decided the same way if the roles of the parties was
reversed. Again, begin by explaining what you understand unconscionability to be
and whether the relationship between the parties is one where there is a special
disadvantage.

In its equitable jurisdiction the court may set aside a contract as unconscionable or unfair
where there was inequality bargaining power between Louth and Diprose because of his
infatuation with her, that is, Diprose was under a special disadvantage because of his
infatuation which has caused him extraordinary vulnerability when she created a false
crisis (on lying to him about being evicted). Unconscionable conduct leading to an
unconscionable contract involves questions of fact and degree, and each case must be
judged on its facts. If the facts show that the conduct of the defendant was such that in its
factual setting fairness and good faith could properly be expected to be exercised, and it
can be shown that they were not, then the conduct of the defendant bank may be described
as unconscionable.

For a contract to be set aside on the grounds that it was unconscionable, the Amadio's must
prove that:

   Diprose was in a position of `special disadvantage' because of his infatuation.
   It must have substantially affected their ability to protect themselves.
   Lough must have known, or should have known of Diprose's 'special disability.'
   Louth had taken unfair advantage of his infatuation in a way that was unconscionable

      (that is, unfair or unjust).
                                                                                                 REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS | 398

From the facts, his infatuation led to vulnerability in the form of emotional dependence. As
her conduct was unconscionable, the court would order that the ownership of the house
be transferred to Diprose. If the position of the parties were reversed, then Louth probably
would have been able to keep the house.

        Chapter 10

Brass hired a roulette table, with all the ancillary equipment
needed to play roulette, from ACME Hire. When they entered
into the contract, neither party was aware of the provisions of their
state's gaming and betting legislation that made the game
unlawful but did not prohibit it. When Brass discovered the Act, he
refused to pay the hire price. Can ACME Hire recover the hire
charges?

The focus of the question is again on the question of legality. Is it a crime to be
unlawful?

The question to consider here is what does the term "unlawful" mean? Is it the same as
`offence' or `illegal'? Playing roulette under gaming and betting legislation is unlawful but
not inherently criminal or illegal. The term `unlawful' means something is not authorised or
permitted by law. It is against the law and can result in legal consequences as a result of a
person's actions that might be in breach of the gaming and betting legislation, but it is not
necessarily criminal. No criminal sanctions are attached to the Act and nothing in the Act
makes playing it a criminal offence as it is not prohibited. `Illegal', on the other hand, refers
to something that is prohibited, punished by law, and is carries a penalty.

The facts suggest that the agreement between the parties is an unlawful agreement.
The terms of the agreement go against the gaming and betting legislation but while the
agreement is unlawful it is not prohibited. Courts generally do not enforce illegal agreements
and treat them as contracts void ab initio (they are void from the beginning) and the contract
is treated as if it never existed. Neither party is bound by its terms. The unlawful conduct,
that is, the playing of roulette, does not gives rise to a civil claim for damages.

Explain why a restraint clause in a contract of employment is most
likely to be struck down by the courts. In what circumstances will
a restraint clause be likely to be considered valid in a contract of
399 | REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS

employment?

Note that there two parts to this question. The first part is asking you to explain why a
restraint clause in a contract of employment is often struck down. The second part is
asking you to comment on when such a clause may be valid. So begin by explaining
what a restraint of trade clause is, then what its purpose is, and why they are often
struck down by the courts. Then explain why there are exceptions to the rule where
the restraint clause may be considered valid.

While a person should be bound by their contracts, one of the fundamental rights in contract
law is a person's freedom to contract. Contracts, or clauses (called `covenants') in contracts,
that attempt to restrict or restrain the freedom of one party to contract are not illegal; rather,
they are unenforceable at common law because they are against public policy unless it
can be shown by the party relying on the clause is protecting a legitimate business interest
such as goodwill, trade secrets or confidential information, and trade connections such as
customer lists, and is reasonable. As a general rule, if there is an inequality of bargaining
power between the parties, the courts will interpret these clauses contra proferentem; that
is, strictly against the party relying on them (in this case, the employer). As a result, if the
clause is merely an attempt to limit competition, the courts will usually find little difficulty in
striking down the clause.

The following factors should be taken into account when trying to decide whether
information was `secret' and therefore protectable, or `general know-how' and generally not
protectable:

   the extent to which the information is known inside and outside the business
   the value of the information to competitors
   the effort spent in developing the information, and
   the difficulty in acquiring or duplicating such information.

In order for such a clause to be valid, it must be shown that:

   the restraint is reasonable, and
   there is some proprietary or legitimate commercial interest owned by the employer

      that requires protection.

In the case of trade secrets, an employer may generally validly restrain an employee from
making any unauthorised use of that information both while working for them and for a
reasonable time after the contract of employment has ended. An employer is entitled
to protect and safeguard the confidential techniques they have developed. They could
therefore legally restrain a former employee from using the information while employed by
                                                                                                 REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS | 400

a rival firm. However, note that while an employer is entitled to protect their trade secrets,
they cannot prevent an employee from using their own skills and knowledge after they have
left the employment, even if those skills were learnt from the employer.

Samson was employed as a computer salesman. Part of
Samson's contract of employment contained the following
clause. Is the restraint between Samson and his employer valid?

As this is a restraint of trade clause, explain what that means, how the courts view
them, and what is required for it to be valid. Then apply to the facts.

Restraint of trade clauses are often included in contracts of employment as a way for
employers to protect their business interests by restricting an employee's freedom to
undertake certain activities during or after ending their employment. In order for such a
clause to be valid, it must be shown that the restraint is legitimate, that is, that the employer
has a legitimate interest in imposing the restraint, that it is reasonable in terms of time, and
the scope of the restraint is no wider than reasonably necessary to protect that legitimate
commercial interest of the employer.

From the facts here, the clause is a non-compete or non-solicitation clause which is
intended to prevent Samson from starting a new job with another employer as a computer
salesman, or enticing customers from his former employer. Has the employer got a
legitimate interest to protect here? Where an employee has direct contact with the
employer's customers as part of their work, are they given Samson's position, could he use
those connections to entice customers away if he went to another employer? Would the
courts recognise that here there is a legitimate interest that may be threatened by Samson
going to another employer, and therefore his business requires protection?

But is the scope of the restraint reasonable? Whether a restraint is reasonable will depend
on three key factors:

 1. The duration of the restraint (in this case, 1 year);
 2. The geographical area in which it is to have effect (no area specified, so geographical

      extent unknown); and,
 3. The activities that it purports to control (that he not sell computers anywhere).

In this case the restraint is for 1 year, there is no geographical area specified, and the
activities it purports to control, that is, to sell computers, is very wide. The restraint clause
appears to be unreasonably wide and there seems to be no legitimate basis for having a
restraint that wide on a computer salesman. It would seem to be doubtful that a computer
salesman would have sufficient contact with customers for there to be a threat of luring
401 | REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS

those customers away from the current employer to a new employer where the salesman
had gone. The clause would be invalid.

Roberta was employed as a works manager with Littlewoods
Recycling Works in Port Morseby. Her contract of employment
contained a restraint of trade clause whereby she agreed that in
the event of leaving Littlewoods she would not work in the
recycling industry in PNG for five years from the time of leaving
the company's employ. Roberta has been approached by a rival
firm in Lae who has offered to double her existing salary if she will
go and work for them. Roberta wishes to know whether the
restraint clause in her contract of employment is valid. What
advice would you give her?

Another restraint of trade clause question. Note that in this case though that Roberta,
unlike the computer salesman in the last question, is in a much more senior position.
Again, explain what that means, how the courts view them, and what is required for
it to be valid. Then apply to the facts but note the length of this restraint.

Restraint of trade clauses are often included in contracts of employment as a way for
employers to protect their business interests by restricting an employee's freedom to
undertake certain similar activities during or after ending their employment. In order for
such a clause to be valid, it must be shown that the restraint is legitimate, that is, that the
employer has a legitimate interest in imposing the restraint on Roberta, that it is reasonable
in terms of time, and the scope of the restraint is no wider than reasonably necessary to
protect that legitimate commercial interest of the employer.

From the facts here, the clause is a non-compete clause which is intended to prevent
her from entering or starting a similar profession or trade in competition with her former
employer in the recycling industry for 5 years. Has the employer got a legitimate interest
to protect here? Is there a legitimate interest that may be threatened here, and therefore
require protection.

But is the scope of the restraint reasonable? Whether a restraint is reasonable will depend
on three key factors:

 1. The duration of the restraint (in this case, 5 years);
 2. The geographical area in which it is to have effect (not be employed in PNG with a

      competitor); and,
 3. The activities that it purports to control (that she not be employed by a competitor for 5
         REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS | 402

years).

In this case the restraint is for 5 years, the geographical area is for all of PNG, and she not
work for a competitor, is very wide. The restraint clause appears to be unreasonably wide
in terms of duration, geographical area, and too wide as it attempts to apply to any position
with a competitor. The restraint is unreasonable as it would seem doubtful that as a works
manager the employer would have a legitimate interest requiring protection and that the
scope of clause is wider than reasonably necessary. The clause would be invalid.

Do the courts apply the same criteria in assessing whether
a restraint clause in a contract of employment is valid as they do
in a contract involving the sale of a business? Explain why.

In this question you should explain what the criteria for a restraint clause is in a
contract of employment and a contract for the sale of a business.

Restraint of trade clauses are included in contracts of employment as a way for employers
to protect their commercial interests or goodwill by restricting an employee's freedom to
undertake certain activities during or after ending their employment. As a general rule, there
is an inequality of bargaining power between the employer and the employee (favouring the
employer), and as a result the courts will interpret these clauses contra proferentem; that is,
strictly against the party relying on them (in this case, the employer).

In the sale of a business, where there is an element of goodwill, it is reasonable to expect
that the purchaser would want to stop the seller from opening a similar business to the one
they just sold within a certain area and time period so that they, as the purchaser, have time
to establish themselves in the business. Here it is assumed that the parties are dealing on
a `more' equal basis, and there is a legitimate commercial interest that requires protection
(such as goodwill), and as a result the courts are generally prepared to uphold the validity
of such clauses.

While each case has to be treated on its own merits and it will be a question of fact as
to whether the restraint is reasonable will depend upon a number of factors including the
length of time of the restraint and its geographic extent (think about whether they were
reasonable), the bargaining strengths and positions of the parties during negotiations, and
the type of business.

In both cases, each case has to be treated on its own merits and it will be a question of fact
whether the restraint is reasonable. The main difference between the two is the assumption
that the parties involved in the sale of a business are dealing on a `more' equal basis and
that there is a legitimate commercial interest that requires protection in the form of goodwill.
403 | REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS

We asked you above that if you were to buy a Toyota dealership
you would expect that you would not want the seller establishing
competition just down the road but, if you bought a milk bar or
caf, for example, the geographic restraint might be just a couple
of kilometres if it is in town (or more in the country). What we did
not ask you is whether you would you use the same restraint
clause in both purchases? Explain why or why not.

In this case you are being asked to give your opinion, that is, can you use the same
restraint clause if you were to buy a Toyota dealership as a milk bar? Remember
that in the sale of a business what you are interested in protecting is the goodwill
of the business. Think about the two types of business and whether there are a lot
more milk bars than Toyota dealerships. Think about the cost of purchasing each
business. Think about why the difference is important.

In any type of business situation what is important for the business to be successful is
goodwill. Goodwill is an intangible business asset that does not have a fixed value. Among
other things, it represents the value of a company's brand name, its customer relationships
and their loyalty, and is classified as an intangible asset on the balance sheet.

The cost of buying a milk bar and the returns for the owner are much less than for a car
dealership. This is reflected in the goodwill and the price you would pay for a milk bar
when compared with something like a Toyota dealership. To protect your goodwill in a car
dealership you would not want the seller to set up in competition down the street from you,
or even in the next suburb, as your customer is much more likely to travel a greater distance
to get what they want because they are paying so much for a car than anything a milk bar
has to sell.

As a result, the restraint clause for a Toyota dealership will always be more onerous to
protect the goodwill of the new purchaser? Whether a restraint is reasonable will depend
on the type of business and is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The question in each
case is what is reasonable to protect the parties. Thus, in the case of milk bar versus Toyota
dealership:

 1. The duration of the restraint (for the car dealership, a much longer restraint clause -
      why?);

 2. The geographical area (much bigger for the car dealership than for a milk bar - again
      why?); and

 3. The type of business (why?).

You could use similar clauses but they would differ in terms of duration, geography and

Does it make any difference whether a statement is a
representation or a term?

If you explain what a representation is and then what a term is, you will see instantly
what the difference is and why it is important.

A representation is a statement of fact, made by one party before or at the time of the
making the contract, which leads the other party to enter into the contract. They are pre-
contractual and do not form part of the contract, and are not intended to be legally
binding. Thus, they are not actionable in contract law.

A term, on the other hand, says what the agreement is about and may be about what each
party has to do, how they should do it, how long that should take, what it is that they have
agreed to, the price, who will pay (and when, where and how payment will be made) to
make the agreement work. The term can be express, and either oral or in writing, or implied
but unlike representation, is intended to be legally binding.

So, in summary, there is a clear difference between the two words. The representation is
not intended to be legally binding while the term is.

Explain the purpose of the parol evidence rule and how it is
applied by the courts.

Note that there are two parts to this question. First, you explain what the purpose of
the parol evidence rule is, and then how it is applied by the courts.

In the case of an oral contract, exactly what the parties said must be found as a matter
of fact, and to this end the courts will admit as evidence all facts known to the parties,
including both actions and words of the parties.

In the case of a written contract, the courts assume that all the terms agreed to by the
parties are contained in the contract and a court will generally not admit evidence of acts
or words of the parties before the execution of the document if it has the effect of adding
405 | REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS

to, varying or contradicting the written agreement. This is because the courts assume that
the parties' intention is contained within the `four corners' (the text) of the contract.

This is a rule of evidence that states that additional oral evidence is not considered by the
courts to contradict, vary, add to or subtract from its terms when a contract is complete on
its face unless it results in hardship or injustice in which case oral evidence can be admitted:

   to prove a trade custom or usage;
   to show that the contract has not yet become effective;
   where the court is of the opinion that the written document contains only part of the

      agreement;
   to clarify any ambiguous language used in the contract;
   where, due to a mistake of the parties, their agreement was not accurately expressed

      in the written contract;
   to demonstrate that a description is false; or
   to determine how important the truth of the statement was.

In trying to ascertain the promissory nature of a statement, and
whether it is a representation or a term, what matters will the
courts take into account in trying to ascertain the intention of the
parties? Discuss.

When trying to ascertain the intentions of the parties from the particular facts before it and
whether a statement is a representation or term, the court will take into account the following
matters:

   How much time has lapsed between the making of the statement and the final
      agreement? The longer the lapse of time between the making of the statement and
      the final agreement, the more likely it is to be treated as an inducement and not
      intended to form part of the agreement. When was the statement made?

   Was the innocent party asked to check or verify the statement? Here the
      statement is more likely to be an inducement.

   Was the statement made with the intention of preventing the other party from
      finding any defects, and did it succeed? Just note it is important to look also at
      the context in which the statement was made. If the statement was made after
      the sale then it was a representation and unenforceable, as the contract had
      already been finalised.

   What importance did the parties attach to the statement? Did the parties placed
      considerable importance on the statement? If a party did not rely on the statement, it
      would be a representation.
                                                                                                 REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS | 406

   Did one of the parties have special skills or knowledge? Where one of the parties
      had some special skill or knowledge not possessed by the other party with regard to
      the subject matter of the contract, then a statement would more likely be treated as a
      term.

   The relative knowledge and intention of the parties should be considered. Which of
      the two parties is in the best position to know or ascertain the truth about the
      statement?

Problem answer

As you asked the question about white ant immediately before entering into the contract,
even though it was not a written term in the contract, and the seller's assurance immediately
before you signed was intended to form part of the agreement between you and the vendor
when considered in the totality of the evidence and it was intended by the parties to form
a condition subject to which the contract was entered into, that is, a collateral contract and
was of sufficient weight to overcome the parol evidence rule.

As an aside: Could you have argued that the vendor had fraudulently misrepresented the
true position of the house when stating that it did not have termites since any reasonable
inspection would have revealed their presence and the extent of the damage caused by
them? Do you think that the seller's statement was made with the knowledge that it was
false or recklessly, without caring whether it was true or false?

You could argue that the vendor had fraudulently misrepresented the true position of the
house when stating that it did not have termites since any reasonable inspection would
have revealed their presence and the extent of the damage caused by them. It could be
argued that the seller's statement was made with the knowledge that it was made false or
recklessly, without caring whether it was true or false but you need more information, for
example, how desperately did he need to sell? Would the statement have helped the seller
get a better price? Would the property not have sold if he declared it was full of termites?

Once a collateral contract is established, what does the plaintiff
need to show for it to be valid and enforceable?

Note that the question is really in two parts. To answer the question you need to
begin by explaining what a collateral contract is, and in the second part what you
need to show for it to be valid and enforceable.

A statement which is not a term of the contract can sometimes be regarded as a collateral
or a preliminary contract if it can be shown that the main contract would not have been
entered into in the absence of the earlier statement. ). In such a case the courts may be
407 | REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS

prepared to enforce the promises made by the parties before they entered into the main
contract. The consideration to support the defendant's promise in the collateral contract is
the making of the main contract.

In order to establish a collateral contract regarding a statement of fact it is necessary to
show that the person making the statement:

   intended it to be relied on (and not descriptive or representational); and
   it is not supported by past consideration (the promise is agreed before the statement

      is made); and
   it is consistent with the main contract

Does a collateral contract or promise override an exclusion
clause?

Begin by explaining what a collateral contract is and how it works, that is, what its
purpose is and whether the collateral contract can exist side by side (but separately)
with the main contract. Then explain what an exclusion clause is and then answer the
question.

A collateral contract can be a verbal statement or a separate written statement to the main
contract where the parties to one contract enter into another contract. Once established, it
exists independently of the main contract. It is essentially a promise that can be enforced
but is not a term of the main contract.

An exclusion and limitation of liability clause, on the other hand, is an attempt by one party
to exclude or limit their liability. For the exclusion clause to be effective, it is not necessary
that the party receiving the offer has read it, but you must have taken reasonable steps to
bring the clause to the other party's attention and it should be reasonable or fair.

The collateral contract must be consistent with the main contract and it must be promissory.
If an inconsistency comes from the operation of an exclusion clause in the main contract,
the collateral contract or promise will override the exclusion clause because it is the very
thing that induces the injured party to contract.

Problem answer

Another problem question. This is a more difficult question because you are going
to have to work out whether the recommendations of the speed of the boat were
promissory and capable of being considered to amount to a collateral contract. So
                                                                                                 REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS | 408

explain what a collateral contract is and what needs to be established for it to be a
collateral contract here based on the facts in the problem.

Was the recommendation of the speed of the boat capable of being considered promissory
and thus a collateral contract? Was the representation in the letter a term of the main
contract or a collateral promise? Although the statement as to the speed of the boat led you
to entering into the contract, it was not promissory but rather an expression of opinion.

At the time of the letter, negotiations were still in progress and as is noted under `Hints' you
had three choices to consider:

 1. You could have made the attainment of speed a condition, but you didn't; or
 2. You could have made the boat builders promise that the boat was capable of

      achieving 23 km/h and not representational to be actionable; or
 3. You could have used your own judgement based on what the boat builders said,

      which you did, and that statement was not promissory.

End result, no collateral contract and no remedy or `so sad, to bad' for you.

Problem answer

In this case an assurance was given about how a particular clause was to operate. By
reneging on the promise, the question is whether you actions were unconscionable?
Begin by explaining what a collateral contract is, and how it is established. Then
apply it to the facts.

Was the collateral promise consistent with the main contract? In this case, as the verbal
agreement and the proviso in the written sublease over termination were inconsistent, it
was not possible to infer a collateral contract. The courts will allow the collateral contract
argument to succeed only if it can be established that the collateral promise is consistent
with the main contract.

Explain why it is important to know what type of term/s are
contained in a contract?

With this type of question, you need to explain what the three types of terms are
and then in a final paragraph you can summarise why they are import, for example,
because the remedies under each available to a plaintiff are different.

The type of term in a contract will determine the type of remedy that the party bringing
a claim for breach will be entitled to. If it is a condition it is a term that is vital to the
409 | REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS

contract. The parties consider it so important that its non-performance may be considered
by the injured party as amounting to substantial failure to honour the contract at all, and thus
may be regarded as grounds for terminating the contract (but note that any obligations
still outstanding at the date of termination continue) or suing for damages (or both).

If it is a warranty the parties consider it to be a term of lesser importance to the main
purpose of the contract. If it is breached, injured parties must still perform their part of the
contract, but they have the right to sue for damages for any loss that they may suffer as a
result of the breach+.

The parties rarely indicate whether a term is a condition or a warranty; that is, an essential
or a non-essential promise, depends on the intention of the parties. And even if they do, the
courts may not be prepared to accept what they say!

It may happen that a term cannot be classified as a condition or a warranty until after a
breach of contract has occurred. The courts have identified a further class of terms that
lies between conditions and warranties, called intermediate or innominate terms. Here
the court focuses on how serious the effects of the breach are on the contract, rather
than attempting to classify the term that has been broken as a condition or a warranty. Has
the breach deprived the innocent party of substantially the whole benefit that they should
have derived from the contract?

How do the courts decide on the importance of a term?

In answering the question you need to begin by explaining what a term is. Then
explain its importance to an injured party, that is, in the remedies available to them.

Having decided that the statement is a term, explain there are three different types of terms:
is it a condition, warranty or innominate term? Explain each. A court will:

   look at what effect the breach had on the contract--if the breach has had a serious
      effect, it could be treated as a condition, or if the breach is not serious, it could be
      treated as a warranty or innominate term, or

   apply an objective test, looking at the case as a whole and considering the
      importance of the broken stipulation as an inducement to the plaintiff to enter into the
      contract. Is the stipulation essential or of fundamental importance to the
      contract? If the answer is `yes', it is a condition. If it still considered to be a term but
      of lesser importance then it is a warranty or an innominate term. The presumption
      being the more important the term is to the contract, the more likely the term will be a
      condition. Subsequently, if a term is less important to the contract, it will more than
      likely be a warranty.
                                                                                                 REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS | 410

The reason it is important to find out what type of term it is that you are dealing with is found
in the remedy available to the injured party, so comment here on the remedies available to
the injured party, that is, for a condition, as it is of fundamental importance to the contract,
the injured party can choose to end the contract and has the right to sue for damages.
If it is a warranty, then the injured party can claim damages for the specific breach. If it
is an innominate term, then the courts will classify the breached term according to the
consequences and seriousness of the breach, and decide whether it should be treated as a
condition or warranty

What is the difference between a condition precedent and a
condition subsequent in a contract? Explain, giving an example of
each.

Note here that you are required to do two things. One is to explain the difference
between a condition precedent and a condition subsequent, so no need for great
detail Second, make sure you give an example of each.

A `condition precedent' and a `condition subsequent' is that in the case of a condition
precedent a contract does not exist until the term has been fulfilled or satisfied, for
example, in a property purchase you, as a buyer, might want to include a clause such as
`subject to the ANZ bank agreeing to provide finance'. If you, as the buyer, can't get the
finance, the agreement fails and there is no contract.

A condition subsequent is the opposite of a condition precedent. It is an exit clause that if
it occurs will bring a contract to an end, for example, you purchase a car from a car dealer
and part of the deal was that if you were not completely satisfied, take the car back within 7
days and get your money back. If you return the car within the 7 day period, that terminates
the original contract.

Problem answer

With this problem begin by explaining what a condition and warranty are. Then look
at the facts again and decide which should apply, explaining why based on the facts.
DO NOT just say, breach of condition and damages but explain what the courts (or
you) are looking for and the impact on the agreement between the parties.

Breach of a condition or warranty? Remember that breach of a condition allows repudiation
and/or damages while breach of a warranty allows the innocent party to claim for damages
only. The court will look at the contract as a whole and consider whether the promise was
so important to the promisee that they would not have entered into the contract unless there
411 | REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS

had been an assurance of a strict or substantial performance of the promise, and this was
apparent to the person making the promise at the time.

In this case, it appears that it was of great importance to the producers that the season
should start well, and the failure of Poussard to perform on the opening night and in early
performances was a serious detriment to them. If the only viable alternative was to employ
a substitute, and this could be achieved only by offering permanent employment at a higher
rate of pay, then the failure on Poussard's part to perform on the opening night went to the
root of the contract as it could only be interpreted as a condition and breach permitted the
producers to fire her.

Problem answer

Note the fact situation here. You might think it is a repeat of the last question, but
they are not identical. So, you have to read carefully. The key to this question is in the
`Hint'. So again, start with an explanation of condition and warranty and then apply
to the facts.

Again, is there a breach of a condition or warranty given the above facts? Remember that
breach of a condition allows repudiation and/or damages while breach of a warranty allows
the innocent party to claim for damages only. The court will look at the contract as a whole
and consider whether the promise was so important to the promisee that they would not
have entered into the contract unless there had been an assurance of a strict or substantial
performance of the promise, and this was apparent to the person making the promise at the
time.

Bettini was an experienced operate singer and while late attendance to rehearsals because
he had been ill did not mean that he could not be there on opening night. The attendance
at rehearsals was subsidiary to the main purpose of the contract and could be treated as a
warranty as his illness would not prevent him from performing the rest of his contract. Thus,
while Gye might claim compensation for any loss he had incurred, he could not repudiate
the agreement.

Problem answer

Here is a question that you have to read carefully. In fact, read it at least twice.
The area of law you are considering appears to clearly stand out. It is about the
operation of an exclusion clause, so begin by explaining what an exclusion is and
what it does. Look closely at the facts and you will notice there is nothing about a
document being given to you, or that you had to sign anything. As an aside, and just
for your information, the question also raises an interesting on an area of law called
                                                                                                 REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS | 412

bailments in case you actually do run into this sort of problem where you might leave
goods with someone for repair and then they damage them or don't do the repairs
properly but still want their money.

The first issue relates to the question of an unsigned docket containing an exclusion clause
as evidence of dropping of the laptop. The second relates issues to evidence of dropping
off the laptop but signing the docket containing an exclusion clause and whether signing it
makes any difference to liability.

Dealing first with the unsigned docket. Where the document is unsigned, the question is
whether the `customer' knew of and consented to the exclusion clause. If they did not, would
a reasonable person have regarded the document as one that would contain contractual
terms and not represent a mere receipt or acknowledgment? What would be reasonably
understood as being the purpose of the docket Did the computer shop make you aware
the docket may contain conditions? The docket handed to you would probably not be
construed as a contractual document but rather an acknowledgement that the shop now
had possession of your computer and the docket was evidence of this. When you came to
collect your laptop, it was evidence that the shop had your laptop and you were the owner,
and not a document containing an exclusion clause exempting the shop from liability for
negligence.

This is in fact a bailment case, where the bailee (the computer shop) is relying on an
exemption clause printed on the shops dockets to avoid liability, and the court is saying that
the bailee must take reasonable steps to bring any conditions that limit the computer shop's
liability to you as the bailors (customer's) notice.

Now turning to the signed docket. A party signing a document knowing that it contains
contractual terms is generally bound by those terms, whether they have read the document
it or not. But a person who signs a document containing an exclusion clause may not be
bound if they have reasonable grounds for believing that the document was not contractual.
In this case, as the exclusion clause on the docket was not drawn to your attention when
you signed the docket, if such terms are to be effective then you must be given reasonable
notice of what the docket was for and that it contained an exclusion clause if it is to be
enforced.

However, just be aware that where there is no disparity in knowledge or bargaining
power, no misrepresentation, fraud or duress, a signature is a very strong indication of
intention to be bound.

Problem answer

When you look at this type of situation you have to begin by working out what the legal issue
413 | REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS

is. In this case, the question is asking you to consider whether the exclusion or limitation
clause is effective. Again, begin by explaining what an exclusion or limitation clause is and
then how it operates. Then you can answer the question.

Where the document is neither a receipt nor an acknowledgment--for example, tickets
for a sea cruise--did the passenger have constructive notice of onerous clauses in the
document? Has the shipping company given passengers sufficient notice of the terms in the
contract? This is a question of fact in each case. In this case the shipping company could
not rely on the limitation clause contained in the ticket because it had not been sufficiently
brought to the respondent's attention before the payment of the fare. Therefore, the clause
did not form part of the contract.

As an aside, if you were a passenger you would be unable to recover your fare because
there was not a total failure of consideration. You had received some benefit under the
contract; that is, eight days of cruising. However, you would be entitled to damages for
disappointment and distress because the object of the contract was to provide an enjoyable
experience.

Problem answer

Another question on exclusion clauses and very important to read the facts carefully.
Here you are being asked to comment on two issues, that is, you are a first-time
visitor and then you are a regular passenger.

On the question of a first-time visitor trying to use the ferry, the crucial test is whether
reasonable notice of the term has been given so that even a first-time visitor could not argue
they were not aware of the entrance requirements on to and off the wharf. In this case,
we are told it is above the turnstiles but what we are not told is how easy it is to see and
read. These two issues go to the question of the reasonableness of the notice. But would
a reasonable person, even a first-time visitor, expect to find express terms and conditions
of travel on a commercial ferry? The answer is probably yes because it is 2024 and people
today expect to find that the use of all forms of transport are subject to terms and conditions
of travel.

Could knowledge of the terms and conditions be presumed where a person has travelled
on the ferry numerous times? If you have travelled on the ferry numerous times, you should
be aware of the conditions of travel and be bound by them as it could be assumed that you
would have had reasonable notice of them.
                REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS | 414

Problem answer

Again, another exclusion clause question. As with the last two questions, begin by
explaining what an exclusion clause is and what its purpose is, that is, what does it
cover? In this case you also want to explain how the courts view such clauses. With
that done, then you can look at the question again and apply the law to the facts.

When it comes to interpretation of exclusion clauses and assuming that they have been
properly incorporated into a contract, the courts strictly construe them against the party who
attempts to rely on the clause or term. This is known as the contra proferentem rule and the
effect is that the court will `read down' the clause unless it specifies the type of liability to be
covered and any ambiguity will be resolved in favour of the injured party,

To be effective here, the clause must operate to protect Warwick & Co in both contract and
tort but if you read the exclusion clause again you will see it applied only to protect Warwick
& Co from its liability in contract, and not from their common law duty of care in negligence.
Any ambiguities will be strictly construed against Warwick & Co. The clause only operates
to protect Warwick & Co from breach of contract but not negligence.

If the clause had read: `Nothing in this agreement shall render the owners liable for any
personal injury to the riders in negligence or contract of the machines hired', that would
have protected Warwick & Co?

It is interesting to note that clauses can be too specific. For example, `Where the passenger
occupies a motor-coach seat fitted with a safety belt, neither the operators nor their agents
or cooperating organisations will be liable for any injury, illness or death or for any damages
or claims whatsoever arising from any accident or incident, if the safety belt is not being
worn at the time of such accident or incident.' Do you see a problem? Would the clause
protect the bus company if you stood to get your bag from an overhead locker, the bus
suddenly braked heavily, and you were thrown to the floor and broke your leg. This
was an Australian High Court case called Insight Vacations Pty Ltd v Young [2011] HCA
16 and here the court gave the words their ordinary meaning. The result was that the
exclusion clause could operate only when passengers were seated. In this case Insight
would probably have been better protected by removing any reference to `seat'!

Problem answer

Don't worry about the fact this is a bailment case. Just remember it for future
reference. Again, this is a case on exclusion clauses. In this case, note what the `Hint'
is asking you to do, so begin with an explanation of what an exclusion clause, what
it is meant to do and how the courts construe them.
415 | REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS

In this case you have an example of interpretation according to the express agreement.
The effectiveness of an exclusion clause is purely a question of construction of the contract
as a whole in each case. Is the term or clause wide enough to exclude an action for the
alleged breach? In this case, the actions of the car park attendant in releasing the car to the
thief were outside the terms of the contract you had with the Car Park. It was not merely a
negligent act but a delivery not authorised or permitted under the contract.

Explain the operation of the contra proferentem rule. Is such a rule
defensible today?

Note there are two parts to this question. First, it is asking you about the operation
of the contra proferentem, so explain what the contra proferentem is, then how it
operates, and finally whether there is still a need for it today.

Contra proferentem is a principle of strict construction against a party relying on clause or
term, for example, to avoid liability such as an exclusion clause. Where the exclusion clause
has been correctly incorporated into the contract it will be strictly construed against the party
who attempts to rely on it. The courts will `read down' such a clause unless it specifies the
type of liability to be covered and any ambiguity will be resolved in favour of the injured
party.

In the case of commercial contracts, there is a greater equality of bargaining positions
that can exist between the parties because of access to lawyers. However, the same
is not necessarily true where consumer contracts are concerned as they are generally
the weaker party in commercial transactions. There is generally no equality of bargaining
position between suppliers and consumers with the result that consumers, particularly
where standard contracts are used, have to accept terms and conditions that can produce
a harsh and/or unfair result for the consumer in the event of a breach.

The contra proferentem rule provides that where a contract contains an ambiguous term
(or clause), the terms should be interpreted against the person who drafted the contract
(or the party who wanted it included in the contract) and to that end it introduces a degree
of equality between the stronger party and the weaker party (the consumer). Because
standard form contract documents often lack a genuine bargaining between the parties
resulting in inequitable positions, the contra proferentem rule helps to mitigate unfairness by
applying the interpretation that gives benefit of doubt to the party upon whom the contract
was forced, that is, the consumer.
                                                                                                 REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS | 416

In order for a party to rely on an exclusion clause, what must they
show?

Again, it is useful to explain what an exclusion clause and what its purpose is, then go on
and explain what the person who wants to rely on such a clause must do. Just remember,
that unless the exclusion or limitation clause is incorporated into the relevant contract, it will
be unenforceable. And even where it is, does the clause cover the liability in question?

Signed documents

A person who signs a contract containing an exclusion clause will be bound by it as an
express term of the contract, even if they have not read it, unless fraud, misrepresentation,
or a statutory defence can be established.

Unsigned documents

For exclusion clauses to be effective in an unsigned contract, the following points should be
noted:

   That the `customer' knew of and consented to the clause? If they did not, would a
      reasonable person have expected to find such a clause in that type of document?

   That reasonable steps were taken to give sufficient notice of the term?
   If the terms have not been brought to the notice of the `customer', can they be implied

      by trade usage or custom trade?

In the case of a signed contract, can the party signing limit their
liability in both contract and tort?

Yes. See problem question You hired a bike from John Warwick & Co (and answer
above) where Warwick & Co could have been protected if their clause had read: `Nothing
in this agreement shall render the owners liable for any personal injury to the riders in
negligence or contract of the machines hired'. This wording makes it clear to the other party
that Warwick & Co are not accepting any responsibility for any customer hiring a bike who
gets injured because the bike has not, for example, been properly serviced Remember that
there is an overlap between negligence (and duty of care owed to a bike user that the bike
is roadworthy) and contract (and an implied duty of care that the bike is roadworthy).

        Chapter 12

If the creditor has not expressly indicated that payment must be
by post - for example, if the account reads `Payment within 7
days' rather than `Payment within 7 days by post' - loss of the
letter and its contents is borne by the debtor, irrespective of what
past practice has been unless payment is in another city or a
great distance away. Explain why

Note what the question is asking you to do and that the focus is on the creditor.

Payment by post can occur by way of request by the creditor or on the initiative of the
debtor, but note that the consequences will differ depending on which way it occurs.

If the creditor requires payment to be made by post, the normal rules of contracts by post
apply. When the letter is lodged at the post office, this is considered as a discharge from
liability for the debtor if the letter is lost in transit as the post office is the agent of the creditor.
The debt itself is discharged when the claim connected with it is made on the debtor's

If the creditor has not expressly indicated that payment must be by post--for example, if the
account reads `Payment within 7 days' rather than `Payment within 7 days by post'--loss
of the letter and its contents is borne by the debtor, irrespective of what past practice has
been, unless payment is in another city or a great distance away.

Where there has been partial performance of a contract, does
payment still automatically follow for the party in breach? Explain
why.

Again, note what the question is asking you to do, that is, comment on whether the
party in breach can still request payment where there has been partial performance,
and explain why.

Where there has only been a partial performance, payment does not automatically follow
unless the contract is divisible, that is, it can be divided up into its component parts (which
is a question of construction), or there has been free and willing acceptance of partial
performance by the party receiving the benefit, or substantial performance has taken place,
or the actions by the non-performing party prevent performance.
                                                                                                 REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS | 418

If the breach is minor, so that the cost of rectification is small when compared with the
contract price, the doctrine of substantial performance may still permit the defaulting
party to obtain the contract price. Each case turns on the construction of the contract.
Whether or not there is a substantial performance is essentially a question of fact. This
can be assessed by taking into account both the nature of the defects and the proportion
between the cost of rectification and the contract price, the benefit obtained by the owner,
whether the work is entirely different from that contracted for, or whether the contractor has
abandoned the work.

If one party is prevented from performing, the other party may regard the contract as being
at an end and the party being prevented from performing will be released from any further
obligations and can:

   terminate the contract;
   claim for damages for breach of contract;
   terminate the contract and claim for damages; or
   if performance had commenced but had not been completed, claim on a quantum

      meruit.

The seller agreed to supply 4500 tonnes of wheat to the buyer.
The contract allowed a variation of 2% on weight and a further 8%
on contract quantity. The seller delivered 25kg more than the
maximum allowed under the contract but never claimed payment
for the surplus. Can the buyer reject the whole cargo solely on the
ground that the quantity tendered was 25kg over the contract
quantity? Explain.

A short problem question but this time with no hints. So look carefully at the facts
and consider whether the buyer is in breach of contract, then explain why you think
they are (or aren't) in breach. Has there been a substantial departure from what was
agreed in the contract?

Where there is a variation from the terms of the contract, the parties will be discharged
from any obligations provided that the performance of the contract corresponds as closely
as practicable with the terms of the contract. The strict rule of complete and precise
performance applies only if the contract is entire-- that is, it cannot be divided up. Contracts
for sale of goods are usually treated as requiring entire performance. If variation is only
minimal or trivial, the courts will generally not worry about it. But each case will have to be
determined on its facts, and in each case the question to ask is whether there has been a
substantial departure from the contract.

Hoenig was employed to redecorate and furnish Laura's flat for
K1500, to be paid as follows: `Terms of payment are net cash, in
three instalments of K300 as the work proceeded; and balance of
K600 on completion'. Laura paid K600 to Hoenig. The work was
done poorly, and the cost of rectification was K350. Hoenig was
not happy. Can he recover the balance of K900 from Laura?

Here you need to consider what sort of contract there is between the parties. Is it
divisible or entire? So, begin by explaining the difference divisible or entire contracts
and then look carefully at the facts here.

This is an example of a divisible contract because it is divided up into three parts. If the
breach is minor, so that the cost of rectification is small when compared with the contract
price, the doctrine of substantial performance may still permit the defaulting party to
obtain the contract price. Hoenig was entitled to recover the contract amount less the cost of
rectification, because the contract had been substantially performed and the defects were
easily rectifiable.

Each case turns on the construction of the contract. Whether or not there is a substantial
performance is essentially a question of fact. This can be assessed by taking into account
both the nature of the defects and the proportion between the cost of rectification and the
contract price, the benefit obtained by the owner, whether the work is entirely different from
that contracted for, or whether the contractor has abandoned the work.

An English firm agreed to sell and deliver machinery to a Polish
company, which paid 1000 (nearly K5000) in advance. The
English firm commenced work on the machine, but because of
the outbreak of war and the German occupation of Poland, the
contract was frustrated. The question of frustration was not in
issue; the Polish company claimed the right to recover the deposit
it had paid before the frustrating event. The English firm claimed
that it had done a considerable amount of work on the machine.
What is the effect of frustration in this case?

Another problem question. From the facts, you are told what the problem is:
frustration. Begin by explaining what frustration is and then look again at the facts
and decide whether there has been a total failure of consideration.

Like the last question, this is also a question on the application of the doctrine of frustration.
The effect of a frustrating event is to discharge a contract immediately, but only as to the
                                                                                                 REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS | 420

future. The contract is not void ab initio (or void from the beginning) but void only from the
time of the frustrating event.

For the period that the contract is valid, any obligations that arise must be fulfilled. Money
paid under the terms of the contract before the frustrating event occurs (for example, a
deposit) cannot be recovered, because at the time the money was paid the contract was
valid. You would need to establish a total failure of consideration to be able to recover the
money.

Is there a total failure of consideration here? Did Fibrosa get anything for the money it had
paid? As the machinery had not been delivered because of the outbreak of war, there was
a total failure of consideration and as a result Fibrosa is entitled to get its deposit back. The
expression `total failure of consideration' should not be seen as meaning that there is no
consideration. In this situation, it means that Fibrosa has got nothing under the contract. As
they had already paid K10,000, that money can be recovered. But the principle only applies
if Fibrosa has got nothing under the contract, If Fibrosa had received part of the machinery
before the contract was frustrated, the K10,000 would not be able to be recovered because
there would not have been a total failure of consideration.

Imagine you wanted to hold a concert and an express term as to
the purpose for which the hall you wanted to use was that it was
in a fit state for a concert. Unknown to the parties the hall burnt
down without their knowledge while they were still negotiating. A
contract was subsequently entered into and both parties at the
time of entering into a contract believed that the hall still existed.
Has the contract been frustrated? Explain why or why not.

Another problem question. From the facts, you are told what the problem is; has
the contract been frustrated? So again, begin with explaining what frustration is and
then look again at the facts and decide whether there has been a total failure of
consideration.

This is a question on the application of the doctrine of frustration and the effect of
impossibility owing to the non-occurrence of an event basic to the contract. If the entire
basis of a contract is the happening of some event that doesn't occur, the contract may be
discharged as it is no longer possible to achieve the substantial purpose of the contract.

While the contract doesn't contain any express reference to what the hall is to be used for,
the only inference that could be drawn from the surrounding circumstances was that both
parties to the contract assumed that the hall could be used for a concert and that this was
421 | REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS

the basis of the contract. When the basis or underlying object for which the parties entered
into the contract ceases to exist, the contract is dissolved.

Why do the courts refuse to enforce penalty clauses in contracts?

Begin by explaining what a penalty clause is, then you can explain why the courts
don't enforce them.

A penalty clause included in a contract is a threat to ensure performance, and is imposed
on the weaker party by the stronger party. If the sum is clearly extravagant and totally out of
proportion to the amount of loss suffered by the injured party, then it is probably a penalty
and so not enforceable. Only the actual loss sustained can be recovered.

The courts are often faced with the problem of deciding whether a sum is a penalty or
liquidated damages. They don't attach great importance to what the parties may like to call
`the sum' in the contract. The question in each case is whether the sum can be seen as
a genuine pre-estimate of the damages that will result from a breach or a sum intended
to punish the other party in the event of a breach. This is a question of construction to be
determined by the circumstances and on the terms of the particular contract at the time
of its making (not at breach) and the reason that the courts don't enforce penalty clauses
is that they are often unconscionable or unfair under common law or contrary to statutory
provisions of `unconscionable conduct' and `unjust' or `unfair'.

Remember that as a general rule, penalty clauses are imposed on the weaker party by the
stronger party.

Explain the difference between liquidated and unliquidated
damages and a penalty.

Start by explaining what liquidated and unliquidated damages and a penalty are, then
what is the difference between them.

Liquidated damages are a fixed amount in the contract. The parties agree to what should
be sum-based paid in the event of a breach, and the clause is known as an `agreed
damages clause'. It must be a genuine or bona fide pre-estimate of actual loss that will flow
from the breach.

Unliquidated damages are awarded when a plaintiff is unable to assess precisely what
should be the amount of recoverable damages be -- for example, for pain and suffering or
disappointment. In most cases, no amount is mentioned in the contract and it is left to the
court or the jury to determine what amount should be awarded.
                                                                                                 REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS | 422

A penalty is an amount agreed on as a security to ensure that a contract will be performed.
It is a threat to ensure performance, and is imposed on the weaker party by the stronger
party.

Explain why an injured party to a contract should have to mitigate
their loss.

Begin by explaining what mitigation of damages means and from there explain why
an injured party has to minimise their loss.

The law imposes a duty on the person claiming damages (the injured party) to take all
reasonable steps to reduce or minimise (mitigate) their loss. The innocent party, that is, the
party not in breach, cannot take advantage of the defendant's breach as that would expose
the breaching party to unfair liability.

If persons claiming damages fail to take this step, the amount of damages they can expect
to recover will be reduced. If the plaintiff is able to avoid a loss, damages will not be
recoverable for the potential loss that the plaintiff may have suffered.

Joad Tyres sold car covers and other motor accessories to Casey
under a contract which provided that Casey would not sell any of
the items below certain listed prices. In the event of breach of the
agreement, Casey agreed to pay K50 in liquidated damages for
every item it sold below the listed price. Casey subsequently sold
a tyre below the listed price and was sued by Joad Tyres. Would
you classify the sum as a penalty or liquidated damages? Explain
why.

Another problem question. Begin by identifying the problem, which you are told
is breach, and explain what that means, then what are liquidated damages and a
penalty. You can then classify the sum.

In effect, this is an amount agreed on as a security to ensure that a contract will be
performed. It is a threat to ensure performance, and is imposed on the weaker party by the
stronger party. If the sum is clearly extravagant and totally out of proportion to the amount
of loss suffered by the injured party, then it is probably a penalty and so not enforceable.
Only the actual loss sustained can be recovered.

The courts are often faced with the problem of deciding whether a sum is a penalty or
liquidated damages. They don't attach great importance to what the parties may like to call
`the sum' in the contract. The question in each case is whether the sum can be seen as
423 | REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS

a genuine pre-estimate of the damages that will result from a breach or a sum intended
to punish the other party in the event of a breach. This is a question of construction to be
determined by the circumstances and on the terms of the particular contract at the time of
its making (not at the time of breach).

In this case the amount of K50 is probably a genuine pre-estimate of loss flowing from the
breach and not `extravagant and unconscionable'. The onus is on Casey to show that the
late fees were penalties. The test in this type of case was whether the K50 per item was
`out of all proportion' to the interests of Joad Tyres, the party it was protecting. What we
don't know here is the value of the car covers and other motor accessories which would
then have provided us with a guide as to whether K50 was a penalty but on the information
given it probably was a genuine pre-estimate.

You arranged a 2 week holiday in Switzerland through a brochure
from Swans Tours. The brochure claimed the accommodation
was close to the ski fields, its owner spoke English, and there
would be a welcome party on arrival and a farewell party on
departure at the bar. However, few of the statements proved to be
correct and the trip turned into a disaster. What would you do?

I would assume that you would give serious thought to suing for breach of contract.
But your problem would be whether you could claim damages. So the first thing you
are going to need to do is to explain whether the courts will grant damages for a
spoilt holiday, and if so what sort of damages would your claim be based on. Does it
matter that it would be hard to assess the amount of damages?

While the courts will generally not grant damages for anything other than provable or
economic losses, in certain instances, the courts will allow a claim for damages by an
injured party for breach of an express or implied term that the promisor would provide
them with pleasure, enjoyment or personal protection, and the failure to do so has caused
physical injury or inconvenience to the plaintiff. The damage claimed must be a direct result
of the breach, and remoteness is not an issue.

On the issue of the recovery of damages for the disaster called a holiday, as few of
the statements in the brochure proved to be correct, the object of the contract, which
was relaxation and enjoyment as promised holiday in the brochure, did not live up to
expectations, you should be entitled to damages for disappointment and distress.

The fact that it is difficult to determine the amount of damages is not a ground for disallowing
a claim. Where this is difficult, or where the loss is of a speculative nature, the court will
                                                                                                 REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS | 424

determine the amount of damages based on you being able to show on the balance of
probabilities that the loss of chance was of some value.

The defendant leased a racehorse to you for 3 years. After 6
months, the defendant took the horse back. As part of the
damages claim for breach of contract, you sued for loss of
potential prize money and profits that you would have made from
betting on the horse. Do you think you would succeed in your
claim? Why?

Again, a problem question, and the question tells you the area, that is, damages. So
begin by explaining what are damages and how they are generally assessed. Here,
the claim is of a speculative nature and what you are going to have to address here
is whether the courts can determine the amount of damages, or even hear the matter.

The question here is where it is difficult to assess the amount of damages, should your
claim be dismissed? Where it is difficult, or where the loss is of a speculative nature, the
court will determine the amount of damages based on the plaintiff being able to show on
the balance of probabilities that the loss of chance was of some value. You will be entitled
to recover damages for potential loss of prize money and profits you could have made as
you have suffered a loss. The courts will exam all the material in order to arrive at what they
believe is a reasonable approximation of the loss suffered by you.

Explain under what circumstances a quantum meruit claim would
arise.

Begin by explaining what quantum meruit means, noting that it is a claim in equity,
and then you can go on and explain when such a claim would arise.

Quantum meruit means `as much as the person has earned' and is a claim in equity. It
is essentially an action for payment of the reasonable value of good supplied or services
performed. The contract may be discharged by breach, but where the contract is for goods
or services there is a new implied contract imposed by law on the party taking the benefit
that they will pay a reasonable amount for the quantum or portion given. It is not available
to the party in breach.

Quantum meruit most often arises where there has been a contract but it has been
frustrated, made void, terminated or is otherwise unenforceable but it can also arise:

   where a defendant has prevented a plaintiff from carrying out the remainder of their
425 | REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS

      contractual duties;
   where the parties cannot agree on payment;
   where the innocent party to the contract is faced with a repudiation by the other party

      and decides to terminate the contract in response; and
   where the parties agree on payment for the part-performance but not the actual

      amount.

Henrietta engaged a firm of solicitors to obtain an injunction to
prevent a former friend from visiting her and making a nuisance of
himself. An unqualified litigation clerk was given the matter to
handle, but his incompetence created further embarrassment for
Henrietta. Does Henrietta have any claim against the firm for
`mental distress and upset'?

A problem question. This is an interesting question because it raises two issues.
It takes you back to what you looked at in Chapter 2 and the issue of, in this
case, vicarious liability, that is, are the actions of the litigation clerk linked to their
employment and thus capable of making the employer liable. But it also raises
an issue of contract that you should deal with, that is, the engaging of the firm
by Henrietta creates a contract. Hands up those who picked up the two possible
actions? The second issue then is the one of damages and whether they are
claimable for mental distress and upset.

There are two questions to consider here. First, is the firm liable for the actions of litigation
clerk? Secondly, are damages recoverable for mental distress?

Liability of the firm for the actions of their litigation clerk in failing to carry out their duties
raises the issue of vicarious liability which is a tort. The clerk was acting in the course of their
employment and so the firm can be held responsible for their clerk's actions in negligently
handling Henrietta's matter. The elements of duty, breach and damage would all appear
to be satisfied. But in addition to the potential tort action there is also a breach of contract
action available to Henrietta. There is an implied term in the contract with the firm that they
will carry out their duties in a professional manner which they have failed to do by failing to
ensure that the clerk was handling Henrietta's matter competently. A breach of contract.

In addition to expectation and reliance losses, damages may be recovered for losses that
arise from mental distress as long as she can establish that she has suffered damage
caused by the breach of contract and it falls within the relevant principles of remoteness
of damage. Damages for disappointment and distress are not recoverable unless they
proceed from physical inconvenience caused by the breach. What is certain is that
damages for disappointment and distress arising from breach of contract will be recoverable
                                                                                                 REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS | 426

where the object of the contract is to provide peace of mind or freedom from distress. In
such cases the damage can be said to flow directly or arise naturally from the breach as
there is a failure to provide promised benefits.

Josef, a well-known film actor, entered into a contract with Frre
Bros for a period of five years, where he agreed to give his
services exclusively to them and not act in films for any other
company during this period. During the first year of the
agreement, Josef entered into a contract to star in a film being
made by Pretty Pictures. Do Frre Bros have any remedy? Explain
why.

Another problem question. This is one of those questions you have to read very
carefully. Is the contract Josef has with Frere Bros exclusive, that is, Josef cannot
work for anyone else for 5 years valid? Note the use of the word `exclusive', so you
need to explain what that means in the context of Josef's contract. Is there a breach
of contract by Josef and if there is, what remedies do Frere have? The best option
here for Frere would be an equitable remedy - an injunction, so explain what an
injunction is and why it would be better than specific performance in your answer.

Frere Bros could seek an equitable remedy in the form of an interlocutory injunction to stop
Josef working for Pretty Pictures. As the matter here involves personal services, specific
performance is not available because of problems in enforcing the contract by the court but
such a problem doesn't exist with an injunction.

An interlocutory injunction is the best option as it can be used to restrain Josef from
breaking his contract but note it will not be awarded if damages are an adequate remedy,
which in this case is probably not an issue as it appears from the facts that Frere Bros are
keener to keep his services (he signed a 5 year deal with the move company).

Initially the company should seek an interlocutory injunction as this preserves the subject
matter of the dispute, that is, the contract with Frere Bros, and the status quo between the
parties is maintained until the dispute can be heard by the court--it does not decide the
rights of the parties and is generally only obtained in the case of urgency. By granting an
injunction against Josef preventing him from acting anywhere else during the term of his
current contract Josef is not being forced to work for Frere by the court's granting of an
injunction. Josef could choose to work in some other profession than acting that had nothing
whatsoever to do with the business of the employer.

        Chapter 13

Problem answer

A problem question. Just note that with this problem there are three questions for
you to consider.

The first is the question of whether painting a portrait was a contract for the sale of goods.
The second question then follows on from the first and that is if it is not a contract for the sale
of goods, is it a contract and there are no rights. Don't forget to consider the final question.
Does the death of one of the parties make any difference to your answer? This raises the
question of whether the contract was one of personal services.

In this case what is the main purpose of the agreement? Is it to transfer ownership of
goods? If it is, it is a contract for the sale of goods. But if the main part of the agreement is
the skill and experience to be displayed by one of the parties in performance of the contract,
such as the painting of a portrait, and the transfer of title to the materials is of secondary
importance, it is a contract for work and labour and the supply of materials.

Even if it is not a contract for the sale of goods, all that means is that doesn't attract the
attention of the Goods Act. The verbal agreement to paint a portrait is still a contract but as
it is for services, it does attract the attention of the Goods Act.

The effect of the death of one of the partiers on the contract will depend on whether the
agreement is one for personal services or not. If it is for personal services and both parties
are required to personally perform obligations if the contract is to be fulfilled, then the death
of either party will bring the contract to an end.

What is the meaning of the following terms, giving an example in
each case:

 1. specific goods

 2. future goods

 3. unascertained goods.

With short answer questions, you should aim at answering them in a couple of lines.
Note that in addition to explain the meaning of the word, you have to give an example.
                                                                                                 REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS | 428

 1. Specific goods are goods identified and agreed on at the time of the contract of sale,
      for example, a year 2024 white Ford Ranger.

 2. Future goods are goods to be manufactured or acquired by the seller after the making
      of the contract for sale, for example, a sale by a dealer of a new 2024 Ford Ranger
      that is yet to be made.

 3. Unascertained goods are goods that are defined by description only. They are not
      identified and agreed on when the contract is made, for example, a bag of Sugar from
      the lot of one thousand bags.

Into which classification would the following goods be placed?

 1. 10 kilograms (kg) of sugar out of a 100-kilogram bag of sugar

 2. an LCD flat-screen TV on display in a shop

 3. a second-hand blue Toyota Camry car.

Another short answer question. Unlike the last question, you are not asked to do any
more than say into which classification the following fall.

 1. 10 kilograms of sugar out of a 100 kilogram bag of sugar - unascertained;
 2. an LCD flat-screen TV on display in a shop - ascertained
 3. a second-hand blue Toyota Camry car - specific.

Explain the purpose of a Romalpa clause in a sale of goods
contract. What impact, if any, has the Personal Property Securities
Act 2011 had on Romalpa clauses?

You need to do three things to answer this question well. First, begin with an
explanation of what a Romalpa Clause is. Second, explain its purpose. Finally,
explain what the Personal Property Securities Act is and its impact on Romalpa
clauses, if any.

A Romalpa clause in a contract is a retention of title clause. Its purpose in a contract for the
sale of goods is to protect the seller of goods by ensuring that the title to the goods remains
vested in the seller until the buyer complies with certain obligations (usually payment of the
purchase price).

The Personal Property Securities Act 2011 covers security interests over personal property
other than land. A security interest is an interest in personal property that in substance
429 | REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS

secures payment of a debt or other obligation. In addition to covering standard forms of
security such as chattel mortgages, the definition also covers retention of title clauses in
contracts under which a purchaser has possession of property but does not acquire title
from the vendor until the full purchase price is paid.

If the buyer defaults, or goes into receivership or liquidation, the seller may lose the goods
if they haven't used a `reservation of title' or `Romalpa' clause to reserve title or legal
ownership over the goods and registered their interest in the goods with the Personal
Property Securities Registry. If the buyer defaults, the seller may be able to get the goods
back from an innocent third party.

Problem answer

Another problem question. In this question you have to decide what area of the
Goods Act might apply. Look again at the facts and what you are looking for is
when did the property (ownership) in the kidneys pass from the seller to the buyer?
Remember that risk passes from the seller to the buyer when property or ownership
pass from the seller to the buyer.

The question here is whether the kidneys are ascertained or unascertained goods. If the
goods are ascertained, property and risk will have passed to the buyer. On the other hand,
if the goods are unascertained property and risk will have remained with the seller.

As the buyer's goods had been identified as they were sitting on the pavement awaiting
collection by the buyer's carrier, property and risk had passed to Wardar they would have
to bear the loss under s 18(3)(a)). of the Goods Act.

The seller agreed to supply 4950 tonnes of wheat to the buyer.
On delivery, the buyer discovered that it had received only 4895
tonnes, a shortfall of 55 tonnes, and so refused to accept delivery.
Can the buyer reject the whole delivery? Advise the buyer.

Another problem question. Remember that the general rule when dealing with
quantities of goods under the Goods Act is that the seller should deliver the exact
quantity of goods ordered by the buyer. Has that happened here? Or is there an
exception to this rule?

It is the duty of the seller to deliver the exact quantity of goods ordered by the buyer.
However, a trifling difference doesn't give the buyer the right to reject the goods, although
this is subject to trade usage, special agreement, and the course of dealing between the
parties (s 30 of the Goods Act).
                                                                                                 REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS | 430

Remember in the last Chapter relating to discharge and breach it was noted that the strict
rule of complete and precise performance applies only if the contract is entire-- that is, it
cannot be divided up. Contracts for sale of goods are usually treated as requiring entire
performance. But if variation is only minimal or trivial, the courts will generally not worry
about it. However, each case has to be determined on its facts, and in each case the
question to ask is whether there has been a substantial departure from the contract. In this
case, the sellers have substantially performed the contract.

Coca-Cola purchased 200,000 yo-yos, to be delivered in
instalments. They were to be used in conjunction with an
advertising program by Coca-Cola. Of the first 85,000 yo-yos
delivered, 65,000 were returned as defective. Coca-Cola wants to
terminate the contract. What percentage of yo-yos do you think
Coca-Cola should have to accept delivery of?

Another problem question. Unlike the last question where the variation was trivial, in
this case the question relates to rules of delivery in a contract of sale of goods and
acceptance where 85 % of the yoyos were defective. Should Coca-Cola be able to
terminate the contract or by taking delivery have Coca-Cola accepted the yoyos?

Under the Goods Act, the buyer by taking delivery of the yoyos has the right to inspect the
goods for defects. Section 34(1) of the Goods Act provides for a buyer's right to examine the
goods where goods are delivered to the buyer and he has not previously examined them,
he shall not be deemed to have accepted them until he has had a reasonable opportunity
of examining them for the purpose of ascertaining whether they are in conformity with the
contract.
In this case, given the percentage of yoyos that were defective was 85 %, Coca-Cola would
be able to rely on s 34(1) as what was delivered was not in conformity with the contract.

Who is an unpaid seller? Briefly explain.

Note the question asks you to `briefly' explain who is an unpaid seller.

An unpaid seller includes any person who is in the position of the seller, such as an agent
for the seller, and who:

   has not been paid the full price or has been paid with a bill of exchange or cheque as
      conditional payment, but which cheque or bill of exchange has been dishonoured.

Where an unpaid seller exercises a lien over goods, what is the
431 | REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS

seller doing?

Explain what a lien is, and then explain what the seller is doing.

A `lien' is a legal right of a seller to hold or retain possession of goods for performance of an
obligation by a buyer, which in this case is for payment of goods.

Discuss whether the unpaid seller has a right of resale of goods
under a contract for the sale of goods. What rights do you have as a
buyer under the Goods Act if the goods you purchase are faulty?

In this question there are two parts. The first relates to the rights of an unpaid seller
while the second part what rights you have if the goods are faulty.

The unpaid seller's rights depend on whether or not the property or possession of the
goods, or both, have passed to the buyer:

   Damages for non-acceptance;
   Where property and possession have passed to the buyer, the unpaid seller has rights

      only against the buyer personally.
   Where the unpaid seller has possession of the goods or they are still in transit to the

      buyer, the seller may:
          exercise a lien on the goods for the price--that is, the right to retain possession
            until the price is paid;

   in the case of insolvency, exercise the right of stopping the goods in transit,
      notwithstanding that the goods are no longer in the possession of the seller; and

   have a right of resale.
   Where property in the goods has not passed to the buyer, the unpaid seller has, in

      addition to the other remedies, the right to withhold or stop delivery of the goods.
   Where the seller has property and possession, the goods may be resold without the

      seller committing a breach of contract.

Assuming the faulty goods cost more than K20 (s 6 of the Goods Act), the buyer may be
able to rely on s 15(2)(b) of the Goods Act that where goods are bought by description from
a seller who deals in goods of that description, there is an implied condition that the goods
are of merchantable quality. Depending on what the faulty goods are, s 15(2)(c) may also
be able to be relied on as there is an implied warranty or condition as to quality or fitness
for a particular purpose that may be annexed by the usage of trade. Breach of a condition is
treated under s 12(4)((4) can only be treated as a breach of warranty. Remedies available
to a buyer for breach of warranty are damages (s 53).

        Chapter 14

A racehorse was consigned by rail for Swaffield at one of the
plaintiff's railway stations. Swaffield was not at the station when the
horse arrived, as it arrived late at night. The railway company
didn't have his address, so there was no way it could get in touch
with him to tell him the horse had arrived. As the horse couldn't be
kept at the station, it was sent to a stable at the company's
expense. When the railway company sought to recover the
expenses for the upkeep of the horse, Swaffield refused to pay.
Do you think the railway company will succeed in their claim?

A problem question and the area of law is agency. How do you know this is an agency
question? The railway company is transporting Swaffield's horse for him. Begin by
explaining what an agency relationship is, then apply each of the conditions to the
facts in the problem and come to a conclusion.

This is a case of agency involving a case of necessity or emergency four conditions must
be satisfied:

 1. there must be a genuine emergency where the principal's property is in physical
      danger; and

 2. it must be impossible or extremely difficult to get the principal's instructions; and
 3. the person must be entrusted with another's property; and
 4. the agent must act bona fide in the principal's interests, and not merely for the

      agent's own convenience.

In this case, it can be argued that the railway company was an agent of necessity as the four
conditions for an agency by necessity are satisfied. First, there was a genuine emergency
as the horse couldn't be kept at a railway station at night. Second, it was impossible to get in
touch with the owner of the horse as it arrived late at night. Third, the railway was entrusted
with Swaffield's horse. Finally, by sending the horse to a stable and feeding it, the company
was acting bona fide in the best interests of Swaffield by looking after the safety and well
being of his horse. The railway company should then succeed in their claim.

Lambert made an offer to buy land from an agent who in fact was
manager and agent of the property on behalf of Bolton Partners.
The agent had no authority to act for Bolton Partners, but he
433 | REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS

accepted the offer on their behalf. Lambert then sought to revoke
the offer. Bolton Partners subsequently ratified the acceptance of
the agent. The question here is whether the unauthorised actions
of the agent could be ratified by the principal. What do you think?

In this case the question tells you what are of law you need to look at. So begin by
explaining what agency and the principle of ratification are. Then set out down the
conditions that need to be satisfied for ratification to be effective and whether the
actions of the agent could be ratified by Bolton.

An agency relationship exists when you (the principal) give your authority to another (an
agent) to enter into a contract with a third party which will be enforceable both for and
against you (as long as the agent was acting within their authority).

Where the agent has acted without the principal's authority, but has nevertheless appeared
to act on behalf of a principal, it is open to the principal to decide whether to ratify the
transaction or not. If the principal decides to ratify the transaction, they assume the benefits
and burdens of the contract from the time the agent acted. The effect of ratification is to
create the relationship of principal and agent retrospectively.

For ratification to be effective, the following conditions must all be satisfied or the agent will
be personally liable:

   The agent must clearly be acting as an agent.
   The agent must have a known principal in mind. It is not necessary that the principal

      be named; however, the principal should be capable of being ascertained at the time
      of making the contract.
   The principal must have contractual capacity at the time of making the contract.
   There should be an act capable of ratification. A contract that is void from its inception
      cannot be made good by ratification.
   The principal must have full knowledge of all the facts at the time of ratification.
   Ratification must occur within a reasonable time of the contract being entered into.
   Ratification may be express or implied by the conduct of the principal. The only time a
      special form is required is for the ratification of a deed.
   Ratification must apply to the whole contract.
   Ratification can only be retrospective.

In this case, the conditions all appear to be satisfied (go through them in your answer)
and so the unauthorised actions of the agent could be ratified by the principal. A contract
existed, as ratification related back to the moment when the contract between the agent
                                                                                                 REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS | 434

and Lambert was concluded, which was before Lambert's revocation. Lambert's attempted
revocation was too late.

Laws sold his hotel to a third party. After the sale, he allowed his
name as licensee to continue to be displayed over the front door
to the hotel. The persons who bought the business continued to
purchase their liquor supplies, as Laws had done, from Tooth & Co
on credit. Tooth & Co were not aware of the change of ownership.
After several months of the new owners failing to pay their bills,
Tooth & Co sued Laws for the cost of the liquor supplied. Who do
you think would win - Tooth & Co or Laws? Why?

Again, from the facts you should be able to tell that this is an agency question. In this
case, has Laws held himself out as a principal by leaving his name over the door of
the hotel? Remember he was the previous owner and by leaving his name as licensee
still on the entrance to the hotel, would you think he was still the licensee?

In this case, Laws has a problem. The question is whether there is enough evidence to
establish apparent or ostensible authority. In trying to establish apparent or ostensible
authority, the courts have been prepared to use objective evidence, including:

   the words or conduct of the principal
   custom or trade usage
   situations where the principal has appointed the agent to perform a task that implies a

      certain amount of authority; and
   whether the position creates an impression of authority.

Laws, by his inaction in not notifying the supplier or removing his name from the sign saying
he was the nominee, prevents him from denying that an agency agreement existed. As a
result, Laws will be liable to pay for the liquor supplied because, by allowing his name to
remain over the front door of the hotel as licensee, he was representing to the public that he
was still the owner. Because of Laws's conduct, the rule of evidence called estoppel would
prohibit him from denying that the purchasers were his agents. Thus, it was possible to infer
that the new purchasers were his agent.

Just note that estoppel is a rule of evidence that prevents a person from denying the truth
of a statement formerly made by them, or the existence of facts which, by their wording or
conduct, have given the impression to others that the statement is true.

Lunghi had a block of land he wished to sell. He approached
435 | REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS

Sinclair, a real estate agent, to sell the land for him. Sinclair
informed Lunghi that his (Sinclair's) wife was an interested buyer,
and after some time, and little buyer interest, Lunghi eventually
sold the land to her. Lunghi subsequently discovered that
Sinclair's wife was a partner in the real estate agency and that no
real attempt had been made to sell the land. It was, in fact, worth
substantially more than he was told, and Mrs Sinclair had resold
the land for a significant profit. What would you advise Lunghi of
his options, if any?

Another problem question. The facts should alert you to the fact that this is an
agency situation, so begin by explaining what an agency situation is and that one of
the duties of an agent is not to receive a secret commission or make a secret profit.

An agency relationship exists when you (the principal) give your authority to another (an
agent) to enter into a contract with a third party which will be enforceable both for and
against you (as long as the agent was acting within their authority).

An agent must not make a secret profit, that is, a profit that should have gone to the
principal. Where an agent has an interest in a contract, full disclosure should be made to
the principal. Were the actions of Mrs Sinclair such that they could be said to amount to a
secret profit?

An agent who has a direct or indirect interest in a contract proposed by a principal should
make full disclosure. In this case Sinclair was under a duty to disclose the true value of the
property and that the profit made by Mrs Sinclair was in fact a secret profit that should go to
the principal (Lunghi).

An agent is entitled only to the agreed or customary payment for services performed. An
agent must not make a secret profit. In this case, the Sinclair's would be made to account
for the profit and would also not be allowed their commission.

Pow appointed McCann & Co, a firm of real estate agents, to sell
his flat. Without Pow's knowledge or consent, the agents gave
details to a sub-agent, who subsequently sold the property. While
McCann & Co were instrumental in arranging the sale, were they
entitled to any commission?

Another problem question but one that is much easier to identify as an agency case.
                                                                                                 REFLECTION AND REVISION ANSWERS | 436

Again, begin by explaining what an agent is and what are the responsibilities of an
agent and then apply that you the facts above.

The question to consider here is whether McCann & Co had to act in person or could
delegate their authority to a sub-agent. Where a personal confidence or skill is required by
the agent, delegation is not possible.

Without Pow's knowledge or consent, the McCann's gave details to a sub-agent, who
subsequently sold the property. While McCann & Co were instrumental in arranging the
sale, they were not entitled to any commission because Pow's contract with McCann & Co
required their personal skill and competence, which could not be delegated.

Harrison, an auctioneer, advertised an auction of horses as being
`without reserve'. This meant that the highest bona fide bidder
should have been the successful bidder, whatever the price bid.
At the auction, Warlow submitted a bid but the owner of the mare
he bid on submitted a final higher bid that the auctioneer
accepted. The plaintiff then sued the auctioneer, alleging a breach
of the auctioneer's contractual obligation to sell the horse to the
highest bona fide bidder. Do you think the plaintiff would be
successful in an action against the auctioneer? Explain why.

Another problem question. Here you need to think about the role of the auctioneer
and whether he was in breach of his contractual undertaking to sell to the highest
bona fide bidder.

Where there is `no reserve' (the minimum price below which the seller is not prepared to
sell), the law is unclear as to whether or not the auctioneer has to accept the highest bid.
The bidder cannot sue on the contract of sale because there has been no acceptance, and
therefore no contract.

However, there may be a personal action against the auctioneer, as `without reserve'
indicates that the goods or property may be sold to the highest bona fide bidder. The
English Court of Exchequer has held that by wrongfully accepting a bid from the owner,
the auctioneer was in breach of his contractual undertaking to sell to the highest bona fide
bidder. By advertising the auction as `without reserve', he had undertaken to sell to the
highest bona fide bidder--which would be the plaintiff in this case.

"What is Negligence?"

Narrator:

In this video we will give you a brief overview of "What is Negligence"?
We see Liam walking down the footpath while he is busy looking down at his mobile phone
and wearing his headphones.
We can see a car coming down the road approaching the pedestrian crossing.
The driver of the car has just hit the pedestrian on the crossing. His attention was distracted
by a mobile text.
The driver stopped but it was his carelessness that caused the accident. He is under a duty
of care to drive carefully and avoid hitting anyone, especially on the pedestrian crossing.
The pedestrian has been injured by the car. He has been placed in an ambulance and is on
the way to hospital.
If the injured pedestrian decides to sue, he will now be called the plaintiff, and he will sue
the driver (now the defendant), for his injuries.
The driver was careless and not paying attention because he was driving while looking at
his mobile. This accident was caused by his negligence. Negligence is an unintentional tort,
that is, a driver does not intend to run down a pedestrian.

Plaintiff's barrister:

To win a negligence claim, as this is a civil action, my client, the plaintiff, must prove on the
balance of probabilities, that the defendant owed my client a reasonable duty of care. That
is, to drive carefully and not to run him down (particularly on a pedestrian crossing). He has
breached his duty of care because he hit my client with his car on a crossing, and my client
was injured as a result.
                                                                                                           VIDEO TRANSCRIPTS AND PDFS | 438

My client must first prove that it is foreseeable that a driver of a car looking at his mobile
while driving is being distracted. There is a foreseeable duty of care in this matter.

A reasonable person driving a car would keep a lookout for other road users (including
pedestrians) and could foresee causing injury to a pedestrian crossing the street if he was
not paying attention to the road in front of him. From the facts, we would say the defendant
breached his duty of care by looking at his mobile while driving and was not as careful as a
reasonable person would be.

Finally, we need to consider the issue of causation. First, would the injury have occurred
`but for' the defendant's negligent driving? This is a question of fact.

Secondly, did the defendant's use of the mobile distract him and cause the accident? If he
had not been looking at his mobile while driving, would there still have been an accident?

If we look at the facts, clearly the acts of the defendant looking at his mobile while driving
led to his inattention and the hitting of the plaintiff. Causation would seem to be satisfied.

Judge:

Does the defendant have a defence? From the facts, it appears that the plaintiff was not
paying attention to whether it was safe to cross the road as he was busy on his mobile. The
law states you have to accept some responsibility for your safety. In this matter the court
would probably find the plaintiff contributed to his injuries by not checking if it was safe to
cross the road.

The amount of damages in Kina that the plaintiff will be entitled to for his injuries will be
determined by what percentage, if any, he was responsible for his injuries. This depends
on many factors including looking at his phone while approaching and using the crossing
without first checking it was safe to cross. He will also recover damages for pain and
suffering, ongoing medical and hospital costs, loss of income and future earnings.
