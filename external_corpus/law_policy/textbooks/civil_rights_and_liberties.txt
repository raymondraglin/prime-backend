Introduction

There are several good constitutional law and civil rights and liberties textbooks on the market, so why create
another? There was a confluence of factors that led to the creation of this volume. First, and most importantly,
after many years of teaching a constitutional law series at a large public institution, it became apparent that the
costs of the texts were a barrier to many students. Second, as texts were updated, the authors had to make choices
about inclusion or exclusion of cases due to printing and publishing constraints. As such, some material that was
pedagogically useful had to be jettisoned to include recent cases as the Court has changed doctrines in multiple
areas recently. These two factors were the main motivations. Trailing behind them is the wonderful support and
staff at Oregon State University's Open Educational Resources unit. With their help, I knew that the volume
would be useful and accessible to students.

To complete this volume, I worked with several excellent students that had completed the constitutional law
series. We examined several other textbooks, and discussed which cases were critical and which were most helpful
to them as they tried to understand the substantive material from the course. Together we built a plan for each
chapter to include cases that are landmarks, and other cases that help build the profile of the doctrine so that
there are guideposts as the doctrine shifts or changes. We read the full case and then selected the key components
that related to the constitutional issue, focusing on the key facts, the constitutional questions, and the resolution
of the case. We included dissents and concurring opinions where we agreed they were historically important,
useful or provided a significantly different approach to the question. We have also included appendices that may
help students place the cases in historical context. First, each case is hyperlinked by year to a table that indicates
who was on the Court at the time of the decision, their appointing president, and that president's political affil-
iation. When available, the table also includes the justices' Martin Quinn scores for that year so that the ideolog-
ical balance of the Court can be easily assessed. For these years, there is also a figure that provides these data in
a visual format. Finally, there is a table and graph of the scores of the median justice for the years available, again
using the Martin Quinn scores as our source.

To use this volume, I would approach it as any other constitutional law textbook; however, there is a significant
difference. This volume, again, only contains excerpts. Unless the justices provide an introduction or make
a strong connection to previous doctrine in the excerpt, these handholds between major cases are left to the
instructor to elucidate. I have used this type of text before in a "rights of the criminally accused course" and it
has been highly successful and pushes the students to make the connections as they read through the cases and
discuss them in class.

We hope to update this text every other year. I plan to assign my students a group project to excerpt a recent
important case that warrants inclusion in the volume. The best versions of these excerpts, with additional editing
by me, will then be included in a new version.

A huge thank you to Petar Jeknic, Kimberly Clairmont, Sarah Mason and Alex Metzdorf for their hard work
and dedication to this project. Petar was instrumental in the initial planning of the volume and Kimberly, Sarah,
and Alex made sure I met my deadlines and did so with fabulous excerpts.

    Opinion: Marshall, joined by Johnson, Duvall, Story, Thompson, McLean and Baldwin

Mr. Chief Justice MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.

... The plaintiff in error contends that it comes within that clause in the fifth amendment to the constitution,
which inhibits the taking of private property for public use without just compensation. He insists that this
amendment, being in favor of the liberty of the citizen, ought to be so construed as to restrain the legislative
power of a state, as well as that of the United States. If this proposition be untrue, the court can take no jurisdic-
tion of the cause.

The question thus presented is, we think, of great importance, but not of much difficulty. The Constitution
was ordained and established by the people of the United States for themselves, for their own government, and
not for the government of the individual States. Each State established a constitution for itself, and in that con-
stitution provided such limitations and restrictions on the powers of its particular government as its judgment
dictated. The people of the United States framed such a government for the United States as they supposed best
adapted to their situation and best calculated to promote their interests. The powers they conferred on this gov-
ernment were to be exercised by itself, and the limitations on power, if expressed in general terms, are naturally,
and we think necessarily, applicable to the government created by the instrument. They are limitations of power
granted in the instrument itself, not of distinct governments framed by different persons and for different pur-
poses.

If these propositions be correct, the fifth amendment must be understood as restraining the power of the Gen-
eral Government, not as applicable to the States.

The counsel for the plaintiff in error insists that the constitution was intended to secure the people of the several
states against the undue exercise of power by their respective state governments; as well as against that which
might be attempted by their general government ...

...

If the original constitution, in the ninth and tenth sections of the first article, draws this plain and marked line
of discrimination between the limitations it imposes on the powers of the general government, and on those of
18 | FIRST ATTEMPT

the states; if in every inhibition intended to act on state power, words are employed which directly express that
intent; some strong, reason must be assigned for departing from this safe and judicious course in framing the
amendments, before that departure can be assumed ...

Had the people of the several states, or any of them, required changes in their constitutions; had they required
additional safeguards to liberty from the apprehended encroachments of their particular governments the rem-
edy was in their own hands, and would have been applied by themselves. A convention would have been assem-
bled by the discontented state, and the required improvements would have been made by itself. The unwieldy
and cumbrous machinery of procuring a recommendation from two-thirds of congress, and the assent of three-
fourths of their sister states, could never have occurred to any human being as a mode of doing that which might
be effected by the state itself. Had the framers of these amendments intended them to be limitations on the
powers of the state governments, they would have initiated the framers of the original constitution, and have
expressed that intention. Had congress engaged in the extraordinary occupation of improving the constitutions
of the several states by affording the people additional protection from the exercise of power by their own gov-
ernments in matters which concerned themselves alone, they would have declared this purpose in plain and intel-
ligible language.

But it is universally understood, it is a part of the history of the day, that the great revolution which established
the constitution of the United States, was not effected without immense opposition. Serious fears were exten-
sively entertained that those powers which the patriot statesmen, who then watched over the interests of our
country, deemed essential to union, and to the attainment of those invaluable objects for which union was
sought, might be exercised in a manner dangerous to liberty. In almost every convention by which the consti-
tution was adopted, amendments to-guard against the abuse of power were recommended. These amendments
demanded security against the apprehended encroachments of the general government-not against those of the
local governments.

In compliance with a sentiment thus generally expressed, to quiet fears thus extensively entertained, amend-
ments were proposed by, the required majority in congress, and adopted by the states. These amendments con-
tain no expression indicating an intention to apply them to the state governments. This court cannot so apply
them.

We are of opinion that the provision in the fifth amendment to the constitution, declaring that private property
shall not be taken for public use without just compensation, is intended solely as a limitation on the exercise
of power by the government of the United States, and is not applicable to the legislation of the states. We are
therefore of opinion that there is no repugnancy between the several acts of the general assembly of Maryland,
given in evidence by the defendants at the trial of this cause, in the court of that state, and the constitution of
the United States. This court, therefore, has no jurisdiction of the cause; and it is dismissed.

Notes of Reporter before the Court:

(see https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/83/36 for full disposition.)

Mr. John A. Campbell, and also Mr. J. Q. A. Fellows, argued the case at much length and on the authorities, in
behalf of the plaintiffs in error. The reporter cannot pretend to give more than such an abstract of the argument
as may show to what the opinion of the court was meant to be responsive.

The learned counsel quoting Thiers, contended that `the right to one's self, to one's own faculties, physical and
intellectual, one's own brain, eyes, hands, feet, in a word to his soul and body, was an incontestable right; one
of whose enjoyment and exercise by its owner no one could complain, and one which no one could take away.
More than this, the obligation to labor was a duty, a thing ordained of God, and which if submitted to faithfully,
secured a blessing to the human family.'

...

Now, the act of the Louisiana legislature was in the face of all these principles; it made it unlawful for men to use
their own land for their own purposes; made it unlawful to any except the seventeen of this company to exercise
a lawful and necessary business for which others were as competent as they, for which at least one thousand per-
sons in the three parishes named had qualified themselves, had framed their arrangements in life, had invested
their property, and had founded all their hopes of success on earth. The act was a pure MONOPOLY; as such
against common right, and void at the common law of England. And it was equally void by our own law.

...

But if this monopoly were not thus void at common law, would be so under both the thirteenth and the fourteenth
amendments.

...
20 | SECOND ATTEMPT

Lest some competitor may present more tempting or convenient arrangements, the act directs that all of these
shall be closed on a particular day, and prohibits any one from having, keeping, or establishing any other; and a
peremptory command is given that all animals shall be sheltered, preserved, and protected by this corporation,
and by none other, under heavy penalties.

Is not this `a servitude?' Might it not be so considered in a strict sense? It is like the `thirlage' of the old Scotch
law and the banalites of seignioral France; which were servitudes undoubtedly. But, if not strictly a servitude, it
is certainly a servitude in a more popular sense, and, being an enforced one, it is an involuntary servitude.

...

The act is even more plainly in the face of the fourteenth amendment. That amendment was a development of
the thirteenth, and is a more comprehensive exposition of the principles which lie at the foundation of the thir-
teenth.

...

But the fourteenth amendment does define citizenship and the relations of citizens to the State and Federal gov-
ernment. It ordains that `all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction
thereof are citizens of the United States and of the State where they reside.' Citizenship in a State is made by res-
idence and without reference to the consent of the State. Yet, by the same amendment, when it exists, no State
can abridge its privileges or immunities.

...

The States in their closest connection with the members of the State, have been placed under the oversight and
restraining and enforcing hand of Congress. The purpose is manifest, to establish through the whole jurisdic-
tion of the United States ONE PEOPLE, and that every member of the empire shall understand and appreci-
ate the fact that his privileges and immunities cannot be abridged by State authority; that State laws must be so
framed as to secure life, liberty, property from arbitrary violation and secure protection of law to all. Thus, as
the great personal rights of each and every person were established and guarded, a reasonable confidence that
there would be good government might seem to be justified. The amendment embodies all that the statesman-
ship of the country has conceived for accommodating the Constitution and the institutions of the country to
the vast additions of territory, increase of the population, multiplication of States and Territorial governments,
the annual influx of aliens, and the mighty changes produced by revolutionary events, and by social, industrial,
commercial development. It is an act of Union, an act to determine the reciprocal relations of the millions of
population within the bounds of the United States--the numerous State governments and the entire United
States administered by a common government--that they might mutually sustain, support, and co-operate for
the promotion of peace, security, and the assurance of property and liberty.

...

From whatever cause originating, or with whatever special and present or pressing purpose passed, the four-
teenth amendment is not confined to the population that had been servile, or to that which had any of the dis-
abilities or disqualifications arising from race or from contract ...

The only question then is this: `When a State passes a law depriving a thousand people, who have acquired valu-
able property, and who, through its instrumentality, are engaged in an honest and necessary business, which
they understand, of their right to use such their own property, and to labor in such their honest and necessary
business, and gives a monopoly, embracing the whole subject, including the right to labor in such business, to
seventeen other persons--whether the State has abridged any of the privileges or immunities of these thousand
persons?'

...

MR. JUSTICE MILLER delivered the opinion of the court.

...

The appellee brought a suit in the Circuit Court to obtain an injunction against the appellant forbidding the
latter from exercising the business of butchering, or receiving and landing livestock intended for butchering,
within certain limits in the parishes of Orleans, Jefferson, and St. Bernard, and obtained such injunction by a
final decree in that court ...

The ground on which this suit was brought and sustained is that the plaintiffs had the exclusive right to have all
such stock landed at their stock-landing place, and butchered at their slaughter-house, by virtue of an act of the
General Assembly of Louisiana, approved March 8th, 1869, entitled, "An act to protect the health of the city of
New Orleans, to locate the stock landing and slaughter-houses, and to incorporate the Crescent City Live-Stock
Lauding and Slaughter-House Company." ...

The fact that it did so, and that this was conceded, was the basis of the contest in this court in the Slaughter-
House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, in which the law was assailed as a monopoly forbidden by the thirteenth and four-
teenth amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and these amendments as well as the fifteenth,
came for the first time before this court for construction. The constitutional power of the State to enact the
statute was upheld by this court. This power was placed by the court in that case expressly on the ground that it
was the exercise of the police power which had remained with the States in the formation of the original Consti-
tution of the United States, and had not been taken away by the amendments adopted since ...

...

The appellant, however, insists that, so far as the act of 1869 partakes of the nature of an irrepealable contract,
the legislature exceeded its authority, and it had no power to tie the hands of the legislature in the future from
legislating on that subject without being bound by the terms of the statute then enacted. This proposition pre-
sents the real point in the case ...
22 | SECOND ATTEMPT

While we are not prepared to say that the legislature can make valid contracts on no subject embraced in the
largest definition of the police power, we think that, in regard to two subjects so embraced, it cannot, by any
contract, limited exercise of those powers to the prejudice of the general welfare. These are the public health and
public morals. The preservation of these is so necessary to the best interests of social organization that a wise
policy forbids the legislative body to divest itself of the power to enact laws for the preservation of health and the
repression of crime.

It cannot be permitted that, when the Constitution of a State, the fundamental law of the land, has imposed
upon its legislature the duty of guarding, by suitable laws, the health of its citizens, especially in crowded cities,
and the protection of their person and property by suppressing and preventing crime, that the power which
enables it to perform this duty can be sold, bargained away, under any circumstances, as if it were a mere privilege
which the legislator could dispose of at his pleasure.

This principle has been asserted and repeated in this court in the last few years in no ambiguous terms ...

But the case of the Fertilizing Company v. Hyde Park (1879), is, perhaps, more directly in point as regard the
facts of the case, while asserting the same principle. ... The opinion cites the language of the court in Beer Com­
pany v. Massachusetts, already copied here, and numerous other cases of the exercise of the police power in pro-
tecting health and property, and holds that the charter conferred no irrepealable right for the fifty years of its
duration to continue a practice injurious to the public health.

These cases are all cited and their views adopted in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Louisiana in a suit
between the same parties in regard to the same matter as the present case, and which was brought to this court
by writ of error and dismissed before a hearing by the present appellee.

The result of these considerations is that the constitution of 1879 and the ordinances of the city of New Orleans,
which are complained of, are not void as impairing the obligation of complainant's contract, and that

The decree of the Circuit Court must be reversed, and the case remanded to that court with directions to dismiss the
bill.

MR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the court.

...

The constitution of Illinois provides that "no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property, without due
process of law." Art. 2, § 2. It also provides: "Private property shall not be taken or damaged for public use with-
out just compensation. Such compensation, when not made by the State, shall be ascertained by a jury, as shall be
prescribed by law. The fee of land taken for railroad tracks, without consent of the owners thereof, shall remain
in such owners, subject to the use for which it is taken." ...

By the fifth article of the general statute, of Illinois, approved April 10, 1872, and relating to the incorporation
of cities and villages, it was provided that "the city council shall have power, by condemnation or otherwise, to
extend any street, alley or highway over or across, or to construct any sewer under or through any railroad track,
right of way or land of any railroad company (within the corporate limits); but where no compensation is made
to such railroad company, the city shall restore such railroad track, right of way or land to its former state, or in
a sufficient manner not to have impaired its usefulness." ...

The ninth article of the same statute declared that when the corporate authorities of a city or village provided by
ordinance for the making of any local improvement authorized to be made, the making of which would require
that private property be taken or damaged for public use, the city or village should file in its name a petition in
some court of record of the county praying "that the just compensation to be made for private property to be
taken or damaged" for the improvement or purpose specified in the ordinance be ascertained by a jury ...

By an ordinance of the city council of Chicago approved October 9, 1880, it was ordained that Rockwell Street
in that city be opened and widened from West 18th Street to West 19th Street by condemning therefor, in accor-
24 | DUE PROCESS CLAUSE

dance with the above act of April 10, 1872, certain parcels of land owned by individuals, and also certain parts of
the right of way in that city of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad Company, a corporation of Illinois
...

In execution of that ordinance a petition was filed by the city, November 12, 1890, in the Circuit Court of Cook
County, Illinois, for the condemnation of the lots, pieces or parcels of land and property proposed to be taken or
damaged for the proposed improvement, and praying that the just compensation required for private property
taken or damaged be ascertained by a jury ...

The parties interested in the property described in the petition, including the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy
Railroad Company, were admitted as defendants in the proceeding. In their verdict the jury fixed the just com-
pensation to be paid to the respective individual owners of the lots, pieces and parcels of land and property
sought to be taken or damaged by the proposed improvements, and fixed one dollar as just compensation to the
railroad company in respect of those parts of its right of way described in the city's petition as necessary to be
used for the purposes of the proposed street ...

It is not contended, as it could not be, that the constitution of Illinois deprives the railroad company of any
right secured by the Fourteenth Amendment. For the state constitution not only declares that no person shall be
deprived of his property without due process of law, but that private property shall not be taken or damaged for
public use without just compensation. But it must be observed that the prohibitions of the amendment refer to
all the instrumentalities of the State, to its legislative, executive and judicial authorities, and, therefore, whoever
by virtue of public position under a state government deprives another of any right protected by that amend-
ment against deprivation by the State, "violates the constitutional inhibition; and as he acts in the name and for
the State, and is clothed with the State's power, his act is that of the State." This must be so, or, as we have often
said, the constitutional prohibition has no meaning, and "the State has clothed one of its agents with power to
annul or evade it." ...

When the government, through its' established agencies, interferes with the title to one's property, or with his
independent enjoyment of it, and its action is called in question as not in accordance with the law of the land,
we are to test its validity by those principles of civil liberty and constitutional protection which have become
established in our system of laws, and not generally by rules that pertain to forms of procedure merely. In judicial
proceedings the law of the land requires a hearing before condemnation, and judgment before dispossession; but
when property is appropriated by the government to public uses, or the legislature interferes to give direction to
its title through remedial statutes, different considerations from those which regard the controversies between
man and man must prevail, different proceedings are required, and we have only to see whether the interfer-
ence can be justified by the established rules applicable to the special case. Due process of law in each particular
case means such an exertion of the powers of government as the settled maxims of law permit and sanction, and
under such safeguards for the protection of individual rights as those maxims prescribe for the class of cases to
which the one in question belongs ...
                                                                                                                   DUE PROCESS CLAUSE | 25

In every government there is inherent authority to appropriate the property of the citizen for the necessities of
the State, and constitutional provisions do not confer the power, though they generally surround it with safe-
guards to prevent abuse. The restraints are, that when specific property is taken, a pecuniary compensation,
agreed upon or determined by judicial inquiry, must be paid." ...

In our opinion, a judgment of a state court, even if it be authorized by statute, whereby private property is taken
for the State or under its direction for public use, without compensation made or secured to the owner, is, upon
principle and authority, wanting in the due process of law required by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Con-
stitution of the United States, and the affirmance of such judgment by the highest court of the State is a denial
by that State of a right secured to the owner by that instrument ...

It is further contended that the railroad company was denied the equal protection of the laws in that by the final
judgment individual property owners were awarded, as compensation for contiguous property appropriated to
the public use by the same proceeding, the value of their land taken, while only nominal compensation was given
to the company-the value of its land, simply as land, across which the street was opened, not being taken into
account. This contention is without merit. Compensation was awarded to individual owners upon the basis of
the value of the property actually taken, having regard to the uses for which it was best adapted and the pur-
poses for which it was held and used and was likely always to be used. Compensation was awarded to the railroad
company upon the basis of the value of the thing actually appropriated by the public ... In the case of individual
owners, they were deprived of the entire use and enjoyment of their property, while the railroad company was
left in the possession and use of its property for the purposes for which it was being used and for which it was
best adapted, subject only to the right of the public to have a street across it. In this there was no denial of the
equal protection of the laws ...

We have examined all the questions of law arising on the record of which this court may take cognizance, and
which, in our opinion, are of sufficient importance to require notice at our hands, and finding no error, the judg-
ment is Affirmed.

    Decision: Affirmed
    Majority: J. Matthews, joined by J. Waite, J. Miller, J. Bradley, J. Woods, J. Gray, J. Blatchford
    Dissent: J. Harlan

MR. Justice Matthews delivered the opinion of the court.

...

It is claimed on behalf of the prisoner that the conviction and sentence are void, on the ground that they are
repugnant to that clause of the Fourteenth Article of Amendment of the Constitution of the United States
which is in these words: `Nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process
of law.'

The proposition of law we are asked to affirm is that an indictment or presentment by a grand jury, as known to
the common law of England, is essential to that "due process of law," when applied to prosecutions for felonies,
which is secured and guaranteed by this provision of the Constitution of the United States, and which accord-
ingly it is forbidden to the States respectively to dispense with in the administration of criminal law.

The question is one of grave and serious import, affecting both private and public rights and interests of great
magnitude, and involves a consideration of what additional restrictions upon the legislative policy of the States
has been imposed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States ...

...

On the other hand, it is maintained on behalf of the plaintiff in error that the phrase "due process of law" is
equivalent to "law of the land," as found in the 29th chapter of Magna Charta; that, by immemorial usage, it
has acquired a fixed, definite, and technical meaning; that it refers to and includes not only the general principles
of public liberty and private right which lie at the foundation of all free government, but the very institutions
which, venerable by time and custom, have been tried by experience and found fit and necessary for the preserva-
tion of those principles, and which, having been the birthright and inheritance of every English subject, crossed
the Atlantic with the colonists and were transplanted and established in the fundamental laws of the State; that,
having been originally introduced into the Constitution of the United States as a limitation upon the powers of
the government, brought into being by that instrument, it has now been added as an additional security to the
                                                                                                          TWO TRACK INCORPORATION | 27

individual against oppression by the States themselves; that one of these institutions is that of the grand jury, an
indictment or presentment by which against the accused in cases of alleged felonies is an essential part of due
process of law in order that he may not be harassed or destroyed by prosecutions founded only upon private
malice or popular fury.

... it may be said that Lord Coke himself explains his own meaning by saying `the law of the land,' as expressed in
Magna Charta, was intended due process of law, that is, by indictment or presentment of good and lawful men.

It is quite apparent from these extracts that the interpretation usually put upon Lord Coke's statement is too
large, because if an indictment or presentment by a grand jury is essential to due process of law in all cases of
imprisonment for crime, it applies not only to felonies but to misdemeanors and petty offences, and the conclu-
sion would be inevitable that information as a substitute for indictments would be illegal in all cases ...
...

When we add to this that the primitive grand jury heard no witnesses in support of the truth of the charges to
be preferred, but presented upon their own knowledge, or indicted upon common fame and general suspicion,
we shall be ready to acknowledge that it is better not to go too far back into antiquity for the best securities for
our "ancient liberties." It is more consonant to the true philosophy of our historical legal institutions to say that
the spirit of personal liberty and individual right, which they embodied, was preserved and developed by a pro-
gressive growth and wise adaptation to new circumstances and situations of the forms and processes found fit to
give, from time to time, new expression and greater effect to modern ideas of self-government ...

The Constitution of the United States was ordained, it is true, by descendants of Englishmen, who inherited the
traditions of English law and history; but it was made for an undefined and expanding future, and for a people
gathered and to be gathered from many nations and of many tongues. And while we take just pride in the prin-
ciples and institutions of the common law, we are not to forget that in lands where other systems of jurispru-
dence prevail, the ideas and processes of civil justice are also not unknown. Due process of law, in spite of the
absolutism of continental governments, is not alien to that code which survived the Roman Empire as the foun-
dation of modern civilization in Europe, and which has given us that fundamental maxim of distributive justice-
suum cuique tribuere. There is nothing in Magna Charta, rightly construed a broad charter of public right and
law, which ought to exclude the best ideas of all systems and of every age; and as it was the characteristic principle
of the common law to draw its inspiration from every fountain of justice, we are not to assume that the sources
of its supply have been exhausted. On the contrary, we should expect that the new and various experiences of
our own situation and system will mould and shape it into new and not less useful forms ...

In this country written constitutions were deemed essential to protect the rights and liberties of the people
against the encroachments of power delegated to their governments, and the provisions of Magna Charta were
incorporated into Bills of Rights. They were limitations upon all the powers of government, legislative as well as
executive and judicial ...

Tried by these principles, we are unable to say that the substitution for a presentment or indictment by a grand
jury of the proceeding by information, after examination and commitment by a magistrate, certifying to the
probable guilt of the defendant, with the right on his part to the aid of counsel, and to the cross-examination of
§28 | TWO TRACK INCORPORATION

the witnesses produced for the prosecution, is not due process of law. It is, as we have seen, an ancient proceed-
ing at common law, which might include every case of an offence of less grade than a felony, except misprision
of treason; and in every circumstance of its administration, as authorized by the statute of California, it care-
fully considers and guards the substantial interest of the prisoner. It is merely a preliminary proceeding, and can
result in no final judgment, except as the consequence of a regular judicial trial, conducted precisely as in cases
of indictment ...

For these reasons, finding no error therein, the judgment of the Supreme Court of California is

Affirmed.

MR. JUSTICE PECKHAM delivered the opinion of the court.

...

On the 27th of June, 1898, an information was filed against the plaintiff in error by the prosecuting attorney of
the county, in a state court of the State of Utah, charging him with the crime of robbery committed within the
county in May, 1898. In September, 1898, he was tried before a jury composed of but eight jurors, and convicted
and sentenced to imprisonment in the state prison for eighteen years, and since that time has been confined in
prison, undergoing the sentence of the state court.

In May, 1899, he applied to the Supreme Court of the State for a writ of habeas corpus, and alleged in his
sworn petition that he was a natural-born citizen of the United States, and that his imprisonment was unlawful,
because he was prosecuted under an information instead of by indictment by a grand jury, and was tried by a jury
composed of eight instead of twelve jurors. He specially set up and claimed (1) that to prosecute him by informa-
tion abridged his privileges and immunities as a citizen of the United States, under article 5 of the amendments
to the Constitution of the United States, and also violated section 1 of article 14 of those amendments; (2) that a
trial by jury of only eight persons abridged his privileges and immunities as a citizen of the United States, under
article 6, and also violated section 1 of article 14 of such amendments; (3) that a trial by such a jury and his sub-
                                                                                                         TWO TRACK INCORPORATION | 29

sequent imprisonment by reason of the verdict of that jury deprived him of his liberty without due process of
law, -in violation of section 1 of article 14, which provides that no State shall deprive any person of life, liberty
or, property, without due process of law ...

The questions to be determined in this court are, (1) as to the validity, with reference to the Federal Constitu-
tion, of the proceeding against the plaintiff in error on an information instead of by an indictment by a grand
jury; and (2) the validity of the trial of the plaintiff in error by a jury composed of eight instead of twelve jurors
...

In a Federal court no person can be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless by indict-
ment by a grand jury, with the exceptions stated in the Fifth Amendment. Yet this amendment was held in the
Hurtado case not to apply to a prosecution for murder in a state court pursuant to a state law. The claim was
made in the case (and referred to in the opinion) that the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment provided
an additional security to the individual against oppression by the States themselves, and limited their powers to
the same extent as the amendments theretofore adopted had limited the powers of the Federal Government. By
holding that the conviction `upon an information was valid, the court necessarily held that an indictment was
not necessary ... To the other objection, that a conviction upon an information deprives a person of his liberty
without due process of law, the Hurtado case is, as we have said, a complete and conclusive answer.

...

It would seem to be quite plain that the provision in the Utah constitution for a jury of eight jurors in all state
criminal trials, for other than capital offences, violates the Sixth Amendment, provided that amendment is now
to be construed as applicable to criminal prosecutions of citizens of the- United States in state courts ...

It is conceded that there are certain privileges or immunities possessed by a citizen of the United States, because
of his citizenship, and that they cannot be abridged by any action of the States. In order to limit the powers
which it was feared might be claimed or exercised by the Federal Government, under the' provisions of the Con-
stitution as it was when adopted, the first ten amendments to that instrument were proposed to the legislatures
of the several States by the first Congress on the 25th of September, 1789. They were intended as restraints and
limitations upon the powers of the General Government, and were not intended to and did not have any effect
upon the powers of the respective States. This has been many times decided. The cases herewith cited are to that
effect, and they cite many others which decide the same matter. Spies v. Illinois (1887) [other citations omitted].

It is claimed, however, that since the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment the effect of the former amend-
ments has been thereby changed and greatly enlarged. It is now urged in substance that all the provisions con-
tained in the first ten amendments, so far as they secure and recognize the fundamental rights of the individual
as against the exercise of Federal power, are by virtue of this amendment to be regarded as privileges or immuni-
ties of a citizen of the United States, and, therefore, the States cannot provide for any procedure in state courts
which could not be followed in a Federal court because of the limitations contained in those amendments ...

That the primary reason for that amendment was to secure the full enjoyment of liberty to the colored race is not
denied, yet it is not restricted to that purpose, and it applies to every one, white or black, that comes within its
30 | TWO TRACK INCORPORATION

provisions. But, as said in the Slaughter-house Cases, the protection of the citizen in his rights as a citizen of the
State still remains with the State ... But if all these rights are included in the phrase "privileges and immunities"`
of citizens of the United States, which the States by reason of the Fourteenth Amendment cannot in any manner
abridge, then the sovereignty of the State in regard to them has been entirely destroyed, and the Slaughter-house
Cases, and United States v. Cruikshank are all wrong, and should be overruled ...

In the case of a constitutional amendment it is of less materiality than in that of an ordinary bill or resolution. A
constitutional amendment must be agreed to, not only by Senators and Representatives, but it must be ratified
by the legislatures, or by conventions, in three fourths of the States before such amendment can take effect. The
safe way is to read its language in connection with the known condition of affairs out of which the occasion for
its adoption may have arisen, and then to construe it, if there be therein any doubtful expressions, in a way so
far as is reasonably possible, to forward the known purpose or object for which the amendment was adopted.
This rule could not, of course, be so used as to limit the force and effect of an amendment in a manner which
the plain and unambiguous language used therein would not justify or permit.

For the reasons stated, we come to the conclusion that the clause under consideration does not affect the validity
of the Utah constitution and legislation.

The remaining question is, whether in denying the right of an individual, in all criminal cases not capital, to have
a jury composed of twelve jurors, the State deprives him of life, liberty or property, without due process of law.

This question is, as we believe, substantially answered by the reasoning of the opinion in the Hurtado case,
supra. The distinct question was there presented whether it was due process of law to prosecute a person charged
with murder by an information under the state constitution and law. It was held that it was, and that the Four-
teenth Amendment did not prohibit such a procedure. In our opinion the right to be exempt from prosecution
for an infamous crime, except upon a presentment by a grand jury, is of the same nature as the right to a petit
jury of the number fixed by the common law. If the State have the power to abolish the grand jury and the con-
sequent proceeding by indictment, the same course of reasoning which establishes that right will and does estab-
lish the right to alter the number of the petit jury from that provided by the common law. Hodgson v. Vermont
(1897) [other citations omitted].

Trial by jury has never been affirmed to be a necessary requisite of due process of law. In pot one of the cases cited
and commented upon in the Hurtado case is a trial by jury mentioned as a necessary part of such process ...

Judged by the various cases in this court we think there is no error in this record, and the judgment of the
Supreme Court of Utah must, therefore, be Affirmed.

What are the privileges and immunities of "citizens of the United States"? Without attempting to enumerate
them, it ought to be deemed safe to say that such privileges and immunities embrace at least those expressly rec-
ognized by the Constitution of the United States and placed beyond the power of Congress to take away or
impair ...

It seems to me that the privileges and immunities enumerated in these amendments belong to every citizen of the
United States. They were universally so regarded prior to the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment. In order
to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense,
promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to themselves and their posterity, the political
community known as the People of the United States ordained and established the Constitution of the United
States; and every member of that political community was a citizen of the United States. It was that commu-
nity that adopted, in the mode prescribed by the Constitution, the first ten amendments; and what they had in
view by so doing was to make it certain that the privileges and immunities therein specified -the enjoyment of
which, the fathers believed, were necessary in order to secure the blessings of liberty could never be impaired or
destroyed by the National Government ...

I am also of opinion that the trial of the accused for the crime charged against him by a jury of eight persons was
not consistent with the "due process of law" prescribed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Referring to the words
in the Fifth Amendment, that "no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of
law," this court said in Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken: "The Constitution contains no description of those processes
which it was intended to allow or forbid. It does not even declare what principles are to be applied to ascertain
whether it be due process. It was manifest that it was not left to the legislative power to enact any process which
might be devised. The article is a restraint on the legislative as well as on the executive and judicial powers of
the Government, and cannot be so construed as to leave Congress free to make any process `due process of law'
by its mere will. To what principles are we to resort to ascertain whether this process enacted by Congress is
due process? To this the answer must be twofold. We must examine the Constitution itself to see whether this
process be in conflict with any of its provisions. If not found to be so, we must look to those settled usages and
modes of proceeding existing in the common and statute law of England before the emigration of our ancestors,
and which are shown not to have been unsuited to their civil and political condition by having been acted on by
them after the settlement `of this country." ...

The right to be tried when charged with crime by a jury of twelve person is placed by the Constitution upon
the same basis as the other rights specified in the first ten amendments. And while those amendments origi-
nally limited only the powers of the National Government in respect of the privileges and immunities specified
therein, since the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment those privileges and immunities are, in my opinion,
also guarded against infringement by the States ...

If some of the guarantees of life, liberty and property which at the time of the adoption of the National Con-
stitution were regarded as fundamental and as absolutely essential to the enjoyment of freedom, have in the
judgment of some ceased to be of practical value, it is for the people of the United States so to declare by an
amendment of that instrument. But, if I do not wholly misapprehend the scope and legal effect of the present
§32 | TWO TRACK INCORPORATION

decision, the Constitution of the United States does not stand in the way of any State striking down guarantees
of life and liberty that English speaking people have for centuries regarded as vital to personal security, and which
the men of the Revolutionary period universally claimed as the birthright of freemen.

I dissent from the opinion and judgment of the court.

MR. JUSTICE SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.

...

Benjamin Gitlow was indicted in the Supreme Court of New York, with three others, for the statutory crime
of criminal anarchy. New York Penal Laws, §§ 160, 161. He was separately tried, convicted, and sentenced to
imprisonment. The judgment was affirmed by the Appellate Division and by the Court of Appeals. 195 App.
Div. 773; 234 N. Y. 132 and 539. The case is here on writ of error to the Supreme Court, to which the record
was remitted ...

The contention here is that the statute, by its terms and as applied in this case, is repugnant to the due process
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Its material provisions are:

"§ 160. Criminal anarchy defined. Criminal anarchy is the doctrine that organized government should be over-
thrown by force or violence, or by assassination of the executive head or of any of the executive officials of gov-
ernment, or by any unlawful means. The advocacy of such doctrine either by word of mouth or writing is a
felony ...

The defendant is a member of the Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party, a dissenting branch or faction of
that party formed in opposition to its dominant policy of" moderate Socialism." Membership in both is open
to aliens as well as citizens. The Left Wing Section was organized nationally at a conference in New York City in
June, 1919, attended by ninety delegates from twenty different States. The conference elected a National Coun-
cil, of which the defendant was a member, and left to it the adoption of a "Manifesto." This was published in
                                                                                                         TWO TRACK INCORPORATION | 33

The Revolutionary Age, the official organ of the Left Wing. The defendant was on the board of managers of the
paper and was its business manager. He arranged for the printing of the paper and took to the printer the manu-
script of the first issue which contained the Left Wing Manifesto, and also a Communist Program and a Program
of the Left Wing that had been adopted by the conference. Sixteen-thousand copies were printed, which were
delivered at the premises in New York City used as the office of the Revolutionary Age and the headquarters of
the Left Wing, and occupied by the defendant and other officials. These copies were paid for by the. defendant,
as business manager of the paper. Employees at this office wrapped and mailed out copies of the paper under
the defendant's direction; and copies were sold from this office. It was admitted that the defendant signed a card
subscribing to the Manifesto and Program of the Left Wing, which all applicants were required to sign before
being admitted to membership; that he went to different parts of the State to speak to branches of the Socialist
Party about the principles of the Left Wing and advocated their adoption; and that he was responsible for the
Manifesto as it appeared, that "he knew of the publication, in a general way and he knew of its publication after-
wards, and is responsible for its circulation." ...

The precise question presented, and the only question which we can consider under this writ of error, then is,
whether the statute, as construed and applied in this case by the state courts, deprived the defendant of his lib-
erty of expression in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment ...

The statute does not penalize the utterance or publication of abstract "doctrine" or academic discussion having
no quality of incitement to any concrete action. It is not aimed against mere historical or philosophical essays. It
does not restrain the advocacy of changes in the form of government by constitutional and lawful means. What
it prohibits is language advocating, advising or teaching the overthrow of organized government by unlawful
means. These words imply urging to action ...

The Manifesto, plainly, is neither the statement of abstract doctrine nor, as suggested by counsel, mere predic-
tion that industrial disturbances and revolutionary mass strikes will result spontaneously in an inevitable process
of evolution in the economic system. It advocates and urges in fervent language mass action which shall progres-
sively foment industrial disturbances and through political mass strikes and revolutionary mass action overthrow
and destroy organized parliamentary government. It concludes with a call to action in these words: "The prole-
tariat revolution and the Communist reconstruction of society-the struggle for these-is now indispensable ...

For present purposes we may and do assume that freedom of speech and of the press-which are protected by
the First Amendment from abridgment by Congress are among the fundamental personal rights and "liberties"
protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from impairment by the States ...

It is a fundamental principle, long established, that the freedom of speech and of the press which is secured by
the Constitution, does not confer an absolute right to speak or publish, without responsibility, whatever one
may choose, or an unrestricted and unbridled license that gives immunity for every possible use of language and
prevents the punishment of those who abuse this freedom ...

That a State in the exercise of its police power may punish those who abuse this freedom by utterances inimical
to the public welfare, tending to corrupt public morals, incite to crime, or disturb the public peace, is not open
to question ...
34 | TWO TRACK INCORPORATION

And, for yet more imperative reasons, a State may punish utterances endangering the foundations of organized
government and threatening its overthrow by unlawful means. These imperil its own existence as a constitu-
tional State. Freedom of speech and press, said Story (supra) does not protect disturbances to the public peace
or the attempt to subvert the government. It does not protect publications or teachings which tend to subvert
or imperil the government or to impede or hinder it in the performance of its governmental duties ...

It does not protect publications prompting the overthrow of government by force; the punishment of those
who publish articles which tend to destroy organized society being essential to the security of freedom and the
stability of the State ...

That utterances inciting to the overthrow of organized government by unlawful means, present a sufficient dan-
ger of substantive evil to bring their punishment within the range of legislative discretion, is clear. Such utter-
ances, by their very nature, involve danger to the public peace and to the security of the State. They threaten
breaches of the peace and ultimate revolution. And the immediate danger is none the less real and substantial,
because the effect of a given utterance cannot be accurately foreseen. The State cannot reasonably be required
to measure the danger from every such utterance in the nice balance of a jeweler's scale. A single revolutionary
spark may kindle a fire that, smouldering for a time, may burst into a sweeping and destructive conflagration.
It cannot be said that the State is acting arbitrarily or unreasonably when in the exercise of its judgment as to
the measures necessary to protect the public peace and safety, it seeks to extinguish the spark without waiting
until it has enkindled the flame or blazed into the conflagration. It cannot reasonably be required to defer the
adoption of measures for its own peace and safety until the revolutionary utterances lead to actual disturbances
of the public peace or imminent and immediate danger of its own destruction; but it may, in the exercise of its
judgment, suppress the threatened danger in its incipiency ...

We cannot hold that the present statute is an arbitrary or unreasonable exercise of the police power of the State
unwarrantably infringing the freedom of speech or press; and we must and do sustain its constitutionality.

This being so it may be applied to every utterance not too trivial to be beneath the notice of the law-which is of
such a character and used with such intent and purpose as to bring it within the prohibition of the statute ... In
other words, when the legislative body has determined generally, in the constitutional exercise of its discretion,
that utterances of a certain kind involve such danger of substantive evil that they may be punished, the question
whether any specific utterance coming within the prohibited class is likely, in and of itself, to bring about the
substantive evil, is not open to consideration. It is sufficient that the statute itself be constitutional and that the
use of the language comes within its prohibition ...

We need not enter upon a consideration of the English common law rule of seditious libel or the Federal Sedition
Act of 1798, to which reference is made in the defendant's brief. These are so unlike the present statute, that we
think the decisions under them cast no helpful light upon the questions here.
§                                                                                                        TWO TRACK INCORPORATION | 35

And finding, for the reasons stated, that the statute is not in itself unconstitutional, and that it has not been
applied in the present case in derogation of any constitutional right, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Affirmed.

MR. JUSTICE CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.

...

Appellant was indicted in Fairfield County, Connecticut, for the crime of murder in the first degree. A jury
found him guilty of murder in the second degree, and he was sentenced to confinement in the state prison for
life. Thereafter the State of Connecticut, with the permission of the judge presiding at the trial, gave notice of a
plea to the Supreme Court of Errors ...

Upon such appeal, the Supreme Court of Errors reversed the judgment and ordered a new trial. State v. Palko,
121 Conn. 669; 186 Atl. 657. It found that there had been error of law to the prejudice of the state (1) in exclud-
ing testimony as to a confession by defendant; (2) in excluding testimony upon cross-examination of defendant
to impeach his credibility, and (3) in the instructions to the jury as to the difference between first and second
degree murder ...

Pursuant to the mandate of the Supreme Court of Errors, defendant was brought to trial again. Before a jury
was impaneled and also at later stages of the case he made the objection that the effect of the new trial was to
place him twice in jeopardy for the same offense, and in so doing to violate the Fourteenth Amendment of the
Constitution of the United States ...

The argument for appellant is that whatever is forbidden by the Fifth Amendment is forbidden by the Four-
teenth also. The Fifth Amendment, which is not directed to the states, but Solely to the federal government,
creates immunity from double jeopardy. No person shall be "subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeop-
36 | TWO TRACK INCORPORATION

ardy of life or limb." The Fourteenth Amendment ordains, "nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty,
or property, without due process of law." To retry a defendant, though under one indictment and only one, sub-
jects him, it is said, to double jeopardy in violation of the Fifth Amendment, if the prosecution is one on behalf
of the United States. From this the consequence is said to follow that there is a denial of life or liberty without
due process of law, if the prosecution is one on behalf of the People of a State ...

We have said that, in appellant's view, the Fourteenth Amendment is to be taken as embodying the prohibitions
of the Fifth. His thesis is even broader. Whatever would be a violation of the original bill of rights (Amendments
I to VIII) if done by the federal government is now equally unlawful by force of the Fourteenth Amendment if
done by a state. There is no such general rule.

The Fifth Amendment provides, among other things, that no person shall be held to answer for a capital or oth-
erwise infamous crime unless on presentment or indictment of a grand jury. This court has held that, in prose-
cutions by a state, presentment or indictment by a grand jury may give way to informations at the instance of a
public officer ... On the other hand, the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment may make it unlaw-
ful for a state to abridge by its statutes the freedom of speech which the First Amendment safeguards against
encroachment by the Congress, De Jonge v. Oregon (1937) [other citations omitted], or the like freedom of the
press, Grosjean v. American Press Co. (1936) [other citations omitted], or the free exercise of religion, Hamilton
v. Regents (1934) [other citations omitted] ... In these and other situations immunities that are valid as against
the federal government by force of the specific pledges of particular amendments have been found to be implicit
in the concept of ordered liberty, and thus, through the Fourteenth Amendment, become valid as against the
states ...

The line of division may seem to be wavering and broken if there is a hasty catalogue of the cases on the one
side and the other. Reflection and analysis will induce a different view. There emerges the perception of a ratio-
nalizing principle which gives to discrete instances a proper order and coherence. The right to trial by jury and
the immunity from prosecution except as the result of an indictment may have value and importance. Even so,
they are not of the very essence of a scheme of ordered liberty. To abolish them is not to violate a "principle of
justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental." Snyder v. Mass­
achusetts (1934) [other citations omitted] ... Few would be so narrow or provincial as to maintain that a fair and
enlightened system of justice would be impossible without them. What is true of jury trials and indictments is
true also, as the cases show, of the immunity from compulsory self-incrimination. Twining v. New Jersey (1908).
This too might be lost, and justice still be done. Indeed, today as in the past there are students of our penal sys-
tem who look upon the immunity as a mischief rather than a benefit, and who would limit its scope, or destroy it
altogether! No doubt there would remain the need to give protection against torture, physical or mental. Justice,
however, would not perish if the accused were subject to a duty to respond to orderly inquiry. The exclusion
of these immunities and privileges from the privileges and immunities protected against the action of the states
has not been arbitrary or casual. It has been dictated by -a study and appreciation of the meaning, the essential
implications, of liberty itself ...

We reach a different plane of social and moral values when we pass to the privileges and immunities that have
been taken over from the earlier articles of the federal bill of rights and brought within the Fourteenth Amend-
                                                                                                         TWO TRACK INCORPORATION | 37

ment by a process of absorption. These in their origin were effective against the federal government alone. If the
Fourteenth Amendment has absorbed them, the process of absorption has had its source in the belief that nei-
ther liberty nor justice would exist if they were sacrificed ...

Our survey of the cases serves, we think, to justify the statement that the dividing line between them, if not unfal-
tering throughout its course, has been true for the most part to a unifying principle. On which side of the line
the case made out by the appellant has appropriate location must be the next inquiry and the final one. Is that
kind of double jeopardy to which the statute has subjected him a hardship so acute and shocking that our polity
will not endure it? Does it violate those "fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all
our civil and political institutions"? The answer surely must be "no." What the answer would have to be if the
state were permitted after a trial free from error to try the accused over again or to bring another case against him,
we have no occasion to consider. We deal with the statute before us and no other. The state is not attempting
to wear the accused out by a multitude of cases with accumulated trials. It asks no more than this, that the case
against him shall go on until there shall be a trial free from the corrosion of substantial legal error. State v. Felch
(1918). This is not cruelty at all, nor even vexation in any immoderate degree. If the trial had been infected with
error adverse to the accused, there might have been review at his instance, and as often as necessary to purge the
vicious taint. A reciprocal privilege, subject at all times to the discretion of the presiding judge, State v. Carabetta
(1927), has now been granted to the state. There is here no seismic innovation. The edifice of justice stands, its
symmetry, to many, greater than before ...

The conviction of appellant is not in derogation of any privileges or immunities that belong to him as a citizen
of the United States.

There is argument in his behalf that the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as well
as the due process clause has been flouted by the judgment ... gives all the answer that is necessary.

The judgment is

Affirmed.

MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.

The precise question for consideration is this: Does a conviction by a State court for a State offense deny the "due
process of law" required by the Fourteenth Amendment, solely because evidence that was admitted at the trial
was obtained under circumstances which would have rendered it inadmissible in a prosecution for violation of a
federal law in a court of the United States because there deemed to be an infraction of the Fourth Amendment
as applied in Weeks v. United States (1914)?...

The notion that the "due process of law" guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment is shorthand for the first
eight amendments of the Constitution and thereby incorporates them has been rejected by this Court again and
again, after impressive consideration ...

For purposes of ascertaining the restrictions which the Due Process Clause imposed upon the States in the
enforcement of their criminal law, we adhere to the views expressed in Palko v. Connecticut, supra, 302 U. S.
319. That decision speaks to us with the great weight of the authority, particularly in matters of civil liberty, of a
court that included Mr. Chief Justice Hughes, Mr. Justice Brandeis, Mr. Justice Stone and Mr. Justice Cardozo,
to name only the dead in rejecting the suggestion that that the Due Process Clause incorporated the original Bill
of Rights ...

Due process of law thus conveys neither formal nor fixed nor narrow requirements. It is the compendious
expression for all those rights which the courts must enforce because they are basic to our free society. But basic
rights do not become petrified as of any one time, even though, as a matter of human experience, some may
not too rhetorically be called eternal verities. It is of the very nature of a free society to advance in its standards
of what is deemed reasonable and right. Representing as it does a living principle, due process is not confined
within a permanent catalogue of what may at a given time be deemed the limits or the essentials of fundamental
rights ...

The security of one's privacy against arbitrary intrusion by the police-which is at the core of the Fourth Amend-
ment-is basic to a free society. It is therefore implicit in "the concept of ordered liberty" and as such enforceable
against the States through the Due Process Clause. The knock at the door, whether by day or by night, as a pre-
                                                                                                         TWO TRACK INCORPORATION | 39

lude to a search, without authority of law but solely on the authority of the police, did not need the commentary
of recent history to be condemned as inconsistent with the conception of human rights enshrined in the history
and the basic constitutional documents of English-speaking peoples ...

Granting that in practice the exclusion of evidence may be an effective way of deterring unreasonable searches,
it is not for this Court to condemn as falling below the minimal standards assured by the Due Process Clause
a State's reliance upon other methods which, if consistently enforced, would be equally effective ... We cannot
brush aside the experience of States which deem the incidence of such conduct by the police too slight to call for
a deterrent remedy not by way of disciplinary measures but by overriding the relevant rules of evidence. There
are, moreover, reasons for excluding evidence unreasonably obtained by the federal police which are less com-
pelling in the case of police under State or local authority. The public opinion of a community can far more
effectively be exerted against oppressive conduct on the part of police directly responsible to the community
itself than can local opinion, sporadically aroused, be brought to bear upon remote authority pervasively exerted
throughout the country.

We hold, therefore, that in a prosecution in a State court for a State crime the Fourteenth Amendment does not
forbid the admission of evidence obtained by an unreasonable search and seizure. And though we have inter-
preted the Fourth Amendment to forbid the admission of such evidence, a different question would be pre-
sented if Congress under its legislative powers were to pass a statute purporting to negate the Weeks doctrine.
We would then be faced with the problem of the respect to be accorded the legislative judgment on an issue as
to which, in default of that judgment, we have been forced to depend upon our own. Problems of a converse
character, also not before us, would be presented should Congress under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment
undertake to enforce the rights there guaranteed by attempting to make the Weeks doctrine binding upon the
States.

Gideon v. Wainwright

372 U.S. 335 (1963)

    Opinion: J. Black
    Decision: unanimous reversed
    Majority: J. Black, joined by J. Warren, J. Brennan, J. Stewart, J. White
    Concurring: J. Clark, J. Harlan, J. Douglas

MR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.

Petitioner was charged in a Florida state court with having broken and entered a poolroom with intent to com-
mit a misdemeanor. This offense is a felony under Florida law. Appearing in court without funds and without a
lawyer, petitioner asked the court to appoint counsel for him, whereupon the following colloquy took place:

"The COURT: Mr. Gideon, I am sorry, but I cannot appoint Counsel to represent you in this case. Under the
laws of the State of Florida, the only time the Court can appoint Counsel to represent a Defendant is when that
person is charged with a capital offense. I am sorry, but I will have to deny your request to appoint Counsel to
defend you in this case."

"The DEFENDANT: The United States Supreme Court says I am entitled to be represented by Counsel."

Put to trial before a jury, Gideon conducted his defense about as well as could be expected from a layman. He
made an opening statement to the jury, cross-examined the State's witnesses, presented witnesses in his own
defense, declined to testify himself, and. made a short argument "emphasizing his innocence to the charge con-
tained in the Information filed in this case." The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and petitioner was sentenced
to serve five years in the state prison. Later, petitioner filed in the Florida Supreme Court this habeas corpus peti-
tion attacking his conviction and sentence on the ground that the trial court's refusal to appoint counsel for him
denied him rights "guaranteed by the Constitution and the Bill of Rights by the United States Government." ...

The facts upon which Betts claimed that he had been unconstitutionally denied the right to have counsel
appointed to assist him are strikingly like the facts upon which Gideon here bases his federal constitutional
claim. Betts was indicted for robbery in a Maryland state court. On arraignment, he told the trial judge of his
lack of funds to hire a lawyer and asked the court to appoint one for him. Betts was advised that it was not the
practice in that county to appoint counsel for indigent defendants except in murder and rape cases. He then
pleaded not guilty, had witnesses summoned, cross-examined the State's witnesses, examined his own, and chose
not to testify himself. He was found guilty by the judge, sitting without a jury, and sentenced to eight years in
prison ...
                                                                                                                      ONE PATH FORWARD | 41

Like Gideon, Betts sought release by habeas corpus, alleging that he had been denied the right to assistance
of counsel in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Betts was denied any relief, and on review this Court
affirmed. It was held that a refusal to appoint counsel for an indigent defendant charged with a felony did not
necessarily violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which for reasons given the Court
deemed to be the only applicable federal constitutional provision ...

The Sixth Amendment provides, "In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to have the
Assistance of Counsel for his defense." We have construed this to mean that in federal courts counsel must
be provided for defendants unable to employ counsel unless the right is competently and intelligently waived.'
Betts argued that this right is extended to indigent defendants in state courts by the Fourteenth Amendment. In
response the Court stated that, while the Sixth Amendment laid down "no rule for the conduct of the States,
the question recurs whether the constraint laid by the Amendment upon the national courts expresses a rule so
fundamental and essential to a fair trial, and so, to due process of law, that it is made obligatory upon the States
by the Fourteenth Amendment ...

On the basis of this historical data the Court concluded that "appointment of counsel is not a fundamental
right, essential to a fair trial." ... It was for this reason the Betts Court refused to accept the contention that
the Sixth Amendment's guarantee of counsel for indigent federal defendants was extended to or, in the words
of that Court, "made obligatory upon the States by the Fourteenth Amendment." Plainly, had the Court con-
cluded that appointment of counsel for an indigent criminal defendant was "a fundamental right, essential to a
fair trial," it would have held that the Fourteenth Amendment requires appointment of counsel in' a state court,
just as the Sixth Amendment requires in a federal court ...

In many cases other than Powell and Betts, this Court has looked to the fundamental nature of original Bill of
Rights guarantees to decide whether the Fourteenth Amendment makes them obligatory on the States. Explic-
itly recognized to be of this "fundamental nature" and therefore made immune from state invasion by the Four-
teenth, or some part of it, are the First Amendment's freedoms of speech, press, religion, assembly, association,
and petition for redress of grievances. For the same reason, though not always in precisely the same terminol-
ogy, the Court had made obligatory on the States the Fifth Amendment's command that private property shall
not be taken for public use without just compensation, the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable
searches and seizures,' and the Eighth's ban on cruel and unusual punishment ...

We accept Betts v. Brady's assumption, based as it was on our prior cases, that a provision of the Bill of Rights
which is "fundamental and essential to a fait trial" is made obligatory upon the States by the Fourteenth Amend-
ment. We think the Court in Betts was wrong, however, in concluding that the Sixth Amendment's guarantee
of counsel is not one of these fundamental rights. Ten years before Betts v. Brady, this Court, after full consider-
ation of all the historical data examined in Betts, had unequivocally declared that "the right to the aid of counsel
is of this fundamental character." Powell v. Alabama (1932). While the Court at the close of its Powell opinion
did by its language, as this Court frequently does, limit its holding to the particular facts and circumstances of
that case, its conclusions about the fundamental nature of the right to counsel are unmistakable ...
42 | ONE PATH FORWARD

In returning, to these old precedents, sounder we believe than the new, we but restore constitutional principles
established to achieve a fair system of justice. Not only these precedents but also reason and reflection require
us to recognize that in our adversary system of criminal justice, any person haled into court, who is too poor to
hire a lawyer, cannot be assured a fair trial unless counsel is provided for him. This seems to us to be an obvious
truth. Governments, both state and federal, quite properly spend vast sums of money to establish machinery to
try defendants accused of crime. Lawyers to prosecute are everywhere deemed essential to protect the public's
interest in an orderly society. Similarly, there are few defendants charged with crime, few indeed, who fail to hire
the best lawyers they can get to prepare and present their defenses. That government hires lawyers to prosecute
and defendants who have the money hire lawyers to defend are the strongest indications of the widespread belief
that lawyers in criminal courts are necessities, not luxuries. The right of one charged with crime to counsel may
not be deemed fundamental and essential to fair trials in some countries, but it is in ours. From the very begin-
ning, our state and national constitutions and laws have laid great emphasis on procedural and substantive safe-
guards designed to assure fair trials before impartial tribunals in which every defendant stands equal before the
law. This noble ideal cannot be realized if the poor man charged with crime has to face his accusers without a
lawyer to assist him ...

The Court in Betts v. Brady departed from the sound wisdom upon which the Court's holding in Powell v.
Alabama rested. Florida, supported by two other States, has asked that Betts v. Brady be left intact. Twenty-two
States, as friends of the Court, argue that Betts was "an anachronism when handed down" and that it should
now be overruled. We agree.

The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the Supreme Court of Florida for further action not
inconsistent with this opinion.

Reversed.

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, concurring in judgement.

While I join the opinion of the Court, a brief historical resume of the relation between the Bill of Rights and the
first section of the Fourteenth Amendment seems pertinent. Since the adoption of that Amendment, ten Jus-
tices have felt that it protects from infringement by the States the privileges, protections, and safeguards granted
by the Bill of Rights. Justice Field, the first Justice Harlan, and probably Justice Brewer, took that position in
O'Neil v. Vermont ... as did Justices BLACK, DOUGLAS, Murphy and Rutledge in Adamson v. California ...
That view was also expressed by Justices Bradley and Swayne in the Slaughter-House Cases ... and seemingly was
accepted by Justice Clifford when he dissented with Justice Field in Walker v. Sauvinet ... Unfortunately it has
never commanded a Court. Yet, happily, all constitutional questions are always open. ... And what we do today
does not foreclose the matter.
§                                                                                                                     ONE PATH FORWARD | 43

My Brother HARLAN is of the view that a guarantee of the Bill of Rights that is made applicable to the States
by reason of the Fourteenth Amendment is a lesser version of that same guarantee as applied to the Federal Gov-
ernment.' Mr. Justice Jackson shared that view. But that view has not prevailed ` and rights protected against
state invasion by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment are not watered-down versions of what
the Bill of Rights guarantees.

Duncan v. Louisiana

391 U.S. 145 (1968)

    Vote: 7-2
    Opinion: White
    Decision: Reversed
    Majority: White, joined by Warren, Black, Douglas, Brennan, Fortas, Marshall
    Concurring: Black, Douglas, Fortas
    Dissent: Harlan and Stewart

MR. JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.

Appellant, Gary Duncan, was convicted of simple battery in the Twenty-fifth Judicial District Court of
Louisiana. Under Louisiana law simple battery is a misdemeanor, punishable by a maximum of two years'
imprisonment and a $300 fine. Appellant sought trial by jury, but because the Louisiana Constitution grants
jury trials only in cases in which capital punishment or imprisonment at hard labor may be imposed, the trial
judge denied the request. Appellant was convicted and sentenced to serve 60 days in the parish prison and pay a
fine of $150. Appellant sought review in the Supreme Court of Louisiana, asserting that the denial of jury trial
violated rights guaranteed to him by the United States Constitution ... appellant sought review in this Court,
alleging that the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution secure the right to jury
trial in state criminal prosecutions where a sentence as long as two years may be imposed ...

Appellant was 19 years of age when tried. While driving on Highway 23 in Plaquemines Parish on October
18, 1966, he saw two younger cousins engaged in a conversation by the side of the road with four white boys.
Knowing his cousins, Negroes who had recently transferred to a formerly all-white high school, had reported the
occurrence of racial incidents at the school, Duncan stopped the car, got out, and approached the six boys. At
trial the white boys and a white onlooker testified, as did appellant and his cousins. The testimony was in dispute
on many points, but the witnesses agreed that appellant and the white boys spoke to each other, that appellant
44 | ONE PATH FORWARD

encouraged his cousins to break off the encounter and enter his car, and that appellant was about to enter the car
himself for the purpose of driving away with his cousins. The whites testified that just before getting in the car
appellant slapped Herman Landry, one of the white boys, on the elbow. The Negroes testified that appellant had
not slapped Landry, but had merely touched him. The trial judge concluded that the State had proved beyond a
reasonable doubt that Duncan had committed simple battery, and found him guilty.

...

The test for determining whether a right extended by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments with respect to federal
criminal proceedings is also protected against state action by the Fourteenth Amendment has been phrased in
a variety of ways in the opinions of this Court. The question has been asked whether a right is among those
"`fundamental principles of' liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions,'"
Powell v Alabama (1932). The claim before us is that the right to trial by jury guaranteed by the Sixth Amend-
ment meets these tests. The position of Louisiana, on the other hand, is that the Constitution imposes upon
the States no duty to give a jury trial in any criminal case, regardless of the seriousness of the crime or the size of
the punishment which may be imposed. Because we believe that trial by jury in criminal cases is fundamental to
the American scheme of justice, we hold that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees a right of jury trial in all
criminal cases which-were they to be tried in a federal court-would come within the Sixth Amendment's guaran-
tee ... Since we consider the appeal before us to be such a case, we hold that the Constitution was violated when
appellant's demand for jury trial was refused ...

The history of trial by jury in criminal cases has been frequently told. It is sufficient for present purposes to say
that by the time our Constitution was written, jury trial in criminal cases had been in existence in England for
several centuries and carried impressive credentials traced by many to Magna Carta. Its preservation and proper
operation as a protection against arbitrary rule were among the major objective of the revolutionary settlement
which was expressed in the Declaration and Bill of Rights of 1689 ...

Even such skeletal history is impressive support for considering the right to jury trial in criminal cases to be fun-
damental to our system of justice, an importance frequently recognized in the opinions of this Court ...

Jury trial continues to receive strong support. The laws of every State guarantee a right to jury trial in serious
criminal cases; no State has dispensed with it; nor are there significant movements underway to do so. Indeed,
the three most recent state constitutional revisions, in Maryland, Michigan, and New York, carefully preserved
the right of the accused to have the judgment of a jury when tried for a serious crime ...

Those who wrote our constitutions knew from history and experience that it was necessary to protect against
unfounded criminal charges brought to eliminate enemies and against judges too responsive to the voice of
higher authority. The framers of the constitutions strove to create an independent judiciary but insisted upon
further protection against arbitrary action. Providing an accused with the right to be tried by a jury of his peers
gave him an inestimable safeguard against the corrupt or overzealous prosecutor and against the compliant,
biased, or eccentric judge. If the defendant preferred the common-sense judgment of a jury to the more tutored
but perhaps less sympathetic reaction of the single judge, he was to have it. Beyond this, the jury trial provisions
in the Federal and State Constitutions reflect a fundamental decision about the exercise of official power-a reluc-
                                                                                                                      ONE PATH FORWARD | 45

tance to entrust plenary powers over the life and liberty of the citizen to one judge or to a group of judges. Fear
of unchecked power, so typical of our State and Federal Governments in other respects, found expression in the
criminal law in this insistence upon community participation in the determination of guilt or innocence. The
deep commitment of the Nation to the right of jury trial in serious criminal cases as a defense against arbitrary
law enforcement qualifies for protection under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and
must therefore be respected by the States ...

We would not assert, however, that every criminal trial-or any particular trial-held before a judge alone is unfair
or that a defendant may never be as fairly treated by a judge as he would be by a jury. Thus, we hold no constitu-
tional doubts about the practices, common in both federal and state courts, of accepting waivers of jury trial and
prosecuting petty crimes without extending a right to jury trial. However, the fact is that in most places more
trials for serious crimes are to juries than to a court alone; a great many defendants prefer the judgment of a jury
to that of a court. Even where defendants are satisfied with bench trials, the right to a jury trial very likely serves
its intended purpose of making judicial or prosecutorial unfairness less likely ...

Louisiana's final contention is that even if it must grant jury trials in serious criminal cases, the conviction before
us is valid and constitutional because here the petitioner was tried for simple battery and was sentenced to only
60 days in the parish prison. We are not persuaded. It is doubtless true that there is a category of petty crimes
or offenses which is not subject to the Sixth Amendment jury trial provision s' and should not be subject to the
Fourteenth Amendment jury trial requirement here applied to the States. Crimes carrying possible penalties up
to six months do not require a jury trial if they otherwise qualify as petty offenses, Cheff v. Schnackenberg (1966).
But the penalty authorized for a particular crime is of major relevance in determining whether it is serious or
not and may in itself, if severe enough, subject the trial to the mandates of the Sixth Amendment. District of
Columbia v. Clawans (1937). In the case before us, the Legislature of Louisiana has made simple battery a crim-
inal offense punishable by imprisonment for up to two years and a fine. The question, then, is whether a crime
carrying such a penalty is an offense which Louisiana may insist on trying without a jury.

We think not ... Of course, the boundaries of the petty offense category have always been ill-defined, if not ambu-
latory. In the absence of an explicit constitutional provision, the definitional task necessarily falls on the courts,
which must either pass upon the validity of legislative attempts to identify those petty offenses which are exempt
from jury trial or, where the legislature has not addressed itself to the problem, themselves face the question in
the first instance. In either case it is necessary to draw a line in the spectrum of crime, separating petty from seri-
ous infractions. This process, although essential, cannot be wholly satisfactory, for it requires attaching different
-consequences to events which, when they lie near the line, actually differ very little.

In determining whether the length of the authorized prison term or the seriousness of other punishment is
enough in itself to require a jury trial, we are counseled b ... chiefly the existing laws and practices in the Nation.
In the federal system, petty offenses are defined as those punishable by no more than six months in prison and a
$500 fine. In 49 of the 50 States crimes subject to trial without a jury, which occasionally include simple battery,
are punishable by no more than one year in jail." ... We need not, however, settle in this case the exact location of
§46 | ONE PATH FORWARD

the line between petty offenses and serious crimes. It is sufficient for our purposes to hold that a crime punish-
able by two years in prison is, based on past and contemporary standards in this country, a serious crime and not
a petty offense." Consequently, appellant was entitled to a jury trial and it was error to deny it.

The judgment below is reversed and the case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

...

Otis McDonald, Adam Orlov, Colleen Lawson, and David Lawson (Chicago petitioners) are Chicago residents
who would like to keep handguns in their homes for self-defense but are prohibited from doing so by Chicago's
firearms laws. A City ordinance provides that "[n]o person shall ... possess ... any firearm unless such person
is the holder of a valid registration certificate for such firearm." Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code § 8-20-040(a)
(2009). The Code then prohibits registration of most handguns, thus effectively banning handgun possession
by almost all private citizens who reside in the City. § 8-20-050(c). Like Chicago, Oak Park makes it "unlawful
for any person to possess ... any firearm," a term that includes "pistols, revolvers, guns and small arms ... com-
monly known as handguns." ...

Chicago enacted its handgun ban to protect its residents "from the loss of property and injury or death from
firearms." See Chicago, Ill., Journal of Proceedings of the City Council, p. 10049 (Mar. 19, 1982). The Chicago
petitioners and their amici, however, argue that the handgun ban has left them vulnerable to criminals. Chicago
                                                                                                                      ONE PATH FORWARD | 47

Police Department statistics, we are told, reveal that the City's handgun murder rate has actually increased since
the ban was enacted and that Chicago residents now face one of the highest murder rates in the country and
rates of other violent crimes that exceed the average in comparable cities.

Several of the Chicago petitioners have been the targets of threats and violence. For instance, Otis McDonald,
who is in his late seventies, lives in a high-crime neighborhood. He is a community activist involved with alterna-
tive policing strategies, and his efforts to improve his neighborhood have subjected him to violent threats from
drug dealers ... Colleen Lawson is a Chicago resident whose home has been targeted by burglars ... Lawson, and
the other Chicago petitioners own handguns that they store outside of the city limits, but they would like to
keep their handguns in their homes for protection ...

After our decision in Heller, the Chicago petitioners and two groups filed suit against the City in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. They sought a declaration that the handgun ban and
several related Chicago ordinances violate the Second and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Consti-
tution. Another action challenging the Oak Park law was filed in the same District Court by the National Rifle
Association (NRA) and two Oak Park residents. In addition, the NRA and others filed a third action challeng-
ing the Chicago ordinances. All three cases were assigned to the same District Judge ...

Petitioners argue that the Chicago and Oak Park laws violate the right to keep and bear arms for two reasons.
Petitioners' primary submission is that this right is among the "privileges or immunities of citizens of the United
States" and that the narrow interpretation of the Privileges or Immunities Clause adopted in the Slaughter-
House Cases, supra, should now be rejected. As a secondary argument, petitioners contend that the Fourteenth
Amendment's Due Process Clause "incorporates" the Second Amendment right ...

As previously noted, the Seventh Circuit concluded that Cruikshank, Presser, and Miller doomed petitioners'
claims at the Court of Appeals level. Petitioners argue, however, that we should overrule those decisions and
hold that the right to keep and bear arms is one of the "privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States."
In petitioners' view, the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects all of the rights set out in the Bill of Rights, as
well as some others ... but petitioners are unable to identify the Clause's full scope ... Nor is there any consensus
on that question among the scholars who agree that the Slaughter-House Cases' interpretation is flawed ...

We see no need to reconsider that interpretation here. For many decades, the question of the rights protected by
the Fourteenth Amendment against state infringement has been analyzed under the Due Process Clause of that
Amendment and not under the Privileges or Immunities Clause. We therefore decline to disturb the Slaughter-
House holding ...

In Cruikshank, the Court held that the general "right of the people peaceably to assemble for lawful purposes,"
which is protected by the First Amendment, applied only against the Federal Government and not against the
States ... Nonetheless, over 60 years later the Court held that the right of peaceful assembly was a "fundamental
righ[t] ... safeguarded by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.". DeJonge v. Oregon (1937). We
follow the same path here and thus consider whether the right to keep and bear arms applies to the States under
the Due Process Clause ...
48 | ONE PATH FORWARD

With this framework in mind, we now turn directly to the question whether the Second Amendment right to
keep and bear arms is incorporated in the concept of due process. In answering that question, as just explained,
we must decide whether the right to keep and bear arms is fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty ...
or as we have said in a related context, whether this right is "deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradi-
tion," Washington v. Glucksberg (1997).

Our decision in Heller points unmistakably to the answer. Thus, we concluded, citizens must be permitted "to
use [handguns] for the core lawful purpose of self-defense."

Heller makes it clear that this right is "deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition." ... Heller explored
the right's origins, noting that the 1689 English Bill of Rights explicitly protected a right to keep arms for self-
defense ... Blackstone was able to assert that the right to keep and bear arms was "one of the fundamental rights
of Englishmen," ...

By the 1850's, the perceived threat that had prompted the inclusion of the Second Amendment in the Bill of
Rights--the fear that the National Government would disarm the universal militia--had largely faded as a pop-
ular concern, but the right to keep and bear arms was highly valued for purposes of self-defense ...

After the Civil War, many of the over 180,000 African Americans who served in the Union Army returned to
the States of the old Confederacy, where systematic efforts were made to disarm them and other blacks ...

Throughout the South, armed parties, often consisting of ex-Confederate soldiers serving in the state militias,
forcibly took firearms from newly freed slaves. In the first session of the 39th Congress, Senator Wilson told his
colleagues: "In Mississippi rebel State forces, men who were in the rebel armies, are traversing the State, visiting
the freedmen, disarming them, perpetrating murders and outrages upon them; and the same things are done in
other sections of the country." 39th Cong. Globe 40 (1865) ...

Union Army commanders took steps to secure the right of all citizens to keep and bear arms, but the 39th
Congress concluded that legislative action was necessary. Its efforts to safeguard the right to keep and bear arms
demonstrate that the right was still recognized to be fundamental.

The most explicit evidence of Congress' aim appears in §14 of the Freedmen's Bureau Act of 1866, which pro-
vided that "the right ... to have full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings concerning personal liberty,
personal security, and the acquisition, enjoyment, and disposition of estate, real and personal, including the con­
stitutional right to bear arms, shall be secured to and enjoyed by all the citizens ... without respect to race or color,
or previous condition of slavery." 14 Stat. 176-177 (emphasis added).

...

In debating the Fourteenth Amendment, the 39th Congress referred to the right to keep and bear arms as a fun-
damental right deserving of protection.

...
                                                                                                                     ONE PATH FORWARD | 49

In sum, it is clear that the Framers and ratifiers of the Fourteenth Amendment counted the right to keep and
bear arms among those fundamental rights necessary to our system of ordered liberty.

...

Municipal respondents' remaining arguments are at war with our central holding in Heller: that the Second
Amendment protects a personal right to keep and bear arms for lawful purposes, most notably for self-defense
within the home. Municipal respondents, in effect, ask us to treat the right recognized in Heller as a second-class
right, subject to an entirely different body of rules than the other Bill of Rights guarantees that we have held to
be incorporated into the Due Process Clause.

Municipal respondents' main argument is nothing less than a plea to disregard 50 years of incorporation prece-
dent and return (presumably for this case only) to a bygone era. Municipal respondents submit that the Due
Process Clause protects only those rights " `recognized by all temperate and civilized governments, from a deep
and universal sense of [their] justice.' " ...

This line of argument is, of course, inconsistent with the long-established standard we apply in incorporation
cases ... And the present day implications of municipal respondents' argument are stunning. For example, many
of the rights that our Bill of Rights provides for persons accused of criminal offenses are virtually unique to this
country. If our understanding of the right to a jury trial, the right against self-incrimination, and the right to
counsel were necessary attributes of any civilized country, it would follow that the United States is the only civi-
lized Nation in the world ...

... In Heller, we held that the Second Amendment protects the right to possess a handgun in the home for the
purpose of self-defense. Unless considerations of stare decisis counsel otherwise, a provision of the Bill of Rights
that protects a right that is fundamental from an American perspective applies equally to the Federal Govern-
ment and the States ... We therefore hold that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment incorpo-
rates the Second Amendment right recognized in Heller.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.

Timbs v. IN

586 U.S. ___ (2019)

    Opinion: Ginsburg, joined by Roberts, Thomas, Breyer, Alito, Sotomayor, Kagan, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh
    Decision: unanimous, reversed
    Concurring: Gorsuch
    Concurring: Thomas

JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.

Tyson Timbs pleaded guilty in Indiana state court to dealing in a controlled substance and conspiracy to commit
theft. The trial court sentenced him to one year of home detention and five years of probation, which included a
court-supervised addiction-treatment program. The sentence also required Timbs to pay fees and costs totaling
$1,203. At the time of Timbs's arrest, the police seized his vehicle, a Land Rover SUV Timbs had purchased
for about $42,000. Timbs paid for the vehicle with money he received from an insurance policy when his father
died. The State engaged a private law firm to bring a civil suit for forfeiture of Timbs's Land Rover, charging that
the vehicle had been used to transport heroin. After Timbs's guilty plea in the criminal case, the trial court held
a hearing on the forfeiture demand. Although finding that Timbs's vehicle had been used to facilitate violation
of a criminal statute, the court denied the requested forfeiture, observing that Timbs had recently purchased the
vehicle for $42,000, more than four times the maximum $10,000 monetary fine assessable against him for his
drug conviction. Forfeiture of the Land Rover, the court determined, would be grossly disproportionate to the
gravity of Timbs's offense, hence unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause.

The Court of Appeals of Indiana affirmed that determination, but the Indiana Supreme Court reversed. 84
N. E. 3d 1179 (2017). The Indiana Supreme Court did not decide whether the forfeiture would be excessive.
Instead, it held that the Excessive Fines Clause constrains only federal action and is inapplicable to state imposi-
tions ...

The question presented: Is the Eighth Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause an "incorporated" protection
applicable to the States under the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause? Like the Eighth Amendment's
proscriptions of "cruel and unusual punishment" and "[e]xcessive bail," the protection against excessive fines
guards against abuses of government's punitive or criminal law-enforcement authority. This safeguard, we hold,
is "fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty," with "dee[p] root[s] in [our] history and tradition." ... The
Excessive Fines Clause is therefore incorporated by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

The Excessive Fines Clause traces its venerable lineage back to at least 1215, when Magna Carta guaranteed that
"[a] Free-man shall not be amerced for a small fault, but after the manner of the fault; and for a great fault after
the greatness thereof, saving to him his contentment. ..." ...
                                                                                                                      ONE PATH FORWARD | 51

Today, acknowledgment of the right's fundamental nature remains widespread. As Indiana itself reports, all 50
States have a constitutional provision prohibiting the imposition of excessive fines either directly or by requiring
proportionality ... Indeed, Indiana explains that its own Supreme Court has held that the Indiana Constitution
should be interpreted to impose the same restrictions as the Eighth Amendment ...

For good reason, the protection against excessive fines has been a constant shield throughout Anglo-American
history: Exorbitant tolls undermine other constitutional liberties. Excessive fines can be used, for example, to
retaliate against or chill the speech of political enemies ... Even absent a political motive, fines may be employed
"in a measure out of accord with the penal goals of retribution and deterrence," for "fines are a source of rev-
enue," while other forms of punishment "cost a State money." ...

In short, the historical and logical case for concluding that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the Exces-
sive Fines Clause is overwhelming. Protection against excessive punitive economic sanctions secured by the
Clause is, to repeat, both "fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty" and "deeply rooted in this Nation's
history and tradition." ...

The State of Indiana does not meaningfully challenge the case for incorporating the Excessive Fines Clause as
a general matter. Instead, the State argues that the Clause does not apply to its use of civil in rem forfeitures
because, the State says, the Clause's specific application to such forfeitures is neither fundamental nor deeply
rooted ...

...

As a fallback, Indiana argues that the Excessive Fines Clause cannot be incorporated if it applies to civil in rem
forfeitures. We disagree. In considering whether the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates a protection con-
tained in the Bill of Rights, we ask whether the right guaranteed--not each and every particular application of
that right--is fundamental or deeply rooted.

Indiana's suggestion to the contrary is inconsistent with the approach we have taken in cases concerning novel
applications of rights already deemed incorporated ... regardless of whether application of the Excessive Fines
Clause to civil in rem forfeitures is itself fundamental or deeply rooted, our conclusion that the Clause is incor-
porated remains unchanged.

For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Indiana Supreme Court is vacated, and the case is remanded for fur-
ther proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Ramos v. Louisiana

590 U.S. ___ (2020)

    Vote: 6-3
    Opinion: Gorsuch
    Decision: Reversed
    Majority: Gorsuch joined by Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, Kavanaugh, Thomas
    [Note the majority on this opinion was split differently for different sections of the opinion]

    Concurring: Kavanaugh
    Concurring: Thomas
    Dissent: Alito, joined by Roberts, Kagan (to all but Part III-D)

JUSTICE GORSUCH delivered the opinion of the Court.

Accused of a serious crime, Evangelisto Ramos insisted on his innocence and invoked his right to a jury trial.
Eventually, 10 jurors found the evidence against him persuasive. But a pair of jurors believed that the State of
Louisiana had failed to prove Mr. Ramos's guilt beyond reasonable doubt; they voted to acquit.

In 48 States and federal court, a single juror's vote to acquit is enough to prevent a conviction. But not in
Louisiana. Along with Oregon, Louisiana has long punished people based on 10-to-2 verdicts like the one here.
So instead of the mistrial he would have received almost anywhere else, Mr. Ramos was sentenced to life in prison
without the possibility of parole.

Why do Louisiana and Oregon allow nonunanimous convictions? Though it's hard to say why these laws per-
sist, their origins are clear. Louisiana first endorsed nonunanimous verdicts for serious crimes at a constitutional
convention in 1898. According to one committee chairman, the avowed purpose of that convention was to
"establish the supremacy of the white race," and the resulting document included many of the trappings of the
Jim Crow era ...

Nor was it only the prospect of African-Americans voting that concerned the delegates. Just a week before the
convention, the U. S. Senate passed a resolution calling for an investigation into whether Louisiana was system-
ically excluding African-Americans from juries. Seeking to avoid unwanted national attention, and aware that
this Court would strike down any policy of overt discrimination against African-American jurors as a violation
of the Fourteenth Amendment, the delegates sought to undermine African-American participation on juries in
another way. With a careful eye on racial demographics, the convention delegates sculpted a "facially race-neu-
tral" rule permitting 10-to-2 verdicts in order "to ensure that African-American juror service would be meaning-
less."
                                                                                                                      ONE PATH FORWARD | 53

Adopted in the 1930s, Oregon's rule permitting nonunanimous verdicts can be similarly traced to the rise of the
Ku Klux Klan and efforts to dilute "the influence of racial, ethnic, and religious minorities on Oregon juries." In
fact, no one before us contests any of this; courts in both Louisiana and Oregon have frankly acknowledged that
race was a motivating factor in the adoption of their States' respective nonunanimity rules.

We took this case to decide whether the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial--as incorporated against the
States by way of the Fourteenth Amendment--requires a unanimous verdict to convict a defendant of a serious
offense. Louisiana insists that this Court has never definitively passed on the question and urges us to find its
practice consistent with the Sixth Amendment. By contrast, the dissent doesn't try to defend Louisiana's law on
Sixth or Fourteenth Amendment grounds; tacitly, it seems to admit that the Constitution forbids States from
using nonunanimous juries. Yet, unprompted by Louisiana, the dissent suggests our precedent requires us to
rule for the State anyway. What explains all this? To answer the puzzle, it's necessary to say a bit more about the
merits of the question presented, the relevant precedent, and, at last, the consequences that follow from saying
what we know to be true.

The Sixth Amendment promises that "[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy
and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed,
which district shall have been previously ascertained by law." The Amendment goes on to preserve other rights
for criminal defendants but says nothing else about what a "trial by an impartial jury" entails.

Still, the promise of a jury trial surely meant something-- otherwise, there would have been no reason to write
it down. Nor would it have made any sense to spell out the places from which jurors should be drawn if their
powers as jurors could be freely abridged by statute. Imagine a constitution that allowed a "jury trial" to mean
nothing but a single person rubberstamping convictions without hearing any evidence--but simultaneously
insisting that the lone juror come from a specific judicial district "previously ascertained by law." And if that's
not enough, imagine a constitution that included the same hollow guarantee twice--not only in the Sixth
Amendment, but also in Article III. No: The text and structure of the Constitution clearly suggest that the term
"trial by an impartial jury" carried with it some meaning about the content and requirements of a jury trial.

One of these requirements was unanimity. Wherever we might look to determine what the term "trial by an
impartial jury trial" meant at the time of the Sixth Amendment's adoption--whether it's the common law, state
practices in the founding era, or opinions and treatises written soon afterward--the answer is unmistakable. A
jury must reach a unanimous verdict in order to convict.

The requirement of juror unanimity emerged in 14th century England and was soon accepted as a vital right
protected by the common law ...

Influential, postadoption treatises confirm this understanding ... Justice Story explained in his Commentaries
on the Constitution that "in common cases, the law not only presumes every man innocent, until he is proved
guilty; but unanimity in the verdict of the jury is indispensable." Similar statements can be found in American
legal treatises throughout the 19th century.
54 | ONE PATH FORWARD

Nor is this a case where the original public meaning was lost to time and only recently recovered. This Court
has, repeatedly and over many years, recognized that the Sixth Amendment requires unanimity. As early as 1898,
the Court said that a defendant enjoys a "constitutional right to demand that his liberty should not be taken
from him except by the joint action of the court and the unanimous verdict of a jury of twelve persons." A few
decades later, the Court elaborated that the Sixth Amendment affords a right to "a trial by jury as understood
and applied at common law, ... includ[ing] all the essential elements as they were recognized in this country and
England when the Constitution was adopted." And, the Court observed, this includes a requirement "that the
verdict should be unanimous." In all, this Court has commented on the Sixth Amendment's unanimity require-
ment no fewer than 13 times over more than 120 years.

There can be no question either that the Sixth Amendment's unanimity requirement applies to state and federal
criminal trials equally. This Court has long explained that the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial is "funda-
mental to the American scheme of justice" and incorporated against the States under the Fourteenth Amend-
ment. This Court has long explained, too, that incorporated provisions of the Bill of Rights bear the same
content when asserted against States as they do when asserted against the federal government. So if the Sixth
Amendment's right to a jury trial requires a unanimous verdict to support a conviction in federal court, it
requires no less in state court.

If Louisiana's path to an affirmance is a difficult one, the dissent's is trickier still. The dissent doesn't dispute
that the Sixth Amendment protects the right to a unanimous jury verdict, or that the Fourteenth Amendment
extends this right to state-court trials. But, it insists, we must affirm Mr. Ramos's conviction anyway. Why?
Because the doctrine of stare decisis supposedly commands it. There are two independent reasons why that
answer falls short.

In the first place and as we've seen, not even Louisiana tries to suggest that Apodaca supplies a governing prece-
dent. Remember, Justice Powell agreed that the Sixth Amendment requires a unanimous verdict to convict, so
he would have no objection to that aspect of our holding today. Justice Powell reached a different result only by
relying on a dual-track theory of incorporation that a majority of the Court had already rejected (and continues
to reject). And to accept that reasoning as precedential, we would have to embrace a new and dubious propo-
sition: that a single Justice writing only for himself has the authority to bind this Court to propositions it has
already rejected.

This is not the rule, and for good reason--it would do more to destabilize than honor precedent. To see how,
consider a hypothetical. Suppose we face a question of first impression under the Fourth Amendment: whether
a State must obtain a warrant before reading a citizen's email in the hands of an Internet provider and using
that email as evidence in a criminal trial. Imagine this question splits the Court, with four Justices finding the
Fourth Amendment requires a warrant and four Justices finding no such requirement. The ninth Justice agrees
that the Fourth Amendment requires a warrant, but takes an idiosyncratic view of the consequences of violating
that right. In her view, the exclusionary rule has gone too far, and should only apply when the defendant is pros-
ecuted for a felony. Because the case before her happens to involve only a misdemeanor, she provides the ninth
vote to affirm a conviction based on evidence secured by a warrantless search. Of course, this Court has long-
standing precedent requiring the suppression of all evidence obtained in unconstitutional searches and seizures.
                                                                                                                      ONE PATH FORWARD | 55

But like Justice Powell, our hypothetical ninth Justice sticks to her view and expressly rejects this Court's prece-
dent. Like Justice Powell, this Justice's vote would be essential to the judgment. So if, as the dissent suggests, that
is enough to displace precedent, would Mapp's exclusionary rule now be limited to felony prosecutions? ...

In the final accounting, the dissent's stare decisis arguments round to zero. We have an admittedly mistaken deci-
sion, on a constitutional issue, an outlier on the day it was decided, one that's become lonelier with time. In
arguing otherwise, the dissent must elide the reliance the American people place in their constitutionally pro-
tected liberties, overplay the competing interests of two States, count some of those interests twice, and make no
small amount of new precedent all its own.

On what ground would anyone have us leave Mr. Ramos in prison for the rest of his life? Not a single Member
of this Court is prepared to say Louisiana secured his conviction constitutionally under the Sixth Amendment.
No one before us suggests that the error was harmless. Louisiana does not claim precedent commands an affir-
mance. In the end, the best anyone can seem to muster against Mr. Ramos is that, if we dared to admit in his
case what we all know to be true about the Sixth Amendment, we might have to say the same in some others.
But where is the justice in that? Every judge must learn to live with the fact he or she will make some mistakes; it
comes with the territory. But it is something else entirely to perpetuate something we all know to be wrong only
because we fear the consequences of being right.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Reversed.

Privileges and Immunities Redux

Saenz v. Roe

526 U.S. 489 (1999)

    Vote: 7-2
    Opinion: Stevens
    Decision: Affirmed
    Majority: Stevens, joined by O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, Ginsburg, Breyer
    Dissent: Rehnquist, joined by Thomas

JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.

In 1992, California enacted a statute limiting the maximum welfare benefits available to newly arrived residents.
The scheme limits the amount payable to a family that has resided in the State for less than 12 months to the
amount payable by the State of the family's prior residence. The questions presented by this case are whether the
1992 statute was constitutional when it was enacted and, if not, whether an amendment to the Social Security
Act enacted by Congress in 1996 affects that determination.

...

On December 21, 1992, three California residents who were eligible for AFDC benefits filed an action in the
Eastern District of California challenging the constitutionality of the durational residency requirement in §
11450.03. Each plaintiff alleged that she had recently moved to California to live with relatives in order to escape
abusive family circumstances. One returned to California after living in Louisiana for seven years, the second
had been living in Oklahoma for six weeks and the third came from Colorado. Each alleged that her monthly
AFDC grant for the ensuing 12 months would be substantially lower under § 11450.03 than if the statute were
not in effect. Thus, the former residents of Louisiana and Oklahoma would receive $190 and $341 respectively
for a family of three even though the full California grant was $641; the former resident of Colorado, who had
just one child, was limited to $280 a month as opposed to the full California grant of $504 for a family of two.

The District Court issued a temporary restraining order and, after a hearing, preliminarily enjoined implemen-
tation of the statute. District Judge Levi found that the statute "produces substantial disparities in benefit levels
and makes no accommodation for the different costs of living that exist in different states."` ... In his view, if the
purpose of the measure was to deter migration by poor people into the State, it would be unconstitutional for
that reason. And even if the purpose was only to conserve limited funds, the State had failed to explain why the
entire burden of the saving should be imposed on new residents ...
                                                                                               PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES REDUX | 57

The word "travel" is not found in the text of the Constitution. Yet the "constitutional right to travel from one
State to another" is firmly embedded in our jurisprudence. Indeed, as Justice Stewart reminded us in Shapiro v.
Thompson, (1969), the right is so important that it is "assertable against private interference as well as govern-
mental action ... a virtually unconditional personal right, guaranteed by the Constitution to us all." ...

In Shapiro, we reviewed the constitutionality of three statutory provisions that denied welfare assistance to res-
idents of Connecticut, the District of Columbia, and Pennsylvania, who had resided within those respective
jurisdictions less than one year immediately preceding their applications for assistance. Without pausing to iden-
tify the specific source of the right, we began by noting that the Court had long "recognized that the nature of
our Federal Union and our constitutional concepts of personal liberty unite to require that all citizens be free to
travel throughout the length and breadth of our land uninhibited by statutes, rules, or regulations which unrea-
sonably burden or restrict this movement." ... We squarely held that it was "constitutionally impermissible" for
a State to enact durational residency requirements for the purpose of inhibiting the migration by needy persons
into the State. We further held that a classification that had the effect of imposing a penalty on the exercise of
the right to travel violated the Equal Protection Clause "unless shown to be necessary to promote a compelling
governmental interest," ... and that no such showing had been made.

... California submits that, instead of being subjected to the strictest scrutiny, the statute should be upheld if it is
supported by a rational basis and that the State's legitimate interest in saving over $10 million a year satisfies that
test. Although the United States did not elect to participate in the proceedings in the District Court or the Court
of Appeals, it has participated as amicus curiae in this Court. It has advanced the novel argument that the enact-
ment of PRWORA allows the States to adopt a "specialized choice-of-law-type provision" that "should be sub-
ject to an intermediate level of constitutional review," merely requiring that durational residency requirements
be "substantially related to an important governmental objective."` The debate about the appropriate standard
of review, together with the potential relevance of the federal statute, persuades us that it will be useful to focus
on the source of the constitutional right on which respondents rely.

The "right to travel" discussed in our cases embraces at least three different components. It protects the right of
a citizen of one State to enter and to leave another State, the right to be treated as a welcome visitor rather than
an unfriendly alien when temporarily present in the second State, and, for those travelers who elect to become
permanent residents, the right to be treated like other citizens of that State ...

...

The second component of the right to travel is, however, expressly protected by the text of the Constitution.
The first sentence of Article IV, § 2, provides:

      "The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States."

Thus, by virtue of a person's state citizenship, a citizen of one State who travels in other States, intending to
return home at the end of his journey, is entitled to enjoy the "Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the sev-
eral States" that he visits. This provision removes "from the citizens of each State the disabilities of alienage in the
other States." Paul v. Virginia (1869). Permissible justifications for discrimination between residents and non-
58 | PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES REDUX

residents are simply inapplicable to a nonresident's exercise of the right to move into another State and become a
resident of that State. It provides important protections for nonresidents who enter a State ... Those protections
are not "absolute," but the Clause "does bar discrimination against citizens of other States where there is no sub-
stantial reason for the discrimination beyond the mere fact that they are citizens of other States." ... Permissible
justifications for discrimination between residents and nonresidents are simply inapplicable to a nonresident's
exercise of the right to move into another State and become a resident of that State.

What is at issue in this case, then, is this third aspect of the right to travel-the right of the newly arrived citizen to
the same privileges and immunities enjoyed by other citizens of the same State. That right is protected not only
by the new arrival's status as a state citizen, but also by her status as a citizen of the United States. That additional
source of protection is plainly identified in the opening words of the Fourteenth Amendment ...

Despite fundamentally differing views concerning the coverage of the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment, most notably expressed in the majority and dissenting opinions in the Slaughter-House
Cases, (1873), it has always been common ground that this Clause protects the third component of the right to
travel. Writing for the majority in the Slaughter-House Cases, Justice Miller explained that one of the privileges
conferred by this Clause "is that a citizen of the United States can, of his own volition, become a citizen of any
State of the Union by a bond fide residence therein, with the same rights as other citizens of that State." ...

That newly arrived citizens "have two political capacities, one state and one federal," adds special force to their
claim that they have the same rights as others who share their citizenship. Neither mere rationality nor some
intermediate standard of review should be used to judge the constitutionality of a state rule that discriminates
against some of its citizens because they have been domiciled in the State for less than a year. The appropriate
standard may be more categorical than that articulated in Shapiro ... but it is surely no less strict.

Because this case involves discrimination against citizens who have completed their interstate travel, the State's
argument that its welfare scheme affects the right to travel only "incidentally" is beside the point. Were we con-
cerned solely with actual deterrence to migration, we might be persuaded that a partial withholding of benefits
constitutes a lesser incursion on the right to travel than an outright denial of all benefits. Dunn v. Blumstein
(1972).

It is undisputed that respondents and the members of the class that they represent are citizens of California and
that their need for welfare benefits is unrelated to the length of time that they have resided in California. We thus
have no occasion to consider what weight might be given to a citizen's length of residence if the bona fides of her
claim to state citizenship were questioned. Moreover, because whatever benefits they receive will be consumed
while they remain in California, there is no danger that recognition of their claim will encourage citizens of other
States to establish residency for just long enough to acquire some readily portable benefit, such as a divorce or a
college education, that will be enjoyed after they return to their original domicile ...

... First, although it is reasonable to assume that some persons may be motivated to move for the purpose of
obtaining higher benefits, the empirical evidence reviewed by the District Judge, which takes into account the
high cost of living in California, indicates that the number of such persons is quite small-surely not large enough
                                                                                               PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES REDUX | 59

to justify a burden on those who had no such motive. Second, California has represented to the Court that the
legislation was not enacted for any such reason. Third, even if it were, as we squarely held in Shapiro v. Thomp­
son, (1969), such a purpose would be unequivocally impermissible ...

The question that remains is whether congressional approval of durational residency requirements in the 1996
amendment to the Social Security Act somehow resuscitates the constitutionality of § 11450.03. That question
is readily answered, for we have consistently held that Congress may not authorize the States to violate the Four-
teenth Amendment. Moreover, the protection afforded to the citizen by the Citizenship Clause of that Amend-
ment is a limitation on the powers of the National Government as well as the States.

Article I of the Constitution grants Congress broad power to legislate in certain areas. Those legislative powers
are, however, limited not only by the scope of the Framers' affirmative delegation, but also by the principle "that
they may not be exercised in a way that violates other specific provisions of the Constitution. For example, Con-
gress is granted broad power to `lay and collect Taxes,' but the taxing power, broad as it is, may not be invoked
in such a way as to violate the privilege against self-incrimination." Williams v. Rhodes, (1968). Congress has
no affirmative power to authorize the States to violate the Fourteenth Amendment and is implicitly prohibited
from passing legislation that purports to validate any such violation ...

Citizens of the United States, whether rich or poor, have the right to choose to be citizens "of the State wherein
they reside." ... The States, however, do not have any right to select their citizens. The Fourteenth Amendment,
like the Constitution itself, was, as Justice Cardozo put it, "framed upon the theory that the peoples of the sev-
eral states must sink or swim together, and that in the long run prosperity and salvation are in union and not
division." Baldwin v. G. A. F. Seelig, Inc., (1935).

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, dissenting.

...

In my view, the majority attributes a meaning to the Privileges or Immunities Clause that likely was unintended
when the Fourteenth Amendment was enacted and ratified.

...

Unlike the majority, I would look to history to ascertain the original meaning of the Clause. At least in American
law, the phrase (or its close approximation) appears to stem from the 1606 Charter of Virginia, which provided
that "all and every the Persons being our Subjects, which shall dwell and inhabit within every or any of the
said several Colonies ... shall HAVE and enjoy all Liberties, Franchises, and Immunities ... as if they had been
abiding and born, within this our Realme of England." ... Other colonial charters contained similar guarantees.
Years later, as tensions between England and the American Colonies increased, the colonists adopted resolutions
reasserting their entitlement to the privileges or immunities of English citizenship ...
60 | PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES REDUX

The colonists' repeated assertions that they maintained the rights, privileges, and immunities of persons "born
within the realm of England" and "natural born" persons suggests that, at the time of the founding, the terms
"privileges" and "immunities" (and their counterparts) were understood to refer to those fundamental rights
and liberties specifically enjoyed by English citizens and, more broadly, by all persons. Presumably members of
the Second Continental Congress so understood these terms when they employed them in the Articles of Con-
federation, which guaranteed that "the free inhabitants of each of these States, paupers, vagabonds and fugitives
from justice excepted, shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of free citizens in the several States." ...

Accordingly, the majority's conclusion-that a State violates the Privileges or Immunities Clause when it "dis-
criminates" against citizens who have been domiciled in the State for less than a year in the distribution of welfare
benefits-appears contrary to the original understanding and is dubious at best.

As THE CHIEF JUSTICE points out ... it comes as quite a surprise that the majority relies on the Privileges or
Immunities Clause at all in this case ... Although the majority appears to breathe new life into the Clause today,
it fails to address its historical underpinnings or its place in our constitutional jurisprudence. Because I believe
that the demise of the Privileges or Immunities Clause has contributed in no small part to the current disarray of
our Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence, I would be open to reevaluating its meaning in an appropriate case.
Before invoking the Clause, however, we should endeavor to understand what the Framers of the Fourteenth
Amendment thought that it meant. We should also consider whether the Clause should displace, rather than
augment, portions of our equal protection and substantive due process jurisprudence. The majority's failure to
consider these important questions raises the specter that the Privileges or Immunities Clause will become yet
another convenient tool for inventing new rights, limited solely by the "predilections of those who happen at the
time to be Members of this Court." ...

I respectfully dissent.

CHIEF JUSTICE HUGHES DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.

...

[In this case] the county attorney of Hennepin county brought this action to enjoin the publication of what was
described as a `malicious, scandalous and defamatory newspaper, magazine or other periodical,' known as "The
Saturday Press" published by the defendants in the city of Minneapolis. * * * Without attempting to summarize
the contents of the voluminous exhibits attached to the complaint, we deem it sufficient to say that the articles
charged, in substance, that a Jewish gangster was in control of gambling, bootlegging, and racketeering in Min-
neapolis, and that law enforcing officers and agencies were not energetically performing their duties. Most of the
charges were directed against the chief of police; he was charged with gross neglect of duty, illicit relations with
gangsters, and with participation in graft. The county attorney was charged with knowing the existing condi-
tions and with failure to take adequate measures to remedy them. The mayor was accused of inefficiency and
dereliction. One member of the grand jury was stated to be in sympathy with the gangsters ... There is no ques-
tion but that the articles made serious accusations against the public officers named and others in connection
with the prevalence of crimes and the failure to expose and punish them ...

[A state district court found against the defendant, Jay Near, the publisher of "The Saturday Press"] and found
that the defendants through these publications "did engage in the business of regularly and customarily produc-
ing, publishing and circulating a malicious, scandalous and defamatory newspaper," and that "the said publica-
tion" "under said name of The Saturday Press, or any other name, constitutes a public nuisance under the laws
of the State." Judgment was thereupon entered adjudging that "the newspaper, magazine and periodical known
as The Saturday Press," as a public nuisance, "be and is hereby abated." The judgment perpetually enjoined the
defendants "from producing, editing, publishing, circulating, having in their possession, selling or giving away
any publication whatsoever which is a malicious, scandalous or defamatory newspaper, as defined by law," and
also "from further conducting said nuisance under the name and title of said The Saturday Press or any other
name or title." * * * [Near appealed to the Minnesota Supreme Court which affirmed. 179 Minn. 40, 228 N.W.
326.].
                                                                                                               BASICS OF THE FREEDOM | 65

This statute, for the suppression as a public nuisance of a newspaper or periodical, is unusual, if not unique,
and raises questions of grave importance transcending the local interests involved in the particular action. It is
no longer open to doubt that the liberty of the press and of speech is within the liberty safeguarded by the due
process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from invasion by state action. * * * Liberty, in each of its phases,
has its history and connotation, and, in the present instance, the inquiry is as to the historic conception of the
liberty of the press and whether the statute under review violates the essential attributes of that liberty.

* * * It is thus important to note precisely the purpose and effect of the statute as the state court has construed it.

First. The statute is not aimed at the redress of individual or private wrongs. Remedies for libel remain available
and unaffected. * * *

Second. The statute is directed not simply at the circulation of scandalous and defamatory statements with regard
to private citizens, but at the continued publication by newspapers and periodical of charges against public offi-
cers of corruption, malfeasance in office, or serious neglect of duty. * * *

Third. The object of the statute is not punishment, in the ordinary sense, but suppression of the offending news-
paper or periodical. * * *

Fourth. The statute not only operates to suppress the offending newspaper or periodical, but to put the pub-
lisher under an effective censorship. When a newspaper or periodical is found to be "malicious, scandalous and
defamatory," and is suppressed as such, resumption of publication is punishable as a contempt of court by fine
or imprisonment. * * *

If we cut through mere details of procedure, the operation and effect of the statute in substance is that public
authorities may bring the owner or publisher of a newspaper or periodical before a judge upon a charge of con-
ducting a business of publishing scandalous and defamatory matter- - - in particular that the matter consists of
charges against public officers of official dereliction- - - and, unless the owner or publisher is able and disposed
to bring competent evidence to satisfy the judge that the charges are true and are published with good motives
and for justifiable ends, his newspaper or periodical is suppressed and further publication is made punishable as
a contempt. This is of the essence of censorship.

The question is whether a statute authorizing such proceedings in restraint of publication is consistent with the
conception of the liberty of the press as historically conceived and guaranteed. In determining the extent of the
constitutional protection, it has been generally, if not universally, considered that it is the chief purpose of the
guaranty to prevent previous restraints upon publication. The struggle in England, directed against the legisla-
tive power of the licenser, resulted in renunciation of the censorship of the press. The liberty deemed to be estab-
lished was thus described by Blackstone: `The liberty of the press is indeed essential to the nature of a free state;
but this consists in laying no previous restraints upon publications, and not in freedom from censure for crimi-
nal matter when published. Every freeman has an undoubted right to lay what sentiments he pleases before the
public; to forbid this, is to destroy the freedom of the press; but if he publishes what is improper, mischievous or
illegal, he must take the consequence of his own temerity.' 4 Bl. Com. 151, 152. See Story on the Constitution,
1884, 1889. The distinction was early pointed out between the extent of the freedom with respect to censorship
66 | BASICS OF THE FREEDOM

under our constitutional system and that enjoyed in England. Here, as Madison said, `the great and essential
rights of the people are secured against legislative as well as against executive ambition. They are secured, not
by laws paramount to prerogative, but by constitutions paramount to laws. This security of the freedom of the
press requires that it should be exempt not only from previous restraint by the Executive, as in Great Britain,
but from legislative restraint also.' Report on the Virginia Resolutions, Madison's Works, vol. IV, p. 543. This
Court said, in Patterson v. Colorado (1907): "In the first place, the main purpose of such constitutional provi-
sions is `to prevent all such previous restraints upon publications as had been practiced by other governments,'
and they do not prevent the subsequent punishment of such as may be deemed contrary to the public welfare.
Commonwealth v. Blanding, Respublica v. Oswald. The preliminary freedom extends as well to the false as to the
true; the subsequent punishment may extend as well to the true as to the false. This was the law of criminal libel
apart from statute in most cases, if not in all. Commonwealth v. Blanding, Respublica v. Oswald."

* * * The objection has also been made that the principle as to immunity from previous restraint is stated too
broadly, if every such restraint is deemed to be prohibited. That is undoubtedly true; the protection even as to
previous restraint is not absolutely unlimited. But the limitation has been recognized only in exceptional cases.
"When a nation is at war many things that might be said in time of peace are such a hindrance to its effort that
their utterance will not be endured so long as men fight and that no Court could regard them as protected by any
constitutional right." Schenck v. United States (1919). No one would question but that a government might pre-
vent actual obstruction to its recruiting service or the publication of the sailing dates of transports or the num-
ber and location of troops. On similar grounds, the primary requirements of decency may be enforced against
obscene publications. The security of the community life may be protected against incitements to acts of vio-
lence and the overthrow by force of orderly government. The constitutional guaranty of free speech does not
"protect a man from an injunction against uttering words that may have all the effect of force." Gompers v. Buck
Stove & Range Co. (1911). Schenck v. U.S., supra. These limitations are not applicable here. * * *

The fact that, for approximately one hundred and fifty years, there has been almost an entire absence of attempts
to impose previous restraints upon publications relating to the malfeasance of public officers is significant of the
deep-seated conviction that such restraints would violate constitutional right. * * * The general principle that the
constitutional guaranty of the liberty of the press gives immunity from previous restraints has been approved in
many decisions under the provisions of state constitutions. * * *

The statute in question cannot be justified by reason of the fact that the publisher is permitted to show, before
injunction issues, that the matter published is true and is published with good motives and for justifiable ends.
If such a statute, authorizing suppression and injunction on such a basis, is constitutionally valid, it would be
equally permissible for the Legislature to provide that at any time the publisher of any newspaper could be
brought before a court, or even an administrative officer (as the constitutional protection may not be regarded
as resting on mere procedural details), and required to produce proof of the truth of his publication, or of what
he intended to publish and of his motives, or stand enjoined. If this can be done, the Legislature may provide
machinery for determining in the complete exercise of its discretion what are justifiable ends and restrain publi-
cation accordingly. And it would be but a step to a complete system of censorship. * * *
                                                                                                               BASICS OF THE FREEDOM | 67

For these reasons we hold the statute, so far as it authorized the proceedings in this action under clause (b) of sec-
tion 1, to be an infringement of the liberty of the press guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. We should
add that this decision rests upon the operation and effect of the statute, without regard to the question of the
truth of the charges contained in the particular periodical. The fact that the public officers named in this case,
and those associated with the charges of official dereliction, may be deemed to be impeccable, cannot affect the
conclusion that the statute imposes an unconstitutional restraint upon publication.

Judgment reversed.

MR. JUSTICE BUTLER, dissenting.

The decision of the Court in this case declares Minnesota and every other State powerless to restrain by injunc-
tion the business of publishing and circulating among the people malicious, scandalous and defamatory period-
icals that in due course of judicial procedure has been adjudged to be a public nuisance. It gives to freedom of
the press a meaning and a scope not heretofore recognized and construes "liberty" in the due process clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment to put upon the States a federal restriction that is without precedent ...

The record shows, and it is conceded, that defendants' regular business was the publication of malicious, scan-
dalous and defamatory articles concerning the principal public officers, leading newspapers of the city, many pri-
vate persons and the Jewish race. It also shows that it was their purpose at all hazards to continue to carry on the
business. In every edition slanderous and defamatory matter predominates to the practical exclusion of all else.
Many of the statements are so highly improbable as to compel a finding that they are false. The articles them-
selves show malice.

...

Defendant Near again appealed to the supreme court ...

Defendant concedes that the editions of the newspaper complained of are "defamatory per se." And he says: "It
has been asserted that the constitution was never intended to be a shield for malice, scandal, and defamation
when untrue, or published with bad motives, or for unjustifiable ends. ... The contrary is true; every per-
son does have a constitutional right to publish malicious, scandalous, and defamatory matter though untrue, and
with bad motives, and for unjustifiable ends, in the first instance, though he is subject to responsibility there-
for afterwards."

The record, when the substance of the articles is regarded, requires that concession here. And this Court is
required to pass on the validity of the state law on that basis ...

The Act was passed in the exertion of the State's power of police, and this court is by well established rule
required to assume, until the contrary is clearly made to appear, that there exists in Minnesota a state of affairs
that justifies this measure for the preservation of the peace and good order of the State. Lindsley v. Natural Car­
bonic Gas Co (1911), Gitlow v. New York (1925), Corporation Commission v. Lowe (1930), O'Gorman & Young v.
Hartford Ins. Co (1931) ...
68 | BASICS OF THE FREEDOM

...

It is of the greatest importance that the States shall be untrammeled and free to employ all just and appropriate
measures to prevent abuses of the liberty of the press ...

The Minnesota statute does not operate as a previous restraint on publication within the proper meaning of that
phrase. It does not authorize administrative control in advance such as was formerly exercised by the licensers
and censors but prescribes a remedy to be enforced by a suit in equity. In this case there was previous publica-
tion made in the course of the business of regularly producing malicious, scandalous and defamatory periodi-
cals. The business and publications unquestionably constitute an abuse of the right of free press. The statute
denounces the things done as a nuisance on the ground, as stated by the state supreme court, that they threaten
morals, peace and good order. There is no question of the power of the State to denounce such transgressions.
The restraint authorized is only in respect of continuing to do what has been duly adjudged to constitute a nui-
sance. The controlling words are "All persons guilty of such nuisance may be enjoined, as hereinafter provided.
... Whenever any such nuisance is committed ... an action in the name of the State" may be brought "to per-
petually enjoin the person or persons committing, conducting or maintaining any such nuisance, from further
committing, conducting or maintaining any such nuisance. ... The court may make its order and judgment perma-
nently enjoining ... defendants found guilty ... from committing or continuing the acts prohibited hereby, and
in and by such judgment, such nuisance may be wholly abated. ..." There is nothing in the statute purporting
to prohibit publications that have not been adjudged to constitute a nuisance. It is fanciful to suggest similarity
between the granting or enforcement of the decree authorized by this statute to prevent further publication of
malicious, scandalous and defamatory articles and the previous restraint upon the press by licensers as referred to
by Blackstone and described in the history of the times to which he alludes ...

It is well known, as found by the state supreme court, that existing libel laws are inadequate effectively to sup-
press evils resulting from the kind of business and publications that are shown in this case. The doctrine that
measures such as the one before us are invalid because they operate as previous restraints to infringe freedom of
press exposes the peace and good order of every community and the business and private affairs of every individ-
ual to the constant and protracted false and malicious assaults of any insolvent publisher who may have purpose
and sufficient capacity to contrive and put into effect a scheme or program for oppression, blackmail or extor-
tion.

The judgment should be affirmed.

MR. JUSTICE VAN DEVANTER, MR. JUSTICE McREYNOLDS, and MR. JUSTICE SUTHERLAND
concur in this opinion.

PER CURIAM.

...

We granted certiorari in these cases in which the United States seeks to enjoin the New York Times and the
Washington Post from publishing the contents of a classified study entitled "History of U. S. Decision-Making
Process on Viet Nam Policy." Post, pp. 942, 943.

"Any system of prior restraints of expression comes to this Court bearing a heavy presumption against its con-
stitutional validity." Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan (1963); see also Near v. Minnesota (1931). The Government
"thus carries a heavy burden of showing justification for the imposition of such a restraint." Organization for a
Better Austin v. Keefe (1971). The District Court for the Southern District of New York in the New York Times
case and the District Court for the District of Columbia and the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit in the Washington Post case held that the Government had not met that burden. We agree.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is therefore affirmed. The order of
the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is reversed and the case is remanded with directions to enter a judg-
ment affirming the judgment of the District Court for the Southern District of New York. The stays entered
June 25, 1971, by the Court are vacated.

The judgments shall issue forthwith. So ordered.

MR. JUSTICE BLACK, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS joins, concurring.

...

I adhere to the view that the Government's case against the Washington Post should have been dismissed and
that the injunction against the New York Times should have been vacated without oral argument when the cases
were first presented to this Court. I believe that every moment's continuance of the injunctions against these
newspapers amounts to a flagrant, indefensible, and continuing violation of the First Amendment ...
70 | BASICS OF THE FREEDOM

In seeking injunctions against these newspapers, and in its presentation to the Court, the Executive Branch
seems to have forgotten the essential purpose and history of the First Amendment. When the Constitution was
adopted, many people strongly opposed it because the document contained no Bill of Rights to safeguard cer-
tain basic freedoms. They especially feared that the new powers granted to a central government might be inter-
preted to permit the government to curtail freedom of religion, press, assembly, and speech. In response to an
overwhelming public clamor, James Madison offered a series of amendments to satisfy citizens that these great
liberties would remain safe and beyond the power of government to abridge ...

In the First Amendment the Founding Fathers gave the free press the protection it must have to fulfill its essen-
tial role in our democracy. The press was to serve the governed, not the governors. The Government's power to
censor the press was abolished so that the press would remain forever free to censure the Government. The press
was protected so that it could bare the secrets of government and inform the people. Only a free and unrestrained
press can effectively expose deception in government. And paramount among the responsibilities of a free press
is the duty to prevent any part of the government from deceiving the people and sending them off to distant
lands to die of foreign fevers and foreign shot and shell. In my view, far from deserving condemnation for their
courageous reporting, the New York Times, the Washington Post, and other newspapers should be commended
for serving the purpose that the Founding Fathers saw so clearly. In revealing the workings of government that
led to the Vietnam war, the newspapers nobly did precisely that which the Founders hoped and trusted they
would do ...

In other words, we are asked to hold that, despite the First Amendment's emphatic command, the Executive
Branch, the Congress, and the Judiciary can make laws enjoining publication of current news and abridging
freedom of the press in the name of "national security." The Government does not even attempt to rely on any
act of Congress. Instead, it makes the bold and dangerously far-reaching contention that the courts should take
it upon themselves to "make" a law abridging freedom of the press in the name of equity, presidential power and
national security, even when the representatives of the people in Congress have adhered to the command of the
First Amendment and refused to make such a law. To find that the President has "inherent power" to halt the
publication of news by resort to the courts would wipe out the First Amendment and destroy the fundamental
liberty and security of the very people the Government hopes to make "secure." No one can read the history of
the adoption of the First Amendment without being convinced beyond any doubt that it was injunctions like
those sought here that Madison and his collaborators intended to outlaw in this Nation for all time.

The word "security" is a broad, vague generality whose contours should not be invoked to abrogate the funda-
mental law embodied in the First Amendment. The guarding of military and diplomatic secrets at the expense
of informed representative government provides no real security for our Republic. The Framers of the First
Amendment, fully aware of both the need to defend a new nation and the abuses of the English and Colonial
governments, sought to give this new society strength and security by providing that freedom of speech, press,
religion, and assembly should not be abridged. This thought was eloquently expressed in 1937 by Mr. Chief Jus-
tice Hughes-great man and great Chief Justice that he was--when the Court held a man could not be punished
for attending a meeting run by Communists ...

MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, concurring.
                                                                                                               BASICS OF THE FREEDOM | 71

I write separately in these cases only to emphasize what should be apparent: that our judgments in the present
cases may not be taken to indicate the propriety, in the future, of issuing temporary stays and restraining orders
to block the publication of material sought to be suppressed by the Government. So far as I can determine,
never before has the United States sought to enjoin a newspaper from publishing information in its possession.
The relative novelty of the questions presented, the necessary haste with which decisions were reached, the mag-
nitude of the interests asserted, and the fact that all the parties have concentrated their arguments upon the
question whether permanent restraints were proper may have justified at least some of the restraints heretofore
imposed in these cases. Certainly it is difficult to fault the several courts below for seeking to assure that the
issues here involved were preserved for ultimate review by this Court. But even if it be assumed that some of the
interim restraints were proper in the two cases before us, that assumption has no bearing upon the propriety of
similar judicial action in the future. To begin with, there has now been ample time for reflection and judgment;
whatever values there may be in the preservation of novel questions for appellate review may not support any
restraints in the future. More important, the First Amendment stands as an absolute bar to the imposition of
judicial restraints in circumstances of the kind presented by these cases.

The error that has pervaded these cases from the outset was the granting of any injunctive relief whatsoever,
interim or otherwise. The entire thrust of the Government's claim throughout these cases has been that publica-
tion of the material sought to be enjoined "could," or "might," or "may" prejudice the national interest in vari-
ous ways. But the First Amendment tolerates absolutely no prior judicial restraints of the press predicated upon
surmise or conjecture that untoward consequences may result.* Our cases, it is true, have indicated that there is
a single, extremely narrow class of cases in which the First Amendment's ban on prior judicial restraint may be
overridden. Our cases have thus far indicated that such cases may arise only when the Nation "is at war," Schenck
v. United States (1919), during which times "[n]o one would question but that a government might prevent
actual obstruction to its recruiting service or the publication of the sailing dates of transports or the number and
location of troops." Near v. Minnesota (1931). Even if the present world situation were assumed to be tanta-
mount to a time of war, or if the power of presently available armaments would justify even in peacetime the
suppression of information that would set in motion a nuclear holocaust, in neither of these actions has the
Government presented or even alleged that publication of items from or based upon the material at issue would
cause the happening of an event of that nature."[T]he chief purpose of [the First Amendment's] guaranty [is]
to prevent previous restraints upon publication." Near v. Minnesota, supra. Thus, only governmental allegation
and proof that publication must inevitably, directly, and immediately cause the occurrence of an event kindred
to imperiling the safety of a transport already at sea can support even the issuance of an interim restraining order.
In no event may mere conclusions be sufficient, for if the Executive Branch seeks judicial aid in preventing publi-
cation, it must inevitably submit the basis upon which that aid is sought to scrutiny by the judiciary. And, there-
fore, every restraint issued in this case, whatever its form, has violated the First Amendment -- and not less so
because that restraint was justified as necessary to afford the courts an opportunity to examine the claim more
thoroughly. Unless and until the Government has clearly made out its case, the First Amendment commands
that no injunction may issue.

MR. JUSTICE WHITE, with whom MR. JUSTICE STEWART joins, concurring.
72 | BASICS OF THE FREEDOM

I concur in today's judgments, but only because of the concededly extraordinary protection against prior
restraints enjoyed by the press under our constitutional system. I do not say that in no circumstances would
the First Amendment permit an injunction against publishing information about government plans or opera-
tions. Nor, after examining the materials the Government characterizes as the most sensitive and destructive, can
I deny that revelation of these documents will do substantial damage to public interests. Indeed, I am confident
that their disclosure will have that result. But I nevertheless agree that the United States has not satisfied the very
heavy burden that it must meet to warrant an injunction against publication in these cases, at least in the absence
of express and appropriately limited congressional authorization for prior restraints in circumstances such as
these.

The Government's position is simply stated: the responsibility of the Executive for the conduct of the foreign
affairs and for the security of the Nation is so basic that the President is entitled to an injunction against publica-
tion of a newspaper story whenever he can convince a court that the information to be revealed threatens "grave
and irreparable" injury to the public interest; and the injunction should issue whether or not the material to be
published is classified, whether or not publication would be lawful under relevant criminal statutes enacted by
Congress, and regardless of the circumstances by which the newspaper came into possession of the information.
At least in the absence of legislation by Congress, based on its own investigations and findings, I am quite unable
to agree that the inherent powers of the Executive and the courts reach so far as to authorize remedies having
such sweeping potential for inhibiting publications by the press ...

It is not easy to reject the proposition urged by the United States, and to deny relief on its good faith claims
in these cases that publication will work serious damage to the country. But that discomfiture is considerably
dispelled by the infrequency of prior-restraint cases. Normally, publication will occur and the damage be done
before the Government has either opportunity or grounds for suppression. So here, publication has already
begun, and a substantial part of the threatened damage has already occurred. The fact of a massive breakdown
in security is known, access to the documents by many unauthorized people is undeniable, and the efficacy of
equitable relief against these or other newspapers to avert anticipated damage is doubtful, at best.

What is more, terminating the ban on publication of the relatively few sensitive documents the Government
now seeks to suppress does not mean that the law either requires or invites newspapers or others to publish them,
or that they will be immune from criminal action if they do. Prior restraints require an unusually heavy justifi-
cation under the First Amendment, but failure by the Government to justify prior restraints does not measure
its constitutional entitlement to a conviction for criminal publication. That the Government mistakenly chose
to proceed by injunction does not mean that it could not successfully proceed in another way ...

MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, concurring.

The Government contends that the only issue in these cases is whether, in a suit by the United States, "the First
Amendment bars a court from prohibiting a newspaper from publishing material whose disclosure would pose
a `grave and immediate danger to the security of the United States.' " Brief for the United States. With all due
respect, I believe the ultimate issue in these cases is even more basic than the one posed by the Solicitor General.
The issue is whether this Court or the Congress has the power to make law.

In these cases, there is no problem concerning the President's power to classify information as "secret" or "top
secret." Congress has specifically recognized Presidential authority, which has been formally exercised in Exec.
Order 10501 (1953), to classify documents and information. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 798; 50 U.S.C. § 783. Nor
is there any issue here regarding the President's power as Chief Executive and Commander in Chief to protect
national security by disciplining employees who disclose information and by taking precautions to prevent leaks.

The problem here is whether, in these particular cases, the Executive Branch has authority to invoke the equity
jurisdiction of the courts to protect what it believes to be the national interest. See In re Debs, (1895). The Gov-
ernment argues that, in addition to the inherent power of any government to protect itself, the President's power
to conduct foreign affairs and his position as Commander in Chief give him authority to impose censorship
on the press to protect his ability to deal effectively with foreign nations and to conduct the military affairs of
the country. Of course, it is beyond cavil that the President has broad powers by virtue of his primary responsi-
bility for the conduct of our foreign affairs and his position as Commander in Chief. Chicago & Southern Air
Lines v. Waterman S.S. Corp (1948); Hirabayashi v. United States (1943); United States v. Curtiss Wright Corp
(1936). And, in some situations, it may be that, under whatever inherent powers the Government may have, as
well as the implicit authority derived from the President's mandate to conduct foreign affairs and to act as Com-
mander in Chief, there is a basis for the invocation of the equity jurisdiction of this Court as an aid to prevent
the publication of material damaging to "national security," however that term may be defined.

It would, however, be utterly inconsistent with the concept of separation of powers for this Court to use its
power of contempt to prevent behavior that Congress has specifically declined to prohibit. There would be a
similar damage to the basic concept of these co-equal branches of Government if, when the Executive Branch
has adequate authority granted by Congress to protect "national security," it can choose, instead, to invoke the
contempt power of a court to enjoin the threatened conduct. The Constitution provides that Congress shall
make laws, the President execute laws, and courts interpret laws. Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer (1952).
It did not provide for government by injunction in which the courts and the Executive Branch can "make law"
without regard to the action of Congress. It may be more convenient for the Executive Branch if it need only
convince a judge to prohibit conduct, rather than ask the Congress to pass a law, and it may be more convenient
to enforce a contempt order than to seek a criminal conviction in a jury trial. Moreover, it may be considered
politically wise to get a court to share the responsibility for arresting those who the Executive Branch has prob-
able cause to believe are violating the law. But convenience and political considerations of the moment do not
justify a basic departure from the principles of our system of government ...

Either the Government has the power under statutory grant to use traditional criminal law to protect the coun-
try or, if there is no basis for arguing that Congress has made the activity a crime, it is plain that Congress has
specifically refused to grant the authority the Government seeks from this Court. In either case, this Court does
not have authority to grant the requested relief. It is not for this Court to fling itself into every breach perceived
by some Government official, nor is it for this Court to take on itself the burden of enacting law, especially a law
that Congress has refused to pass.

JUSTICE BRENNAN DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.

We are required in this case to determine for the first time the extent to which the constitutional protections for
speech and press limit a State's power to award damages in a libel action brought by a public official against crit-
ics of his official conduct.

Respondent L. B. Sullivan is one of the three elected Commissioners of the City of Montgomery, Alabama. He
testified that he was "Commissioner of Public Affairs and the duties are supervision of the Police Department,
Fire Department, Department of Cemetery and Department of Scales." He brought this civil libel action against
the four individual petitioners, who are Negroes and Alabama clergymen, and against petitioner the New York
Times Company, a New York corporation which publishes the New York Times, a daily newspaper. A jury in
the Circuit Court of Montgomery County awarded him damages of $500,000, the full amount claimed, against
all the petitioners, and the Supreme Court of Alabama affirmed.

Respondent's complaint alleged that he had been libeled by statements in a full-page advertisement that was car-
ried in the New York Times on March 29, 1960. Entitled "Heed Their Rising Voices," the advertisement began
by stating that "As the whole world knows by now, thousands of Southern Negro students are engaged in wide-
spread non-violent demonstrations in positive affirmation of the right to live in human dignity as guaranteed by
the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights." It went on to charge that "in their efforts to uphold these guaran-
tees, they are being met by an unprecedented wave of terror by those who would deny and negate that document
which the whole world looks upon as setting the pattern for modern freedom. ..." Succeeding paragraphs pur-
ported to illustrate the "wave of terror" by describing certain alleged events. The text concluded with an appeal
for funds for three purposes: support of the student movement, "the struggle for the right-to-vote," and the legal
defense of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., leader of the movement, against a perjury indictment then pending in
Montgomery.

The text appeared over the names of 64 persons, many widely known for their activities in public affairs, religion,
trade unions, and the performing arts. Below these names, and under a line reading "We in the south who are
76 | LIBEL AND DEFAMATION

struggling daily for dignity and freedom warmly endorse this appeal," appeared the names of the four individual
petitioners and of 16 other persons, all but two of whom were identified as clergymen in various Southern cities.
The advertisement was signed at the bottom of the page by the "Committee to Defend Martin Luther King and
the Struggle for Freedom in the South," and the officers of the Committee were listed.

Of the 10 paragraphs of text in the advertisement, the third and a portion of the sixth were the basis of respon-
dent's claim of libel. They read as follows:

Third paragraph:

      "In Montgomery, Alabama, after students sang `My Country, `Tis of Thee' on the State Capitol steps, their leaders
      were expelled from school, and truckloads of police armed with shotguns and tear-gas ringed the Alabama State
      College Campus. When the entire student body protested to state authorities by refusing to re-register, their din-
      ing hall was padlocked in an attempt to starve them into submission."

Sixth paragraph:

      "Again and again the Southern violators have answered Dr. King's peaceful protests with intimidation and vio-
      lence. They have bombed his home almost killing his wife and child. They have assaulted his person. They have
      arrested him seven times - for `speeding,' `loitering' and similar `offenses.' And now they have charged him with
      `perjury' - a felony under which they could imprison him for ten years. ..."

Although neither of these statements mentions respondent by name, he contended that the word "police" in the
third paragraph referred to him as the Montgomery Commissioner who supervised the Police Department, so
that he was being accused of "ringing" the campus with police. He further claimed that the paragraph would be
read as imputing to the police, and hence to him, the padlocking of the dining hall in order to starve the students
into submission. As to the sixth paragraph, he contended that since arrests are ordinarily made by the police, the
statement "They have arrested [Dr. King] seven times" would be read as referring to him; he further contended
that the "They" who did the arresting would be equated with the "They" who committed the other described
acts and with the "Southern violators." Thus, he argued, the paragraph would be read as accusing the Mont-
gomery police, and hence him, of answering Dr. King's protests with "intimidation and violence," bombing his
home, assaulting his person, and charging him with perjury. Respondent and six other Montgomery residents
testified that they read some or all of the statements as referring to him in his capacity as Commissioner.

It is uncontroverted that some of the statements contained in the paragraphs were not accurate descriptions of
events which occurred in Montgomery. Although Negro students staged a demonstration on the State Capi-
tol steps, they sang the National Anthem and not "My Country, `Tis of Thee." Although nine students were
expelled by the State Board of Education, this was not for leading the demonstration at the Capitol, but for
demanding service at a lunch counter in the Montgomery County Courthouse on another day. Not the entire
student body, but most of it, had protested the expulsion, not by refusing to register, but by boycotting classes
on a single day; virtually all the students did register for the ensuing semester. The campus dining hall was not
padlocked on any occasion, and the only students who may have been barred from eating there were the few
who had neither signed a preregistration application nor requested temporary meal tickets. Although the police
were deployed near the campus in large numbers on three occasions, they did not at any time "ring" the campus,
                                                                                                                 LIBEL AND DEFAMATION | 77

and they were not called to the campus in connection with the demonstration on the State Capitol steps, as the
third paragraph implied. Dr. King had not been arrested seven times, but only four; and although he claimed to
have been assaulted some years earlier in connection with his arrest for loitering outside a courtroom, one of the
officers who made the arrest denied that there was such an assault.

On the premise that the charges in the sixth paragraph could be read as referring to him, respondent was allowed
to prove that he had not participated in the events described. Although Dr. King's home had in fact been
bombed twice when his wife and child were there, both of these occasions antedated respondent's tenure as
Commissioner, and the police were not only not implicated in the bombings, but had made every effort to
apprehend those who were. Three of Dr. King's four arrests took place before respondent became Commis-
sioner. Although Dr. King had in fact been indicted (he was subsequently acquitted) on two counts of perjury,
each of which carried a possible five-year sentence, respondent had nothing to do with procuring the indict-
ment.

Respondent made no effort to prove that he suffered actual pecuniary loss as a result of the alleged libel. * * *
The trial judge submitted the case to the jury under instructions that the statements in the advertisement were
"libelous per se" and were not privileged, so that petitioners might be held liable if the jury found that they had
published the advertisement and that the statements were made "of and concerning" respondent. The jury was
instructed that, because the statements were libelous per se, "the law ... implies legal injury from the bare fact of
publication itself," "falsity and malice are presumed," "general damages need not be alleged or proved but are
presumed," and "punitive damages may be awarded by the jury even though the amount of actual damages is
neither found nor shown." An award of punitive damages - as distinguished from "general" damages, which are
compensatory in nature - apparently requires proof of actual malice under Alabama law, and the judge charged
that "mere negligence or carelessness is not evidence of actual malice or malice in fact, and does not justify an
award of exemplary or punitive damages." He refused to charge, however, that the jury must be "convinced" of
malice, in the sense of "actual intent" to harm or "gross negligence and recklessness," to make such an award,
and he also refused to require that a verdict for respondent differentiate between compensatory and punitive
damages. The judge rejected petitioners' contention that his rulings abridged the freedoms of speech and of the
press that are guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

[The jury found for the plaintiff and the Supreme Court of Alabama affirmed]. Because of the importance of the
constitutional issues involved, we granted the separate petitions for certiorari of the individual petitioners and
of the Times. We reverse the judgment. We hold that the rule of law applied by the Alabama courts is constitu-
tionally deficient for failure to provide the safeguards for freedom of speech and of the press that are required by
the First and Fourteenth Amendments in a libel action brought by a public official against critics of his official
conduct. We further hold that under the proper safeguards the evidence presented in this case is constitutionally
insufficient to support the judgment for respondent.

[The Court first held that there was state action and that the publication was not a "commercial" advertisement
unprotected by the First Amendment because it "communicated information, expressed opinion, recited griev-
ances, protested claimed abuses, and sought financial support on behalf of a movement whose existence and
objectives are matters of the highest public interest and concern."]
78 | LIBEL AND DEFAMATION

Under Alabama law as applied in this case, a publication is "libelous per se" if the words "tend to injure a person
... in his reputation" or to "bring [him] into public contempt." * * * Once "libel per se" has been established, the
defendant has no defense as to stated facts unless he can persuade the jury that they were true in all their partic-
ulars. Alabama Ride Co. v. Vance (1938); Johnson Publishing Co. v. Davis (1960). * * *

The question before us is whether this rule of liability, as applied to an action brought by a public official against
critics of his official conduct, abridges the freedom of speech and of the press that is guaranteed by the first and
Fourteenth Amendments. * * * In deciding the question now, we are compelled by neither precedent nor policy
to give any more weight to the epithet "libel" than we have to other "mere labels" of state law. NAACP v. But­
ton (1963). Like insurrection, contempt, advocacy of unlawful acts, breach of the peace, obscenity, solicitation
of legal business, and the various other formulae for the repression of expression that have been challenged in
this court, libel can claim no talismanic immunity from constitutional limitations. It must be measured by stan-
dards that satisfy the First Amendment.

The general proposition that freedom of expression upon public questions is secured by the First Amendment
has long been settled by our decisions. * * *

Thus we consider this case against the background of a profound national commitment to the principle that
debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may well include vehe-
ment, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials. See Terminiello v.
Chicago (1949); De Jonge v. Oregon (1937). The present advertisement, as an expression of grievance and protest
on one of the major public issues of our time, would seem clearly to qualify for the constitutional protection.
The question is whether it forfeits that protection by the falsity of some of its factual statements and by its
alleged defamation of respondent.

Authoritative interpretations of the First Amendment guarantees have consistently refused to recognize an
exception for any test of truth - whether administered by judges, juries, or administrative officials - and
especially one that puts the burden of proving truth on the speaker. The constitutional protection does not
turn upon "the truth, popularity, or social utility of the ideas and beliefs which are offered." NAACP v. But­
ton (1963). As Madison said, "Some degree of abuse is inseparable from the proper use of everything; and in no
instance is this more true than in that of the press." * * *

[E]rroneous statement is inevitable in free debate, and * * * must be protected if the freedoms of expression are
to have the "breathing space" that they "need ... to survive," NAACP v. Button (1963) ...

Injury to official reputation affords no more warrant for repressing speech that would otherwise be free than
does factual error. Where judicial officers are involved, this Court has held that concern for the dignity and
reputation of the courts does not justify the punishment as criminal contempt of criticism of the judge or his
decision. Bridges v. California (1941). This is true even though the utterance contains "half-truths" and "misin-
formation." Pennekamp v. Florida (1946). Such repression can be justified, if at all, only by a clear and present
danger of the obstruction of justice. If judges are to be treated as "men of fortitude, able to thrive in a hardy cli-
                                                                                                                 LIBEL AND DEFAMATION | 79

mate," Craig v. Harney (1947), surely the same must be true of other government officials, such as elected city
commissioners. Criticism of their official conduct does not lose its constitutional protection merely because it is
effective criticism and hence diminishes their official reputations.

If neither factual error nor defamatory content suffices to remove the constitutional shield from criticism of offi-
cial conduct, the combination of the two elements is no less inadequate. This is the lesson to be drawn from
the great controversy over the Sedition Act of 1798 which first crystallized a national awareness of the central
meaning of the First Amendment. See Levy, Legacy of Suppression (1960), at 258 et seq.; Smith, Freedom's Fet-
ters (1956), at 426, 431, and passim. That statute made it a crime, punishable by a $5,000 fine and five years in
prison, "if any person shall write, print, utter or publish ... any false, scandalous and malicious writing or writ-
ings against the government of the United States, or either house of the Congress ..., or the President ..., with
intent to defame ... or to bring them, or either of them, into contempt or disrepute; or to excite against them, or
either or any of them, the hatred of the good people of the United States."

The Act allowed the defendant the defense of truth, and provided that the jury were to be judges both of the law
and the facts. Despite these qualifications, the Act was vigorously condemned as unconstitutional in an attack
joined in by Jefferson and Madison. * * *

Although the Sedition Act was never tested in this Court, the attack upon its validity has carried the day in the
court of history. * * * [There is] a broad consensus that the Act, because of the restraint it imposed upon criti-
cism of government and public officials, was inconsistent with the First Amendment. * * * There is no force in
respondent's argument that the constitutional limitations implicit in the history of the Sedition Act apply only
to Congress and not to the States. * * * [T]his distinction was eliminated with the adoption of the Fourteenth
Amendment and the application to the States of the First Amendment's restrictions.

What a State may not constitutionally bring about by means of a criminal statute is likewise beyond the reach of
its civil law of libel. The fear of damage awards under a rule such as that invoked by the Alabama courts here may
be markedly more inhibiting than the fear of prosecution under a criminal statute. * * * The judgment awarded
in this case - without the need for any proof of actual pecuniary loss - was one thousand times greater than
the maximum fine provided by the Alabama criminal statute, and one hundred times greater than that provided
by the Sedition Act. And since there is no double-jeopardy limitation applicable to civil lawsuits, this is not the
only judgment that may be awarded against petitioners for the same publication. Whether or not a newspaper
can survive a succession of such judgments, the pall of fear and timidity imposed upon those who would give
voice to public criticism is an atmosphere in which the First Amendment freedoms cannot survive. Plainly the
Alabama law of civil libel is "a form of regulation that creates hazards to protected freedoms markedly greater
than those that attend reliance upon the criminal law." Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan (1963).

The state rule of law is not saved by its allowance of the defense of truth. * * *

Allowance of the defense of truth, with the burden of proving it on the defendant, does not mean that only
false speech will be deterred. Even courts accepting this defense as an adequate safeguard have recognized the dif-
ficulties of adducing legal proofs that the alleged libel was true in all its factual particulars. Under such a rule,
would-be critics of official conduct may be deterred from voicing their criticism, even though it is believed to be
80 | LIBEL AND DEFAMATION

true and even though it is in fact true, because of doubt whether it can be proved in court or fear of the expense
of having to do so. They tend to make only statements which "steer far wider of the unlawful zone." Speiser v.
Randall (1958). The rule thus dampens the vigor and limits the variety of public debate. It is inconsistent with
the First and Fourteenth Amendments ...

The constitutional guarantees require, we think, a federal rule that prohibits a public official from recovering
damages for a defamatory falsehood relating to his official conduct unless he proves that the statement was made
with "actual malice" - that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false
or not. * * *

Such a privilege for criticism of official conduct is appropriately analogous to the protection accorded a public
official when he is sued for libel by a private citizen. * * * Analogous considerations support the privilege for the
citizen-critic of government. It is as much his duty to criticize as it is the official's duty to administer. * * * We
conclude that such a privilege is required by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

We hold today that the Constitution delimits a State's power to award damages for libel in actions brought by
public officials against critics of their official conduct. Since this is such an action, the rule requiring proof of
actual malice is applicable. While Alabama law apparently requires proof of actual malice for an award of puni-
tive damages, where general damages are concerned malice is "presumed." Such a presumption is inconsistent
with the federal rule. * * * Since the trial judge did not instruct the jury to differentiate between general and puni-
tive damages, it may be that the verdict was wholly an award of one or the other. But it is impossible to know,
in view of the general verdict returned. Because of this uncertainty, the judgment must be reversed and the case
remanded ...

The judgment of the Supreme Court of Alabama is reversed and the case is remanded to that court for further
proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

MR. JUSTICE BLACK, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS joins, concurring.

I concur in reversing this half-million-dollar judgment against the New York Times Company and the four indi-
vidual defendants. In reversing the Court holds that "the Constitution delimits a State's power to award dam-
ages for libel in actions brought by public officials against critics of their official conduct." I base my vote to
reverse on the belief that the First and Fourteenth Amendments not merely "delimit" a State's power to award
damages to "public officials against critics of their official conduct" but completely prohibit a State from exercis-
ing such a power. The Court goes on to hold that a State can subject such critics to damages if "actual malice"
can be proved against them. "Malice," even as defined by the Court, is an elusive, abstract concept, hard to prove
and hard to disprove. The requirement that malice be proved provides at best an evanescent protection for the
right critically to discuss public affairs and certainly does not measure up to the sturdy safeguard embodied in
the First Amendment. Unlike the Court, therefore, I vote to reverse exclusively on the ground that the Times
and the individual defendants had an absolute, unconditional constitutional right to publish in the Times adver-
tisement their criticisms of the Montgomery agencies and officials. * * *
                                                                                                                 LIBEL AND DEFAMATION | 81

We would, I think, more faithfully interpret the First Amendment by holding that at the very least it leaves the
people and the press free to criticize officials and discuss public affairs with impunity. This Nation of ours elects
many of its important officials; so do the States, the municipalities, the counties, and even many precincts. These
officials are responsible to the people for the way they perform their duties. While our Court has held that some
kinds of speech and writings, such as "obscenity," Roth v. United States (1957) and "fighting words," Chaplinsky
v. New Hampshire (1942) are not expression within the protection of the First Amendment, freedom to dis-
cuss public affairs and public officials is unquestionably, as the Court today holds, the kind of speech the First
Amendment was primarily designed to keep within the area of free discussion. To punish the exercise of this
right to discuss public affairs or to penalize it through libel judgments is to abridge or shut off discussion of the
very kind most needed. This Nation, I suspect, can live in peace without libel suits based on public discussions
of public affairs and public officials. But I doubt that a country can live in freedom where its people can be made
to suffer physically or financially for criticizing their government, its actions, or its officials. "For a representa-
tive democracy ceases to exist the moment that the public functionaries are by any means absolved from their
responsibility to their constituents; and this happens whenever the constituent can be restrained in any manner
from speaking, writing, or publishing his opinions upon any public measure, or upon the conduct of those who
may advise or execute it." An unconditional right to say what one pleases about public affairs is what I consider
to be the minimum guarantee of the First Amendment. I regret that the Court has stopped short of this holding
indispensable to preserve our free press from destruction.

MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS joins, concurring.

The Court today announces a constitutional standard which prohibits "a public official from recovering dam-
ages for a defamatory falsehood relating to his official conduct unless he proves that the statement was made
with `actual malice' - that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or
not." The Court thus rules that the Constitution gives citizens and newspapers a "conditional privilege" immu-
nizing nonmalicious misstatements of fact regarding the official conduct of a government officer. The impres-
sive array of history and precedent marshaled by the Court, however, confirms my belief that the Constitution
affords greater protection than that provided by the Court's standard to citizen and press in exercising the right
of public criticism.

In my view, the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution afford to the citizen and to the press an
absolute, unconditional privilege to criticize official conduct despite the harm which may flow from excesses and
abuses. * * *

JUSTICE POWELL DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.

...

We granted certiorari to reconsider the extent of a publisher's constitutional privilege against liability for defama-
tion of a private citizen.

In 1968 a Chicago policeman named Nuccio shot and killed a youth named Nelson. The state authorities pros-
ecuted Nuccio for the homicide and ultimately obtained a conviction for murder in the second degree. The
Nelson family retained petitioner Elmer Gertz, a reputable attorney, to represent them in civil litigation against
Nuccio.

Respondent publishes American Opinion, a monthly outlet for the views of the John Birch Society. Early in
the 1960's the magazine began to warn of a nationwide conspiracy to discredit local law enforcement agencies
and create in their stead a national police force capable of supporting a Communist dictatorship. As part of the
continuing effort to alert the public to this assumed danger, the managing editor of American Opinion com-
missioned an article on the murder trial of Officer Nuccio. For this purpose, he engaged a regular contributor to
the magazine. In March 1969 respondent published the resulting article under the title "FRAME-UP: Richard
Nuccio and The War On Police." The article purports to demonstrate that the testimony against Nuccio at his
criminal trial was false and that his prosecution was part of the Communist campaign against the police ...

These statements contained serious inaccuracies. The implication that petitioner had a criminal record was false.
Petitioner had been a member and officer of the National Lawyers Guild some 15 years earlier, but there was no
evidence that he or that organization had taken any part in planning the 1968 demonstrations in Chicago. There
was also no basis for the charge that petitioner was a "Leninist" or a "Communist-fronter." And he had never
been a member of the "Marxist League for Industrial Democracy" or the "Intercollegiate Socialist Society."

The managing editor of American Opinion made no effort to verify or substantiate the charges against peti-
tioner. Instead, he appended an editorial introduction stating that the author had "conducted extensive research
into the Richard Nuccio Case." And he included in the article a photograph of petitioner and wrote the caption
that appeared under it: "Elmer Gertz of Red Guild harasses Nuccio." Respondent placed the issue of Ameri-

Petitioner filed a diversity action for libel in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.
He claimed that the falsehoods published by respondent injured his reputation as a lawyer and a citizen. * *
* After answering the complaint, respondent filed a pretrial motion for summary judgment, claiming a con-
stitutional privilege against liability for defamation. It asserted that petitioner was a public official or a pub-
lic figure and that the article concerned an issue of public interest and concern. For these reasons, respondent
argued, it was entitled to invoke the privilege enunciated in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964). Under this
rule respondent would escape liability unless petitioner could prove publication of defamatory falsehood "with
`actual malice' - that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not."
Respondent claimed that petitioner could not make such a showing and submitted a supporting affidavit by the
magazine's managing editor. The editor denied any knowledge of the falsity of the statements concerning peti-
tioner and stated that he had relied on the author's reputation and on his prior experience with the accuracy and
authenticity of the author's contributions to American Opinion ...

The principal issue in this case is whether a newspaper or broadcaster that publishes defamatory falsehoods
about an individual who is neither a public official nor a public figure may claim a constitutional privilege
against liability for the injury inflicted by those statements. * * *

We begin with the common ground. Under the First Amendment there is no such thing as a false idea. However
pernicious an opinion may seem, we depend for its correction not on the conscience of judges and juries but on
the competition of other ideas. But there is no constitutional value in false statements of fact. Neither the inten-
tional lie nor the careless error materially advances society's interest in "uninhibited, robust, and wide-open"
debate on public issues. New York Times v. Sullivan (1964). They belong to that category of utterances which
"are no essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any ben-
efit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality." Chaplinsky
v. New Hampshire (1942) ...

Although the erroneous statement of fact is not worthy of constitutional protection, it is nevertheless inevitable
in free debate ... [P]unishment of error runs the risk of inducing a cautious and restrictive exercise of the con-
stitutionally guaranteed freedoms of speech and press. Our decisions recognize that a rule of strict liability [lia-
bility that does not depend on actual negligence or intent to harm] that compels a publisher or broadcaster to
guarantee the accuracy of his factual assertions may lead to intolerable self-censorship. Allowing the media to
avoid liability only by proving the truth of all injurious statements does not accord adequate protection to First
Amendment liberties. As the Court stated in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan: "Allowance of the defense of truth,
with the burden of proving it on the defendant, does not mean that only false speech will be deterred." The First
Amendment requires that we protect some falsehood in order to protect speech that matters.

The need to avoid self-censorship by the news media is, however, not the only societal value at issue. If it were,
this Court would have embraced long ago the view that publishers and broadcasters enjoy an unconditional and
indefeasible immunity from liability for defamation ... Yet absolute protection for the communications media
requires a total sacrifice of the competing value served by the law of defamation ...
84 | LIBEL AND DEFAMATION

The legitimate state interest underlying the law of libel is the compensation of individuals for the harm inflicted
on them by defamatory falsehood. * * *

The New York Times standard defines the level of constitutional protection appropriate to the context of
defamation of a public person. Those who, by reason of the notoriety of their achievements or the vigor and
success with which they seek the public's attention, are properly classed as public figures and those who hold
governmental office may recover for injury to reputation only on clear and convincing proof that the defamatory
falsehood was made with knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard for the truth. This standard admin-
isters an extremely powerful antidote to the inducement to media self-censorship of the common-law rule of
strict liability for libel and slander. And it exacts a correspondingly high price from the victims of defamatory
falsehood. Plainly many deserving plaintiffs, including some intentionally subjected to injury, will be unable to
surmount the barrier of the New York Times test. Despite this substantial abridgment of the state law right to
compensation for wrongful hurt to one's reputation, the Court has concluded that the protection of the New
York Times privilege should be available to publishers and broadcasters of defamatory falsehood concerning
public officials and public figures. We think that these decisions are correct, but we do not find their holdings
justified solely by reference to the interest of the press and broadcast media in immunity from liability. Rather,
we believe that the New York Times rule states an accommodation between this concern and the limited state
interest present in the context of libel actions brought by public persons. For the reasons stated below, we con-
clude that the state interest in compensating injury to the reputation of private individuals requires that a differ-
ent rule should obtain with respect to them ...

With that caveat we have no difficulty in distinguishing among defamation plaintiffs. The first remedy of any
victim of defamation is self-help - using available opportunities to contradict the lie or correct the error and
thereby to minimize its adverse impact on reputation. Public officials and public figures usually enjoy signifi-
cantly greater access to the channels of effective communication and hence have a more realistic opportunity to
counteract false statements than private individuals normally enjoy. Private individuals are therefore more vul-
nerable to injury, and the state interest in protecting them is correspondingly greater.

More important than the likelihood that private individuals will lack effective opportunities for rebuttal, there is
a compelling normative consideration underlying the distinction between public and private defamation plain-
tiffs. An individual who decides to seek governmental office must accept certain necessary consequences of that
involvement in public affairs. He runs the risk of closer public scrutiny than might otherwise be the case. And
society's interest in the officers of government is not strictly limited to the formal discharge of official duties ...

Even if the foregoing generalities do not obtain in every instance, the communications media are entitled to act
on the assumption that public officials and public figures have voluntarily exposed themselves to increased risk
of injury from defamatory falsehood concerning them. No such assumption is justified with respect to a private
individual. He has not accepted public office or assumed an "influential role in ordering society." Curtis Publish­
ing Co. v. Butts (1967). He has relinquished no part of his interest in the protection of his own good name, and
consequently he has a more compelling call on the courts for redress of injury inflicted by defamatory falsehood.
Thus, private individuals are not only more vulnerable to injury than public officials and public figures; they are
also more deserving of recovery.
                                                                                                                 LIBEL AND DEFAMATION | 85

For these reasons we conclude that the States should retain substantial latitude in their efforts to enforce a legal
remedy for defamatory falsehood injurious to the reputation of a private individual. * * * The "public or general
interest" test for determining the applicability of the New York Times standard to private defamation actions
inadequately serves both of the competing values at stake. On the one hand, a private individual whose reputa-
tion is injured by defamatory falsehood that does concern an issue of public or general interest has no recourse
unless he can meet the rigorous requirements of New York Times. This is true despite the factors that distinguish
the state interest in compensating private individuals from the analogous interest involved in the context of pub-
lic persons. On the other hand, a publisher or broadcaster of a defamatory error which a court deems unrelated
to an issue of public or general interest may be held liable in damages even if it took every reasonable precaution
to ensure the accuracy of its assertions. And liability may far exceed compensation for any actual injury to the
plaintiff, for the jury may be permitted to presume damages without proof of loss and even to award punitive
damages.

We hold that, so long as they do not impose liability without fault, the States may define for themselves the
appropriate standard of liability for a publisher or broadcaster of defamatory falsehood injurious to a private
individual ...

Notwithstanding our refusal to extend the New York Times privilege to defamation of private individuals,
respondent contends that we should affirm the judgment below on the ground that petitioner is either a public
official or a public figure. There is little basis for the former assertion. Several years prior to the present inci-
dent, petitioner had served briefly on housing committees appointed by the mayor of Chicago, but at the time of
publication he had never held any remunerative governmental position. Respondent admits this but argues that
petitioner's appearance at the coroner's inquest rendered him a "de facto public official." Our cases recognize no
such concept. Respondent's suggestion would sweep all lawyers under the New York Times rule as officers of the
court and distort the plain meaning of the "public official" category beyond all recognition. We decline to follow
it.

Respondent's characterization of petitioner as a public figure raises a different question. That designation may
rest on either of two alternative bases. In some instances, an individual may achieve such pervasive fame or noto-
riety that he becomes a public figure for all purposes and in all contexts. More commonly, an individual volun-
tarily injects himself or is drawn into a particular public controversy and thereby becomes a public figure for a
limited range of issues. In either case such persons assume special prominence in the resolution of public ques-
tions.

Petitioner has long been active in community and professional affairs. He has served as an officer of local civic
groups and of various professional organizations, and he has published several books and articles on legal sub-
jects. Although petitioner was consequently well known in some circles, he had achieved no general fame or
notoriety in the community. None of the prospective jurors called at the trial had ever heard of petitioner prior
to this litigation, and respondent offered no proof that this response was atypical of the local population. We
would not lightly assume that a citizen's participation in community and professional affairs rendered him a
public figure for all purposes. Absent clear evidence of general fame or notoriety in the community, and perva-
§86 | LIBEL AND DEFAMATION

sive involvement in the affairs of society, an individual should not be deemed a public personality for all aspects
of his life. It is preferable to reduce the public-figure question to a more meaningful context by looking to the
nature and extent of an individual's participation in the particular controversy giving rise to the defamation.

In this context it is plain that petitioner was not a public figure ... We are persuaded that the trial court did not
err in refusing to characterize petitioner as a public figure for the purpose of this litigation.

We therefore conclude that the New York Times standard is inapplicable to this case and that the trial court erred
in entering judgment for respondent. Because the jury was allowed to impose liability without fault and was per-
mitted to presume damages without proof of injury, a new trial is necessary. We reverse and remand for further
proceedings in accord with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Hustler Magazine v. Falwell

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.

Petitioner Hustler Magazine, Inc., is a magazine of nationwide circulation. Respondent Jerry Falwell, a nation-
ally known minister who has been active as a commentator on politics and public affairs, sued petitioner and its
publisher, petitioner Larry Flynt, to recover damages for invasion of privacy, libel, and intentional infliction of
emotional distress. The District Court directed a verdict against respondent on the privacy claim, and submitted
the other two claims to a jury. The jury found for petitioners on the defamation claim, but found for respondent
on the claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress and awarded damages. We now consider whether
this award is consistent with the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.

The inside front cover of the November 1983 issue of Hustler Magazine featured a "parody" of an advertisement
for Campari Liqueur that contained the name and picture of respondent and was entitled "Jerry Falwell talks
about his first time." This parody was modeled after actual Campari ads that included interviews with various
                                                                                                                 LIBEL AND DEFAMATION | 87

celebrities about their "first times." Although it was apparent by the end of each interview that this meant the
first time they sampled Campari, the ads clearly played on the sexual double entendre of the general subject of
"first times." Copying the form and layout of these Campari ads, Hustler's editors chose respondent as the fea-
tured celebrity and drafted an alleged "interview" with him in which he states that his "first time" was during a
drunken incestuous rendezvous with his mother in an outhouse. The Hustler parody portrays respondent and
his mother as drunk and immoral, and suggests that respondent is a hypocrite who preaches only when he is
drunk. In small print at the bottom of the page, the ad contains the disclaimer, "ad parody - not to be taken
seriously." The magazine's table of contents also lists the ad as "Fiction; Ad and Personality Parody."

Soon after the November issue of Hustler became available to the public, respondent brought this diversity
action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia against Hustler Magazine, Inc.,
Larry C. Flynt, and Flynt Distributing Co., Inc. Respondent stated in his complaint that publication of the
ad parody in Hustler entitled him to recover damages for libel, invasion of privacy, and intentional infliction
of emotional distress. The case proceeded to trial. At the close of the evidence, the District Court granted a
directed verdict for petitioners on the invasion of privacy claim. The jury then found against respondent on the
libel claim, specifically finding that the ad parody could not "reasonably be understood as describing actual facts
about [respondent] or actual events in which [he] participated." The jury ruled for respondent on the inten-
tional infliction of emotional distress claim, however, and stated that he should be awarded $100,000 in compen-
satory damages, as well as $50,000 each in punitive damages from petitioners. Petitioners' motion for judgment
notwithstanding the verdict was denied.

On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the judgment against petitioners.
The court rejected petitioners' argument that the "actual malice" standard of New York Times Co. v. Sulli­
van (1964), must be met before respondent can recover for emotional distress. The court agreed that because
respondent is concededly a public figure, petitioners are "entitled to the same level of first amendment protec-
tion in the claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress that they received in [respondent's] claim for
libel." But this does not mean that a literal application of the actual malice rule is appropriate in the context of an
emotional distress claim. * * * The Court of Appeals then went on to reject the contention that because the jury
found that the ad parody did not describe actual facts about respondent, the ad was an opinion that is protected
by the First Amendment. As the court put it, this was "irrelevant," as the issue is "whether [the ad's] publica-
tion was sufficiently outrageous to constitute intentional infliction of emotional distress." Petitioners then filed
a petition for rehearing en banc, but this was denied by a divided court. Given the importance of the constitu-
tional issues involved, we granted certiorari.

This case presents us with a novel question involving First Amendment limitations upon a State's authority to
protect its citizens from the intentional infliction of emotional distress. We must decide whether a public fig-
ure may recover damages for emotional harm caused by the publication of an ad parody offensive to him, and
doubtless gross and repugnant in the eyes of most. Respondent would have us find that a State's interest in pro-
tecting public figures from emotional distress is sufficient to deny First Amendment protection to speech that is
patently offensive and is intended to inflict emotional injury, even when that speech could not reasonably have
been interpreted as stating actual facts about the public figure involved. This we decline to do.
88 | LIBEL AND DEFAMATION

At the heart of the First Amendment is the recognition of the fundamental importance of the free flow of ideas
and opinions on matters of public interest and concern."[T]he freedom to speak one's mind is not only an
aspect of individual liberty - and thus a good unto itself - but also is essential to the common quest for truth
and the vitality of society as a whole." Base Corp v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc. (1984). We have there-
fore been particularly vigilant to ensure that individual expressions of ideas remain free from governmentally
imposed sanctions. The First Amendment recognizes no such thing as a "false" idea. Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.
(1974). As Justice Holmes wrote, "when men have realized that time has upset many fighting faiths, they may
come to believe even more than they believe the very foundations of their own conduct that the ultimate good
desired is better reached by free trade in ideas - that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself
accepted in the competition of the market ..." Abrams v. United States (1919) (dissenting opinion).

The sort of robust political debate encouraged by the First Amendment is bound to produce speech that is crit-
ical of those who hold public office or those public figures who are "intimately involved in the resolution of
important public questions or, by reason of their fame, shape events in areas of concern to society at large." * * *

Of course, this does not mean that any speech about a public figure is immune from sanction in the form of
damages. Since New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964), we have consistently ruled that a public figure may hold
a speaker liable for the damage to reputation caused by publication of a defamatory falsehood, but only if the
statement was made "with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not."
Id. False statements of fact are particularly valueless; they interfere with the truth-seeking function of the mar-
ketplace of ideas, and they cause damage to an individual's reputation that cannot easily be repaired by counter
speech, however persuasive or effective. But even though falsehoods have little value in and of themselves, they
are "nevertheless inevitable in free debate," and a rule that would impose strict liability on a publisher for false
factual assertions would have an undoubted "chilling" effect on speech relating to public figures that does have
constitutional value. "Freedoms of expression require `breathing space.'" This breathing space is provided by a
constitutional rule that allows public figures to recover for libel or defamation only when they can prove both
that the statement was false and that the statement was made with the requisite level of culpability.

Respondent argues, however, that a different standard should apply in this case because here the State seeks to
prevent not reputational damage, but the severe emotional distress suffered by the person who is the subject of
an offensive publication. In respondent's view, and in the view of the Court of Appeals, so long as the utterance
was intended to inflict emotional distress, was outrageous, and did in fact inflict serious emotional distress, it is
of no constitutional import whether the statement was a fact or an opinion, or whether it was true or false. It is
the intent to cause injury that is the gravamen of the tort, and the State's interest in preventing emotional harm
simply outweighs whatever interest a speaker may have in speech of this type.

Generally speaking, the law does not regard the intent to inflict emotional distress as one which should receive
much solicitude, and it is quite understandable that most if not all jurisdictions have chosen to make it civilly
culpable where the conduct in question is sufficiently "outrageous." But in the world of debate about public
affairs, many things done with motives that are less than admirable are protected by the First Amendment. * * *
Thus, while such a bad motive may be deemed controlling for purposes of tort liability in other areas of the law,
we think the First Amendment prohibits such a result in the area of public debate about public figures.
                                                                                                                 LIBEL AND DEFAMATION | 89

Were we to hold otherwise, there can be little doubt that political cartoonists and satirists would be subjected to
damages awards without any showing that their work falsely defamed its subject. Webster's defines a caricature as
"the deliberately distorted picturing or imitating of a person, literary style, etc. by exaggerating features or man-
nerisms for satirical effect." Webster's New Unabridged Twentieth Century Dictionary of the English Language
275 (2d ed. 1979). The appeal of the political cartoon or caricature is often based on exploitation of unfortunate
physical traits or politically embarrassing events - an exploitation often calculated to injure the feelings of the
subject of the portrayal. The art of the cartoonist is often not reasoned or evenhanded, but slashing and one-
sided. One cartoonist expressed the nature of the art in these words:

"The political cartoon is a weapon of attack, of scorn and ridicule and satire; it is least effective when it tries to
pat some politician on the back. It is usually as welcome as a bee sting and is always controversial in some quar-
ters." Long, The Political Cartoon: Journalism's Strongest Weapon, The Quill 56, 57 (Nov. 1962).

Several famous examples of this type of intentionally injurious speech were drawn by Thomas Nast, probably
the greatest American cartoonist to date, who was associated for many years during the post-Civil War era with
Harper's Weekly. In the pages of that publication Nast conducted a graphic vendetta against William M."Boss"
Tweed and his corrupt associates in New York City's "Tweed Ring." It has been described by one historian of
the subject as "a sustained attack which in its passion and effectiveness stands alone in the history of American
graphic art." M. Keller, The Art and Politics of Thomas Nast 177 (1968). Another writer explains that the suc-
cess of the Nast cartoon was achieved "because of the emotional impact of its presentation. It continuously goes
beyond the bounds of good taste and conventional manners." C. Press, The Political Cartoon 251 (1981).

Despite their sometimes caustic nature, from the early cartoon portraying George Washington as an ass down
to the present day, graphic depictions and satirical cartoons have played a prominent role in public and political
debate. Nast's castigation of the Tweed Ring, Walt McDougall's characterization of Presidential candidate James
G. Blaine's banquet with the millionaires at Delmonico's as "The Royal Feast of Belshazzar," and numerous
other efforts have undoubtedly had an effect on the course and outcome of contemporaneous debate. Lincoln's
tall, gangling posture, Teddy Roosevelt's glasses and teeth, and Franklin D. Roosevelt's jutting jaw and cigarette
holder have been memorialized by political cartoons with an effect that could not have been obtained by the
photographer or the portrait artist. From the viewpoint of history, it is clear that our political discourse would
have been considerably poorer without them.

;Respondent contends, however, that the caricature in question here was so "outrageous" as to distinguish it
from more traditional political cartoons. There is no doubt that the caricature of respondent and his mother
published in Hustler is at best a distant cousin of the political cartoons described above, and a rather poor rela-
tion at that. If it were possible by laying down a principled standard to separate the one from the other, public
discourse would probably suffer little or no harm. But we doubt that there is any such standard, and we are quite
sure that the pejorative description "outrageous" does not supply one. "Outrageousness" in the area of political
and social discourse has an inherent subjectiveness about it which would allow a jury to impose liability on the
basis of the jurors' tastes or views, or perhaps on the basis of their dislike of a particular expression. An "out-
rageousness" standard thus runs afoul of our longstanding refusal to allow damages to be awarded because the
speech in question may have an adverse emotional impact on the audience. * * *
90 | LIBEL AND DEFAMATION

Admittedly, these oft-repeated First Amendment principles, like other principles, are subject to limitations. * * *
But the sort of expression involved in this case does not seem to us to be governed by any exception to the general
First Amendment principles stated above.

We conclude that public figures and public officials may not recover for the tort of intentional infliction of emo-
tional distress by reason of publications such as the one here at issue without showing in addition that the pub-
lication contains a false statement of fact which was made with "actual malice," i.e., with knowledge that the
statement was false or with reckless disregard as to whether or not it was true. This is not merely a "blind appli-
cation" of the New York Times standard, it reflects our considered judgment that such a standard is necessary to
give adequate "breathing space" to the freedoms protected by the First Amendment.

Here it is clear that respondent Falwell is a "public figure" for purposes of First Amendment law. The jury found
against respondent on his libel claim when it decided that the Hustler ad parody could not "reasonably be under-
stood as describing actual facts about [respondent] or actual events in which [he] participated." The Court of
Appeals interpreted the jury's finding to be that the ad parody "was not reasonably believable," and in accor-
dance with our custom we accept this finding. Respondent is thus relegated to his claim for damages awarded by
the jury for the intentional infliction of emotional distress by "outrageous" conduct. But for reasons heretofore
stated this claim cannot, consistently with the First Amendment, form a basis for the award of damages when
the conduct in question is the publication of a caricature such as the ad parody involved here. The judgment of
the Court of Appeals is accordingly

Reversed.

OPINION OF THE COURT BY JUSTICE WHITE, ANNOUNCED BY THE CHIEF JUSTICE.

...

The issue in these cases is whether requiring newsmen to appear and testify before state or federal grand juries
abridges the freedom of speech and press guaranteed by the First Amendment. We hold that it does not.

[There were three consolidated cases: Branzburg was a reporter for the Louisville, Kentucky newspaper the
Courier-Journal, who published articles including his observations of people "synthesizing hashish from mari-
huana" and the "drug scene" in Kentucky; Pappas was a television reporter-photographer in Providence, Rhode
Island who gained entrance to a Black Panther headquarters waiting for a police raid that did not occur and did
not write about the incident; and Caldwell was a "reporter for the New York Times assigned to cover the Black
Panther Party" in Northern California. All three were subpoenaed by grand juries].

Petitioners Branzburg and Pappas and respondent Caldwell press First Amendment claims that may be simply
put: that to gather news it is often necessary to agree either not to identify the source of information published
or to publish only part of the facts revealed, or both; that if the reporter is nevertheless forced to reveal these
confidences to a grand jury, the source so identified and other confidential sources of other reporters will be
measurably deterred from furnishing publishable information, all to the detriment of the free flow of informa-
tion protected by the First Amendment. Although the newsmen in these cases do not claim an absolute privi-
lege against official interrogation in all circumstances, they assert that the reporter should not be forced either to
appear or to testify before a grand jury or at trial until and unless sufficient grounds are shown for believing that
the reporter possesses information relevant to a crime the grand jury is investigating, that the information the
reporter has is unavailable from other sources, and that the need for the information is sufficiently compelling to
override the claimed invasion of First Amendment interests occasioned by the disclosure. Principally relied upon
are prior cases emphasizing the importance of the First Amendment guarantees to individual development and
to our system of representative government, decisions requiring that official action with adverse impact on First
Amendment rights be justified by a public interest that is "compelling" or "paramount," and those precedents
92 | PROTECTION OF THE PRESS

establishing the principle that justifiable governmental goals may not be achieved by unduly broad means hav-
ing an unnecessary impact on protected rights of speech, press, or association. The heart of the claim is that the
burden on news gathering resulting from compelling reporters to disclose confidential information outweighs
any public interest in obtaining the information.

We do not question the significance of free speech, press, or assembly to the country's welfare. Nor is it suggested
that news gathering does not qualify for First Amendment protection; without some protection for seeking out
the news, freedom of the press could be eviscerated. But these cases involve no intrusions upon speech or assem-
bly, no prior restraint or restriction on what the press may publish, and no express or implied command that
the press publish what it prefers to withhold. No exaction or tax for the privilege of publishing, and no penalty,
civil or criminal, related to the content of published material is at issue here. The use of confidential sources by
the press is not forbidden or restricted; reporters remain free to seek news from any source by means within the
law. No attempt is made to require the press to publish its sources of information or indiscriminately to disclose
them on request.

The sole issue before us is the obligation of reporters to respond to grand jury subpoenas as other citizens do and
to answer questions relevant to an investigation into the commission of crime. Citizens generally are not consti-
tutionally immune from grand jury subpoenas; and neither the First Amendment nor any other constitutional
provision protects the average citizen from disclosing to a grand jury information that he has received in confi-
dence. The claim is, however, that reporters are exempt from these obligations because if forced to respond to
subpoenas and identify their sources or disclose other confidences, their informants will refuse or be reluctant
to furnish newsworthy information in the future. This asserted burden on news gathering is said to make com-
pelled testimony from newsmen constitutionally suspect and to require a privileged position for them.

* * * The prevailing view is that the press is not free to publish with impunity everything and anything it desires
to publish. Although it may deter or regulate what is said or published, the press may not circulate knowing or
reckless falsehoods damaging to private reputation without subjecting itself to liability for damages, including
punitive damages, or even criminal prosecution. * * *

Despite the fact that news gathering may be hampered, the press is regularly excluded from grand jury proceed-
ings, our own conferences, the meetings of other official bodies gathered in executive session, and the meetings of
private organizations. Newsmen have no constitutional right of access to the scenes of crime or disaster when the
general public is excluded, and they may be prohibited from attending or publishing information about trials if
such restrictions are necessary to assure a defendant a fair trial before an impartial tribunal. * * *

It is thus not surprising that the great weight of authority is that newsmen are not exempt from the normal duty
of appearing before a grand jury and answering questions relevant to a criminal investigation. At common law,
courts consistently refused to recognize the existence of any privilege authorizing a newsman to refuse to reveal
confidential information to a grand jury. * * *

A number of States have provided newsmen a statutory privilege of varying breadth, but the majority have not
done so, and none has been provided by federal statute. Until now the only testimonial privilege for unofficial
                                                                                                              PROTECTION OF THE PRESS | 93

  witnesses that is rooted in the Federal Constitution is the Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-
  incrimination. We are asked to create another by interpreting the First Amendment to grant newsmen a testi-
  monial privilege that other citizens do not enjoy. This we decline to do. * * *

  MR. JUSTICE POWELL, concurring.

  I add this brief statement to emphasize what seems to me to be the limited nature of the Court's holding. The
  Court does not hold that newsmen, subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury, are without constitutional rights
  with respect to the gathering of news or in safeguarding their sources. Certainly, we do not hold, as suggested
  in Mr. Justice Stewart's dissenting opinion, that state and federal authorities are free to "annex" the news media
  as "an investigative arm of government." The solicitude repeatedly shown by this Court for First Amendment
  freedoms should be sufficient assurance against any such effort, even if one seriously believed that the media -
  properly free and untrammeled in the fullest sense of these terms - were not able to protect themselves.

  As indicated in the concluding portion of the opinion, the Court states that no harassment of newsmen will be
  tolerated. If a newsman believes that the grand jury investigation is not being conducted in good faith he is not
  without remedy. Indeed, if the newsman is called upon to give information bearing only a remote and tenuous
  relationship to the subject of the investigation, or if he has some other reason to believe that his testimony impli-
  cates confidential source relationships without a legitimate need of law enforcement, he will have access to the
  court on a motion to quash and an appropriate protective order may be entered. The asserted claim to privilege
  should be judged on its facts by the striking of a proper balance between freedom of the press and the obligation
  of all citizens to give relevant testimony with respect to criminal conduct. The balance of these vital constitu-
  tional and societal interests on a case-by-case basis accords with the tried and traditional way of adjudicating such
  questions.1

  In short, the courts will be available to newsmen under circumstances where legitimate First Amendment inter-
  ests require protection.

  MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting.

  * * * The starting point for decision pretty well marks the range within which the end result lies. The New York
  Times, whose reporting functions are at issue here, takes the amazing position that First Amendment rights are

1. It is to be remembered that Caldwell asserts a constitutional privilege not even to appear before the grand jury unless a court decides
  that the Government has made a showing that meets the three preconditions specified in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Stewart.
  To be sure, this would require a "balancing" of interests by the court, but under circumstances and constraints significantly different
  from the balancing that will be appropriate under the court's decision. The newsman witness, like all other witnesses, will have to
  appear; he will not be in a position to litigate at the threshold the State's very authority to subpoena him. Moreover, absent the constitu­
  tional preconditions that Caldwell and that dissenting opinion would impose as heavy burdens of proof to be carried by the State, the
  court - when called upon to protect a newsman from improper or prejudicial questioning - would be free to balance the competing
  interests on their merits in the particular case. The new constitutional rule endorsed by that dissenting opinion would, as a practical
  matter, defeat such a fair balancing and the essential societal interest in the detection and prosecution of crime would be heavily subor­
  dinated.
94 | PROTECTION OF THE PRESS

to be balanced against other needs or conveniences of government. My belief is that all of the "balancing" was
done by those who wrote the Bill of Rights. By casting the First Amendment in absolute terms, they repudiated
the timid, watered-down, emasculated versions of the First Amendment which both the Government and the
New York Times advance in the case. * * *

I see no way of making mandatory the disclosure of a reporter's confidential source of the information on which
he bases his news story.

The press has a preferred position in our constitutional scheme, not to enable it to make money, not to set news-
men apart as a favored class, but to bring fulfillment to the public's right to know. The right to know is crucial
to the governing powers of the people, to paraphrase Alexander Meiklejohn. Knowledge is essential to informed
decisions. * * *

* * * A reporter is no better than his source of information. Unless he has a privilege to withhold the identity
of his source, he will be the victim of governmental intrigue or aggression. If he can be summoned to testify in
secret before a grand jury, his sources will dry up and the attempted exposure, the effort to enlighten the pub-
lic, will be ended. If what the Court sanctions today becomes settled law, then the reporter's main function in
American society will be to pass on to the public the press releases which the various departments of government
issue. * * *

MR. JUSTICE STEWART, with whom MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN and MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL join,
dissenting.

The Court's crabbed view of the First Amendment reflects a disturbing insensitivity to the critical role of an
independent press in our society. The question whether a reporter has a constitutional right to a confidential
relationship with his source is of first impression here, but the principles that should guide our decision are as
basic as any to be found in the Constitution. While Mr. Justice Powell's enigmatic concurring opinion gives
some hope of a more flexible view in the future, the Court in these cases holds that a newsman has no First
Amendment right to protect his sources when called before a grand jury. The Court thus invites state and fed-
eral authorities to undermine the historic independence of the press by attempting to annex the journalistic
profession as an investigative arm of government. Not only will this decision impair performance of the press'
constitutionally protected functions, but it will, I am convinced, in the long run harm rather than help the
administration of justice.

relevant to a specific probable violation of law; (2) demonstrate that the information sought cannot be obtained
by alternative means less destructive of First Amendment rights; and (3) demonstrate a compelling and overrid-
ing interest in the information.

MR. JUSTICE WHITE DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.

...

On Sunday, April 11, a special edition of the Stanford Daily (Daily), a student newspaper published at Stanford
University, carried articles and photographs devoted to the hospital protest and the violent clash between
demonstrators and police. The photographs carried the byline of a Daily staff member and indicated that he had
been at the east end of the hospital hallway where he could have photographed the assault on the nine officers.
The next day, the Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office secured a warrant from the Municipal Court
for an immediate search of the Daily's offices for negatives, film, and pictures showing the events and occurrences
at the hospital on the evening of April 9. The warrant issued on a finding of "just, probable and reasonable cause
for believing that: Negatives and photographs and films, evidence material and relevant to the identity of the
perpetrators of felonies, to wit, Battery on a Peace Officer, and Assault with Deadly Weapon, will be located [on
the premises of the Daily]." App. 31-32. The warrant affidavit contained no allegation or indication that mem-
bers of the Daily staff were in any way involved in unlawful acts at the hospital.

The search pursuant to the warrant was conducted later that day by four police officers and took place in the
presence of some members of the Daily staff. The Daily's photographic laboratories, filing cabinets, desks, and
wastepaper baskets were searched. Locked drawers and rooms were not opened. The officers apparently had
opportunity to read notes and correspondence during the search; but, contrary to claims of the staff, the officers
96 | PROTECTION OF THE PRESS

denied that they had exceeded the limits of the warrant. They had not been advised by the staff that the areas
they were searching contained confidential materials. The search revealed only the photographs that had already
been published on April 11, and no materials were removed from the Daily's office.

A month later the Daily and various members of its staff, respondents here, brought a civil action in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of California seeking declaratory and injunctive relief under 42
U. S. C. § 1983 against the police officers who conducted the search, the chief of police, the district attorney
and one of his deputies, and the judge who had issued the warrant. The complaint alleged that the search of the
Daily's office had deprived respondents under color of state law of rights secured to them by the First, Fourth,
and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution ...

The issue here is how the Fourth Amendment is to be construed and applied to the "third party" search, the
recurring situation where state authorities have probable cause to believe that fruits, instrumentalities, or other
evidence of crime is located on identified property but do not then have probable cause to believe that the owner
or possessor of the property is himself implicated in the crime that has occurred or is occurring ...

Because the State's interest in enforcing the criminal law and recovering evidence is the same whether the third
party is culpable or not, the premise of the District Court's holding appears to be that state entitlement to a
search warrant depends on the culpability of the owner or possessor of the place to be searched and on the State's
right to arrest him. The cases are to the contrary ... the central purpose of the Fourth Amendment was seen to
be the protection of the individual against official searches for evidence to convict him of a crime. Entries upon
property for civil purposes, where the occupant was suspected of no criminal conduct whatsoever, involved a
more peripheral concern and the less intense "right to be secure from intrusion into personal privacy." Frank v.
Maryland (1959). Such searches could proceed without warrant, as long as the State's interest was sufficiently
substantial. Under this view, the Fourth Amendment was more protective where the place to be searched was
occupied by one suspected of crime and the search was for evidence to use against him ... held that a warrant is
required where entry is sought for civil purposes, as well as when criminal law enforcement is involved. Neither
case, however, suggested that to secure a search warrant the owner or occupant of the place to be inspected or
searched must be suspected of criminal involvement. Indeed, both cases held that a less stringent standard of
probable cause is acceptable where the entry is not to secure evidence of crime against the possessor ...

The critical element in a reasonable search is not that the owner of the property is suspected of crime but that
there is reasonable cause to believe that the specific "things" to be searched for and seized are located on the prop-
erty to which entry is sought ...

Against this background, it is untenable to conclude that property may not be searched unless its occupant is
reasonably suspected of crime and is subject to arrest ... As we understand the structure and language of the
Fourth Amendment and our cases expounding it, valid warrants to search property may be issued when it is sat-
isfactorily demonstrated to the magistrate that fruits, instrumentalities, or evidence of crime is located on the
premises. The Fourth Amendment has itself struck the balance between privacy and public need, and there is no
occasion or justification for a court to revise the Amendment and strike a new balance by denying the search war-
                                                                                                            PROTECTION OF THE PRESS | 97

rant in the circumstances present here and by insisting that the investigation proceed by subpoena duces tecum [a
writ ordering a person to attend court and bring relevant documents], whether on the theory that the latter is a
less intrusive alternative or otherwise.

This is not to question that "reasonableness" is the overriding test of compliance with the Fourth Amendment
or to assert that searches, however or whenever executed, may never be unreasonable if supported by a warrant
issued on probable cause and properly identifying the place to be searched and the property to be seized. We do
hold, however, that the courts may not, in the name of Fourth Amendment reasonableness, prohibit the States
from issuing warrants to search for evidence simply because the owner or possessor of the place to be searched is
not then reasonably suspected of criminal involvement ...

In any event, the reasons presented by the District Court and adopted by the Court of Appeals for arriving at
its remarkable conclusion do not withstand analysis. First, as we have said, it is apparent that whether the third-
party occupant is suspect or not, the State's interest in enforcing the criminal law and recovering the evidence
remains the same; and it is the seeming innocence of the property owner that the District Court relied on to
foreclose the warrant to search. But, as respondents themselves now concede, if the third party knows that con-
traband or other illegal materials are on his property, he is sufficiently culpable to justify the issuance of a search
warrant. Similarly, if his ethical stance is the determining factor, it seems to us that whether or not he knows that
the sought after articles are secreted on his property and whether or not he knows that the articles are in fact the
fruits, instrumentalities, or evidence of crime, he will be so informed when the search warrant is served, and it
is doubtful that he should then be permitted to object to the search, to withhold, if it is there, the evidence of
crime reasonably believed to be possessed by him or secreted on his property, and to forbid the search and insist
that the officers serve him with a subpoena duces tecum.

Second, we are unpersuaded that the District Court's new rule denying search warrants against third parties and
insisting on subpoenas would substantially further privacy interests without seriously undermining law enforce-
ment efforts. Because of the fundamental public interest in implementing the criminal law, the search warrant,
a heretofore effective and constitutionally acceptable enforcement tool, should not be suppressed on the basis
of surmise and without solid evidence supporting the change ... [S]earch warrants are often employed early in
an investigation, perhaps before the identity of any likely criminal and certainly before all the perpetrators are or
could be known. The seemingly blameless third party in possession of the fruits or evidence may not be inno-
cent at all; and if he is, he may nevertheless be so related to or so sympathetic with the culpable that he cannot
be relied upon to retain and preserve the articles that may implicate his friends, or at least not to notify those
who would be damaged by the evidence that the authorities are aware of its location. In any event, it is likely that
the real culprits will have access to the property, and the delay involved in employing the subpoena duces tecum,
offering as it does the opportunity to litigate its validity, could easily result in the disappearance of the evidence,
whatever the good faith of the third party.

Forbidding the warrant and insisting on the subpoena instead when the custodian of the object of the search
is not then suspected of crime, involves hazards to criminal investigation much more serious than the District
Court believed ... At the very least, the burden of justifying a major revision of the Fourth Amendment has not
been carried.
98 | PROTECTION OF THE PRESS

We are also not convinced that the net gain to privacy interests by the District Court's new rule would be worth
the candle. In the normal course of events, search warrants are more difficult to obtain than subpoenas, since
the latter do not involve the judiciary and do not require proof of probable cause. Where, in the real world, sub-
poenas would suffice, it can be expected that they will be employed by the rational prosecutor. On the other
hand, when choice is available under local law and the prosecutor chooses to use the search warrant, it is unlikely
that he has needlessly selected the more difficult course. His choice is more likely to be based on the solid belief,
arrived at through experience but difficult, if not impossible, to sustain in a specific case, that the warranted
search is necessary to secure and to avoid the destruction of evidence ...

Neither the Fourth Amendment nor the cases requiring consideration of First Amendment values in issuing
search warrants, however, call for imposing the regime ordered by the District Court. Aware of the long struggle
between Crown and press and desiring to curb unjustified official intrusions, the Framers took the enormously
important step of subjecting searches to the test of reasonableness and to the general rule requiring search war-
rants issued by neutral magistrates. They nevertheless did not forbid warrants where the press was involved, did
not require special showings that subpoenas would be impractical, and did not insist that the owner of the place
to be searched, if connected with the press, must be shown to be implicated in the offense being investigated.
Further, the prior cases do no more than insist that the courts apply the warrant requirements with particu-
lar exactitude when First Amendment interests would be endangered by the search. As we see it, no more than
this is required where the warrant requested is for the seizure of criminal evidence reasonably believed to be on
the premises occupied by a newspaper. Properly administered, the preconditions for a warrant-probable cause,
specificity with respect to the place to be searched and the things to be seized, and overall reasonableness-should
afford sufficient protection against the harms that are assertedly threatened by warrants for searching newspaper
offices ...

We note finally that if the evidence sought by warrant is sufficiently connected with the crime to satisfy the
probable cause requirement, it will very likely be sufficiently relevant to justify a subpoena and to withstand a
motion to quash. Further, Fifth Amendment and state shield-law objections that might be asserted in opposi-
tion to compliance with a subpoena are largely irrelevant to determining the legality of a search warrant under
the Fourth Amendment. Of course, the Fourth Amendment does not prevent or advise against legislative or
executive efforts to establish non constitutional protections against possible abuses of the search warrant proce-
dure, but we decline to reinterpret the Amendment to impose a general constitutional barrier against warrants
to search newspaper premises, to require resort to subpoenas as a general rule, or to demand prior notice and
hearing in connection with the issuance of search warrants ...
                                                                                                            PROTECTION OF THE PRESS | 99

We accordingly reject the reasons given by the District Court and adopted by the Court of Appeals for holding
the search for photographs at the Stanford Daily to have been unreasonable within the meaning of the Fourth
Amendment and in violation of the First Amendment. Nor has anything else presented here persuaded us that
the Amendments forbade this search.
It follows that the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.
So ordered.

[JUSTICE BLACK DISSENTED WITHOUT OPINION.]

JUSTICE CLARK DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.

This federal habeas corpus application involves the question whether Sheppard was deprived of a fair trial in his
state conviction for the second-degree murder of his wife because of the trial judge's failure to protect Sheppard
sufficiently from the massive, pervasive and prejudicial publicity that attended his prosecution ...

Marilyn Sheppard, petitioner's pregnant wife, was bludgeoned to death in the upstairs bedroom of their
lakeshore home in Bay Village, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland ... [on July 4, 1954] ...

From the outset, officials focused suspicion on Sheppard. After a search of the house and premises on the morn-
ing of the tragedy, Dr. Gerber, the Coroner, is reported -- and it is undenied -- to have told his men, "Well, it
is evident the doctor did this, so let's go get the confession out of him." He proceeded to interrogate and exam-
ine Sheppard while the latter was under sedation in his hospital room. On the same occasion, the Coroner was
given the clothes Sheppard wore at the time of the tragedy, together with the personal items in them. Later that,
afternoon Chief Eaton and two Cleveland police officers interrogated Sheppard at some length, confronting him
with evidence, and demanding explanations. Asked by Officer Shotke to take a lie detector test, Sheppard said he
would if it were reliable. Shotke replied that it was "infallible," and "you might as well tell us all about it now."
At the end of the interrogation, Shotke told Sheppard: "I think you killed your wife." Still later in the same after-
noon, a physician sent by the Coroner was permitted to make a detailed examination of Sheppard. Until the
Coroner's inquest on July 22, at which time he was subpoenaed, Sheppard made himself available for frequent
and extended questioning without the presence of an attorney.

On July 7, the day of Marilyn Sheppard's funeral, a newspaper story appeared in which Assistant County Attor-
ney Mahon - later the chief prosecutor of Sheppard - sharply criticized the refusal of the Sheppard family to
permit his immediate questioning. From there on headline stories repeatedly stressed Sheppard's lack of coop-
eration with the police and other officials. Under the headline "Testify Now In Death, Bay Doctor Is Ordered,"
one story described a visit by Coroner Gerber and four police officers to the hospital on July 8. When Shep-
                                                                              PRESS ACCESS TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROCESS | 101

pard insisted that his lawyer be present, the Coroner wrote out a subpoena and served it on him. Sheppard then
agreed to submit to questioning without counsel and the subpoena was torn up. The officers questioned him
for several hours. On July 9, Sheppard, at the request of the Coroner, re-enacted the tragedy at his home before
the Coroner, police officers, and a group of newsmen, who apparently were invited by the Coroner. The home
was locked so that Sheppard was obliged to wait outside until the Coroner arrived. Sheppard's performance
was reported in detail by the news media along with photographs. The newspapers also played up Sheppard's
refusal to take a lie detector test and "the protective ring" thrown up by his family. Front-page newspaper head-
lines announced on the same day that "Doctor Balks At Lie Test; Retells Story." A column opposite that story
contained an "exclusive" interview with Sheppard headlined: "`Loved My Wife, She Loved Me,' Sheppard Tells
News Reporter." The next day, another headline story disclosed that Sheppard had "again late yesterday refused
to take a lie detector test" and quoted an Assistant County Attorney as saying that "at the end of a nine-hour
questioning of Dr. Sheppard, I felt he was now ruling [a test] out completely." But subsequent newspaper arti-
cles reported that the Coroner was still pushing Sheppard for a lie detector test. More stories appeared when
Sheppard would not allow authorities to inject him with "truth serum."

On the 20th, the "editorial artillery" opened fire with a front-page charge that somebody is "getting away with
murder." The editorial attributed the ineptness of the investigation to "friendships, relationships, hired lawyers,
a husband who ought to have been subjected instantly to the same third-degree to which any other person under
similar circumstances is subjected. ..." The following day, July 21, another page-one editorial was headed: "Why
No Inquest? Do It Now, Dr. Gerber." The Coroner called an inquest the same day and subpoenaed Sheppard. It
was staged the next day in a school gymnasium; the Coroner presided with the County Prosecutor as his advisor
and two detectives as bailiffs. In the front of the room was a long table occupied by reporters, television and radio
personnel, and broadcasting equipment. The hearing was broadcast with live microphones placed at the Coro-
ner's seat and the witness stand. A swarm of reporters and photographers attended. Sheppard was brought into
the room by police who searched him in full view of several hundred spectators. Sheppard's counsel were present
during the three-day inquest but were not permitted to participate. When Sheppard's chief counsel attempted
to place some documents in the record, he was forcibly ejected from the room by the Coroner, who received
cheers, hugs, and kisses from ladies in the audience. Sheppard was questioned for five and one-half hours about
his actions on the night of the murder, his married life, and a love affair with Susan Hayes. At the end of the
hearing the Coroner announced that he "could" order Sheppard held for the grand jury, but did not do so.

Throughout this period the newspapers emphasized evidence that tended to incriminate Sheppard and pointed
out discrepancies in his statements to authorities. At the same time, Sheppard made many public statements to
the press and wrote feature articles asserting his innocence. During the inquest on July 26, a headline in large
type stated: "Kerr [Captain of the Cleveland Police] Urges Sheppard's Arrest." In the story, Detective McArthur
"disclosed that scientific tests at the Sheppard home have definitely established that the killer washed off a trail
of blood from the murder bedroom to the downstairs section," a circumstance casting doubt on Sheppard's
accounts of the murder. No such evidence was produced at trial. The newspapers also delved into Sheppard's
personal life. Articles stressed his extramarital love affairs as a motive for the crime. The newspapers portrayed
102 | PRESS ACCESS TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROCESS

Sheppard as a Lothario, fully explored his relationship with Susan Hayes, and named a number of other women
who were allegedly involved with him. The testimony at trial never showed that Sheppard had any illicit relation-
ships besides the one with Susan Hayes.

On July 28, an editorial entitled "Why Don't Police Quiz Top Suspect" demanded that Sheppard be taken to
police headquarters. It described him in the following language:

"Now proved under oath to be a liar, still free to go about his business, shielded by his family, protected by a
smart lawyer who has made monkeys of the police and authorities, carrying a gun part of the time, left free to do
whatever he pleases. ..."

A front-page editorial on July 30 asked: "Why Isn't Sam Sheppard in Jail?" It was later titled "Quit Stalling -
Bring Him In." After calling Sheppard "the most unusual murder suspect ever seen around these parts" the
article said that "[e]xcept for some superficial questioning during Coroner Sam Gerber's inquest he has been
scot-free of any official grilling. ..." It asserted that he was "surrounded by an iron curtain of protection [and]
concealment."

That night at 10 o'clock Sheppard was arrested at his father's home on a charge of murder. He was taken to
the Bay Village City Hall where hundreds of people, newscasters, photographers and reporters were awaiting his
arrival. He was immediately arraigned - having been denied a temporary delay to secure the presence of counsel
- and bound over to the grand jury ... the Court has also pointed out that "[l]egal trials are not like elections, to
be won through the use of the meeting-hall, the radio, and the newspaper." And the Court has insisted that no
one be punished for a crime without "a charge fairly made and fairly tried in a public tribunal free of prejudice,
passion, excitement, and tyrannical power." "Freedom of discussion should be given the widest range compati-
ble with the essential requirement of the fair and orderly administration of justice." But it must not be allowed
to divert the trial from the "very purpose of a court system ... to adjudicate controversies, both criminal and civil,
in the calmness and solemnity of the courtroom according to legal procedures." Among these "legal procedures"
is the requirement that the jury's verdict be based on evidence received in open court, not from outside sources
...

Sheppard was not granted a change of venue to a locale away from where the publicity originated; nor was his
jury sequestered ... Sheppard jurors were subjected to newspaper, radio and television coverage of the trial while
not taking part in the proceedings. They were allowed to go their separate ways outside of the courtroom, with-
out adequate directions not to read or listen to anything concerning the case. The judge's "admonitions" at the
beginning of the trial are representative ...

At intervals during the trial, the judge simply repeated his "suggestions" and "requests" that the jurors not
expose themselves to comment upon the case. Moreover, the jurors were thrust into the role of celebrities by the
judge's failure to insulate them from reporters and photographers. The numerous pictures of the jurors, with
their addresses, which appeared in the newspapers before and during the trial itself exposed them to expressions
of opinion from both cranks and friends. The fact that anonymous letters had been received by prospective
jurors should have made the judge aware that this publicity seriously threatened the jurors' privacy ...
                                                                              PRESS ACCESS TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROCESS | 103

Sheppard stood indicted for the murder of his wife; the State was demanding the death penalty. For months the
virulent publicity about Sheppard and the murder had made the case notorious. Charges and countercharges
were aired in the news media besides those for which Sheppard was called to trial ... The inquest was televised
live from a high school gymnasium seating hundreds of people. Furthermore, the trial began two weeks before
a hotly contested election at which both Chief Prosecutor Mahon and Judge Blythin were candidates for judge-
ships.

While we cannot say that Sheppard was denied due process by the judge's refusal to take precautions against the
influence of pretrial publicity alone, the court's later rulings must be considered against the setting in which the
trial was held. In light of this background, we believe that the arrangements made by the judge with the news
media caused Sheppard to be deprived of that "judicial serenity and calm to which [he] was entitled." Estes v.
Texas (1965). The fact is that bedlam reigned at the courthouse during the trial and newsmen took over practi-
cally the entire courtroom, hounding most of the participants in the trial, especially Sheppard. At a temporary
table within a few feet of the jury box and counsel table sat some 20 reporters staring at Sheppard and taking
notes. The erection of a press table for reporters inside the bar is unprecedented. The bar of the court is reserved
for counsel, providing them a safe place in which to keep papers and exhibits, and to confer privately with client
and co-counsel. It is designed to protect the witness and the jury from any distractions, intrusions or influences,
and to permit bench discussions of the judge's rulings away from the hearing of the public and the jury. Having
assigned almost all of the available seats in the courtroom to the news media the judge lost his ability to super-
vise that environment. The movement of the reporters in and out of the courtroom caused frequent confusion
and disruption of the trial. And the record reveals constant commotion within the bar. Moreover, the judge gave
the throng of newsmen gathered in the corridors of the courthouse absolute free rein. Participants in the trial,
including the jury, were forced to run a gantlet of reporters and photographers each time they entered or left the
courtroom. The total lack of consideration for the privacy of the jury was demonstrated by the assignment to
a broadcasting station of space next to the jury room on the floor above the courtroom, as well as the fact that
jurors were allowed to make telephone calls during their five-day deliberation.

There can be no question about the nature of the publicity which surrounded Sheppard's trial ... Indeed, every
court that has considered this case, save the court that tried it, has deplored the manner in which the news media
inflamed and prejudiced the public.

Much of the material printed or broadcast during the trial was never heard from the witness stand, such as the
charges that Sheppard had purposely impeded the murder investigation and must be guilty since he had hired a
prominent criminal lawyer; that Sheppard was a perjurer; that he had sexual relations with numerous women;
that his slain wife had characterized him as a "Jekyll-Hyde"; that he was "a bare-faced liar" because of his testi-
mony as to police treatment; and, finally, that a woman convict claimed Sheppard to be the father of her illegiti-
mate child. As the trial progressed, the newspapers summarized and interpreted the evidence, devoting particular
attention to the material that incriminated Sheppard, and often drew unwarranted inferences from testimony.
At one point, a front-page picture of Mrs. Sheppard's blood-stained pillow was published after being "doctored"
to show more clearly an alleged imprint of a surgical instrument.

Nor is there doubt that this deluge of publicity reached at least some of the jury ...
104 | PRESS ACCESS TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROCESS

The court's fundamental error is compounded by the holding that it lacked power to control the publicity about
the trial. From the very inception of the proceedings the judge announced that neither he nor anyone else could
restrict prejudicial news accounts. And he reiterated this view on numerous occasions. Since he viewed the news
media as his target, the judge never considered other means that are often utilized to reduce the appearance of
prejudicial material and to protect the jury from outside influence. We conclude that these procedures would
have been sufficient to guarantee Sheppard a fair trial and so do not consider what sanctions might be available
against a recalcitrant press nor the charges of bias now made against the state trial judge.

The carnival atmosphere at trial could easily have been avoided since the courtroom and courthouse premises
are subject to the control of the court. As we stressed in Estes, the presence of the press at judicial proceedings
must be limited when it is apparent that the accused might otherwise be prejudiced or disadvantaged. Bearing in
mind the massive pretrial publicity, the judge should have adopted stricter rules governing the use of the court-
room by newsmen, as Sheppard's counsel requested. The number of reporters in the courtroom itself could have
been limited at the first sign that their presence would disrupt the trial. They certainly should not have been
placed inside the bar. Furthermore, the judge should have more closely regulated the conduct of newsmen in the
courtroom. For instance, the judge belatedly asked them not to handle and photograph trial exhibits lying on
the counsel table during recesses.

Secondly, the court should have insulated the witnesses. All of the newspapers and radio stations apparently
interviewed prospective witnesses at will, and in many instances disclosed their testimony. A typical example was
the publication of numerous statements by Susan Hayes, before her appearance in court, regarding her love affair
with Sheppard. Although the witnesses were barred from the courtroom during the trial the full verbatim testi-
mony was available to them in the press. This completely nullified the judge's imposition of the rule.

Thirdly, the court should have made some effort to control the release of leads, information, and gossip to the
press by police officers, witnesses, and the counsel for both sides. Much of the information thus disclosed was
inaccurate, leading to groundless rumors and confusion. That the judge was aware of his responsibility in this
respect may be seen from his warning to Steve Sheppard, the accused's brother, who had apparently made public
statements in an attempt to discredit testimony for the prosecution ...

Defense counsel immediately brought to the court's attention the tremendous amount of publicity in the Cleve-
land press that "misrepresented entirely the testimony" in the case. Under such circumstances, the judge should
have at least warned the newspapers to check the accuracy of their accounts. And it is obvious that the judge
should have further sought to alleviate this problem by imposing control over the statements made to the news
media by counsel, witnesses, and especially the Coroner and police officers. The prosecution repeatedly made
evidence available to the news media which was never offered in the trial. Much of the "evidence" disseminated
in this fashion was clearly inadmissible. The exclusion of such evidence in court is rendered meaningless when
news media make it available to the public. For example, the publicity about Sheppard's refusal to take a lie detec-
tor test came directly from police officers and the Coroner. The story that Sheppard had been called a "Jekyll-
Hyde" personality by his wife was attributed to a prosecution witness. No such testimony was given. The further
                                                                              PRESS ACCESS TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROCESS | 105

report that there was "a `bombshell witness' on tap" who would testify as to Sheppard's "fiery temper" could
only have emanated from the prosecution. Moreover, the newspapers described in detail clues that had been
found by the police, but not put into the record.

The fact that many of the prejudicial news items can be traced to the prosecution, as well as the defense, aggra-
vates the judge's failure to take any action. Effective control of these sources - concededly within the court's
power - might well have prevented the divulgence of inaccurate information, rumors, and accusations that made
up much of the inflammatory publicity, at least after Sheppard's indictment.

...

Being advised of the great public interest in the case, the mass coverage of the press, and the potential prejudicial
impact of publicity, the court could also have requested the appropriate city and county officials to promulgate a
regulation with respect to dissemination of information about the case by their employees. In addition, reporters
who wrote or broadcast prejudicial stories, could have been warned as to the impropriety of publishing material
not introduced in the proceedings. The judge was put on notice of such events by defense counsel's complaint
about the WHK broadcast on the second day of trial. In this manner, Sheppard's right to a trial free from outside
interference would have been given added protection without corresponding curtailment of the news media.
Had the judge, the other officers of the court, and the police placed the interest of justice first, the news media
would have soon learned to be content with the task of reporting the case as it unfolded in the courtroom - not
pieced together from extrajudicial statements.

From the cases coming here we note that unfair and prejudicial news comment on pending trials has become
increasingly prevalent. Due process requires that the accused receive a trial by an impartial jury free from outside
influences. Given the pervasiveness of modern communications and the difficulty of effacing prejudicial public-
ity from the minds of the jurors, the trial courts must take strong measures to ensure that the balance is never
weighed against the accused. And appellate tribunals have the duty to make an independent evaluation of the
circumstances. Of course, there is nothing that proscribes the press from reporting events that transpire in the
courtroom. But where there is a reasonable likelihood that prejudicial news prior to trial will prevent a fair trial,
the judge should continue the case until the threat abates, or transfer it to another county not so permeated
with publicity. In addition, sequestration of the jury was something the judge should have raised sua sponte with
counsel. If publicity during the proceedings threatens the fairness of the trial, a new trial should be ordered. But
we must remember that reversals are but palliatives; the cure lies in those remedial measures that will prevent the
prejudice at its inception. The courts must take such steps by rule and regulation that will protect their processes
from prejudicial outside interferences. Neither prosecutors, counsel for defense, the accused, witnesses, court
staff nor enforcement officers coming under the jurisdiction of the court should be permitted to frustrate its
function. Collaboration between counsel and the press as to information affecting the fairness of a criminal trial
is not only subject to regulation, but is highly censurable and worthy of disciplinary measures.

Since the state trial judge did not fulfill his duty to protect Sheppard from the inherently prejudicial publicity
which saturated the community and to control disruptive influences in the courtroom, we must reverse the
§106 | PRESS ACCESS TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROCESS

denial of the habeas petition. The case is remanded to the District Court with instructions to issue the writ and
order that Sheppard be released from custody unless the State puts him to its charges again within a reasonable
time.

It is so ordered.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.

...

On the evening of October 18, 1975, local police found the six members of the Henry Kellie family murdered in
their home in Sutherland, Neb., a town of about 850 people. Police released the description of a suspect, Erwin
Charles Simants, to the reporters who had hastened to the scene of the crime. Simants was arrested and arraigned
in Lincoln County Court the following morning, ending a tense night for this small rural community.

The crime immediately attracted widespread news coverage, by local, regional, and national newspapers, radio
and television stations ... [A broad initial order prohibiting reporting was later amended by the Nebraska
Supreme Court and] prohibited reporting of only three matters: (a) the existence and nature of any confessions
or admissions made by the defendant to law enforcement officers, (b) any confessions or admissions made to
any third parties, except members of the press, and (c) other facts "strongly implicative" of the accused. The
Nebraska Supreme Court did not rely on the Nebraska Bar-Press Guidelines. After construing Nebraska law to
permit closure in certain circumstances, the court remanded the case to the District Judge for reconsideration of
the issue whether pretrial hearings should be closed to the press and public ...
                                                                              PRESS ACCESS TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROCESS | 107

The order at issue in this case expired by its own terms when the jury was impaneled on January 7, 1976. There
were no restraints on publication once the jury was selected, and there are now no restrictions on what may be
spoken or written about the Simants case. Intervenor Simants argues that for this reason the case is moot ... [We]
conclude that this case is not moot, and proceed to the merits.

The problems presented by this case are almost as old as the Republic. Neither in the Constitution nor in con-
temporaneous writings do we find that the conflict between these two important rights was anticipated, yet it
is inconceivable that the authors of the Constitution were unaware of the potential conflicts between the right
to an unbiased jury and the guarantee of freedom of the press. The unusually able lawyers who helped write the
Constitution and later drafted the Bill of Rights were familiar with the historic episode in which John Adams
defended British soldiers charged with homicide for firing into a crowd of Boston demonstrators; they were inti-
mately familiar with the clash of the adversary system and the part that passions of the populace sometimes play
in influencing potential jurors. They did not address themselves directly to the situation presented by this case;
their chief concern was the need for freedom of expression in the political arena and the dialogue in ideas. But
they recognized that there were risks to private rights from an unfettered press ...

The speed of communication and the pervasiveness of the modern news media have exacerbated these problems,
however, as numerous appeals demonstrate. The trial of Bruno Hauptmann in a small New Jersey community
for the abduction and murder of the Charles Lindberghs' infant child probably was the most widely covered trial
up to that time, and the nature of the coverage produced widespread public reaction. Criticism was directed at
the "carnival" atmosphere that pervaded the community and the courtroom itself. Responsible leaders of press
and the legal profession - including other judges - pointed out that much of this sorry performance could have
been controlled by a vigilant trial judge and by other public officers subject to the control of the court.

The excesses of press and radio and lack of responsibility of those in authority in the Hauptmann case and others
of that era led to efforts to develop voluntary guidelines for courts, lawyers, press, and broadcasters. The effort
was renewed in 1965 when the American Bar Association embarked on a project to develop standards for all
aspects of criminal justice, including guidelines to accommodate the right to a fair trial and the rights of a free
press. See Powell, The Right to a Fair Trial, 51 A. B. A. J. 534 (1965) [Lewis Powell was then president of the
ABA; he joined the Court as an Associate Justice in 1972]. The resulting standards, approved by the Association
in 1968, received support from most of the legal profession. American Bar Association Project on Standards for
Criminal Justice, Fair Trial and Free Press (Approved Draft 1968). Other groups have undertaken similar studies
...

In practice, of course, even the most ideal guidelines are subjected to powerful strains when a case such as
Simants' arises, with reporters from many parts of the country on the scene. Reporters from distant places are
unlikely to consider themselves bound by local standards. They report to editors outside the area covered by the
guidelines, and their editors are likely to be guided only by their own standards. To contemplate how a state
court can control acts of a newspaper or broadcaster outside its jurisdiction, even though the newspapers and
broadcasts reach the very community from which jurors are to be selected, suggests something of the practical
difficulties of managing such guidelines ...
108 | PRESS ACCESS TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROCESS

The First Amendment provides that "Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom ... of the press," and
it is "no longer open to doubt that the liberty of the press, and of speech, is within the liberty safeguarded by
the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from invasion by state action." Near v. Minnesota ex rel.
Olson (1931). The Court has interpreted these guarantees to afford special protection against orders that pro-
hibit the publication or broadcast of particular information or commentary - orders that impose a "previous"
or "prior" restraint on speech. None of our decided cases on prior restraint involved restrictive orders entered to
protect a defendant's right to a fair and impartial jury, but the opinions on prior restraint have a common thread
relevant to this case ...

The thread running through all these cases is that prior restraints on speech and publication are the most serious
and the least tolerable infringement on First Amendment rights. A criminal penalty or a judgment in a defama-
tion case is subject to the whole panoply of protections afforded by deferring the impact of the judgment until
all avenues of appellate review have been exhausted. Only after judgment has become final, correct or otherwise,
does the law's sanction become fully operative.

A prior restraint, by contrast and by definition, has an immediate and irreversible sanction. If it can be said that
a threat of criminal or civil sanctions after publication "chills" speech, prior restraint "freezes" it at least for the
time.

The damage can be particularly great when the prior restraint falls upon the communication of news and com-
mentary on current events. Truthful reports of public judicial proceedings have been afforded special protection
against subsequent punishment. For the same reasons the protection against prior restraint should have particu-
lar force as applied to reporting of criminal proceedings, whether the crime in question is a single isolated act or
a pattern of criminal conduct ...

... The extraordinary protections afforded by the First Amendment carry with them something in the nature of a
fiduciary duty to exercise the protected rights responsibly - a duty widely acknowledged but not always observed
by editors and publishers. It is not asking too much to suggest that those who exercise First Amendment rights
in newspapers or broadcasting enterprises direct some effort to protect the rights of an accused to a fair trial by
unbiased jurors.

Of course, the order at issue - like the order requested in New York Times - does not prohibit but only post-
pones publication. Some news can be delayed and most commentary can even more readily be delayed without
serious injury, and there often is a self-imposed delay when responsible editors call for verification of informa-
tion. But such delays are normally slight and they are self-imposed. Delays imposed by governmental authority
are a different matter ...

The authors of the Bill of Rights did not undertake to assign priorities as between First Amendment and Sixth
Amendment rights, ranking one as superior to the other. In this case, the petitioners would have us declare the
right of an accused subordinate to their right to publish in all circumstances. But if the authors of these guaran-
tees, fully aware of the potential conflicts between them, were unwilling or unable to resolve the issue by assign-
ing to one priority over the other, it is not for us to rewrite the Constitution by undertaking what they declined
to do. It is unnecessary, after nearly two centuries, to establish a priority applicable in all circumstances. Yet it is
                                                                              PRESS ACCESS TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROCESS | 109

nonetheless clear that the barriers to prior restraint remain high unless we are to abandon what the Court has
said for nearly a quarter of our national existence and implied throughout all of it. The history of even wartime
suspension of categorical guarantees, such as habeas corpus or the right to trial by civilian courts, see Ex parte
Milligan (1867), cautions against suspending explicit guarantees ...

Finally, another feature of this case leads us to conclude that the restrictive order entered here is not supportable
... [The final order] enjoined reporting of (1) "[c]onfessions or admissions against interest made by the accused
to law enforcement officials"; (2) "[c]onfessions or admissions against interest, oral or written, if any, made by
the accused to third parties, excepting any statements, if any, made by the accused to representatives of the news
media"; and (3) all "[o]ther information strongly implicative of the accused as the perpetrator of the slayings."

To the extent that this order prohibited the reporting of evidence adduced at the open preliminary hearing, it
plainly violated settled principles: "[T]here is nothing that proscribes the press from reporting events that tran-
spire in the courtroom." Sheppard v. Maxwell (1966). The County Court could not know that closure of the
preliminary hearing was an alternative open to it until the Nebraska Supreme Court so construed state law; but
once a public hearing had been held, what transpired there could not be subject to prior restraint.

The third prohibition of the order was defective in another respect as well. As part of a final order, entered after
plenary review, this prohibition regarding "implicative" information is too vague and too broad to survive the
scrutiny we have given to restraints on First Amendment rights. The third phase of the order entered falls out-
side permissible limits.

The record demonstrates, as the Nebraska courts held, that there was indeed a risk that pretrial news accounts,
true or false, would have some adverse impact on the attitudes of those who might be called as jurors. But on
the record now before us it is not clear that further publicity, unchecked, would so distort the views of potential
jurors that 12 could not be found who would, under proper instructions, fulfill their sworn duty to render a just
verdict exclusively on the evidence presented in open court. We cannot say on this record that alternatives to a
prior restraint on petitioners would not have sufficiently mitigated the adverse effects of pretrial publicity so as
to make prior restraint unnecessary. Nor can we conclude that the restraining order actually entered would serve
its intended purpose. Reasonable minds can have few doubts about the gravity of the evil pretrial publicity can
work, but the probability that it would do so here was not demonstrated with the degree of certainty our cases
on prior restraint require.

Of necessity our holding is confined to the record before us. But our conclusion is not simply a result of assessing
the adequacy of the showing made in this case; it results in part from the problems inherent in meeting the heavy
burden of demonstrating, in advance of trial, that without prior restraint a fair trial will be denied. The practi-
cal problems of managing and enforcing restrictive orders will always be present. In this sense, the record now
before us is illustrative rather than exceptional. It is significant that when this Court has reversed a state con-
viction because of prejudicial publicity, it has carefully noted that some course of action short of prior restraint
would have made a critical difference. However difficult it may be, we need not rule out the possibility of show-
§110 | PRESS ACCESS TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROCESS

ing the kind of threat to fair trial rights that would possess the requisite degree of certainty to justify restraint.
This Court has frequently denied that First Amendment rights are absolute and has consistently rejected the
proposition that a prior restraint can never be employed.

Our analysis ends as it began, with a confrontation between prior restraint imposed to protect one vital con-
stitutional guarantee and the explicit command of another that the freedom to speak and publish shall not be
abridged. We reaffirm that the guarantees of freedom of expression are not an absolute prohibition under all cir-
cumstances, but the barriers to prior restraint remain high and the presumption against its use continues intact.
We hold that, with respect to the order entered in this case prohibiting reporting or commentary on judicial pro-
ceedings held in public, the barriers have not been overcome; to the extent that this order restrained publication
of such material, it is clearly invalid. To the extent that it prohibited publication based on information gained
from other sources, we conclude that the heavy burden imposed as a condition to securing a prior restraint was
not met and the judgment of the Nebraska Supreme Court is therefore

Reversed.

(Closing off a trial to the public and the press violates the First Amendment).

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which
MR. JUSTICE WHITE and MR. JUSTICE STEVENS joined.

The narrow question presented in this case is whether the right of the public and press to attend criminal trials
is guaranteed under the United States Constitution.

In March 1976, one Stevenson was indicted for the murder of a hotel manager who had been found stabbed to
death on December 2, 1975. Tried promptly in July 1976, Stevenson was convicted of second-degree murder in
the Circuit Court of Hanover County, Va.
                                                                               PRESS ACCESS TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROCESS | 111

The Virginia Supreme Court reversed the conviction in October 1977, holding that a bloodstained shirt pur-
portedly belonging to Stevenson had been improperly admitted into evidence ... Stevenson was retried in the
same court. This second trial ended in a mistrial ... A third trial, which began in the same court on June 6, 1978,
also ended in a mistrial ...

Stevenson was tried in the same court for a fourth time beginning on September 11, 1978. Present in the court-
room when the case was called were appellants Wheeler and McCarthy, reporters for appellant Richmond News-
papers, Inc. Before the trial began, counsel for the defendant moved that it be closed to the public ... The trial
judge, who had presided over two of the three previous trials, asked if the prosecution had any objection to clear-
ing the courtroom. The prosecutor stated he had no objection and would leave it to the discretion of the court.

Presumably referring to Va. Code § 19.2-266 (Supp. 1980), the trial judge then announced."[T]he statute gives
me that power specifically and the defendant has made the motion." He then ordered "that the Courtroom be
kept clear of all parties except the witnesses when they testify" Tr., supra, at 4-5.2 The record does not show that
any objections to the closure order were made by anyone present at the time, including appellants Wheeler and
McCarthy.

Later that same day, however, appellants sought a hearing on a motion to vacate the closure order. The trial
judge granted the request and scheduled a hearing to follow the close of the day's proceedings. When the hearing
began, the court ruled that the hearing was to be treated as part of the trial, accordingly, he again ordered the
reporters to leave the courtroom, and they complied.

At the closed hearing, counsel for appellants observed that no evidentiary findings had been made by the court
prior to the entry of its closure order and pointed out that the court had failed to consider any other, less drastic
measures within its power to ensure a fair trial ...

What transpired when the closed trial resumed the next day was disclosed in the following manner by an order
of the court entered September 12, 1978."[I]n the absence of the jury, the defendant by counsel made a Motion
that a mistrial be declared, which motion was taken under advisement" ...

"At the conclusion of the Commonwealth's evidence, the attorney for the defendant moved the Court to strike
the Commonwealth's evidence on grounds stated to the record, which Motion was sustained by the Court."

"And the jury having been excused, the Court doth find the accused NOT GUILTY of Murder, as charged in
the Indictment, and he was allowed to depart."

On September 27, 1978, the trial court granted appellants' motion to intervene nunc pro tunc [changing back
to an earlier date of an order] in the Stevenson case. Appellants then petitioned the Virginia Supreme Court for
writs of mandamus and prohibition and filed an appeal from the trial court's closure order. On July 9, 1979,
the Virginia Supreme Court dismissed the mandamus and prohibition petitions and, finding no reversible error,
denied the petition for appeal.
112 | PRESS ACCESS TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROCESS

Appellants then sought review in this Court, invoking both our appellate and certiorari jurisdiction ... We con-
clude that jurisdiction by appeal does not lie; however, treating the filed papers as a petition for a writ of certio-
rari ... we grant the petition.

The criminal trial which appellants sought to attend has long since ended, and there is thus some suggestion that
the case is moot. This Court has frequently recognized, however, that its jurisdiction is not necessarily defeated
by the practical termination of a contest which is short-lived by nature ... If the underlying dispute is "capable of
petition, yet evading review," it is not moot. Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. ICC (1911).

Since the Virginia Supreme Court declined plenary review, it is reasonably foreseeable that other trials may be
closed by other judges without any more showing of need than is presented on this record. More often than not,
criminal trials will be of sufficiently short duration that a closure order "will evade review, or at least considered
plenary review in this Court." Nebraska Press Assn v. Stuart (1976). Accordingly, we turn to the merits.

...

In prior cases the Court has treated questions involving conflicts between publicity and a defendant's right to a
fair trial, as we observed in Nebraska Press Assn. v Stuart ... But here for the first time the Court is asked to decide
whether a criminal trial itself may be closed to the public upon the unopposed request of a defendant, without
any demonstration that closure is required to protect the defendant's superior right to a fair trial, or that some
other overriding consideration requires closure ...

As we have shown, and was shown in both the Court's opinion and the dissent in Gannett Co., Inc. v.
DePasquale (1979), the historical evidence demonstrates conclusively that at the time when our organic laws
were adopted, criminal trials both here and in England had long been presumptively open. This is no quirk of
history; rather, it has long been recognized as an indispensable attribute of an Anglo-American trial. Both Hale
in the 17th century and Blackstone in the 18th saw the importance of openness to the proper functioning of a
trial, it gave assurance that the proceedings were conducted fairly to all concerned, and it discouraged perjury,
the misconduct of participants, and decisions based on secret bias or partiality ...

When a shocking crime occurs, a community reaction of outrage and public protest often follows ... Thereafter
the open processes of justice serve an important prophylactic purpose, providing an outlet for community con-
cern, hostility, and emotion. Without an awareness that society's responses to criminal conduct are underway,
natural human reactions of outrage and protest are frustrated and may manifest themselves in some form of
vengeful "self-help," as indeed they did regularly in the activities of vigilante "committees" on our frontiers ...

Civilized societies withdraw both from the victim and the vigilante the enforcement of criminal laws, but they
cannot erase from people's consciousness the fundamental, natural yearning to see justice done-or even the urge
for retribution. The crucial prophylactic aspects of the administration of justice cannot function in the dark; no
community catharsis can occur if justice is "done in a corner [or] in any covert manner ..."

It is not enough to say that results alone will satiate the natural community desire for "satisfaction." A result con-
sidered untoward may undermine public confidence, and where the trial has been concealed from public view
                                                                               PRESS ACCESS TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROCESS | 113

an unexpected outcome can cause a reaction that the system at best has failed and at worst has been corrupted.
To work effectively, it is important that society's criminal process "satisfy the appearance of justice," Offutt v.
United States (1954) ...

People in an open society do not demand infallibility from their institutions, but it is difficult for them to accept
what they are prohibited from observing. When a criminal trial is conducted in the open, there is at least an
opportunity both for understanding the system in general and its workings in a particular case ...

From this unbroken, uncontradicted history, supported by reasons as valid today as in centuries past, we are
bound to conclude that a presumption of openness inheres in the very nature of a criminal trial under our sys-
tem of justice. This conclusion is hardly novel, without a direct holding on the issue, the Court has voiced its
recognition of it in a variety of contexts over the years ...

We hold that the right to attend criminal trials is implicit in the guarantees of the First Amendment, without the
freedom to attend such trials, which people have exercised for centuries, important aspects of freedom of speech
and "of the press could be eviscerated." Branzburg v. Hayes (1972).

... Despite the fact that this was the fourth trial of the accused, the trial judge made no findings to support clo-
sure, no inquiry was made as to whether alternative solutions would have met the need to ensure fairness, there
was no recognition of any right under the Constitution for the public or press to attend the trial ... [T]here exist
the context of the trial itself various tested alternatives to satisfy the constitutional demands of fairness ... There
was no suggestion that any problems with witnesses could not have been dealt with by their exclusion from the
courtroom or their sequestration during the trial. Nor is there anything to indicate that sequestration of the
jurors would not have guarded against their being subjected to any improper information. All of the alternatives
admittedly present difficulties for trial courts, but none of the factors relied on here was beyond the realm of the
manageable. Absent an overriding interest articulated in findings, the trial of a criminal case must be open to the
public. Accordingly, the judgment under review is

Reversed.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER ANNOUNCED THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT AND DELIVERED
AN OPINION, IN WHICH WHITE AND REHNQUIST, JJ., JOINED.

The question presented is whether the news media have a constitutional right of access to a county jail, over and
above that of other persons, to interview inmates and make sound recordings, films, and photographs for publi-
cation and broadcasting by newspapers, radio, and television.

Petitioner Houchins, as Sheriff of Alameda County, Cal., controls all access to the Alameda County Jail at Santa
Rita. Respondent KQED operates licensed television and radio broadcasting stations which have frequently
reported newsworthy events relating to penal institutions in the San Francisco Bay Area. On March 31, 1975,
KQED reported the suicide of a prisoner in the Greystone portion of the Santa Rita jail. The report included a
statement by a psychiatrist that the conditions at the Greystone facility were responsible for the illnesses of his
patient-prisoners there, and a statement from petitioner denying that prison conditions were responsible for the
prisoners' illnesses.

KQED requested permission to inspect and take pictures within the Greystone facility. After permission was
refused, KQED and the Alameda and Oakland branches of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People (NAACP) filed suit under 42 U.S.C. 1983. They alleged that petitioner had violated the First
Amendment by refusing to permit media access and failing to provide any effective means by which the public
could be informed of conditions prevailing in the Greystone facility or learn of the prisoners' grievances. Public
access to such information was essential, they asserted, in order for NAACP members to participate in the pub-
lic debate on jail conditions in Alameda County. They further asserted that television coverage of the conditions
in the cells and facilities was the most effective way of informing the public of prison conditions.

The complaint requested a preliminary and permanent injunction to prevent petitioner from "excluding KQED
news personnel from the Greystone cells and Santa Rita facilities and generally preventing full and accurate news
coverage of the conditions prevailing therein." On June 17, 1975, when the complaint was filed, there appears
to have been no formal policy regarding public access to the Santa Rita jail. However, according to petitioner, he
had been in the process of planning a program of regular monthly tours since he took office six months earlier.
On July 8, 1975, he announced the program and invited all interested persons to make arrangements for the reg-
ular public tours. News media were given notice in advance of the public and presumably could have made early

On interlocutory appeal from the District Court's order, petitioner invoked Pell v. Procunier (1974), where
this Court held that "newsmen have no constitutional right of access to prisons or their inmates beyond that
afforded to the general public." He contended that the District Court had departed from Pell and abused its dis-
cretion because it had ordered that he give the media greater access to the jail than he gave to the general public.
The Court of Appeals rejected petitioner's argument that Pell and Saxbe v. Washington Post Co. (1974), were
controlling. It concluded, albeit in three separate opinions, that the public and the media had a First and Four-
teenth Amendment right of access to prisons and jails, and sustained the District Court's order ...

We can agree with many of the respondents' generalized assertions; conditions in jails and prisons are clearly
matters "of great public importance." Penal facilities are public institutions which require large amounts of pub-
lic funds, and their mission is crucial in our criminal justice system. Each person placed in prison becomes, in
effect, a ward of the state for whom society assumes broad responsibility. It is equally true that with greater infor-
mation, the public can more intelligently form opinions about prison conditions. Beyond question, the role
of the media is important; acting as the "eyes and ears" of the public, they can be a powerful and constructive
force, contributing to remedial action in the conduct of public business. They have served that function since
the beginning of the Republic, but like all other components of our society media representatives are subject to
limits.

The media are not a substitute for or an adjunct of government and, like the courts, they are "ill equipped" to
deal with problems of prison administration. We must not confuse the role of the media with that of govern-
ment; each has special, crucial functions, each complementing - and sometimes conflicting with - the other ...

The respondents' argument is flawed, not only because it lacks precedential support and is contrary to state-
ments in this Court's opinions, but also because it invites the Court to involve itself in what is clearly a legislative
task which the Constitution has left to the political processes. Whether the government should open penal insti-
tutions in the manner sought by respondents is a question of policy which a legislative body might appropriately
resolve one way or the other.

A number of alternatives are available to prevent problems in penal facilities from escaping public attention ...
Citizen task forces and prison visitation committees continue to play an important role in keeping the public
informed on deficiencies of prison systems and need for reforms. Grand juries, with the potent subpoena power
- not available to the media - traditionally concern themselves with conditions in public institutions; a prosecu-
tor or judge may initiate similar inquiries, and the legislative power embraces an arsenal of weapons for inquiry
relating to tax-supported institutions. In each case, these public bodies are generally compelled to publish their
findings and, if they default, the power of the media is always available to generate public pressure for disclosure.
But the choice as to the most effective and appropriate method is a policy decision to be resolved by legislative
decision. We must not confuse what is "good," "desirable," or "expedient" with what is constitutionally com-
manded by the First Amendment. To do so is to trivialize constitutional adjudication.

Unarticulated but implicit in the assertion that media access to the jail is essential for informed public debate on
jail conditions is the assumption that media personnel are the best qualified persons for the task of discovering
malfeasance in public institutions. But that assumption finds no support in the decisions of this Court or the
116 | PRESS ACCESS TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROCESS

First Amendment. Editors and newsmen who inspect a jail may decide to publish or not to publish what infor-
mation they acquire. Public bodies and public officers, on the other hand, may be coerced by public opinion to
disclose what they might prefer to conceal. No comparable pressures are available to anyone to compel publica-
tion by the media of what they might prefer not to make known.
There is no discernible basis for a constitutional duty to disclose, or for standards governing disclosure of or
access to information. Because the Constitution affords no guidelines, absent statutory standards, hundreds of
judges would, under the Court of Appeals' approach, be at large to fashion ad hoc standards, in individual
cases, according to their own ideas of what seems "desirable" or "expedient." We, therefore, reject the Court of
Appeals' conclusory assertion that the public and the media have a First Amendment right to government infor-
mation regarding the conditions of jails and their inmates and presumably all other public facilities such as hos-
pitals and mental institutions ...
Neither the First Amendment nor the Fourteenth Amendment mandates a right of access to government infor-
mation or sources of information within the government's control. Under our holdings in Pell v. Procunier,
supra, and Saxbe v. Washington Post Co.,, supra, until the political branches decree otherwise, as they are free
to do, the media have no special right of access to the Alameda County Jail different from or greater than that
accorded the public generally.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.
Reversed and remanded.

Seattle Times v. Rhinehart

476 U.S. 20 (1984)

    Vote: 9-0
    Decision: Affirmed
    Majority: Burger, Brennan, White, Marshall, Blackmun, Powell, Rehnquist, Stevens, O' Connor

JUSTICE POWELL DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.

This case presents the issue whether parties to civil litigation have a First Amendment right to disseminate, in
advance of trial, information gained through the pretrial discovery process.

Respondent Rhinehart is the spiritual leader of a religious group, the Aquarian Foundation. The Foundation
has fewer than 1,000 members, most of whom live in the State of Washington. Aquarian beliefs include life after
death and the ability to communicate with the dead through a medium. Rhinehart is the primary Aquarian
medium.

In recent years, the Seattle Times and the Walla Walla Union-Bulletin have published stories about Rhinehart
and the Foundation. Altogether 11 articles appeared in the newspapers during the years 1973, 1978, and 1979.
The five articles that appeared in 1973 focused on Rhinehart and the manner in which he operated the Foun-
dation. They described seances conducted by Rhinehart in which people paid him to put them in touch with
deceased relatives and friends. The articles also stated that Rhinehart had sold magical "stones" that had been
"expelled" from his body. One article referred to Rhinehart's conviction, later vacated, for sodomy. The four arti-
cles that appeared in 1978 concentrated on an "extravaganza" sponsored by Rhinehart at the Walla Walla State
Penitentiary. The articles stated that he had treated 1,100 inmates to a 6-hour-long show, during which he gave
away between $35,000 and $50,000 in cash and prizes. One article described a "chorus line of girls [who] shed
their gowns and bikinis and sang. ..." The two articles that appeared in 1979 referred to a purported connection
between Rhinehart and Lou Ferrigno, star of the popular television program, "The Incredible Hulk."

Rhinehart brought this action in the Washington Superior Court on behalf of himself and the Foundation
against the Seattle Times, the Walla Walla Union-Bulletin, the authors of the articles, and the spouses of the
authors. Five female members of the Foundation who had participated in the presentation at the penitentiary
joined the suit as plaintiffs. The complaint alleges that the articles contained statements that were "fictional and
untrue," and that the defendants - petitioners here - knew, or should have known, they were false. According to
the complaint, the articles "did and were calculated to hold [Rhinehart] up to public scorn, hatred and ridicule,
and to impeach his honesty, integrity, virtue, religious philosophy, reputation as a person and in his profession as
a spiritual leader." With respect to the Foundation, the complaint also states: "[T]he articles have, or may have
                                                                                                                        RIGHT TO PUBLISH | 119

had, the effect of discouraging contributions by the membership and public and thereby diminished the finan-
cial ability of the Foundation to pursue its corporate purposes." The complaint alleges that the articles misrep-
resented the role of the Foundation's "choir" and falsely implied that female members of the Foundation had
"stripped off all their clothes and wantonly danced naked. ..." The complaint requests $14,100,000 in damages
for the alleged defamation and invasions of privacy.

Petitioners filed an answer, denying many of the allegations of the complaint and asserting affirmative defenses.
Petitioners promptly initiated extensive discovery. They deposed Rhinehart, requested production of docu-
ments pertaining to the financial affairs of Rhinehart and the Foundation, and served extensive interrogatories
on Rhinehart and the other respondents. Respondents turned over a number of financial documents, including
several of Rhinehart's income tax returns. Respondents refused, however, to disclose certain financial informa-
tion, the identity of the Foundation's donors during the preceding 10 years, and a list of its members during that
period.

Petitioners filed a motion [under state law] requesting an order compelling discovery. In their supporting mem-
orandum, petitioners recognized that the principal issue as to discovery was respondents'"refusa[l] to permit any
effective inquiry into their financial affairs, such as the source of their donations, their financial transactions,
uses of their wealth and assets, and their financial condition in general." Record 350. Respondents opposed
the motion, arguing in particular that compelled production of the identities of the Foundation's donors and
members would violate the First Amendment rights of members and donors to privacy, freedom of religion, and
freedom of association. Respondents also moved for a protective order preventing petitioners from disseminat-
ing any information gained through discovery. Respondents noted that petitioners had stated their intention to
continue publishing articles about respondents and this litigation, and their intent to use information gained
through discovery in future articles.

In a lengthy ruling, the trial court initially granted the motion to compel and ordered respondents to identify
all donors who made contributions during the five years preceding the date of the complaint, along with the
amounts donated ... Respondents filed a motion for reconsideration in which they renewed their motion for a
protective order. They submitted affidavits of several Foundation members to support their request ... In gen-
eral, the affidavits averred that public release of the donor lists would adversely affect Foundation membership
and income and would subject its members to additional harassment and reprisals.

Persuaded by these affidavits, the trial court issued a protective order covering all information obtained through
the discovery process that pertained to "the financial affairs of the various plaintiffs, the names and addresses
of Aquarian Foundation members, contributors, or clients, and the names and addresses of those who have
been contributors, clients, or donors to any of the various plaintiffs." App. 65a. The order prohibited petition-
ers from publishing, disseminating, or using the information in any way except where necessary to prepare for
and try the case. By its terms, the order did not apply to information gained by means other than the discovery
process. In an accompanying opinion, the trial court recognized that the protective order would restrict petition-
ers' right to publish information obtained by discovery, but the court reasoned that the restriction was necessary
to avoid the "chilling effect" that dissemination would have on "a party's willingness to bring his case to court."
Record 63.
120 | RIGHT TO PUBLISH

Respondents appealed from the trial court's production order, and petitioners appealed from the protective
order. The Supreme Court of Washington affirmed both. * * * The Supreme Court of Washington recognized
that its holding conflicts with the holdings of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit * * * and applies a different standard from that of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit * * * . We
granted certiorari to resolve the conflict. We affirm.

Most States, including Washington, have adopted discovery provisions modeled on Rules 26 through 37 of the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 26(b)(1) provides that a party "may obtain discovery regarding any mat-
ter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action." It further provides
that discovery is not limited to matters that will be admissible at trial so long as the information sought "appears
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence." Wash.Super.Ct.Civ.Rule 26(b)(1); Trust
Fund Services v. Aro Glass Co. (1978); cf. 8 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2008 (1970).

The Rules do not differentiate between information that is private or intimate and that to which no privacy
interests attach. Under the Rules, the only express limitations are that the information sought is not privileged,
and is relevant to the subject matter of the pending action. Thus, the Rules often allow extensive intrusion
into the affairs of both litigants and third parties. If a litigant fails to comply with a request for discovery,
the court may issue an order directing compliance that is enforceable by the court's contempt powers.
Wash.Super.Ct.Civ.Rule 37(b).

Petitioners argue that the First Amendment imposes strict limits on the availability of any judicial order that has
the effect of restricting expression. They contend that civil discovery is not different from other sources of infor-
mation, and that therefore the information is "protected speech" for First Amendment purposes. Petitioners
assert the right in this case to disseminate any information gained through discovery. They do recognize that in
limited circumstances, not thought to be present here, some information may be restrained. They submit, how-
ever: "When a protective order seeks to limit expression, it may do so only if the proponent shows a compelling
governmental interest. Mere speculation and conjecture are insufficient. Any restraining order, moreover, must
be narrowly drawn and precise. Finally, before issuing such an order a court must determine that there are no
alternatives which intrude less directly on expression." Brief for Petitioners 10.

We think the rule urged by petitioners would impose an unwarranted restriction on the duty and discretion of a
trial court to oversee the discovery process.

It is, of course, clear that information obtained through civil discovery authorized by modern rules of civil pro-
cedure would rarely, if ever, fall within the classes of unprotected speech identified by decisions of this Court.
In this case, as petitioners argue, there certainly is a public interest in knowing more about respondents. This
interest may well include most - and possibly all - of what has been discovered as a result of the court's order
under Rule 26(b)(1). It does not necessarily follow, however, that a litigant has an unrestrained right to dissem-
inate information that has been obtained through pretrial discovery. For even though the broad sweep of the
First Amendment seems to prohibit all restraints on free expression, this Court has observed that "[f]reedom of
speech ... does not comprehend the right to speak on any subject at any time." American Communications Assn.
v. Dods (1950).
                                                                                                                        RIGHT TO PUBLISH | 121

The critical question that this case presents is whether a litigant's freedom comprehends the right to disseminate
information that he has obtained pursuant to a court order that both granted him access to that information
and placed restraints on the way in which the information might be used. In addressing that question it is neces-
sary to consider whether the "practice in question [furthers] an important or substantial governmental interest
unrelated to the suppression of expression" and whether "the limitation of First Amendment freedoms [is] no
greater than is necessary or essential to the protection of the particular governmental interest involved." Procu­
nier v. Martinez (1974) ...

At the outset, it is important to recognize the extent of the impairment of First Amendment rights that a pro-
tective order, such as the one at issue here, may cause. As in all civil litigation, petitioners gained the information
they wish to disseminate only by virtue of the trial court's discovery processes. As the Rules authorizing discov-
ery were adopted by the state legislature, the processes thereunder are a matter of legislative grace. A litigant has
no First Amendment right of access to information made available only for purposes of trying his suit. Zemel v.
Rusk (1965). Thus, continued court control over the discovered information does not raise the same specter of
government censorship that such control might suggest in other situations.

Moreover, pretrial depositions and interrogatories are not public components of a civil trial. Such proceedings
were not open to the public at common law, Gannett Co. v. DePasquale (1979), and, in general, they are con-
ducted in private as a matter of modern practice. Much of the information that surfaces during pretrial discovery
may be unrelated, or only tangentially related, to the underlying cause of action. Therefore, restraints placed on
discovered, but not yet admitted, information are not a restriction on a traditionally public source of informa-
tion.

Finally, it is significant to note that an order prohibiting dissemination of discovered information before trial is
not the kind of classic prior restraint that requires exacting First Amendment scrutiny. As in this case, such a
protective order prevents a party from disseminating only that information obtained through use of the discov-
ery process. Thus, the party may disseminate the identical information covered by the protective order as long as
the information is gained through means independent of the court's processes. In sum, judicial limitations on a
party's ability to disseminate information discovered in advance of trial implicates the First Amendment rights
of the restricted party to a far lesser extent than would restraints on dissemination of information in a different
context. Therefore, our consideration of the provision for protective orders contained in the Washington Civil
Rules takes into account the unique position that such orders occupy in relation to the First Amendment.

Rule 26(c) furthers a substantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of expression. Procunier,
supra. The Washington Civil Rules enable parties to litigation to obtain information "relevant to the subject
matter involved" that they believe will be helpful in the preparation and trial of the case. Rule 26, however, must
be viewed in its entirety. Liberal discovery is provided for the sole purpose of assisting in the preparation and
trial, or the settlement, of litigated disputes. Because of the liberality of pretrial discovery permitted by Rule
26(b)(1), it is necessary for the trial court to have the authority to issue protective orders conferred by Rule 26(c).
It is clear from experience that pretrial discovery by depositions and interrogatories has a significant potential for
abuse. This abuse is not limited to matters of delay and expense; discovery also may seriously implicate privacy
122 | RIGHT TO PUBLISH

interests of litigants and third parties. The Rules do not distinguish between public and private information.
Nor do they apply only to parties to the litigation, as relevant information in the hands of third parties may be
subject to discovery.

There is an opportunity, therefore, for litigants to obtain - incidentally or purposefully - information that not
only is irrelevant but if publicly released could be damaging to reputation and privacy. The government clearly
has a substantial interest in preventing this sort of abuse of its processes. * * * The prevention of the abuse that
can attend the coerced production of information under a State's discovery rule is sufficient justification for the
authorization of protective orders.

...

The facts in this case illustrate the concerns that justifiably may prompt a court to issue a protective order. As we
have noted, the trial court's order allowing discovery was extremely broad. It compelled respondents - among
other things - to identify all persons who had made donations over a 5-year period to Rhinehart and the Aquar-
ian Foundation, together with the amounts donated. In effect the order would compel disclosure of member-
ship as well as sources of financial support. The Supreme Court of Washington found that dissemination of this
information would "result in annoyance, embarrassment and even oppression." 98 Wash. 2d at 257, 654 P.2d at
690. It is sufficient for purposes of our decision that the highest court in the State found no abuse of discretion
in the trial court's decision to issue a protective order pursuant to a constitutional state law. We therefore hold
that where, as in this case, a protective order is entered on a showing of good cause as required by Rule 26(c),
is limited to the context of pretrial civil discovery, and does not restrict the dissemination of the information if
gained from other sources, it does not offend the First Amendment.

The judgment accordingly is

Affirmed.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.

...

On February 9, 1978, a 15-year-old student was shot and killed at Hayes Junior High School in St. Albans, W.
Va., a small community located about 13 miles outside of Charleston, W. Va. The alleged assailant, a 14-year-old
classmate, was identified by seven different eyewitnesses and was arrested by police soon after the incident.

The Charleston Daily Mail and the Charleston Gazette, respondents here, learned of the shooting by monitor-
ing routinely the police band radio frequency; they immediately dispatched reporters and photographers to the
junior high school. The reporters for both papers obtained the name of the alleged assailant simply by asking
various witnesses, the police, and an assistant prosecuting attorney who were at the school.

The staffs of both newspapers prepared articles for publication about the incident. The Daily Mail's first article
appeared in its February 9 afternoon edition. The article did not mention the alleged attacker's name. The edito-
rial decision to omit the name was made because of the statutory prohibition against publication without prior
court approval.

The Gazette made a contrary editorial decision and published the juvenile's name and picture in an article about
the shooting that appeared in the February 10 morning edition of the paper. In addition, the name of the alleged
juvenile attacker was broadcast over at least three different radio stations on February 9 and 10. Since the infor-
mation had become public knowledge, the Daily Mail decided to include the juvenile's name in an article in its
afternoon paper on February 10.

On March 1, an indictment against the respondents was returned by a grand jury. The indictment alleged that
each knowingly published the name of a youth involved in a juvenile proceeding in violation of W. Va. Code §
49-7-3 (1976). Respondents then filed an original-jurisdiction petition with the West Virginia Supreme Court
of Appeals, seeking a writ of prohibition ... alleg[ing] that the indictment was based on a statute that violated
the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution ... The West Virginia Supreme Court
of Appeals ... held that the statute abridged the freedom of the press ...

We granted certiorari.
124 | RIGHT TO PUBLISH

Respondents urge this Court to hold that because [the statute] requires court approval prior to publication
of the juvenile's name it operates as a "prior restraint" on speech ... Petitioners do not dispute that the statute
amounts to a prior restraint on speech. Rather, they take the view that, even if it is a prior restraint, the statute is
constitutional because of the significance of the State's interest in protecting the identity of juveniles ...

Whether we view the statute as a prior restraint or as a penal sanction for publishing lawfully obtained, truthful
information is not dispositive because even the latter action requires the highest form of state interest to sustain
its validity. Prior restraints have been accorded the most exacting scrutiny in previous cases ...

Our recent decisions demonstrate that state action to punish the publication of truthful information seldom
can satisfy constitutional standards ...

None of [our previous and related] opinions directly controls this case; however, all suggest strongly that if a
newspaper lawfully obtains truthful information about a matter of public significance then state officials may
not constitutionally punish publication of the information, absent a need to further a state interest of the high-
est order. These cases involved situations where the government itself provided or made possible press access
to the information. That factor is not controlling. Here respondents relied upon routine newspaper reporting
techniques to ascertain the identity of the alleged assailant.

A free press cannot be made to rely solely upon the sufferance of government to supply it with information ... If
the information is lawfully obtained, as it was here, the state may not punish its publication except when neces-
sary to further an interest more substantial than is present here ...

The sole interest advanced by the State to justify its criminal statute is to protect the anonymity of the juvenile
offender. It is asserted that confidentiality will further his rehabilitation because publication of the name may
encourage further antisocial conduct and also may cause the juvenile to lose future employment or suffer other
consequences for this single offense ...

However, we concluded [in a previous case] that the State's policy must be subordinated to the defendant's Sixth
Amendment right of confrontation. The important rights created by the First Amendment must be considered
along with the rights of defendants guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. Therefore, the reasoning ... that the
constitutional right must prevail over the state's interest in protecting juveniles applies with equal force here.

The magnitude of the State's interest in this statute is not sufficient to justify application of a criminal penalty
to respondents. Moreover, the statute's approach does not satisfy constitutional requirements. The statute does
not restrict the electronic media or any form of publication, except "newspapers," from printing the names of
youths charged in a juvenile proceeding. In this very case, three radio stations announced the alleged assailant's
name before the Daily Mail decided to publish it. Thus, even assuming the statute served a state interest of the
highest order, it does not accomplish its stated purpose. In addition, there is no evidence to demonstrate that the
imposition of criminal penalties is necessary to protect the confidentiality of juvenile proceedings ...

Our holding in this case is narrow. There is no issue before us of unlawful press access to confidential judicial
proceedings ... there is no issue here of privacy or prejudicial pretrial publicity. At issue is simply the power of a
                                                                                                                        RIGHT TO PUBLISH | 125

state to punish the truthful publication of an alleged juvenile delinquent's name lawfully obtained by a newspa-
per. The asserted state interest cannot justify the statute's imposition of criminal sanctions on this type of pub-
lication.

Accordingly, the judgment of the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals is

Affirmed.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE [UNANIMOUS] COURT.

The issue in this case is whether a state statute granting a political candidate a right to equal space to reply to
criticism and attacks on his record by a newspaper violates the guarantees of a free press.

In the fall of 1972, appellee ... was a candidate for the Florida House of Representatives. On September 20,
1972, and again on September 29, 1972, appellant printed editorials critical of appellee's candidacy. In response
to these editorials, appellee demanded that appellant print verbatim his replies ... Appellant declined to print
the appellee's replies, and appellee brought suit ... seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and actual and puni-
tive damages in excess of $5,000. The action was premised on Florida Statute §104.38 (1973), a "right of reply"
statute which provides that if a candidate for nomination or election is assailed regarding his personal charac-
ter or official record by any newspaper, the candidate has the right to demand that the newspaper print, free of
cost to the candidate, any reply the candidate may make to the newspaper's charges. The reply must appear in as
conspicuous a place and in the same kind of type as the charges which prompted the reply, provided it does not
take up more space than the charges. Failure to comply with the statute constitutes a first-degree misdemeanor.
Appellant sought a declaration that §104.38 was unconstitutional. After an emergency hearing requested by
appellee, the Circuit Court denied injunctive relief because, absent special circumstances, no injunction could
properly issue against the commission of a crime and held that 104.38 was unconstitutional as an infringement
on the freedom of the press under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. The Circuit
Court concluded that dictating what a newspaper must print was no different from dictating what it must not
print. The Circuit Judge viewed the statute's vagueness as serving "to restrict and stifle protected expression ...

On direct appeal, the Florida Supreme Court reversed, holding that 104.38 did not violate constitutional guar-
antees. It held that free speech was enhanced and not abridged by the Florida right-of-reply statute, which in
that court's view, furthered the "broad societal interest in the free flow of information to the public." It also held
that the statute is not impermissibly vague; the statute informs "those who are subject to it as to what conduct
on their part will render them liable to its penalties." Civil remedies, including damages, were held to be avail-
                                                                                                                          PRINT VERSUS . . . | 127

able under this statute; the case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings not inconsistent with the
Florida Supreme Court's opinion. We postponed consideration of the question of jurisdiction to the hearing of
the case on the merits.

The challenged statute creates a right to reply to press criticism of a candidate for nomination or election. The
statute was enacted in 1913, and this is only the second recorded case decided under its provisions. Appellant
contends the statute is void on its face because it purports to regulate the content of a newspaper in violation of
the First Amendment. Alternatively it is urged that the statute is void for vagueness since no editor could know
exactly what words would call the statute into operation. It is also contended that the statute fails to distinguish
between critical comment which is, and which is not defamatory.

The appellee and supporting advocates of an enforceable right of access to the press vigorously argue that gov-
ernment has an obligation to ensure that a wide variety of views reach the public ... It is urged that at the time
the First Amendment to the Constitution was ratified ... the press was broadly representative of the people it was
serving. While many of the newspapers were intensely partisan and narrow in their views, the press collectively
presented a broad range of opinions to readers. Entry into publishing was inexpensive; pamphlets and books
provided meaningful alternatives to the organized press for the expression of unpopular ideas and often treated
events and expressed views not covered by conventional newspapers. A true marketplace of ideas existed in which
there was relatively easy access to the channels of communication.

Access advocates submit that, although newspapers of the present are superficially similar to those of 1791, the
press of today is in reality very different from that known in the early years of our national existence. In the
past half century, a communications revolution has seen the introduction of radio and television into our lives,
the promise of a global community through the use of communications satellites, and the specter of a "wired"
nation by means of an expanding cable television network with two-way capabilities. The printed press, it is
said, has not escaped the effects of this revolution. Newspapers have become big business and there are far fewer
of them to serve a larger literate population. Chains of newspapers, national newspapers, national wire and
news services, and one-newspaper towns, are the dominant features of a press that has become noncompetitive
and enormously powerful and influential in its capacity to manipulate popular opinion and change the course
of events. Major metropolitan newspapers have collaborated to establish news services national in scope. Such
national news organizations provide syndicated "interpretive reporting" as well as syndicated features and com-
mentary, all of which can serve as part of the new school of "advocacy journalism."

The elimination of competing newspapers in most of our large cities, and the concentration of control of media
that results from the only newspaper's being owned by the same interests which own a television station and
a radio station, are important components of this trend toward concentration of control of outlets to inform
the public. The result of these vast changes has been to place in a few hands the power to inform the American
people and shape public opinion. Much of the editorial opinion and commentary that is printed is that of syndi-
cated columnists distributed nationwide and, as a result, we are told, on national and world issues there tends to
be a homogeneity of editorial opinion, commentary, and interpretive analysis. The abuses of bias and manipula-
tive reportage are, likewise, said to be the result of the vast accumulations of unreviewable power in the modern
128 | PRINT VERSUS . . .

media empires. In effect, it is claimed, the public has lost any ability to respond or to contribute in a meaningful
way to the debate on issues. The monopoly of the means of communication allows for little or no critical analy-
sis of the media except in professional journals of very limited readership. * * *

The obvious solution, which was available to dissidents at an earlier time when entry into publishing was rel-
atively inexpensive, today would be to have additional newspapers. But the same economic factors which have
caused the disappearance of vast numbers of metropolitan newspapers, have made entry into the marketplace of
ideas served by the print media almost impossible. It is urged that the claim of newspapers to be "surrogates for
the public" carries with it a concomitant fiduciary obligation to account for that stewardship. From this premise
it is reasoned that the only effective way to insure fairness and accuracy and to provide for some accountability is
for government to take affirmative action. The First Amendment interest of the public in being informed is said
to be in peril because the "marketplace of ideas" is today a monopoly controlled by the owners of the market.
Proponents of enforced access to the press take comfort from language in several of this Court's decisions which
suggests that the First Amendment acts as a sword as well as a shield, that it imposes obligations on the owners
of the press in addition to protecting the press from government regulation. * * *

However much validity may be found in these arguments, at each point the implementation of a remedy such
as an enforceable right of access necessarily calls for some mechanism, either governmental or consensual. If
it is governmental coercion, this at once brings about a confrontation with the express provisions of the First
Amendment and the judicial gloss on that Amendment developed over the years. * * * We see that * * * the Court
has expressed sensitivity as to whether a restriction or requirement constituted the compulsion exerted by gov-
ernment on a newspaper to print that which it would not otherwise print. The clear implication has been that
any such a compulsion to publish that which "`reason' tells them should not be published" is unconstitutional.
A responsible press is an undoubtedly desirable goal, but press responsibility is not mandated by the Constitu-
tion and like many other virtues it cannot be legislated.

Appellee's argument that the Florida statute does not amount to a restriction of appellant's right to speak
because "the statute in question here has not prevented the Miami Herald from saying anything it wished" begs
the core question. Compelling editors or publishers to publish that which "`reason' tells them should not be
published" is what is at issue in this case. The Florida statute operates as a command in the same sense as a statute
or regulation forbidding appellant to publish specified matter. Governmental restraint on publishing need not
fall into familiar or traditional patterns to be subject to constitutional limitations on governmental powers. Gros­
jean v. American Press Co. (1936). The Florida statute exacts a penalty on the basis of the content of a newspa-
per. The first phase of the penalty resulting from the compelled printing of a reply is exacted in terms of the cost
in printing and composing time and materials and in taking up space that could be devoted to other material
the newspaper may have preferred to print. It is correct, as appellee contends, that a newspaper is not subject
to the finite technological limitations of time that confront a broadcaster but it is not correct to say that, as an
economic reality, a newspaper can proceed to infinite expansion of its column space to accommodate the replies
that a government agency determines or a statute commands the readers should have available.

Faced with the penalties that would accrue to any newspaper that published news or commentary arguably
within the reach of the right-of-access statute, editors might well conclude that the safe course is to avoid con-
§                                                                                                                         PRINT VERSUS . . . | 129

troversy. Therefore, under the operation of the Florida statute, political and electoral coverage would be blunted
or reduced. Government-enforced right of access inescapably "dampens the vigor and limits the variety of public
debate," New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964). * * *

Even if a newspaper would face no additional costs to comply with a compulsory access law and would not be
forced to forgo publication of news or opinion by the inclusion of a reply, the Florida statute fails to clear the
barriers of the First Amendment because of its intrusion into the function of editors. A newspaper is more than
a passive receptacle or conduit for news, comment, and advertising. The choice of material to go into a newspa-
per, and the decisions made as to limitations on the size and content of the paper, and treatment of public issues
and public officials -whether fair or unfair -constitute the exercise of editorial control and judgment. It has yet
to be demonstrated how governmental regulation of this crucial process can be exercised consistent with First
Amendment guarantees of a free press as they have evolved to this time.

Accordingly, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida is reversed.

It is so ordered.

BRENNAN, WITH WHOM REHNQUIST JOINS, CONCURRING.

I join the Court's opinion which, as I understand it, addresses only "right of reply" statutes and implies no

Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC

395 U.S. 367 (1969)

    Vote: 8-0
    Decision: Reversed
    Majority: White, joined by Warren, Black, Harlan, Brennan, Stewart, Marshal
    Not participating: Douglas

MR. JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.

The Federal Communications Commission has for many years imposed on radio and television broadcasters
the requirement that discussion of public issues be presented on broadcast stations, and that each side of those
issues must be given fair coverage. This is known as the fairness doctrine, which originated very early. In the his-
tory of broadcasting and has maintained its present outlines for some time. It is an obligation whose content has
130 | PRINT VERSUS . . .

been defined in a long series of FCC rulings in particular cases, and which is distinct from the statutory require-
ment of § 315 of the Communications Act' that equal time be allotted all qualified candidates for public office.
Two aspects of the fairness doctrine, relating to personal attacks in the context of controversial public issues and
to political editorializing, were codified more precisely in the form of FCC regulations in 1967. The two cases
before us now, which were decided separately below, challenge the constitutional and statutory bases of the doc-
trine and component rules. Red Lion involves the application of the fairness doctrine to a particular broadcast,
and RTNDA arises as an action to review the FCC's 1967 promulgation of the personal attack and political edi-
torializing regulations, which were laid down after the Red Lion litigation had begun.

The Red Lion Broadcasting Company is licensed to operate a Pennsylvania radio station, WGCB. On Novem-
ber 27, 1964, WGCB carried a 15-minute broadcast by the Reverend Billy James Hargis as part of a "Christian'
Crusade" series. A hook by Fred J. Cook entitled "Gold-water-Extremist on the Right" was discussed by Hargis,.
who said that Cook had been fired by a newspaper for making false charges against city officials; that Cook
had then worked for a Communist-affiliated publication; that he had defended Alger Hiss and attacked J.
Edgar Hoover and the Central Intelligence Agency; and that he had now written a "book to smear and destroy
Barry Goldwater." When Cook heard of the broadcast he concluded that he had been personally attacked and
demanded free reply time, which the station refused. After an exchange of letters among Cook, Red Lion, and
the FCC, the FCC declared that the Hargis broadcast constituted a personal attack on Cook; that Red Lion had
failed to meet its obligation under the fairness doctrine as expressed in Times-Mirror Broadcasting Co., 24 P &
F Radio Reg. 404 (1962), to send a tape, transcript, or summary of the broadcast to Cook and offer him reply
time; and that the station must provide reply time whether or not Cook would pay for it ...

Believing that the specific application of the fairness doctrine in Red Lion, and the promulgation of, the regula-
tions in RTNDA, are both authorized by Congress and enhance rather than abridge the freedoms of speech and
press protected by the First Amendment, we hold them valid and constitutional, reversing the judgment below
in RTNDA and affirming the judgment below in Red Lion.

The history of the emergence of the fairness doctrine and of the related legislation shows that the Commission's
action in the Red Lion case did not exceed its authority, and that in adopting the new regulations the Commis-
sion was implementing congressional policy rather than embarking on a frolic of its own.

Before 1927, the allocation of frequencies was left entirely to the private sector, and the result was chaos. It
quickly became apparent that broadcast frequencies constituted a scarce resource whose use could be regulated
and rationalized only by the Government. Without government control, the medium would be of little use
because of the cacaphony of competing voices, none of which could be clearly and predictably heard to allocate
frequencies among competing applicants in a manner responsive to the public "convenience, interest, or neces-
sity."

Very shortly thereafter the Commission expressed its view that the "public interest requires ample play for the
free and fair competition of opposing views, and the commission believes that the principle applies ... to all
discussions of issues of importance to the public." Great Lakes Broadcasting Co., 3 F.R.C.Ann.Rep. 32, 33
(1929), rev'd on other grounds, 59 App.D.C.197, 37 F.2d 993, cert. dismissed, 281 U.S. 706 (1930) ... After an
                                                                                                                          PRINT VERSUS . . . | 131

extended period during which the licensee was obliged not only to cover and to cover fairly the views of others
but also to refrain from expressing his own personal views, Mayflower Broadcasting Corp., 8 F.C.C. 333 (1940),
the latter limitation on the licensee was abandoned, and the doctrine developed into its present form.

There is a twofold duty laid down by the FCC's decisions and described by the 1949 Report on Editorializing
by Broadcast Licensees, 13 F.C.C. 1246 (1949). The broadcaster must give adequate coverage to public
issues, United Broadcasting Co., 10 F.C.C. 515 (1945), and coverage must be fair in that it accurately reflects the
opposing views. New Broadcasting Co., 6 P & F Radio Reg. 258 (1950). This must be done at the broadcaster's
own expense if sponsorship is unavailable. Cullman Broadcasting Co., 25 P & F Radio Reg. 895 (1963).

Moreover, the duty must be met by programming obtained at the licensee's own initiative if available from no
other source ...

When a personal attack has been made on a figure involved in a public issue, both the doctrine of cases such as
Red Lion and Times-Mirror Broadcasting Co., 24 P & F Radio Reg. 404 (1962), and also the 1967 regulations
at issue in RTNDA require that the individual attacked himself be offered an opportunity to respond. Likewise,
where one candidate is endorsed in a political editorial, the other candidates must themselves be offered reply
time to use personally or through a spokesman. These obligations differ from the general fairness requirement
that issues be presented, and presented with coverage of competing views, in that the broadcaster does not have
the option of presenting the attacked party's side himself or choosing a third party to represent that side ...

The fairness doctrine finds specific recognition in statutory form, is in part modeled on explicit statutory provi-
sions relating to political candidates, and is approvingly reflected in legislative history ... Thirty years of consis-
tent administrative construction left undisturbed by Congress until 1959, when that construction was expressly
accepted, reinforce the natural conclusion that the public interest language of the Act authorized the Commis-
sion to require licensees to use their stations for discussion of public issues, and that the FCC is free to imple-
ment this requirement by reasonable rules and regulations which fall short of abridgment of the freedom of
speech and press, and of the censorship proscribed by § 326 of the Act ...

It is true that the personal attack aspect of the fairness doctrine was not actually adjudicated until after 1959, so
that Congress then did not have those rules specifically before it. However, the obligation to offer time to reply
to a personal attack was presaged by the FCC's 1949 Report on Editorializing, which the FCC views as the prin-
cipal summary of its ratio decidendi in cases in this area:

"In determining whether to honor specific requests for time, the station will inevitably be confronted with such
questions as ... whether there may not be other available groups or individuals who might be more appropriate
spokesmen for the particular
point of view than the person making the request. The latter's personal involvement in the controversy may also
be a factor which must be considered, for elementary considerations of fairness may dictate that time be allo-
cated to a person or group which has been specifically attacked over the station, where otherwise no such oblig-
ation would exist." 13 F.C.C. at 1251-1252.
132 | PRINT VERSUS . . .

When the Congress ratified the FCC's implication of a fairness doctrine in 1959 it did not, of course, approve
every past decision or pronouncement by the Commission on this subject, or give it a completely free hand for
the future. The statutory authority does not go so far. But we cannot say that when a station publishes personal
attacks or endorses political candidates, it is a misconstruction of the public interest standard to require the sta-
tion to offer time for a response rather than to leave the response entirely within the control of the station which
has attacked either the candidacies or the men who wish to reply in their own defense. When a broadcaster grants
time to a political candidate, Congress itself requires that equal time be offered to his opponents. It would exceed
our competence to hold that the Commission is unauthorized by the statute to employ a similar device where
personal attacks or political editorials are broadcast by a radio or television station ...

The broadcasters challenge the fairness doctrine and its specific manifestations in the personal attack and polit-
ical editorial rules on conventional First Amendment grounds, alleging that the rules abridge their freedom of
speech and press. Their contention is that the First Amendment protects their desire to use their allotted fre-
quencies continuously to broadcast whatever they
choose, and to exclude whomever they choose from ever using that frequency. No man may be prevented from
saying or publishing what he thinks, or from refusing in his speech or other utterances to give equal weight to
the views of his opponents. This right, they say, applies equally to broadcasters ...

When two people converse face to face, both should not speak at once if either is to be clearly understood. But
the range of the human voice is so limited that there could be meaningful communications if half the people in
the United States were talking and the other half listening. Just as clearly, half the people might publish and the
other half read. But the reach of radio signals is incomparably greater than the range of the human voice and the
problem of interference is a massive reality. The lack of know-how and equipment may keep many from the air,
but only a tiny fraction of those with resources and intelligence can hope to communicate by radio at the same
time if intelligible communication is to be had, even if the entire radio spectrum is utilized in the present state of
commercially acceptable technology ...

It does not violate the First Amendment to treat licensees given the privilege of using scarce radio frequencies as
proxies for the entire community, obligated to give suitable time and attention to matters of great public con-
cern. To condition the granting or renewal of licenses on a willingness to present representative community
views on controversial issues is consistent with the ends and purposes of those constitutional provisions forbid-
ding the abridgment of freedom of speech and freedom of the press. Congress need not stand idly by and permit
those with licenses to ignore the problems which beset the people or to exclude from the airways anything but
their own views of fundamental questions. The statute, long administrative practice, and cases are to this effect
...
§                                                                                                                         PRINT VERSUS . . . | 133

In view of the scarcity of broadcast frequencies, the Government's role in allocating those frequencies, and the
legitimate claims of those unable without governmental assistance to gain access to those frequencies for expres-
sion of their views, we hold the regulations and ruling at issue here are both authorized by statute and constitu-
tional." The judgment of the Court of Appeals in Red Lion is affirmed and that in RTNDA reversed and the
causes remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

STEVENS, J., announced the Court's judgment and delivered an opinion of the Court with respect to Parts
I-III and IV-C, in which BURGER, C. J., and REHNQUIST, J., joined, and in all but Parts IV-A and V-B of
which BLACKMUN and POWELL, JJ., joined, and an opinion as to Parts IV-A and V-B, in which BURGER,
C. J., and REHNQUIST, J., joined.

This case requires that we decide whether the Federal Communications Commission has any power to regulate
a radio broadcast that is indecent but not obscene.

A satiric humorist named George Carlin recorded a 12-minute monologue entitled "Filthy Words" before a live
audience in a California theater. He began by referring to his thoughts about "the words you couldn't say on the
public, ah, airwaves, um, the ones you definitely wouldn't say, ever." He proceeded to list those words and repeat
them over and over again in a variety of colloquialisms. The transcript of the recording, which is appended to
this opinion, indicates frequent laughter from the audience.

At about 2 o'clock in the afternoon on Tuesday, October 30, 1973, a New York radio station, owned by respon-
dent Pacifica Foundation, broadcast the "Filthy Words" monologue. A few weeks later a man, who stated that
134 | PRINT VERSUS . . .

he had heard the broadcast while driving with his young son, wrote a letter complaining to the Commission.
He stated that, although he could perhaps understand the "record's being sold for private use, I certainly cannot
understand the broadcast of same over the air that, supposedly, you control."

The complaint was forwarded to the station for comment. In its response, Pacifica explained that the monologue
had been played during a program about contemporary society's attitude toward language and that, immediately
before its broadcast, listeners had been advised that it included "sensitive language which might be regarded as
offensive to some." Pacifica characterized George Carlin as "a significant social satirist" who "like Twain and Sahl
before him, examines the language of ordinary people. ... Carlin is not mouthing obscenities, he is merely using
words to satirize as harmless and essentially silly our attitudes towards those words." Pacifica stated that it was
not aware of any other complaints about the broadcast ...

The Commission characterized the language used in the Carlin monologue as "patently offensive," though not
necessarily obscene, and expressed the opinion that it should be regulated by principles analogous to those found
in the law of nuisance, where the "law generally speaks to channeling behavior more than actually prohibiting it.
... [T]he concept of `indecent' is intimately connected with the exposure of children to language that describes,
in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium, sex-
ual or excretory activities and organs, at times of the day when there is a reasonable risk that children may be in
the audience." 56 F.C.C.2d at 98.

Applying these considerations to the language used in the monologue as broadcast by respondent, the Com-
mission concluded that certain words depicted sexual and excretory activities in a patently offensive manner,
noted that they "were broadcast at a time when children were undoubtedly in the audience (i.e., in the early
afternoon)," and that the prerecorded language, with these offensive words "repeated over and over," was "delib-
erately broadcast." Id., at 99. In summary, the Commission stated: "We therefore hold that the language as
broadcast was indecent and prohibited by 18 U. S. C. [§] 1464 ..."

The general statements in the Commission's memorandum opinion do not change the character of its order.
Its action was an adjudication under 5 U. S. C. § 554 (e) (1976 ed.); it did not purport to engage in formal rule-
making or in the promulgation of any regulations. The order "was issued in a specific factual context"; questions
concerning possible action in other contexts were expressly reserved for the future. The specific holding was care-
fully confined to the monologue "as broadcast ..."

The relevant statutory questions are whether the Commission's action is forbidden "censorship" within the
meaning of 47 U. S. C. § 326 and whether speech that concededly is not obscene may be restricted as "indecent"
under the authority of 18 U. S. C. § 1464 (1976 ed.). The questions are not unrelated, for the two statutory pro-
visions have a common origin ...

Entirely apart from the fact that the subsequent review of program content is not the sort of censorship at which
the statute was directed, its history makes it perfectly clear that it was not intended to limit the Commission's
power to regulate the broadcast of obscene, indecent, or profane language. A single section of the 1927 Act is
the source of both the anticensorship provision and the Commission's authority to impose sanctions for the
                                                                                                                          PRINT VERSUS . . . | 135

broadcast of indecent or obscene language. Quite plainly, Congress intended to give meaning to both provisions.
Respect for that intent requires that the censorship language be read as inapplicable to the prohibition on broad-
casting obscene, indecent, or profane language.

There is nothing in the legislative history to contradict this conclusion. The provision was discussed only in gen-
eralities when it was first enacted ...

We conclude, therefore, that § 326 does not limit the Commission's authority to impose sanctions on licensees
who engage in obscene, indecent, or profane broadcasting ...

The only other statutory question presented by this case is whether the afternoon broadcast of the "Filthy
Words" monologue was indecent within the meaning of § 1464.13 Even that question is narrowly confined by
the arguments of the parties ...

The plain language of the statute does not support Pacifica's argument. The words "obscene, indecent, or pro-
fane" are written in the disjunctive, implying that each has a separate meaning. Prurient appeal is an element of
the obscene, but the normal definition of "indecent" merely refers to nonconformance with accepted standards
of morality.' ...

Because neither our prior decisions nor the language or history of § 1464 supports the conclusion that prurient
appeal is an essential component of indecent language, we reject Pacifica's construction of the statute. When that
construction is put to one side, there is no basis for disagreeing with the Commission's conclusion that indecent
language was used in this broadcast ...

Pacifica makes two constitutional attacks on the Commission's order. First, it argues that the Commission's con-
struction of the statutory language broadly encompasses so much constitutionally protected speech that rever-
sal is required even if Pacifica's broadcast of the "Filthy Words" monologue is not itself protected by the First
Amendment. Second, Pacifica argues that inasmuch as the recording is not obscene, the Constitution forbids
any abridgment of the right to broadcast it on the radio.

The first argument fails because our review is limited to the question whether the Commission has the authority
to proscribe this particular broadcast. As the Commission itself emphasized, its order was "issued in a specific
factual context." 59 F. C. C. 2d, at 893. That approach is appropriate for courts as well as the Commission when
regulation of indecency is at stake, for indecency is largely a function of context-it cannot be adequately judged
in the abstract ...

When the issue is narrowed to the facts of this case, the question is whether the First Amendment denies gov-
ernment any power to restrict the public broadcast of indecent language in any circumstances. For if the govern-
ment has any such power, this was an appropriate occasion for its exercise ...

The question in this case is whether a broadcast of patently offensive words dealing with sex and excretion may
be regulated because of its content." Obscene materials have been denied the protection of the First Amendment
because their content is so offensive to contemporary moral standards. Roth v. United States (1957). But the fact
that society may find speech offensive is not a sufficient reason for suppressing it. Indeed, if it is the speaker's
136 | PRINT VERSUS . . .

opinion that gives offense, that consequence is a reason for according it constitutional protection. For it is a cen-
tral tenet of the First Amendment that the government must remain neutral in the marketplace of ideas. If there
were any reason to believe that the Commission's characterization of the Carlin monologue as offensive could be
traced to its political content-or even to the fact that it satirized contemporary attitudes about four-letter words
` ___ First Amendment protection might be required. But that is simply not this case. These words offend for
the same reasons that obscenity offends ...

Although these words ordinarily lack literary, political, or scientific value, they are not entirely outside the pro-
tection of the First Amendment. Some uses of even the most offensive words are unquestionably protected.
Indeed, we may assume, arguendo, that this monologue would be protected in other contexts. Nonetheless, the
constitutional protection accorded to a communication containing such patently offensive sexual and excretory
language need not be the same in every context. It is a characteristic of speech such as this that both its capacity
to offend and its "social value," to use Mr. Justice Murphy's term, vary with the circumstances. Words that are
commonplace in one setting are shocking in another. To paraphrase Mr. Justice Harlan, one occasion's lyric is
another's vulgarity. Cohen v. California, (1971) ...

The reasons for these distinctions are complex, but two have relevance to the present case. First, the broadcast
media have established a uniquely pervasive presence in the lives of all Americans. Patently offensive, indecent
material presented over the airwaves confronts the citizen, not only in public, but also in the privacy of the home,
where the individual's right to be left alone plainly outweighs the First Amendment rights of an intruder. Rowan
v. Post Office Dept (1970). Because the broadcast audience is constantly tuning in and out, prior warnings cannot
completely protect the listener or viewer from unexpected program content. To say that one may avoid further
offense by turning off the radio when he hears indecent language is like saying that the remedy for an assault is
to run away after the first blow. One may hang up on an indecent phone call, but that option does not give the
caller a constitutional immunity or avoid a harm that has already taken place.

Second, broadcasting is uniquely accessible to children, even those too young to read. Although Cohen's written
message might have been incomprehensible to a first grader, Pacifica's broadcast could have enlarged a child's
vocabulary in an instant. Other forms of offensive expression may be withheld from the young without restrict-
ing the expression at its source. Bookstores and motion picture theaters, for example, may be prohibited from
making indecent material available to children ...

The Commission's decision rested entirely on a nuisance rationale under which context is all-important. The
concept requires consideration of a host of variables. The time of day was emphasized by the Commission. The
content of the program in which the language is used will also affect the composition of the audience, and dif-
ferences between radio, television, and perhaps closed-circuit transmissions, may also be relevant. As Mr. Justice
Sutherland wrote, a "nuisance may be merely a right thing in the wrong place, like a pig in the parlor instead of
the barnyard." Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co. (1926). We simply hold that when the Commission finds that a pig
has entered the parlor, the exercise of its regulatory power does not depend on proof that the pig is obscene.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.

It is so ordered.

JUSTICE KENNEDY announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion of the Court, except as
to Part III-B.

Sections 4 and 5 of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 require cable tele-
vision systems to devote a portion of their channels to the transmission of local broadcast television stations.
This case presents the question whether these provisions abridge the freedom of speech or of the press, in viola-
tion of the First Amendment ...

On October 5, 1992, Congress overrode a Presidential veto to enact the Cable Television Consumer Protection
and Competition Act of 1992, Pub. L. 102-385, 106 Stat. 1460 (1992 Cable Act or Act). Among other things,
the Act subjects the cable industry to rate regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and
by municipal franchising authorities; prohibits municipalities from awarding exclusive franchises to cable oper-
ators; imposes various restrictions on cable programmers that are affiliated with cable operators; and directs the
FCC to develop and promulgate regulations imposing minimum technical standards for cable operators. At
issue in this case is the constitutionality of the so-called must-carry provisions, contained in §§ 4 and 5 of the Act,
which require cable operators to carry the signals of a specified number of local broadcast television stations.
138 | PRINT VERSUS . . .

Section 4 requires carriage of "local commercial television stations," defined to include all full power television
broadcasters, other than those qualifying as "noncommercial educational" stations under § 5, that operate
within the same television market as the cable system ...

Section 5 of the Act imposes similar requirements regarding the carriage of local public broadcast television sta-
tions, referred to in the Act as local "noncommercial educational television stations," ...

Taken together, therefore, §§4 and 5 subject all but the smallest cable systems nationwide to must-carry obliga-
tions, and confer must-carry privileges on all full power broadcasters operating within the same television mar-
ket as a qualified cable system ...

In particular, Congress found that over 60 percent of the households with television sets subscribe to cable, §
2(a)(3), and for these households cable has replaced over-the-air broadcast television as the primary provider of
video programming, § 2(a)(17) ...

In addition, Congress concluded that due to "local franchising requirements and the extraordinary expense of
constructing more than one cable television system to serve a particular geographic area," the overwhelming
majority of cable operators exercise a monopoly over cable service ...

According to Congress, this market position gives cable operators the power and the incentive to harm broadcast
competitors. The power derives from the cable operator's ability, as owner of the transmission facility, to "ter-
minate the retransmission of the broadcast signal, refuse to carry new signals, or reposition a broadcast signal to
a disadvantageous channel position." ...

Soon after the Act became law, appellants filed these five consolidated actions in the United States District Court
for the District of Columbia against the United States and the Federal Communications Commission (here-
inafter referred to collectively as the Government), challenging the constitutionality of the must-carry provisions
...

There can be no disagreement on an initial premise: Cable programmers and cable operators engage in and trans-
mit speech, and they are entitled to the protection of the speech and press provisions of the First Amendment ...

Nevertheless, because not every interference with speech triggers the same degree of scrutiny under the First
Amendment, we must decide at the outset the level of scrutiny applicable to the must-carry provisions ...

We address first the Government's contention that regulation of cable television should be analyzed under the
same First Amendment standard that applies to regulation of broadcast television. It is true that our cases have
permitted more intrusive regulation of broadcast speakers than of speakers in other media. Compare Red Lion
Broadcasting Co. v. FCC (1969) (television), and National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, (1943) (radio),
with Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, (1974) (print), and Riley v. National Federation of Blind of N.
c., Inc., (1988) (personal solicitation). But the rationale for applying a less rigorous standard of First Amend-
ment scrutiny to broadcast regulation, whatever its validity in the cases elaborating it, does not apply in the con-
text of cable regulation.
                                                                                                                          PRINT VERSUS . . . | 139

The justification for our distinct approach to broadcast regulation rests upon the unique physical limitations
of the broadcast medium. As a general matter, there are more would-be broadcasters than frequencies available
in the electromagnetic spectrum. And if two broadcasters were to attempt to transmit over the same frequency
in the same locale, they would interfere with one another's signals, so that neither could be heard at all. The
scarcity of broadcast frequencies thus required the establishment of some regulatory mechanism to divide the
electromagnetic spectrum and assign specific frequencies to particular broadcasters.

...

Although the Government acknowledges the substantial technological differences between broadcast and cable
... It asserts that the foundation of our broadcast jurisprudence is not the physical limitations of the electro-mag-
netic spectrum, but rather the "market dysfunction" that characterizes the broadcast market. Because the cable
market is beset by a similar dysfunction, the Government maintains, the Red Lion standard of review should
also apply to cable. While we agree that the cable market suffers certain structural impediments, the Govern-
ment's argument is flawed in two respects. First, as discussed above, the special physical characteristics of broad-
cast transmission, not the economic characteristics of the broadcast market, are what underlies our broadcast
jurisprudence ... Second, the mere assertion of dysfunction or failure in a speech market, without more, is not
sufficient to shield a speech regulation from the First Amendment standards applicable to nonbroadcast media
...

By a related course of reasoning, the Government and some appellees maintain that the must-carry provisions
are nothing more than industry-specific antitrust legislation, and thus warrant rational-basis scrutiny under
this Court's "precedents governing legislative efforts to correct market failure in a market whose commodity is
speech," such as Associated Press v. United States (1945) and Lorain Journal Co. v. United States (1951). This
contention is unavailing ... But while the enforcement of a generally applicable law may or may not be subject
to heightened scrutiny under the First Amendment, subject to at least some degree of heightened First Amend-
ment scrutiny ...

At the heart of the First Amendment lies the principle that each person should decide for himself or herself the
ideas and beliefs deserving of expression, consideration, and adherence. Our political system and cultural life rest
upon this ideal ...

For these reasons, the First Amendment, subject only to narrow and well-understood exceptions, does not coun-
tenance governmental control over the content of messages expressed by private individuals ...

Our precedents thus apply the most exacting scrutiny to regulations that suppress, disadvantage, or impose dif-
ferential burdens upon speech because of its content ...

Insofar as they pertain to the carriage of full-power broadcasters, the must-carry rules, on their face, impose bur-
dens and confer benefits without reference to the content of speech. Although the provisions interfere with
cable operators' editorial discretion by compelling them to offer carriage to a certain minimum number of
broadcast stations, the extent of the interference does not depend upon the content of the cable operators'
programming. The rules impose obligations upon all operators, save those with fewer than 300 subscribers,
140 | PRINT VERSUS . . .

regardless of the programs or stations they now offer or have offered in the past. Nothing in the Act imposes a
restriction, penalty, or burden by reason of the views, programs, or stations the cable operator has selected or will
select. The number of channels a cable operator must set aside depends only on the operator's channel capacity
...

It is true that the must-carry provisions distinguish between speakers in the television programming market. But
they do so based only upon the manner in which speakers transmit their messages to viewers, and not upon
the messages they carry: Broadcasters, which transmit over the airwaves, are favored, while cable programmers,
which do not, are disfavored. Cable operators, too, are burdened by the carriage obligations, but only because
they control access to the cable conduit. So long as they are not a subtle means of exercising a content preference,
speaker distinctions of this nature are not presumed invalid under the First Amendment ...

That the must-carry provisions, on their face, do not burden or benefit speech of a particular content does not
end the inquiry. Our cases have recognized that even a regulation neutral on its face may be content based if its
manifest purpose is to regulate speech because of the message it conveys. United States v. Eichman, (1990) ...

Appellants contend, in this regard, that the must-carry regulations are content based because Congress' purpose
in enacting them was to promote speech of a favored content. We do not agree. Our review of the Act and its
various findings persuades us that Congress' overriding objective in enacting must-carry was not to favor pro-
gramming of a particular subject matter, viewpoint, or format, but rather to preserve access to free television
programming for the 40 percent of Americans without cable ...

By preventing cable operators from refusing carriage to broadcast television stations, the must-carry rules ensure
that broadcast television stations will retain a large enough potential audience to earn necessary advertising rev-
enue-or, in the case of noncommercial broadcasters, sufficient viewer contributions, see § 2(a)(8)(B)-to maintain
their continued operation. In so doing, the provisions are designed to guarantee the survival of a medium that
has become a vital part of the Nation's communication system, and to ensure that every individual with a televi-
sion set can obtain access to free television programming ...

This overriding congressional purpose is unrelated to the content of expression disseminated by cable and broad-
cast speakers. Indeed, our precedents have held that "protecting noncable households from loss of regular tele-
vision broadcasting service due to competition from cable systems," is not only a permissible governmental
justification, but an "important and substantial federal interest." Capital Cities Cable Inc v. Crisp (1984) ...

In short, the must-carry provisions are not designed to favor or disadvantage speech of any particular content.
Rather, they are meant to protect broadcast television from what Congress determined to be unfair competition
by cable systems. In enacting the provisions, Congress sought to preserve the existing structure of the Nation's
broadcast television medium while permitting the concomitant expansion and development of cable television,
and, in particular, to ensure that broadcast television remains available as a source of video programming for
those without cable. Appellants' ability to hypothesize a content-based purpose for these provisions rests on lit-
tle more than speculation and does not cast doubt upon the content-neutral character of must-carry ...
                                                                                                                          PRINT VERSUS . . . | 141

The Government's assertion that the must-carry rules are necessary to protect the viability of broadcast televi-
sion rests on two essential propositions: (1) that unless cable operators are compelled to carry broadcast stations,
significant numbers of broadcast stations will be refused carriage on cable systems; and (2) that the broadcast
stations denied carriage will either deteriorate to a substantial degree or fail altogether.

As support for the first proposition, the Government relies upon a 1988 FCC study showing, at a time when no
must- carry rules were in effect, that approximately 20 percent of cable systems reported dropping or refusing
carriage to one or more local broadcast stations on at least one occasion ... The record does not indicate, how-
ever, the time frame within which these drops occurred, or how many of these stations were dropped for only
a temporary period and then restored to carriage. The same FCC study indicates that about 23 percent of the
cable operators reported shifting the channel positions of one or more local broadcast stations, and that, in most
cases, the repositioning was done for "marketing" rather than "technical" reasons ...

The parties disagree about the significance of these statistics. But even if one accepts them as evidence that a large
number of broadcast stations would be dropped or repositioned in the absence of must-carry, the Government
must further demonstrate that broadcasters so affected would suffer financial difficulties as a result. Without a
more substantial elaboration in the District Court of the predictive or historical evidence upon which Congress
relied, or the introduction of some additional evidence to establish that the dropped or repositioned broadcast-
ers would be at serious risk of financial difficulty, we cannot determine whether the threat to broadcast televi-
sion is real enough to overcome the challenge to the provisions made by these appellants. We think it significant,
for instance, that the parties have not presented any evidence that local broadcast stations have fallen into bank-
ruptcy, turned in their broadcast licenses, curtailed their broadcast operations, or suffered a serious reduction in
operating revenues as a result of their being dropped from, or otherwise disadvantaged by, cable systems ...

The paucity of evidence indicating that broadcast television is in jeopardy is not the only deficiency in this
record. Also lacking are any findings concerning the actual effects of must-carry on the speech of cable operators
and cable programmers-i.e., the extent to which cable operators will, in fact, be forced to make changes in their
current or anticipated programming selections; the degree to which cable programmers will be dropped from
cable systems to make room for local broadcasters; and the extent to which cable operators can satisfy their
must-carry obligations by devoting previously unused channel capacity to the carriage of local broadcasters. The
answers to these and perhaps other questions are critical to the narrow tailoring step of the O'Brien analysis, for
unless we know the extent to which the must-carry provisions in fact interfere with protected speech, we cannot
say whether they suppress "substantially more speech than ... necessary" to ensure the viability of broadcast tele-
vision.

In sum, because there are genuine issues of material fact still to be resolved on this record, we hold that the Dis-
trict Court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the Government ... Because of the unresolved factual
questions, the importance of the issues to the broadcast and cable industries, and the conflicting conclusions
that the parties contend are to be drawn from the statistics and other evidence presented, we think it necessary
to permit the parties to develop a more thorough factual record, and to allow the District Court to resolve any
factual disputes remaining, before passing upon the constitutional validity of the challenged provisions.

United States et. al v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc.

529 U.S. 803 (2000)

    Decision: 5-4
    Decision: Affirmed
    Majority: Kennedy, joined by Stevens, Souter, Thomas, Ginsburg
    Concurrence: Stevens, joined by Thomas
    Dissent: Breyer, joined by Rehnquist, O'Connor, Scalia

JUSTICE KENNEDY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.

This case presents a challenge to § 505 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-104, 110 Stat. 136,
47 U. S. C. § 561 (1994 ed., Supp. III). Section 505 requires cable television operators who provide channels
"primarily dedicated to sexually-oriented programming" either to "fully scramble or otherwise fully block" those
channels or to limit their transmission to hours when children are unlikely to be viewing, set by administrative
regulation as the time between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. 47 U. S. C. § 561(a) (1994 ed., Supp. III); 47 CFR § 76.227
(1999). Even before enactment of the statute, signal scrambling was already in use. Cable operators used scram-
bling in the regular course of business, so that only paying customers had access to certain programs. Scrambling
could be imprecise, however; and either or both audio and visual portions of the scrambled programs might be
heard or seen, a phenomenon known as "signal bleed." The purpose of § 505 is to shield children from hearing
or seeing images resulting from signal bleed.

To comply with the statute, the majority of cable operators adopted the second, or "time channeling," approach.
The effect of the widespread adoption of time channeling was to eliminate altogether the transmission of the tar-
geted programming outside the safe harbor period in affected cable service areas. In other words, for two-thirds
of the day no household in those service areas could receive the programming, whether or not the household or
the viewer wanted to do so.

Appellee Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., challenged the statute as unnecessarily restrictive content-based
legislation violative of the First Amendment. After a trial, a three-judge District Court concluded that a regime
in which viewers could order signal blocking on a household-by household basis presented an effective, less
restrictive alternative to § 505. 30 F. Supp. 2d 702, 719 (Del. 1998). Finding no error in this conclusion, we
affirm.
                                                                                                                          PRINT VERSUS . . . | 143

Playboy Entertainment Group owns and prepares programs for adult television networks, including Playboy
Television and Spice. Playboy transmits its programming to cable television operators, who retransmit it to their
subscribers, either through monthly subscriptions to premium channels or on a so-called "pay-per-view" basis.
Cable operators transmit Playboy's signal, like other premium channel signals, in scrambled form. The opera-
tors then provide

paying subscribers with an "addressable converter," a box placed on the home television set. The converter per-
mits the viewer to see and hear the descrambled signal. It is conceded that almost all of Playboy's programming
consists of sexually explicit material as defined by the statute ...

When the statute became operative, most cable operators had "no practical choice but to curtail [the targeted]
programming during the [regulated] sixteen hours or risk the penalties imposed ... if any audio or video signal
bleed occur[red] during [those] times." 30 F. Supp. 2d, at 711. The majority of operators-"in one survey, 69%"-
complied with § 505 by time channeling the targeted programmers. Ibid. Since "30 to 50% of all adult program-
ming is viewed by households prior to 10 p.m.," the result was a significant restriction of communication, with
a corresponding reduction in Playboy's revenues ...

Two essential points should be understood concerning the speech at issue here. First, we shall assume that many
adults themselves would find the material highly offensive; and when we consider the further circumstance that
the material comes unwanted into homes where children might see or hear it against parental wishes or con-
sent, there are legitimate reasons for regulating it. Second, all parties bring the case to us on the premise that
Playboy's programming has First Amendment protection. As this case has been litigated, it is not alleged to be
obscene; adults have a constitutional right to view it; the Government disclaims any interest in preventing chil-
dren from seeing or hearing it with the consent of their parents; and Playboy has concomitant rights under the
First Amendment to transmit it. These points are undisputed.

The speech in question is defined by its content; and the statute which seeks to restrict it is content based. Sec-
tion 505 applies only to channels primarily dedicated to "sexually explicit adult programming or other program-
ming that is indecent." The statute is unconcerned with signal bleed from any other channels. See 945 F. Supp.,
at 785 ("[Section 505] does not apply when signal bleed occurs on other premium channel networks, like HBO
or the Disney Channel"). The overriding justification for the regulation is concern for the effect of the sub-
ject matter on young viewers. Section 505 is not "`justified without reference to the content of the regulated
speech."` Ward v. Rock Against Racism (1989) ...

To prohibit this much speech is a significant restriction of communication between speakers and willing adult
listeners, communication which enjoys First Amendment protection. It is of no moment that the statute does
not impose a complete prohibition. The distinction between laws burdening and laws banning speech is but a
matter of degree. The Government's content-based burdens must satisfy the same rigorous scrutiny as its con-
tent-based bans ...
144 | PRINT VERSUS . . .

Since § 505 is a content-based speech restriction, it can stand only if it satisfies strict scrutiny. Sable Communica­
tions of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, (1989). If a statute regulates speech based on its content, it must be narrowly tailored to
promote a compelling Government interest. Ibid. If a less restrictive alternative would serve the Government's
purpose, the legislature must use that alternative ...

The District Court concluded that a less restrictive alternative is available: §504, with adequate publicity. 30 F.
Supp. 2d, at 719-720. No one disputes that § 504, which requires cable operators to block undesired channels at
individual households upon request, is narrowly tailored to the Government's goal of supporting parents who
want those channels blocked. The question is whether § 504 can be effective.

When a plausible, less restrictive alternative is offered to a content-based speech restriction, it is the Govern-
ment's obligation to prove that the alternative will be ineffective to achieve its goals. The Government has not
met that burden here. In support of its position, the Government cites empirical evidence showing that § 504,
as promulgated and implemented before trial, generated few requests for household-by-household blocking.
Between March 1996 and May 1997, while the Government was enjoined from enforcing § 505, § 504 remained
in operation. A survey of cable operators determined that fewer than 0.5% of cable subscribers requested full
blocking during that time. The uncomfortable fact is the § 504 was the sole blocking regulation in effect for over
a year; and the public greeted it with a collective yawn.

... It is through speech that our convictions and beliefs are influenced, expressed, and tested. It is through speech
that we bring those beliefs to bear on Government and on society. It is through speech that our personalities are
formed and expressed. The citizen is entitled to seek out or reject certain ideas or influences without Govern-
ment interference or control ...

It is rare that a regulation restricting speech because of its content will ever be permissible. Indeed, were we to
give the Government the benefit of the doubt when it attempted to restrict speech, we would risk leaving regu-
lations in place that sought to shape our unique personalities

or to silence dissenting ideas. When First Amendment compliance is the point to be proved, the risk of non-per-
suasion operative in all trials-must rest with the Government, not with the citizen ...

The District Court's thorough discussion exposes a central weakness in the Government's proof: There is little
hard evidence of how widespread or how serious the problem of signal bleed is. Indeed, there is no proof as
to how likely any child is to view a discernible explicit image, and no proof of the duration of the bleed or the
quality of the pictures or sound. To say that millions of children are subject to a risk of viewing signal bleed is
one thing; to avoid articulating the true nature and extent of the risk is quite another. Under §505, sanctionable
signal bleed can include instances as fleeting as an image appearing on a screen for just a few seconds. The First
Amendment requires a more careful assessment and characterization of an evil in order to justify a regulation as
sweeping as this ...
§                                                                                                                         PRINT VERSUS . . . | 145

If television broadcasts can expose children to the real risk of harmful exposure to indecent materials, even in
their own home and without parental consent, there is a problem the Government can address. It must do so,
however, in a way consistent with First Amendment principles. Here the Government has not met the burden
the First Amendment imposes.

The Government has failed to show that § 505 is the least restrictive means for addressing a real problem; and
the District Court did not err in holding the statute violative of the First Amendment. In light of our ruling, it is
unnecessary to address the second question presented: whether the District Court was divested of jurisdiction to
consider the Government's post judgment motions after the Government filed a notice of appeal in this Court.
The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

JUSTICE STEVENS DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.

At issue is the constitutionality of two statutory provisions enacted to protect minors from "indecent" and
"patently offensive" communications on the Internet ...

Though such material is widely available, users seldom encounter such content accidentally." A document's title
or a description of the document will usually appear before the document itself ... and in many cases the user
will receive detailed information about a site's content before he or she need take the step to access the docu-
ment. Almost all sexually explicit images are preceded by warnings as to the content." For that reason, the "odds
are slim" that a user would enter a sexually explicit site by accident. Unlike communications received by radio
or television, "the receipt of information on the Internet requires a series of affirmative steps more deliberate
and directed than merely turning a dial. A child requires some sophistication and some ability to read to retrieve
material and thereby to use the Internet unattended." ...

Systems have been developed to help parents control the material that may be available on a home computer
with Internet access. A system may either limit a computer's access to an approved list of sources that have
been identified as containing no adult material, it may block designated inappropriate sites, or it may attempt to
146 | PRINT VERSUS . . .

block messages containing identifiable objectionable features."Although parental control software currently can
screen for certain suggestive words or for known sexually explicit sites, it cannot now screen for sexually explicit
images." Nevertheless, the evidence indicates that "a reasonably effective method by which parents can prevent
their children from accessing sexually explicit and other material which parents may believe is inappropriate for
their children will soon be widely available." ...

The problem of age verification differs for different uses of the Internet. The District Court categorically deter-
mined that there "is no effective way to determine the identity or the age of a user who is accessing material
through e-mail, mail exploders, newsgroups or chat rooms." The Government offered no evidence that there
was a reliable way to screen recipients and participants in such forums for age. Moreover, even if it were techno-
logically feasible to block minors' access to newsgroups and chat rooms containing discussions of art, politics, or
other subjects that potentially elicit "indecent" or "patently offensive" contributions, it would not be possible to
block their access to that material and "still allow them access to the remaining content, even if the overwhelm-
ing majority of that content was not indecent ...

An amendment offered in the Senate was the source of the two statutory provisions challenged in this case. They
are informally described as the "indecent transmission" provision and the "patently offensive display" provision
...

The breadth of these prohibitions is qualified by two affirmative defenses. See § 223(e)(5). One covers those who
take "good faith, reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions" to restrict access by minors to the prohibited
communications. § 223(e)(5)(A). The other covers those who restrict access to covered material by requiring cer-
tain designated forms of age proof, such as a verified credit card or an adult identification number or code ...

On February 8, 1996, immediately after the President signed the statute, 20 plaintiffs filed suit against the Attor-
ney General of the United States and the Department of Justice challenging the constitutionality of §§223(a)(1)
and 223(d). A week later, based on his conclusion that the term "indecent" was too vague to provide the basis for
a criminal prosecution, District Judge Buckwalter entered a temporary restraining order against enforcement of
§ 223(a)(1)(B)(ii) insofar as it applies to indecent communications. A second suit was then filed by 27 additional
plaintiffs, the two cases were consolidated, and a three-judge District Court was convened pursuant to § 561 of
the CDA. After an evidentiary hearing, that court entered a preliminary injunction against enforcement of both
of the challenged provisions. Each of the three judges wrote a separate opinion, but their judgment was unani-
mous ...

The judgement of the District Court enjoins the Government from enforcing the prohibitions ... The Govern-
ment appealed. ... we noted probable jurisdiction. In its appeal, the Government argues that the District Court
erred in holding that the CDA violated the First Amendment because it is overbroad and the Fifth Amendment
because it is vague ...

In arguing for reversal, the Government contends that the CDA is plainly constitutional under three of our prior
decisions: (1) Ginsberg v. New York, (1968); (2) FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, (1978); and (3) Renton v. Playtime
Theatres, Inc., (1986). A close look at these cases, however, raises-rather than relieves-doubts concerning the
constitutionality of the CDA ...
                                                                                                                          PRINT VERSUS . . . | 147

These precedents, then, surely do not require us to uphold the CDA and are fully consistent with the application
of the most stringent review of its provisions ...

In Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. V. Conrad, (1975), we observed the "[e]ach medium of expression ... may pre-
sent its own problems." Thus, some of our cases have recognized special justifications for the regulation of
broadcast media that are not application to other speakers ... In these cases, the Court relied on the history of
extensive government regulation of the broadcast medium; the scarcity of available frequencies at its inception;
and its "invasive" nature ...

... unlike the conditions that prevailed when Congress first authorized regulation of the broadcast spectrum,
the Internet can hardly be considered a "scarce" expressive commodity. It provides relatively unlimited, low-cost
capacity for communication of all kinds ... This dynamic, multifaceted category of communication includes not
only traditional print and news services, but also audio, video, and still images, as well as interactive, real-time
dialogue. Through the use of chat rooms, any person with a phone line can become a town crier with a voice
that resonates farther than it could from any soapbox. Through the use of Web pages, mail exploders, and news-
groups, the same individual can become a pamphleteer. As the District Court found, "the content on the Inter-
net is as diverse as human thought." 929 F. Supp., at 842 (finding 74). We agree with its conclusion that our cases
provide no basis for qualifying the level of First Amendment scrutiny that should be applied to this medium ...

Regardless of whether the CDA is so vague that it violates the Fifth Amendment, the many ambiguities con-
cerning the scope of its coverage render it problematic for purposes of

the First Amendment. For instance, each of the two parts of the CDA uses a different linguistic form. The first
uses the word "indecent," 47 U. S. C. § 223(a) (1994 ed., Supp. II), while the second speaks of material that "in
context, depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards,
sexual or excretory activities or organs," § 223(d). Given the absence of a definition of either term, this difference
in language will provoke uncertainty among speakers about how the two standards relate to each other36 and
just what they mean. Could a speaker confidently assume that a serious discussion about birth control practices,
homosexuality, the First Amendment issues raised by the Appendix to our Pacifica opinion, or the consequences
of prison rape would not violate the CDA? This uncertainty undermines the likelihood that the CDA has been
carefully tailored to the congressional goal of protecting minors from potentially harmful materials ...

The vagueness of the CDA is a matter of special concern for two reasons. First, the CDA is a content-based reg-
ulation of speech. The vagueness of such a regulation raises special First Amendment concerns because of its
obvious chilling effect on free speech ... Second, the CDA

is a criminal statute. In addition to the opprobrium and stigma of a criminal conviction, the CDA threatens vio-
lators with penalties including up to two years in prison for each act of violation. The severity of criminal sanc-
tions may well cause speakers to remain silent rather than communicate even arguably unlawful words, ideas,
and images ...

We are persuaded that the CDA lacks the precision that the First Amendment requires when a statute regulates
the content of speech. In order to deny minors access to potentially harmful speech, the CDA effectively sup-
148 | PRINT VERSUS . . .

presses a large amount of speech that adults have a constitutional right to receive and to address to one another.
That burden on adult speech is unacceptable if less restrictive alternatives would be at least as effective in achiev-
ing the legitimate purpose that the statute was enacted to serve ...

In evaluating the free speech rights of adults, we have made it perfectly clear that "[s]exual expression which is
indecent but not obscene is protected by the First Amendment." Sable, (1989) Indeed, Pacifica itself admon-
ished that "the fact that society may find speech offensive is not a sufficient reason for suppressing it." ...

The breadth of the CDA's coverage is wholly unprecedented. Unlike the regulations upheld in Ginsberg v. New
York (1968) and Pacifica, the scope of the CDA is not limited to commercial speech or commercial entities. Its
open-ended prohibitions embrace all nonprofit entities and individuals posting indecent messages or displaying
them on their own computers in the presence of minors. The general, undefined terms "indecent" and "patently
offensive" cover large amounts of nonpornographic material with serious educational or other value." Moreover,
the "community standards" criterion as applied to the Internet means that any communication available to a
nationwide audience will be judged by the standards of the community most likely to be offended by the mes-
sage. The regulated subject matter includes any of the seven "dirty words" used in the Pacifica monologue, the
use of which the Government's expert acknowledged could constitute a felony ... It may also extend to discus-
sions about prison rape or safe sexual practices, artistic images that include nude subjects, and arguably the card
catalog of the Carnegie Library ...

The breadth of this content-based restriction of speech imposes an especially heavy burden on the Government
to explain why a less restrictive provision would not be as effective as the CDA. It has not done so. The argu-
ments in this Court have referred to possible alternatives such as requiring that indecent material be "tagged"
in a way that facilitates parental control of material coming into their homes, making exceptions for messages
with artistic or educational value, providing some tolerance for parental choice, and regulating some portions of
the Internet-such as commercial Web sites-differently from others, such as chat rooms. Particularly in the light
of the absence of any detailed findings by the Congress, or even hearings addressing the special problems of the
CDA, we are persuaded that the CDA is not narrowly tailored if that requirement has any meaning at all ...

Finally, we find no textual support for the Government's submission that material having scientific, educational,
or other redeeming social value will necessarily fall outside the CDA's "patently offensive" and "indecent" pro-
hibitions ...

In this Court, though not in the District Court, the Government asserts that-in addition to its interest in pro-
tecting children-its "[e]qually significant" interest in fostering the growth of the Internet provides an indepen-
dent basis for upholding the constitutionality of the CDA ... The Government apparently assumes that the
unregulated availability of "indecent" and "patently offensive" material on the Internet is driving countless cit-
izens away from the medium because of the risk of exposing themselves or their children to harmful material.
We find this argument singularly unpersuasive. The dramatic expansion of this new marketplace of ideas con-
tradicts the factual basis of this contention. The record demonstrates that the growth of the Internet has been
and continues to be phenomenal. As a matter of constitutional tradition, in the absence of evidence to the con-
                                                                                                                          PRINT VERSUS . . . | 149

trary, we presume that governmental regulation of the content of speech is more likely to interfere with the free
exchange of ideas than to encourage it. The interest in encouraging freedom of expression in a democratic soci-
ety outweighs any theoretical but unproven benefit of censorship.

For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

MR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.

...

A New Jersey statute authorizes its local school districts to make rules and contracts for the transportation of
children to and from schools. The appellee, a township board of education, acting pursuant to this statute,
authorized reimbursement to parents of money expended by them for the bus transportation of their children
on regular busses operated by the public transportation system. Part of this money was for the payment of trans-
portation of some children in the community to Catholic parochial schools. These church schools give their
students, in addition to secular education, regular religious instruction conforming to the religious tenets and
modes of worship of the Catholic Faith. The superintendent of these schools is a Catholic priest.

The appellant, in his capacity as a district taxpayer, filed suit in a state court challenging the right of the Board
to reimburse parents of parochial school students. He contended that the statute and the resolution passed pur-
suant to it violated both the State and the Federal Constitutions. That court held that the legislature was with-
out power to authorize such payment under the state constitution ...

The only contention here is that the state statute and the resolution, insofar as they authorized reimbursement
to parents of children attending parochial schools, violate the Federal Constitution in these two respects, which
to some extent overlap. First. They authorize the State to take by taxation the private property of some and
bestow it upon others, to be used for their own private purposes. This, it is alleged, violates the due process
clause of the Fourteenth' Amendment. Second. The statute and the resolution forced inhabitants to pay taxes to
help support and maintain schools which are dedicated to, and which regularly teach, the Catholic Faith. This is
alleged to be a use of state power to support church schools contrary to the prohibition of the First Amendment
which the Fourteenth Amendment made applicable to the states.

First. The due process argument that the state law taxes some people to help others carry out their private pur-
poses is framed in two phases. The first phase is that a state cannot tax A to reimburse B for the cost of trans-
                                                                                                              ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE | 153

porting his children to church schools. It is said to violate the due process clause because the children are sent
to these church schools to satisfy the personal desires of their parents, rather than the public's interest in the
general education of all children. This argument, if valid, would apply equally to prohibit state payment for the
transportation of children to any non-public school, whether operated by a church or any other non-govern-
ment individual or group. But the New Jersey legislature has decided that a public purpose will be served by
using tax-raised funds to pay the bus fares of all school children, including those who attend parochial schools.
The New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals has reached the same conclusion. The fact that a state law, passed
to satisfy a public need, coincides with the personal desires of the individuals most directly affected is certainly
an inadequate reason for us to say that a legislature has erroneously appraised the public need ...

...

Second. The New Jersey statute is challenged as a "law respecting an establishment of religion." The First
Amendment, as made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth, Murdock v. Pennsylvania (1943), commands
that a state "shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
..." These words of the First Amendment reflected in the minds of early Americans a vivid mental picture of
conditions and practices which they fervently wished to stamp out in order to preserve liberty for themselves and
for their posterity. Doubtless their goal has not been entirely reached; but so far has the Nation moved toward it
that the expression "law respecting an establishment of religion," probably does not so vividly remind present-
day Americans of the evils, fears, and political problems that caused that expression to be written into our Bill of
Rights. Whether this New Jersey law is one respecting an "establishment of religion" requires an understanding
of the meaning of that language, particularly with respect to the imposition of taxes. Once again, therefore, it is
not inappropriate briefly to review the background and environment of the period in which that constitutional
language was fashioned and adopted.

A large proportion of the early settlers of this country came here from Europe to escape the bondage of laws
which compelled them to support and attend government-favored churches. The centuries immediately before
and contemporaneous with the colonization of America had been filled with turmoil, civil strife and persecu-
tions, generated in large part by established sects determined to maintain their absolute political and religious
supremacy. With the power of government supporting them, at various times and places, Catholics had perse-
cuted Protestants, Protestants had persecuted Catholics, Protestant sects had persecuted other Protestant sects,
Catholics of one shade of belief had persecuted Catholics of another shade of belief, and all of these had from
time to time persecuted Jews. In efforts to force loyalty to whatever religious group happened to be on top and
in league with the government of a particular time and place, men and women had been fined, cast in jail, cruelly
tortured, and killed. Among the offenses for which these punishments had been inflicted were such things as
speaking disrespectfully of the views of ministers of government-established churches, non-attendance at those
churches, expressions of nonbelief in their doctrines, and failure to pay taxes and tithes to support them.

These practices of the old world were transplanted to, and began to thrive in, the soil of the new America. The
very charters granted by the English Crown to the individuals and companies designated to make the laws which
would control the destinies of the colonials authorized these individuals and companies to erect religious estab-
lishments which all, whether believers or nonbelievers, would be required to support and attend. An exercise
154 | ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE

of this authority was accompanied by a repetition of many of the old-world practices and persecutions ... These
practices became so commonplace as to shock the freedom-loving colonials into a feeling of abhorrence. The
imposition of taxes to pay ministers' salaries and to build and maintain churches and church property aroused
their indignation. It was these feelings which found expression in the First Amendment ...

... Prior to the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, the First Amendment did not apply as a restraint
against the states. Most of them did soon provide similar constitutional protections for religious liberty. But
some states persisted for about half a century in imposing restraints upon the free exercise of religion and in
discriminating against particular religious groups. In recent years, so far as the provision against the establish-
ment of a religion is concerned, the question has most frequently arisen in connection with proposed state aid
to church schools and efforts to carry on religious teachings in the public schools in accordance with the tenets
of a particular sect. Some churches have either sought or accepted state financial support for their schools. Here
again, the efforts to obtain state aid or acceptance of it have not been limited to any one particular faith. The
state courts, in the main, have remained faithful to the language of their own constitutional provisions designed
to protect religious freedom and to separate religions and governments. Their decisions, however, show the dif-
ficulty in drawing the line between tax legislation which provides funds for the welfare of the general public and
that which is designed to support institutions which teach religion.

...

The meaning and scope of the First Amendment, preventing establishment of religion or prohibiting the free
exercise thereof, in the light of its history and the evils it was designed forever to suppress, have been several times
elaborated by the decisions of this Court prior to the application of the First Amendment to the states by the
Fourteenth.' The broad meaning given the Amendment by these earlier cases has been accepted by this Court
in its decisions concerning an individual's religious freedom rendered since the Fourteenth Amendment was
interpreted to make the prohibitions of the First applicable to state action abridging religious freedom." There
is every reason to give the same application and broad interpretation to the "establishment of religion" clause.
The "establishment of religion" clause of the First Amendment means at least this: neither a state nor the Federal
Government can set up a church. Neither can pass laws which aid one religion, aid all religions, or prefer one
religion over another. Neither can force nor influence a person to go to or to remain away from church against
his will or force him to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion. No person can be punished for entertaining or
professing religious beliefs or disbeliefs, for church attendance or non-attendance. No tax in any amount, large
or small, can be levied to support any religious activities or institutions, whatever they may be called, or what-
ever form they may adopt to teach or practice religion. Neither a state nor the Federal Government can, openly
or secretly, participate in the affairs of any religious organizations or groups, and vice versa. In the words of Jef-
ferson, the clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect "a wall of separation between
church and State." Reynolds v. United States, supra.

We must consider the New Jersey statute in accordance with the foregoing limitations imposed by the First
Amendment. But we must not strike that state statute down if it is within the State's constitutional power, even
though it approaches the verge of that power. New Jersey cannot consistently with the "establishment of reli-
gion" clause of the First Amendment contribute tax-raised funds to the support of an institution which teaches
                                                                                                              ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE | 155

the tenets and faith of any church. On the other hand, other language of the amendment commands that New
Jersey cannot hamper its citizens in the free exercise of their own religion. Consequently, it cannot exclude indi-
vidual Catholics, Lutherans, Mohammedans, Baptists. Jews, Methodists, Non-believers, Presbyterians or the
members of any other faith, because of their faith, or lack of it, from receiving the benefits of public welfare
legislation. While we do not mean to intimate that a state could not provide transportation only to children
attending public schools, we must be careful, in protecting the citizens of New Jersey against state-established
churches, to be sure that we do not inadvertently prohibit New Jersey from extending its general state law bene-
fits to all its citizens without regard to their religious belief ...

Measured by these standards, we cannot say that the First Amendment prohibits New Jersey from spending tax-
raised funds to pay the bus fares of parochial school pupils as a part of a general program under which it pays
the fares of pupils attending public and other schools. It is undoubtedly true that children are helped to get to
church schools. There is even a possibility that some of the children might not be sent to the church schools
if the parents were compelled to pay their children's bus fares out of their own pockets when transportation
to a public school would have been paid for by the State. The same possibility exists where the state requires a
local transit company to provide reduced fares to school children including those attending parochial schools, or
where a municipally owned transportation system undertakes to carry all school children free of charge ...

This Court has said that parents may, in the discharge of their duty under state compulsory education laws,
send their children to a religious rather than a public school if the school meets the secular educational require-
ments which the state has power to impose ... It appears that these parochial schools meet New Jersey's require-
ments. The State contributes no money to the schools. It does not support them. Its legislation, as applied, does
no more than provide a general program to help parents get their children, regardless of their religion, safely
and expeditiously to and from accredited schools. The First Amendment has erected a wall between church and
state. That wall must be kept high and impregnable. We could not approve the slightest breach. New Jersey has
not breached it here.

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.

...

New York City has a program which permits its public schools to release students during the school day so that
they may leave the school buildings and school grounds and go to religious centers for religious instruction ...
A student is released on written request of his parents. Those not released stay in the classrooms. The churches
make weekly reports to the schools, sending a list of children who have been released from public school but
who have not reported for religious instruction.

This "released time" program involves neither religious instruction in public school classrooms nor the expen-
diture of public funds. All costs, including the application blanks, are paid by the religious organizations ... our
problem reduces itself to whether New York by this system has either prohibited the "free exercise" of religion
or has made a law "respecting an establishment of religion" within the meaning of the First Amendment ...

It takes obtuse reasoning to inject any issue of the "free exercise" of religion into the present case. No one is
forced to go to the religious classroom and no religious exercise or instruction is brought to the classrooms of
the public schools. A student need not take religious instruction. He is left to his own desires as to the manner
or time of his religious devotions, if any. There is a suggestion that the system involves the use of coercion to get
public school students into religious classrooms. There is no evidence in the record before us that supports that
conclusion ...

The First Amendment, however, does not say that in every and all respects there shall be a separation of Church
and State. Rather, it studiously defines the manner, the specific ways, in which there shall be no concert or
union or dependency one on the other. That is the common sense of the matter. Otherwise, the state and reli-
gion would be aliens to each other-hostile, suspicious, and even unfriendly. Churches could not be required to
pay even property taxes. Municipalities would not be permitted to render police or fire protection to religious
groups. Policemen who helped parishioners into their places of worship would violate the Constitution ...

We would have to press the concept of separation of Church and State to these extremes to condemn the present
law on constitutional grounds. The nullification of this law would have wide and profound effects. A Catholic

student applies to his teacher for permission to leave the school during hours on a Holy Day of Obligation to
attend a mass. A Jewish student asks his teacher for permission to be excused for Yom Kippur. A Protestant
wants the afternoon off for a family baptismal ceremony. In each case the teacher requires parental consent in
writing. In each case the teacher, in order to make sure the student is not a truant, goes further and requires a
report from the priest, the rabbi, or the minister. The teacher in other words cooperates in a religious program
to the extent of making it possible for her students to participate in it. Whether she does it occasionally for a few
students, regularly for one, or pursuant to a systematized program designed to further the religious needs of all
the students does not alter the character of the act ...

Here, as we have said, the public schools' do no more than accommodate their schedule- to a program of outside
religious instruction. We follow the [precedent]. But we cannot expand it to cover the present released time pro-
gram unless separation of Church and State means that public institutions can make no adjustments of their
schedules to accommodate the religious needs of the people. We cannot read into the Bill of Rights such a phi-
losophy of hostility to religion.

MR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.

...

The respondent Board of Education of Union Free School District No. 9, New Hyde Park, New York, acting
in its official capacity under state law, directed the School District's principal to cause the following prayer to be
said aloud by each class in the presence of a teacher at the beginning of each school day:

"Almighty God, we acknowledge our dependence upon Thee, and we beg Thy blessings upon us, our parents,
our teachers and our Country."
158 | ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE

This daily procedure was adopted on the recommendation of the State Board of Regents, a governmental agency
created by the State Constitution to which the New York Legislature has granted broad supervisory, executive,
and legislative powers over the State's public school system. These state officials composed the prayer which they
recommended and published as a part of their "Statement on Moral and Spiritual Training in the Schools," say-
ing:

"We believe that this Statement will be subscribed to by all men and women of good will, and we call upon all of
them to aid in giving life to our program."

Shortly after the practice of reciting the Regents' prayer was adopted by the School District, the parents of
ten pupils brought this action in a New York State Court insisting that use of this official prayer in the public
schools was contrary to the beliefs, religions, or religious practices of both themselves and their children. Among
other things, these parents challenged the constitutionality of both the state law authorizing the School Dis-
trict to direct the use of prayer in public schools and the School District's regulation ordering the recitation of
this particular prayer on the ground that these actions of official governmental agencies violate that part of the
First Amendment of the Federal Constitution which commands that "Congress shall make no law respecting an
establishment of religion"-a command which was "made applicable to the State of New York by the Fourteenth
Amendment of the said Constitution ..."

We think that by using its public school system to encourage recitation of the Regents' prayer, the State of
New York has adopted a practice wholly inconsistent with the Establishment Clause. There can, of course,
be no doubt that New York's program of daily classroom invocation of God's blessings as prescribed in the
Regents' prayer is a religious activity. It is a solemn avowal of divine faith and supplication for the blessings of
the Almighty. The nature of such a prayer has always been religious, none of the respondents has denied this and
the trial court expressly so found ...

It is a matter of history that this very practice of establishing governmentally composed prayers for religious ser-
vices was one of the reasons which caused many of our early colonists to leave England and seek religious free-
dom in America ... The Constitution was intended to avert a part of this danger by leaving the government of
this country in the hands of the people rather than in the hands of any monarch. But this safeguard was not
enough. Our Founders were no more willing to let the content of their prayers and their privilege of praying
whenever they pleased be influenced by the ballot box than they were to let these vital matters of personal con-
science depend upon the succession of monarchs. The First Amendment was added to the Constitution to stand
as a guarantee that neither the power nor the prestige of the Federal Government would be used to control, sup-
port, or influence the kinds of prayer the American people can say ...

There can be no doubt that New York's state prayer program officially establishes the religious beliefs embodied
in the Regents' prayer. The respondents' argument to the contrary, which is largely based upon the contention
that the Regents' prayer is "non-denominational" and the fact that the program, as modified and approved by
state courts, does not require all pupils to recite the prayer but permits those who wish to do so to remain silent
or be excused from the room, ignores the essential nature of the program's constitutional defects. Neither the
fact that the prayer may be denominationally neutral nor the fact that its observance on the part of the stu-
                                                                                                              ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE | 159

dents is voluntary can serve to free it from the limitations of the Establishment Clause, as it might from the Free
Exercise Clause, of the First Amendment, both of which are operative against the States by virtue of the Four-
teenth Amendment. Although these two clauses may in certain instances overlap, they forbid two quite differ-
ent kinds of governmental encroachment upon religious freedom. The Establishment Clause, unlike the Free
Exercise Clause, does not depend upon any showing of direct governmental compulsion and is violated by the
enactment of laws which establish an official religion whether those laws operate directly to coerce non observ-
ing individuals or not ...

It is true that New York's establishment of its Regents' prayer as an officially approved religious doctrine of that
State does not amount to a total establishment of one particular religious sect to the exclusion of all others that,
indeed, the governmental endorsement of that prayer seems relatively insignificant when compared to the gov-
ernmental encroachments upon religion which were commonplace 200 years ago. To those who may subscribe
to the view that because the Regents' official prayer is so brief and general there can be no danger to religious
freedom in its governmental establishment, however, it may be appropriate to say in the words of James Madi-
son, the author of the First Amendment:

"[I]t is proper to take alarm at the first experiment on our liberties ... Who does not see that the same authority
which can establish Christianity, in exclusion of all other Religions, may establish with the same ease any par-
ticular sect of Christians, in exclusion of all other Sects? That the same authority which can force a citizen to
contribute three pence only of his property for the support of any one establishment, may force him to conform
to any other establishment in all cases whatsoever?"

Reversed and remanded.

MR. JUSTICE FORTAS delivered the opinion of the Court.

...

This appeal challenges the constitutionality of the "anti-evolution" statute which the State of Arkansas adopted
in 1928 to prohibit the teaching in its public schools and universities of the theory that man evolved from other
species of life. The statute was a product of the upsurge of "fundamentalist" religious fervor of the twenties. The
Arkansas statute was an adaptation of the famous Tennessee "monkey law" which that State adopted in 1925.'
The constitutionality of the Tennessee law was upheld by the Tennessee Supreme Court in the celebrated Scopes
case in 1927 ...

The Arkansas law makes it unlawful for a teacher in any state-supported school or university "to teach the theory
or doctrine that mankind ascended or descended from a lower order of animals," or "to adopt or use in any such
institution a textbook that teaches" this theory. Violation is a misdemeanor and subjects the violator to dismissal
from his position ...

In any event, we do not rest our decision upon the asserted vagueness of the statute. On either interpretation of
its language, Arkansas' statute cannot stand. It is of no moment whether the law is deemed to prohibit mention
of Darwin's theory, or to forbid any or all of the infinite varieties of communication embraced within the term
"teaching." Under either interpretation, the law must be stricken because of its conflict with the constitutional
prohibition of state laws respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. The
overriding fact is that Arkansas' law selects from the body of knowledge a particular segment which it proscribes
for the sole reason that it is deemed to conflict with a particular religious doctrine; that is, with a particular inter-
pretation of the Book of Genesis by a particular religious group ...

The antecedents of today's decision are many and unmistakable. They are rooted in the foundation soil of our
Nation. They are fundamental to freedom. Government in our democracy, state and national, must be neutral
in matters of religious theory, doctrine, and practice. It may not be hostile to any religion or to the advocacy of
no-religion; and it may not aid, foster, or promote one religion or religious theory against another or even against
the militant opposite. The First Amendment mandates governmental neutrality between religion and religion,
and between religion and nonreligion ... There is and can be no doubt that the First Amendment does not per-
                                                                                                              ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE | 161

mit the State to require that teaching and learning must be tailored to the principles or prohibitions of any reli-
gious sect or dogma. In Everson v. Board of Education (1947), this Court, in upholding a state law to provide
free bus service to school children, including those attending parochial schools, said: "Neither [a State nor the
Federal Government] can pass laws which aid one religion, aid all religions, or prefer one religion over another
..."

Arkansas' law cannot be defended as an act of religious neutrality. Arkansas did not seek to excise from the
curricula of its schools and universities all discussion of the origin of man. The law's effort was confined to an
attempt to blot out a particular theory because of its supposed conflict with the Biblical account, literally read.
Plainly, the law is contrary to the mandate of the First, and in violation of the Fourteenth, Amendment to the
Constitution.

The judgment of the Supreme Court of Arkansas is

Reversed.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER delivered the opinion of the Court.

...

These two appeals raise questions as to Pennsylvania and Rhode Island statutes providing state aid to church
related elementary and secondary schools. Both statutes are challenged as violative of the Establishment and Free
Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Pennsyl-
vania has adopted a statutory program that provides financial support to nonpublic elementary and secondary
schools by way of reimbursement for the cost of teachers' salaries, textbooks, and instructional materials in spec-
ified secular subjects. Rhode Island has adopted a statute under which the State pays directly to teachers in non-
public elementary schools a supplement of 15% of their annual salary. Under each statute state aid has been given
to church-related educational institutions. We hold that both statutes are unconstitutional ...

In the absence of precisely stated constitutional prohibitions, we must draw lines with reference to the three
main evils against which the Establishment Clause was intended to afford protection: "sponsorship, financial
support, and active involvement of the sovereign in religious activity." Walz v. Tax Commission (1970). Every
analysis in this area must begin with consideration of the cumulative criteria developed by the Court over many
years. Three such tests may be gleaned from our cases. First, the statute must have a secular legislative pur-
pose; second, its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion, Board of
Education v. Allen (1968); finally, the statute must not foster "an excessive government entanglement with reli-
gion." Walz, supra, at 397 U. S. 674.

The language of the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment is at best opaque, particularly when compared
with other portions of the Amendment. Its authors did not simply prohibit the establishment of a state church
or a state religion, an area history shows they regarded as very important and fraught with great dangers. Instead,
they commanded that there should be "no law respecting an establishment of religion." A law may be one
                                                                                                                         THE LEMON TEST | 163

"respecting" the forbidden objective while falling short of its total realization. A law "respecting" the proscribed
result, that is, the establishment of religion, is not always easily identifiable as one violative of the Clause. A given
law might not establish a state religion but nevertheless be one "respecting" that end in the sense of being a step
that could lead to such establishment and hence offend the First Amendment ...

The two legislatures, however, have also recognized that church-related elementary and secondary schools have
a significant religious mission and that a substantial portion of their activities is religiously oriented. They have
therefore sought to create statutory restrictions designed to guarantee the separation between secular and reli-
gious educational functions and to ensure that State financial aid supports only the former. All these provisions
are precautions taken in candid recognition that these programs approached, even if they did not intrude upon,
the forbidden areas under the Religion Clauses. We need not decide whether these legislative precautions restrict
the principal or primary effect of the programs to the point where they do not offend the Religion Clauses, for
we conclude that the cumulative impact of the entire relationship arising under the statutes in each State involves
excessive entanglement between government and religion ...

The dangers and corresponding entanglements are enhanced by the particular form of aid that the Rhode Island
Act provides. Our decisions from Everson to Allen have permitted the States to provide church related schools
with secular, neutral, or nonideological services, facilities, or materials. Bus transportation, school lunches, pub-
lic health services, and secular textbooks supplied in common to all students were not thought to offend the
Establishment Clause ...

We need not and do not assume that teachers in parochial schools will be guilty of bad faith or any conscious
design to evade the limitations imposed by the statute and the First Amendment. We simply recognize that a
dedicated religious person, teaching in a school affiliated with his or her faith and operated to inculcate its tenets,
will inevitably experience great difficulty in remaining religiously neutral. Doctrines and faith are not inculcated
or advanced by neutrals. With the best of intentions such a teacher would find it hard to make a total separation
between secular teaching and religious doctrine. What would appear to some to be essential to good citizenship
might well for others border on or constitute instruction in religion ...

There is another area of entanglement in the Rhode Island program that gives concern. The statute excludes
teachers employed by nonpublic schools whose average per-pupil expenditures on secular education equal or
exceed the comparable figures for public schools. In the event that the total expenditures of an otherwise eligible
school exceed this norm, the program requires the government to examine the school's records in order to deter-
mine how much of the total expenditures is attributable to secular education and how much to religious activity.
This kind of state inspection and evaluation of the religious content of a religious organization is fraught with
the sort of entanglement that the Constitution forbids. It is a relationship pregnant with dangers of excessive
government direction of church schools and hence of churches ...

The merit and benefits of these schools, however, are not the issue before us in these cases. The sole question is
whether state aid to these schools can be squared with the dictates of the Religion Clauses. Under our system
the choice has been made that government is to be entirely excluded from the area of religious instruction and
§164 | THE LEMON TEST

churches excluded from the affairs of government. The Constitution decrees that religion must be a private mat-
ter for the individual, the family, and the institutions of private choice, and that while some involvement and
entanglement are inevitable, lines must be drawn ...

The judgment of the Pennsylvania District Court in No. 89 is reversed, and the case is remanded for further pro-
ceedings consistent with this opinion.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.

...

The State of Ohio has established a pilot program designed to provide educational choices to families with chil-
dren who reside in the Cleveland City School District. The question presented is whether this program offends
the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution. We hold that it does not.

There are more than 75,000 children enrolled in the Cleveland City School District. The majority of these chil-
dren are from low-income and minority families. Few of these families enjoy the means to send their children
to any school other than an inner-city public school. For more than a generation, however, Cleveland's public
schools have been among the worst performing public schools in the Nation. In 1995, a Federal District Court
declared a "crisis of magnitude" and placed the entire Cleveland school district under state control. Shortly
thereafter, the state auditor found that Cleveland's public schools were in the midst of a "crisis that is perhaps
unprecedented in the history of American education." The district had failed to meet any of the 18 state stan-
dards for minimal acceptable performance. Only 1 in 10 ninth graders could pass a basic proficiency examina-
tion, and students at all levels performed at a dismal rate compared with students in other Ohio public schools.
                                                                                                                         THE LEMON TEST | 165

More than two-thirds of high school students either dropped or failed out before graduation. Of those students
who managed to reach their senior year, one of every four still failed to graduate. Of those students who did
graduate, few could read, write, or compute at levels comparable to their counterparts in other cities.

It is against this backdrop that Ohio enacted, among other initiatives, its Pilot Project Scholarship Program,
Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §§3313.974-3313.979 (Anderson 1999 and Supp. 2000) (program). The program pro-
vides financial assistance to families in any Ohio school district that is or has been "under federal court order
requiring supervision and operational management of the district by the state superintendent." Cleveland is the
only Ohio school district to fall within that category.

The program provides two basic kinds of assistance to parents of children in a covered district. First, the program
provides tuition aid for students in kindergarten through third grade, expanding each year through eighth grade,
to attend a participating public or private school of their parent's choosing. Second, the program provides tuto-
rial aid for students who choose to remain enrolled in public school. The tuition aid portion of the program is
designed to provide educational choices to parents who reside in a covered district. Any private school, whether
religious or nonreligious, may participate in the program and accept program students so long as the school is
located within the boundaries of a covered district and meets statewide educational standards. Participating pri-
vate schools must agree not to discriminate on the basis of race, religion, or ethnic background, or to "advocate
or foster unlawful behavior or teach hatred of any person or group on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin,
or religion." Any public school located in a school district adjacent to the covered district may also participate
in the program. Adjacent public schools are eligible to receive a $2,250 tuition grant for each program student
accepted in addition to the full amount of per-pupil state funding attributable to each additional student. All
participating schools, whether public or private, are required to accept students in accordance with rules and
procedures established by the state superintendent. Tuition aid is distributed to parents according to financial
need. Families with incomes below 200% of the poverty line are given priority and are eligible to receive 90%
of private school tuition up to $2,250. For these lowest-income families, participating private schools may not
charge a parental co-payment greater than $250. For all other families, the program pays 75% of tuition costs,
up to $1,875, with no co-payment cap. These families receive tuition aid only if the number of available scholar-
ships exceeds the number of low-income children who choose to participate.

Where tuition aid is spent depends solely upon where parents who receive tuition aid choose to enroll their child.
If parents choose a private school, checks are made payable to the parents who then endorse the checks over to
the chosen school. The tutorial aid portion of the program provides tutorial assistance through grants to any
student in a covered district who chooses to remain in public school. * * *

The program has been in operation within the Cleveland City School District since the 1996-1997 school year.
In the 1999-2000 school year, 56 private schools participated in the program, 46 (or 82%) of which had a reli-
gious affiliation. None of the public schools in districts adjacent to Cleveland have elected to participate. More
than 3,700 students participated in the scholarship program, most of whom (96%) enrolled in religiously affili-
ated schools. Sixty percent of these students were from families at or below the poverty line. In the 1998-1999
school year, approximately 1,400 Cleveland public school students received tutorial aid. This number was
expected to double during the 1999-2000 school year.
166 | THE LEMON TEST

The program is part of a broader undertaking by the State to enhance the educational options of Cleveland's
schoolchildren in response to the 1995 takeover. That undertaking includes programs governing community
and magnet schools ...

In July 1999, respondents filed this action in United States District Court, seeking to enjoin the ... program on
the ground that it violated the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution. In August 1999, the
District Court issued a preliminary injunction barring further implementation of the program, which we stayed
pending review by the Court of Appeals. In December 1999, the District Court granted summary judgment for
respondents. In December 2000, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the District
Court, finding that the program had the "primary effect" of advancing religion in violation of the Establishment
Clause. The Court of Appeals stayed its mandate pending disposition in this Court. We granted certiorari and
now reverse the Court of Appeals.

The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment,
prevents a State from enacting laws that have the "purpose" or "effect" of advancing or inhibiting religion. There
is no dispute that the program challenged here was enacted for the valid secular purpose of providing educa-
tional assistance to poor children in a demonstrably failing public school system. Thus, the question presented
is whether the Ohio program nonetheless has the forbidden "effect" of advancing or inhibiting religion.

To answer that question, our decisions have drawn a consistent distinction between government programs that
provide aid directly to religious schools and programs of true private choice, in which government aid reaches
religious schools only as a result of the genuine and independent choices of private individuals. While our
jurisprudence with respect to the constitutionality of direct aid programs has "changed significantly" over the
past two decades, our jurisprudence with respect to true private choice programs has remained consistent and
unbroken. Three times we have confronted Establishment Clause challenges to neutral government programs
that provide aid directly to a broad class of individuals, who, in turn, direct the aid to religious schools or insti-
tutions of their own choosing. Three times we have rejected such challenges ...

[W]e have never found a program of true private choice to offend the Establishment Clause. We believe that the
program challenged here is a program of true private choice, consistent with Mueller, Witters, and Zobrest, and
thus constitutional. As was true in those cases, the Ohio program is neutral in all respects toward religion. It is
part of a general and multifaceted undertaking by the State of Ohio to provide educational opportunities to the
children of a failed school district. It confers educational assistance directly to a broad class of individuals defined
without reference to religion, i.e., any parent of a school-age child who resides in the Cleveland City School Dis-
trict. The program permits the participation of all schools within the district, religious or nonreligious. Adjacent
public schools also may participate and have a financial incentive to do so. Program benefits are available to par-
ticipating families on neutral terms, with no reference to religion. The only preference stated anywhere in the
program is a preference for low-income families, who receive greater assistance and are given priority for admis-
sion at participating schools.

There are no "financial incentive[s]" that "ske[w]" the program toward religious schools ... The program here
in fact creates financial disincentives for religious schools, with private schools receiving only half the govern-
                                                                                                                         THE LEMON TEST | 167

ment assistance given to community schools and one-third the assistance given to magnet schools. Adjacent
public schools, should any choose to accept program students, are also eligible to receive two to three times the
state funding of a private religious school. Families too have a financial disincentive to choose a private religious
school over other schools. Parents that choose to participate in the scholarship program and then to enroll their
children in a private school (religious or nonreligious) must copay a portion of the school's tuition. Families that
choose a community school, magnet school, or traditional public school pay nothing. Although such features
of the program are not necessary to its constitutionality, they clearly dispel the claim that the program "creates ...
financial incentive[s] for parents to choose a sectarian school." Respondents suggest that even without a finan-
cial incentive for parents to choose a religious school, the program creates a "public perception that the State is
endorsing religious practices and beliefs." But we have repeatedly recognized that no reasonable observer would
think a neutral program of private choice, where state aid reaches religious schools solely as a result of the numer-
ous independent decisions of private individuals, carries with it the imprimatur of government endorsement.

Any objective observer familiar with the full history and context of the Ohio program would reasonably view it
as one aspect of a broader undertaking to assist poor children in failed schools, not as an endorsement of reli-
gious schooling in general. There also is no evidence that the program fails to provide genuine opportunities for
Cleveland parents to select secular educational options for their school-age children. Cleveland schoolchildren
enjoy a range of educational choices: They may remain in public school as before, remain in public school with
publicly funded tutoring aid, obtain a scholarship and choose a religious school, obtain scholarship and choose a
nonreligious private school, enroll in a community school, or enroll in a magnet school. That 46 of the 56 private
schools now participating in the program are religious schools does not condemn it as a violation of the Estab-
lishment Clause. The Establishment Clause question is whether Ohio is coercing parents into sending their chil-
dren to religious schools, and that question must be answered by evaluating all options Ohio provides Cleveland
schoolchildren, only one of which is to obtain a program scholarship and then choose a religious school.

Justice Souter [dissenting] speculates that because more private religious schools currently participate in the pro-
gram, the program itself must somehow discourage the participation of private nonreligious schools. But Cleve-
land's preponderance of religiously affiliated private schools certainly did not arise as a result of the program;
it is a phenomenon common to many American cities ... Indeed, by all accounts the program has captured a
remarkable cross-section of private schools, religious and nonreligious. It is true that 82% of Cleveland's par-
ticipating private schools are religious schools, but it is also true that 81% of private schools in Ohio are reli-
gious schools. See Brief for State of Florida et al. as Amici Curiae 16 (citing Private School Universe Survey).
To attribute constitutional significance to this figure, moreover, would lead to the absurd result that a neutral
school-choice program might be permissible in some parts of Ohio, such as Columbus, where a lower percentage
of private schools are religious schools, but not in inner-city Cleveland, where Ohio has deemed such programs
most sorely needed, but where the preponderance of religious schools happens to be greater. Likewise, an iden-
tical private choice program might be constitutional in some States, such as Maine or Utah, where less than 45%
of private schools are religious schools, but not in other States, such as Nebraska or Kansas, where over 90% of
private schools are religious schools. Respondents and Justice Souter claim that even if we do not focus on the
number of participating schools that are religious schools, we should attach constitutional significance to the
fact that 96% of scholarship recipients have enrolled in religious schools. They claim that this alone proves par-
168 | THE LEMON TEST

ents lack genuine choice, even if no parent has ever said so. We need not consider this argument in detail, since
it was flatly rejected in Mueller, where we found it irrelevant that 96% of parents taking deductions for tuition
expenses paid tuition at religious schools.

...

In sum, the Ohio program is entirely neutral with respect to religion. It provides benefits directly to a wide spec-
trum of individuals, defined only by financial need and residence in a particular school district. It permits such
individuals to exercise genuine choice among options public and private, secular and religious. The program is
therefore a program of true private choice. In keeping with an unbroken line of decisions rejecting challenges to
similar programs, we hold that the program does not offend the Establishment Clause.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.

JUSTICE SOUTER, WITH WHOM JUSTICE STEVENS, JUSTICE GINSBURG, AND JUSTICE
BREYER JOIN, DISSENTING.

...

The Court's majority holds that the Establishment Clause is no bar to Ohio's payment of tuition at private
religious elementary and middle schools under a scheme that systematically provides tax money to support the
schools' religious missions. The occasion for the legislation thus upheld is the condition of public education in
the city of Cleveland. The record indicates that the schools are failing to serve their objective, and the vouchers
in issue here are said to be needed to provide adequate alternatives to them. If there were an excuse for giving
short shrift to the Establishment Clause, it would probably apply here. But there is no excuse. Constitutional
limitations are placed on government to preserve constitutional values in hard cases, like these.

"[C]onstitutional lines have to be drawn, and on one side of every one of them is an otherwise sympathetic case
that provokes impatience with the Constitution and with the line. But constitutional lines are the price of con-
stitutional government." Agostini v. Felton (1997) (Souter, J., dissenting). I therefore respectfully dissent.

The applicability of the Establishment Clause to public funding of benefits to religious schools was settled in
Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing (1947), which inaugurated the modern era of establishment doctrine. * * *

Today, however, the majority holds that the Establishment Clause is not offended by Ohio's Pilot Project Schol-
arship Program, under which students may be eligible to receive as much as $2,250 in the form of tuition
vouchers transferable to religious schools. In the city of Cleveland, the overwhelming proportion of large appro-
priations for voucher money must be spent on religious schools if it is to be spent at all, and will be spent in
amounts that cover almost all of tuition. The money will thus pay for eligible students' instruction not only in
secular subjects but in religion as well, in schools that can fairly be characterized as founded to teach religious
doctrine and to imbue teaching in all subjects with a religious dimension. Public tax money will pay at a systemic
level for teaching the covenant with Israel and Mosaic law in Jewish schools, the primacy of the Apostle Peter
and the Papacy in Catholic schools, the truth of reformed Christianity in Protestant schools, and the revelation
to the Prophet in Muslim schools, to speak only of major religious groupings in the Republic. How can a Court
                                                                                                                         THE LEMON TEST | 169

consistently leave Everson on the books and approve the Ohio vouchers? The answer is that it cannot. It is only
by ignoring Everson that the majority can claim to rest on traditional law in its invocation of neutral aid provi-
sions and private choice to sanction the Ohio law. It is, moreover, only by ignoring the meaning of neutrality
and private choice themselves that the majority can even pretend to rest today's decision on those criteria ...

The majority's statements of Establishment Clause doctrine cannot be appreciated without some historical per-
spective on the Court's announced limitations on government aid to religious education, and its repeated repu-
diation of limits previously set. * * * Viewed with the necessary generality, the cases can be categorized in three
groups. In the period from 1947 to 1968, the basic principle of no aid to religion through school benefits was
unquestioned. Thereafter for some 15 years, the Court termed its efforts as attempts to draw a line against aid
that would be divertible to support the religious, as distinct from the secular, activity of an institutional benefi-
ciary. Then, starting in 1983, concern with divertibility was gradually lost in favor of approving aid in amounts
unlikely to afford substantial benefits to religious schools, when offered evenhandedly without regard to a recipi-
ent's religious character, and when channeled to a religious institution only by the genuinely free choice of some
private individual. Now, the three stages are succeeded by a fourth, in which the substantial character of govern-
ment aid is held to have no constitutional significance, and the espoused criteria of neutrality in offering aid, and
private choice in directing it, are shown to be nothing but examples of verbal formalism

Hence it seems fair to say that it was not until today that substantiality of aid has clearly been rejected as irrel-
evant by a majority of this Court, just as it has not been until today that a majority, not a plurality, has held
purely formal criteria to suffice for scrutinizing aid that ends up in the coffers of religious schools. Today's cases
are notable for their stark illustration of the inadequacy of the majority's chosen formal analysis. Although it has
taken half a century since Everson to reach the majority's twin standards of neutrality and free choice, the facts
show that, in the majority's hands, even these criteria cannot convincingly legitimize the Ohio scheme.

...

... The majority looks not to the provisions for tuition vouchers, but to every provision for educational oppor-
tunity. The majority then finds confirmation that "participation of all schools" satisfies neutrality by noting that
the better part of total state educational expenditure goes to public schools, thus showing there is no favor of
religion.

The illogic is patent ..."Neutrality" as the majority employs the term is, literally, verbal and nothing more. This,
indeed, is the only way the majority can gloss over the very nonneutral feature of the total scheme covering "all
schools": public tutors may receive from the State no more than $324 per child to support extra tutoring (that
is, the State's 90% of a total amount of $360), whereas the tuition voucher schools (which turn out to be mostly
religious) can receive up to $2,250.Why the majority does not simply accept the fact that the challenge here is to
the more generous voucher scheme and judge its neutrality in relation to religious use of voucher money seems
very odd.

...
170 | THE LEMON TEST

The majority's view that all educational choices are comparable for the purposes of choice thus ignores the whole
point of the choice test: it is a criterion for deciding whether indirect aid to a religious school is legitimate because
it passes through private hands that can spend or use the aid in a secular school. The question is whether the
private hand is genuinely free to send the money in either a secular direction or a religious one. The majority
now has transformed this question about private choice in channeling aid into a question about selecting from
examples of state spending (on education) including direct spending on magnet and community public schools
that goes through no private hands and could never reach a religious school under any circumstance. When the
choice test is transformed from where to spend the money to where to go to school, it is cut loose from its very
purpose. Defining choice as choice in spending the money or channeling the aid is, moreover, necessary if the
choice criterion is to function as a limiting principle at all. If "choice" is present whenever there is any educa-
tional alternative to the religious school to which vouchers can be endorsed, then there will always be a choice
and the voucher can always be constitutional, even in a system in which there is not a single private secular school
as an alternative to the religious school. And because it is unlikely that any participating private religious school
will enroll more pupils than the generally available public system, it will be easy to generate numbers suggesting
that aid to religion is not the significant intent or effect of the voucher scheme.

That is, in fact, just the kind of rhetorical argument that the majority accepts in these cases. * * * It is not, of
course, that I think even a genuine choice criterion is up to the task of the Establishment Clause when substan-
tial state funds go to religious teaching. * * * The point is simply that if the majority wishes to claim that choice
is a criterion, it must define choice in a way that can function as a criterion with a practical capacity to screen
something out.

If, contrary to the majority, we ask the right question about genuine choice to use the vouchers, the answer
shows that something is influencing choices in a way that aims the money in a religious direction: of 56 private
schools in the district participating in the voucher program (only 53 of which accepted voucher students in
1999-2000), 46 of them are religious; 96.6% of all voucher recipients go to religious schools, only 3.4% to nonre-
ligious ones. * * *

...

The scale of the aid to religious schools approved today is unprecedented, both in the number of dollars and in
the proportion of systemic school expenditure supported. * * * The Cleveland voucher program has cost Ohio
taxpayers $33 million since its implementation in 1996 ($28 million in voucher payments, $5 million in admin-
istrative costs), and its cost was expected to exceed $8 million in the 2001-2002 school year. * * *

...

Views like these, and innumerable others, have been safe in the sectarian pulpits and classrooms of this Nation
not only because the Free Exercise Clause protects them directly, but because the ban on supporting religious
establishment has protected free exercise, by keeping it relatively private. With the arrival of vouchers in religious
schools, that privacy will go, and along with it will go confidence that religious disagreement will stay moderate.
If the divisiveness permitted by today's majority is to be avoided in the short term, it will be avoided only by
action of the political branches at the state and national levels. Legislatures not driven to desperation by the
                                                                                                                          THE LEMON TEST | 171

problems of public education may be able to see the threat in vouchers negotiable in sectarian schools. Perhaps
even cities with problems like Cleveland's will perceive the danger, now that they know a federal court will not
save them from it. My own course as a judge on the Court cannot, however, simply be to hope that the political
branches will save us from the consequences of the majority's decision. Everson's statement is still the touchstone
of sound law, even though the reality is that in the matter of educational aid the Establishment Clause has largely
been read away. True, the majority has not approved vouchers for religious schools alone, or aid earmarked for
religious instruction. But no scheme so clumsy will ever get before us, and in the cases that we may see, like these,
the Establishment Clause is largely silenced. I do not have the option to leave it silent, and I hope that a future
Court will reconsider today's dramatic departure from basic Establishment Clause principle.

PER CURIAM.

...

A Kentucky statute requires the posting of a copy of the Ten Commandments, purchased with private con-
tributions, on the wall of each public classroom in the State. Petitioners, claiming that this statute violates the
Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment, sought an injunction against its enforcement.
The state trial court upheld the statute, finding that its "avowed purpose" was "secular and not religious," and
that the statute would `neither advance nor inhibit any religion or religious group" nor involve the State exces-
sively in religious matters ...

This Court has announced a three-part test for determining whether a challenged state statute is permissible
under the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution:

"First, the statute must have a secular legislative purpose; second, its principal or primary effect must be one that
neither advances nor inhibits religion ... finally, the statute must not foster `an excessive government entangle-
ment with religion.'" Lemon v. Kurtzman ...

We conclude that Kentucky's statute requiring the posting of the Ten Commandments in public school rooms
has no secular legislative purpose, and is therefore unconstitutional ...

The pre-eminent purpose for posting the Ten Commandments on schoolroom walls is plainly religious in
nature. The Ten Commandments are undeniably a sacred text in the Jewish and Christian faiths, and no leg-
islative recitation of a supposed secular purpose can blind us to that fact. The Commandments do not confine
themselves to arguably secular matters, such as honoring one's parents, killing or murder adultery, stealing, false
witness, and covetousness ... It does not matter that the posted copies of the Ten Commandments are financed
by voluntary private contributions, for the mere posting of the copies under the auspices of the legislature pro-
vides the "official support of the State ... Government" that the Establishment Clause prohibits ...

The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted, and the judgment below is reversed.

It is so ordered.

JUSTICE REHNQUIST, dissenting.

...

The Court's summary rejection of a secular purpose articulated by the legislature and confirmed by the state
court is without precedent in Establishment Clause jurisprudence. This Court regularly looks to legislative artic-
ulations of a statute's purpose in Establishment Clause cases and accords such pronouncements the deference
they are due ...

The Court rejects the secular purpose articulated by the State because the Decalogue is "undeniably a sacred
text ..." It is equally undeniable, however, as the elected representatives of Kentucky determined, that the Ten
Commandments have had a significant impact on the development of secular legal codes of the Western World.
The trial court concluded that evidence submitted substantiated this determination ... Certainly the State was
permitted to conclude that a document with such secular significance should be placed before its students, with
an appropriate statement of the document's secular import ... The Establishment Clause does not require that
the public sector be insulated from all things which may have a religious significance or origin. This Court has
recognized that "religion has been closely identified with our history and government ..."

I therefore dissent from what I cannot refrain from describing as a cavalier summary reversal, without benefit of
oral argument or briefs on the merits, of the highest court of Kentucky.

JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.

...

At an early stage of this litigation, the constitutionality of three Alabama statutes was questioned: (1) § 16-1-20,
enacted in 1978, which authorized a 1-minute period of silence in all public schools "for meditation"; (2) §
16-1-20.1, enacted in 1981, which authorized a period of silence "for meditation or voluntary prayer"; and (3)
§ 16-1-20.2, enacted in 1982, which authorized teachers to lead "willing students" in a prescribed prayer to
"Almighty God ... the Creator and Supreme Judge of the world."

... Thus, the narrow question for decision is whether § 16-1-20.1, which authorizes a period of silence for "med-
itation or voluntary prayer," is a law respecting the establishment of religion within the meaning of the First
Amendment. [Note: § 16-1-20 was not challenged and § 16-1-20.2 was deemed unconstitutional.]

Appellee Ishmael Jaffree is a resident of Mobile County, Alabama. On May 28, 1982, he filed a complaint on
behalf of three of his minor children; two of them were second-grade students and the third was then in kinder-
garten. The complaint named members of the Mobile County School Board, various school officials, and the
minor plaintiffs' three teachers as defendants. The complaint alleged that the appellees brought the action "seek-
ing principally a declaratory judgment and an injunction restraining the Defendants and each of them from
maintaining or allowing the maintenance of regular religious prayer services or other forms of religious obser-
vances in the Mobile County Public Schools in violation of the First Amendment as made applicable to states
by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution ..."

As is plain from its text, the First Amendment was adopted to curtail the power of Congress to interfere with
the individual's freedom to believe, to worship, and to express himself in accordance with the dictates of his own
conscience. Until the Fourteenth Amendment was added to the Constitution, the First Amendment's restraints
on the exercise of federal power simply did not apply to the States. But when the Constitution was amended to
prohibit any State from depriving any person of liberty without due process of law, that Amendment imposed
                                                                                           ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE IN SCHOOLS | 175

the same substantive limitations on the States' power to legislate that the First Amendment had always imposed
on the Congress' power. This Court has confirmed and endorsed this elementary proposition of law time and
time again ...

Just as the right to speak and the right to refrain from speaking are complementary components of a broader
concept of individual freedom of mind, so also the individual's freedom to choose his own creed is the coun-
terpart of his right to refrain from accepting the creed established by the majority. At one time it was thought
that this right merely proscribed the preference of one Christian sect over another, but would not require equal
respect for the conscience of the infidel, the atheist, or the adherent of a non-Christian faith such as Islam or
Judaism. But when the underlying principle has been examined in the crucible of litigation, the Court has unam-
biguously concluded that the individual freedom of conscience protected by the First Amendment embraces
the right to select any religious faith or none at all. This conclusion derives support not only from the interest
in respecting the individual's freedom of conscience, but also from the conviction that religious beliefs worthy
of respect are the product of free and voluntary choice by the faithful and from recognition of the fact that the
political interest in forestalling intolerance extends beyond intolerance among Christian sects-or even intoler-
ance among "religions"-to encompass intolerance of the disbeliever and the uncertain ...

When the Court has been called upon to construe the breadth of the Establishment Clause, it has examined the
criteria developed over a period of many years. Thus, in Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971), we wrote:

"Every analysis in this area must begin with consideration of the cumulative criteria developed by the Court over
many years. Three such tests may be gleaned from our cases. First, the statute must have a secular legislative pur-
pose; second, its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion, Board of
Education v. Allen, (1968); finally, the statute must not foster `an excessive government entanglement with reli-
gion.' Walz v. Tax Comm'n, (1970)."

It is the first of these three criteria that is most plainly implicated by this case. As the District Court correctly
recognized, no consideration of the second or third criteria is necessary if a statute does not have a clearly secular
purpose. For even though a statute that is motivated in part by a religious purpose may satisfy the first crite-
rion, the First Amendment requires that a statute must be invalidated if it is entirely motivated by a purpose to
advance religion.

In applying the purpose test, it is appropriate to ask "whether government's actual purpose is to endorse or dis-
approve of religion." In this case, the answer to that question is dispositive. For the record not only provides us
with an unambiguous affirmative answer, but it also reveals that the enactment of § 16-1-20.1 was not motivated
by any clearly secular purpose-indeed, the statute had no secular purpose ...

The unrebutted evidence of legislative intent contained in the legislative record and in the testimony of the spon-
sor of § 16-1-20.1 is confirmed by a consideration of the relationship between this statute and the two other mea-
sures that were considered in this case. The District Court found that the 1981 statute and its 1982 sequel had a
common, nonsecular purpose. The wholly religious character of the later enactment is plainly evident from its
text ...
176 | ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE IN SCHOOLS

We must, therefore, conclude that the Alabama Legislature intended to change existing law and that it was moti-
vated by the same purpose that the Governor's answer to the second amended complaint expressly admitted; that
the statement inserted in the legislative history revealed; and that Senator Holmes' testimony frankly described.
The legislature enacted § 16-1-20.1, despite the existence of § 161-20, for the sole purpose of expressing the
State's endorsement of prayer activities for one minute at the beginning of each schoolday. The addition of "or
voluntary prayer" indicates that the State intended to characterize prayer as a favored practice. Such an endorse-
ment is not consistent with the established principle that the government must pursue a course of complete neu-
trality toward religion.

The importance of that principle does not permit us to treat this as an inconsequential case involving nothing
more than a few words of symbolic speech on behalf of the political majority. For whenever the State itself speaks
on a religious subject, one of the questions that we must ask is "whether the government intends to convey
a message of endorsement or disapproval of religion." The well-supported concurrent findings of the District
Court and the Court of Appeals -- that § 16-1-20.1 was intended to convey a message of state approval of prayer
activities in the public schools -- make it unnecessary, and indeed inappropriate, to evaluate the practical signif-
icance of the addition of the words "or voluntary prayer" to the statute. Keeping in mind, as we must,

"both the fundamental place held by the Establishment Clause in our constitutional scheme and the myriad,
subtle ways in which Establishment Clause values can be eroded," we conclude that § 16-1-20.1 violates the First
Amendment.

It is so ordered.

JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.

...

The question for decision is whether Louisiana's "Balanced Treatment for Creation-Science and Evolution-
Science in Public School Instruction" Act (Creationism Act), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 17:286.1-17:286.7 (West
1982), is ... valid as violative of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment ...

Appellees, who include parents of children attending Louisiana public schools, Louisiana teachers, and religious
leaders, challenged the constitutionality of the Act in District Court, seeking an injunction and declaratory
relief.' Appellants, Louisiana officials charged with implementing the Act, defended on the ground that the pur-
pose of the Act is to protect a legitimate secular interest, namely, academic freedom. Appellees attacked the Act
as facially invalid because it violated the Establishment Clause and made a motion for summary judgment ...

The Establishment Clause forbids the enactment of any law "respecting an establishment of religion. The Court
has applied a three-pronged test to determine whether legislation comports with the Establishment Clause. First,
the legislature must have adopted the law with a secular purpose. Second, the statute's principal or primary effect
must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion. Third, the statute must not result in an excessive entan-
glement of government with religion. Lemon v. Kurtzman, (1971) ...

In this case, the Court must determine whether the Establishment Clause was violated in the special context of
the public elementary and secondary school system. States and local school boards are generally afforded consid-
erable discretion in operating public schools ...

If the law was enacted for the purpose of endorsing religion, "no consideration of the second or third criteria [of
Lemon] is necessary. ..." In this case, appellants have identified no clear secular purpose for the Louisiana Act ...
It is clear from the legislative history that the purpose of the legislative sponsor, Senator Bill Keith, was to nar-
row the science curriculum. During the legislative hearings, Senator Keith stated: "My preference would be that
neither [creationism nor evolution] be taught." 2 App. E-621. Such a ban on teaching does not promote-indeed,
it undermines-the provision of a comprehensive scientific education ...
178 | ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE IN SCHOOLS

Furthermore, the goal of basic "fairness" is hardly furthered by the Act's discriminatory preference for the
teaching of creation science and against the teaching of evolution. While requiring that curriculum guides be
developed for creation science, the Act says nothing of comparable guides for evolution ... If the Louisiana Legis-
lature's purpose was solely to maximize the comprehensiveness and effectiveness of science instruction, it would
have encouraged the teaching of all scientific theories about the origins of humankind ... Thus, we agree with
the Court of Appeals' conclusion that the Act does not serve to protect academic freedom, but has the distinctly
different purpose of discrediting "evolution by counterbalancing its teaching at every turn with the teaching of
creationism. ..."

Furthermore, it is not happenstance that the legislature required the teaching of a theory that coincided with this
religious view. The legislative history documents that the Act's primary purpose was to change the science cur-
riculum of public schools in order to provide persuasive advantage to a particular religious doctrine that rejects
the factual basis of evolution in its entirety ...

In a similar way, teaching a variety of scientific theories about the origins of humankind to school children might
be validly done with the clear secular intent of enhancing the effectiveness of science instruction. But because
the primary purpose of the Creationism Act is to endorse a particular religious doctrine, the Act furthers reli-
gion in violation of the Establishment Clause ...

Appellants contend that affidavits made by two scientists, two theologians, and an education administrator raise
a genuine issue of material fact and that summary judgment was therefore barred. The affidavits define creation
science as "origin through abrupt appearance in complex form" and allege that such a viewpoint constitutes a
true scientific theory ... We agree with the lower courts that these affidavits do not raise a genuine issue of mater-
ial fact. The existence of "uncontroverted affidavits" does not bar summary judgment ...

The Act violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment because it seeks to employ the symbolic and
financial support of government to achieve a religious purpose. The judgment of the Court of Appeals therefore
is

Affirmed.

JUSTICE POWELL, with whom JUSTICE O'CONNOR joins, concurring.

...

I write separately to note certain aspects of the legislative history, and to emphasize that nothing in the Court's
opinion diminishes the traditionally broad discretion accorded state and local school officials in the selection of
the public school curriculum ...

This Court consistently has applied the three-pronged test of Lemon v. Kurtzman, (1971), to determine whether
a particular state action violates the Establishment Clause of the Constitution ...
                                                                                           ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE IN SCHOOLS | 179

"Balanced treatment" means "providing whatever information and instruction in both creation and evolution
models the classroom teacher determines is necessary and appropriate to provide insight into both theories in
view of the textbooks and other instructional materials available for use in his classroom ..."

Although the Act requires the teaching of the scientific evidences of both creation and evolution whenever
either is taught, it does not define either term."A fundamental canon of statutory construction is that, unless
otherwise defined, words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning ..."

A religious purpose alone is not enough to invalidate an act of a state legislature ... The religious purpose must
pre-dominate ... But it necessarily is circumscribed by the Establishment Clause. "Academic freedom" does not
encompass the right of a legislature to structure the public school curriculum in order to advance a particular
religious belief ...

My examination of the language and the legislative history of the Balanced Treatment Act confirms that the
intent of the Louisiana Legislature was to promote a particular religious belief. The legislative history of the
Arkansas statute prohibiting the teaching of evolution examined in Epperson v. Arkansas, (1968), was strikingly
similar to the legislative history of the Balanced Treatment Act ... That the statute is limited to the scientific evi-
dences supporting the theory does not render its purpose secular ...

Whatever the academic merit of particular subjects or theories, the Establishment Clause limits the discretion of
state officials to pick and choose among them for the purpose of promoting a particular religious belief. The lan-
guage of the statute and its legislative history convince me that the Louisiana Legislature exercised its discretion
for this purpose in this case ...

In sum, I find that the language and the legislative history of the Balanced Treatment Act unquestionably
demonstrate that its purpose is to advance a particular religious belief. Although the discretion of state and local
authorities over public school curricula is broad, "the First Amendment does not permit the State to require
that teaching and learning must be tailored to the principles or prohibitions of any religious sect or dogma ..."
Accordingly, I concur in the opinion of the Court and its judgment that the Balanced Treatment Act violates
the Establishment Clause of the Constitution.

JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.

...

Prior to 1995, the Santa Fe High School student who occupied the school's elective office of student council
chaplain delivered a prayer over the public address system before each varsity football game for the entire season.
This practice, along with others, was challenged in District Court as a violation of the Establishment Clause of
the First Amendment. While these proceedings were pending in the District Court, the school district adopted
a different policy that permits, but does not require, prayer initiated and led by a student at all home games. The
District Court entered an order modifying that policy to permit only nonsectarian, nonproselytizing prayer.
The Court of Appeals held that, even as modified by the District Court, the football prayer policy was invalid.
We granted the school district's petition for certiorari to review that holding.

...

Respondents commenced this action in April 1995 and moved for a temporary restraining order to prevent the
District from violating the Establishment Clause at the imminent graduation exercises. In their complaint the
Does alleged that the District had engaged in several proselytizing practices, such as promoting attendance at a
Baptist revival meeting, encouraging membership in religious clubs, chastising children who held minority reli-
gious beliefs, and distributing Gideon Bibles on school premises. They also alleged that the District allowed stu-
dents to read Christian invocations and benedictions from the stage at graduation ceremonies, and to deliver
overtly Christian prayers over the public address system at home football games.

On May 10, 1995, the District Court entered an interim order addressing a number of different issues. ... In
response to that portion of the order, the District adopted a series of policies over several months dealing with
prayer at school functions ... The parties stipulated that after this policy was adopted, "the senior class held an
election to determine whether to have an invocation and benediction at the commencement [and that the] class
voted, by secret ballot, to include prayer at the high school graduation." In a second vote the class elected two
seniors to deliver the invocation and benediction ...

The August policy, which was titled "Prayer at Football Games," ... authorized two student elections, the first to
determine whether "invocations" should be delivered, and the second to select the spokesperson to deliver them
...
                                                                                           ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE IN SCHOOLS | 181

The first Clause in the First Amendment to the Federal Constitution provides that "Congress shall make no
law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." The Fourteenth Amend-
ment imposes those substantive limitations on the legislative power of the States and their political subdivi-
sions. Wallace v. Jaffree, (1985). In Lee v. Weisman, (1992), we held that a prayer delivered by a rabbi at a middle
school graduation ceremony violated that Clause. Although this case involves student prayer at a different type
of school function, our analysis is properly guided by the principles that we endorsed in Lee.

As we held in that case:

"The principle that government may accommodate the free exercise of religion does not supersede the funda-
mental limitations imposed by the Establishment Clause. It is beyond dispute that, at a minimum, the Consti-
tution guarantees that government may not coerce anyone to support or participate in religion or its exercise,
or otherwise act in a way which `establishes a [state] religion or religious faith, or tends to do SO.'" Id., at 587
(citations omitted) (quoting Lynch v. Donnelly, (1984)).

...

These invocations are authorized by a government policy and take place on government property at government
sponsored school-related events ... The Santa Fe school officials simply do not "evince either `by policy or by
practice,' any intent to open the [pregame ceremony] to `indiscriminate use,' ... by the student body gener-
ally." Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, (1988). Rather, the school allows only one student, the same student
for the entire season, to give the invocation. The statement or invocation, moreover, is subject to particular reg-
ulations that confine the content and topic of the student's message,

...

The text of the October policy, however, exposes the extent of the school's entanglement. The elections take
place at all only because the school "board has chosen to permit students to deliver a brief invocation and/or
message." ... In addition to involving the school in the selection of the speaker, the policy, by its terms, invites and
encourages religious messages. The policy itself states that the purpose of the message is "to solemnize the event."
A religious message is the most obvious method of solemnizing an event. Moreover, the requirements that the
message "promote good sportsmanship" and "establish the appropriate environment for competition" further
narrow the types of message deemed appropriate ... In fact, as used in the past at Santa Fe High School, an "invo-
cation" has always entailed a focused religious message. Thus, the expressed purposes of the policy encourage the
selection of a religious message, and that is precisely how the students understand the policy ...

We recognize the important role that public worship plays in many communities, as well as the sincere desire
to include public prayer as a part of various occasions so as to mark those occasions' significance. But such reli-
gious activity in public schools, as elsewhere, must comport with the First Amendment. The actual or perceived
endorsement of the message, moreover, is established by factors beyond just the text of the policy. Once the stu-
dent speaker is selected and the message composed, the invocation is then delivered to a large audience assem-
bled as part of a regularly scheduled, school-sponsored function conducted on school property. The message is
broadcast over the school's public address system, which remains subject to the control of school officials. It is
182 | ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE IN SCHOOLS

fair to assume that the pregame ceremony is clothed in the traditional indicia of school sporting events, which
generally include not just the team, but also cheerleaders and band members dressed in uniforms sporting the
school name and mascot. The school's name is likely written in large print across the field and on banners and
flags. The crowd will certainly include many who display the school colors and insignia on their school T-shirts,
jackets, or hats and who may also be waving signs displaying the school name. It is in a setting such as this that
"[t]he board has chosen to permit" the elected student to rise and give the "statement or invocation ..."

The text and history of this policy, moreover, reinforce our objective student's perception that the prayer is, in
actuality, encouraged by the school. When a governmental entity professes a secular purpose for an arguably reli-
gious policy, the government's characterization is, of course, entitled to some deference. But it is nonetheless
the duty of the courts to "distinguis[h] a sham secular purpose from a sincere one." Wallace v. Jaffree (1985)
(O'CONNOR, J., concurring in judgment).

According to the District, the secular purposes of the policy are to "foste[r] free expression of private persons ...
as well [as to] solemniz[e] sporting events, promot[e] good sportsmanship and student safety, and establis[h] an
appropriate environment for competition." Brief for Petitioner. We note, however, that the District's approval
of only one specific kind of message, an "invocation," is not necessary to further any of these purposes. Addi-
tionally, the fact that only one student is permitted to give a content-limited message suggests that this policy
does little to "foste[r] free expression." Furthermore, regardless of whether one considers a sporting event an
appropriate occasion for solemnity, the use of an invocation to foster such solemnity is impermissible when, in
actuality, it constitutes prayer sponsored by the school. And it is unclear what type of message would be both
appropriately "solemnizing" under the District's policy and yet nonreligious. Most striking to us is the evolu-
tion of the current policy from the long-sanctioned office of "Student Chaplain" to the candidly titled "Prayer
at Football Games" regulation. This history indicates that the District intended to preserve the practice of prayer
before football games ... Given these observations, and in light of the school's history of regular delivery of a stu-
dent-led prayer at athletic events, it is reasonable to infer that the specific purpose of the policy was to preserve a
popular "state-sponsored religious practice ..."

Therefore, the simple enactment of this policy, with the purpose and perception of school endorsement of stu-
dent prayer, was a constitutional violation. We need not wait for the inevitable to confirm and magnify the
constitutional injury. In Wallace, for example, we invalidated Alabama's as yet unimplemented and voluntary
"moment of silence" statute based on our conclusion that it was enacted "for the sole purpose of expressing
the State's endorsement of prayer activities for one minute at the beginning of each school day ..." Therefore,
even if no Santa Fe High School student were ever to offer a religious message, the October policy fails a facial
challenge because the attempt by the District to encourage prayer is also at issue. Government efforts to endorse
religion cannot evade constitutional reproach based solely on the remote possibility that those attempts may
fail. This policy likewise does not survive a facial challenge because it impermissibly imposes upon the student
body a majoritarian election on the issue of prayer. Through its election scheme, the District has established a
governmental electoral mechanism that turns the school into a forum for religious debate. It further empowers
the student body majority with the authority to subject students of minority views to constitutionally improper
messages. The award of that power alone, regardless of the students' ultimate use of it, is not acceptable ...
                                                                                           ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE IN SCHOOLS | 183

The policy is invalid on its face because it establishes an improper majoritarian election on religion, and unques-
tionably has the purpose and creates the perception of encouraging the delivery of prayer at a series of important
school events. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is, accordingly, affirmed.

It is so ordered.

a sign saluting liberty. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled that each display violates the Establish-
ment Clause of the First Amendment because each has the impermissible effect of endorsing religion. We agree
that the creche display has that unconstitutional effect, but reverse the Court of Appeals' judgment regarding
the menorah display.

...

The county courthouse is owned by Allegheny County and is its seat of government. It houses the offices of the
county commissioners, controller, treasurer, sheriff, and clerk of court. Civil and criminal trials are held there.
The "main," "most beautiful," and "most public" part of the courthouse is its Grand Staircase, set into one arch
and surrounded by others, with arched windows serving as a backdrop ... Since 1981, the county has permit-
ted the Holy Name Society, a Roman Catholic group, to display a creche in the county courthouse during the
Christmas holiday season. Christmas, we note perhaps needlessly, is the holiday when Christians celebrate the
birth of Jesus of Nazareth, whom they believe to be the Messiah. Western churches have celebrated Christmas
Day on December 25 since the fourth century. As observed in this Nation, Christmas has a secular, as well as a
religious, dimension ...

The creche includes figures of the infant Jesus, Mary, Joseph, farm animals, shepherds, and wise men, all placed
in or before a wooden representation of a manger, which has at its crest an angel bearing a banner that proclaims
"Gloria in Excelsis Deo!" ... Altogether, the creche, the fence, the poinsettias, and the trees occupied a substantial
amount of space on the Grand Staircase.

The City-County Building is separate and a block removed from the county courthouse and, as the name
implies, is jointly owned by the city of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County. The city's portion of the building
houses the city's principal offices, including the mayor's. Id. at 17. The city is responsible for the building's
Grant Street entrance, which has three rounded arches supported by columns. Id. at 194, 207. For a number of
years, the city has had a large Christmas tree under the middle arch outside the Grant Street entrance. Following
this practice, city employees, on November 17, 1986, erected a 45-foot tree under the middle arch and decorated
it with lights and ornaments. Id. at 218-219. A few days later, the city placed at the foot of the tree a sign bearing
the mayor's name and entitled "Salute to Liberty." Beneath the title, the sign stated:

"During this holiday season, the city of Pittsburgh salutes liberty. Let these festive lights remind us that we are
the keepers of the flame of liberty and our legacy of freedom."

At least since 1982, the city has expanded its Grant Street holiday display to include a symbolic representation
of Chanukah, an 8-day Jewish holiday that begins on the 25th day of the Jewish lunar month of Kislev. App.
138. The 25th of Kislev usually occurs in December, and thus Chanukah is the annual Jewish holiday that falls
closest to Christmas Day each year

...

Chanukah, like Christmas, is a cultural event as well as a religious holiday. Id. at 143. Indeed, the Chanukah
story always has had a political or national, as well as a religious, dimension: it tells of national heroism in addi-
tion to divine intervention. Also, Chanukah, like Christmas, is a winter holiday; according to some historians,
it was associated in ancient times with the winter solstice. Just as some Americans celebrate Christmas without
regard to its religious significance, some nonreligious American Jews celebrate Chanukah as an expression of
ethnic identity, and "as a cultural or national event, rather than as a specifically religious event.

This Nation is heir to a history and tradition of religious diversity that dates from the settlement of the North
American Continent ... Precisely because of the religious diversity that is our national heritage, the Founders
added to the Constitution a Bill of Rights, the very first words of which declare: "Congress shall make no law
respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." Perhaps in the early days of the
Republic these words were understood to protect only the diversity within Christianity, but today they are rec-
ognized as guaranteeing religious liberty and equality to "the infidel, the atheist, or the adherent of a non-Chris-
tian faith such as Islam or Judaism."

In the course of adjudicating specific cases, this Court has come to understand the Establishment Clause to
mean that government may not promote or affiliate itself with any religious doctrine or organization," may not
discriminate among persons on the basis of their religious beliefs and practices, may not delegate a governmental
power to a religious institution, and may not involve itself too deeply in such an institution's affairs ...
186 | ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE IN THE PUBLIC SQUARE

... Our subsequent decisions further have refined the definition of governmental action that unconstitutionally
advances religion. In recent years, we have paid particularly close attention to whether the challenged govern-
mental practice either has the purpose or effect of "endorsing" religion, a concern that has long had a place in
our Establishment Clause jurisprudence ...

... Thus, it has been noted that the prohibition against governmental endorsement of religion "preclude[s]
government from conveying or attempting to convey a message that religion or a particular religious belief
is favored or preferred." ... Whether the key word is "endorsement," "favoritism," or "promotion," the essential
principle remains the same. The Establishment Clause, at the very least, prohibits government from appearing
to take a position on questions of religious belief or from "making adherence to a religion relevant in any way to
a person's standing in the political community." Lynch v. Donnelly, (O'CONNOR, J., concurring).

... We turn first to the county's creche display. There is no doubt, of course, that the creche itself is capable
of communicating a religious message ... [T]he effect of a creche display turns on its setting. Here, unlike
in Lynch, nothing in the context of the display detracts from the creche's religious message.

... The floral decoration surrounding the creche contributes to, rather than detracts from, the endorsement of
religion conveyed by the creche. It is as if the county had allowed the Holy Name Society to display a cross on the
Grand Staircase at Easter, and the county had surrounded the cross with Easter lilies. The county could not say
that surrounding the cross with traditional flowers of the season would negate the endorsement of Christianity
conveyed by the cross on the Grand Staircase. Its contention that the traditional Christmas greens negate the
endorsement effect of the creche fares no better ...

Nor does the fact that the creche was the setting for the county's annual Christmas-carol program diminish its
religious meaning. First, the carol program in 1986 lasted only from December 3 to December 23 and occupied
at most one hour a day. The effect of the creche on those who viewed it when the choirs were not singing-the
vast majority of the time-cannot be negated by the presence of the choir program. Second, because some of the
carols performed at the site of the creche were religious in nature, those carols were more likely to augment the
religious quality of the scene than to secularize it ...

No viewer could reasonably think that it occupies this location without the support and approval of the gov-
ernment. Thus, by permitting the "display of the creche in this particular physical setting," the county sends an
unmistakable message that it supports and promotes the Christian praise to God that is the creche's religious
message ...

For this reason, the claim that prohibiting government from celebrating Christmas as a religious holiday discrim-
inates against Christians in favor of non-adherents must fail. Celebrating Christmas as a religious, as opposed
to a secular, holiday, necessarily entails professing, proclaiming, or believing that Jesus of Nazareth, born in a
manger in Bethlehem, is the Christ, the Messiah. If the government celebrates Christmas as a religious holiday
(for example, by issuing an official proclamation saying: "We rejoice in the glory of Christ's birth!"), it means
that the government really is declaring Jesus to be the Messiah, a specifically Christian belief. In contrast, confin-
ing the government's own celebration of Christmas to the holiday's secular aspects does not favor the religious
beliefs of non-Christians over those of Christians. Rather, it simply permits the government to acknowledge the
                                                                           ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE IN THE PUBLIC SQUARE | 187

holiday without expressing an allegiance to Christian beliefs, an allegiance that would truly favor Christians over
non-Christians. To be sure, some Christians may wish to see the government proclaim its allegiance to Chris-
tianity in a religious celebration of Christmas, but the Constitution does not permit the gratification of that
desire, which would contradict the "`the logic of secular liberty"` it is the purpose of the Establishment Clause
to protect ...

In sum, Lynch teaches that government may celebrate Christmas in some manner and form, but not in a way
that endorses Christian doctrine. Here, Allegheny County has transgressed this line. It has chosen to celebrate
Christmas in a way that has the effect of endorsing a patently Christian message: Glory to God for the birth of
Jesus Christ. Under Lynch, and the rest of our cases, nothing more is required to demonstrate a violation of the
Establishment Clause. The display of the creche in this context, therefore, must be permanently enjoined.

...

Justice Kennedy's accusations ["the Court of harboring a "latent hostility" or "callous indifference" toward reli-
gion"] are shot from a weapon triggered by the following proposition: if government may celebrate the secu-
lar aspects of Christmas, then it must be allowed to celebrate the religious aspects as well because, otherwise,
the government would be discriminating against citizens who celebrate Christmas as a religious, and not just a
secular, holiday. This proposition, however, is flawed at its foundation. The government does not discriminate
against any citizen on the basis of the citizen's religious faith if the government is secular in its functions and
operations. On the contrary, the Constitution mandates that the government remain secular, rather than affil-
iate itself with religious beliefs or institutions, precisely in order to avoid discriminating among citizens on the
basis of their religious faiths.

...

The display of the Chanukah menorah in front of the City-County Building may well present a closer constitu-
tional question. The menorah, one must recognize, is a religious symbol: it serves to commemorate the miracle
of the oil as described in the Talmud. But the menorah's message is not exclusively religious. The menorah is the
primary visual symbol for a holiday that, like Christmas, has both religious and secular dimensions.

Moreover, the menorah here stands next to a Christmas tree and a sign saluting liberty. While no challenge has
been made here to the display of the tree and the sign, their presence is obviously relevant in determining the
effect of the menorah's display. The necessary result of placing a menorah next to a Christmas tree is to create an
"overall holiday setting" that represents both Christmas and Chanukah -- two holidays, not one.

The mere fact that Pittsburgh displays symbols of both Christmas and Chanukah does not end the constitu-
tional inquiry. If the city celebrates both Christmas and Chanukah as religious holidays, then it violates the
Establishment Clause.

...

Accordingly, the relevant question for Establishment Clause purposes is whether the combined display of the
tree, the sign, and the menorah has the effect of endorsing both Christian and Jewish faiths, or rather simply
188 | ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE IN THE PUBLIC SQUARE

recognizes that both Christmas and Chanukah are part of the same winter holiday season, which has attained a
secular status in our society. Of the two interpretations of this particular display, the latter seems far more plau-
sible and is also in line with Lynch.

The Christmas tree, unlike the menorah, is not itself a religious symbol. Although Christmas trees once carried
religious connotations, today they typify the secular celebration of Christmas ... Indeed, a 40-foot Christmas
tree was one of the objects that validated the creche in Lynch. The widely accepted view of the Christmas tree
as the preeminent secular symbol of the Christmas holiday season serves to emphasize the secular component
of the message communicated by other elements of an accompanying holiday display, including the Chanukah
menorah.

The tree, moreover, is clearly the predominant element in the city's display. The 45-foot tree occupies the central
position ... the 18-foot menorah is positioned to one side. Given this configuration, it is much more sensible
to interpret the meaning of the menorah in light of the tree, rather than vice versa. In the shadow of the tree,
the menorah is readily understood as simply a recognition that Christmas is not the only traditional way of
observing the winter-holiday season. In these circumstances, then, the combination of the tree and the menorah
communicates, not a simultaneous endorsement of both the Christian and Jewish faiths, but instead, a secular
celebration of Christmas coupled with an acknowledgment of Chanukah as a contemporaneous alternative tra-
dition ...

The conclusion here that, in this particular context, the menorah's display does not have an effect of endorsing
religious faith does not foreclose the possibility that the display of the menorah might violate either the "pur-
pose" or "entanglement" prong of the Lemon analysis.

...

Lynch v. Donnelly confirms, and in no way repudiates, the longstanding constitutional principle that govern-
ment may not engage in a practice that has the effect of promoting or endorsing religious beliefs. The display of
the creche in the county courthouse has this unconstitutional effect. The display of the menorah in front of the
City County Building, however, does not have this effect, given its "particular physical setting."

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the cases are remanded for
further proceedings.

It is so ordered.

JUSTICE SOUTER delivered the opinion of the Court.

Executives of two counties posted a version of the Ten Commandments on the walls of their courthouses. After
suits were filed charging violations of the Establishment Clause, the legislative body of each county adopted a
resolution calling for a more extensive exhibit meant to show that the Commandments are Kentucky's "prece-
dent legal code ..." The result in each instance was a modified display of the Commandments surrounded by
texts containing religious references as their sole common element. After changing counsel, the counties revised
the exhibits again by eliminating some documents, expanding the text set out in another, and adding some new
ones.

The issues are whether a determination of the counties' purpose is a sound basis for ruling on the Establishment
Clause complaints, and whether evaluation of the counties' claim of secular purpose for the ultimate displays
may take their evolution into account. We hold that the counties' manifest objective may be dispositive of the
constitutional enquiry, and that the development of the presentation should be considered when determining
its purpose ...

...

Ever since Lemon v. Kurtzman summarized the three familiar considerations for evaluating Establishment
Clause claims, looking to whether government action has "a secular legislative purpose" has been a common,
albeit seldom dispositive, element of our cases ... The touchstone for our analysis is the principle that the "First
Amendment mandates governmental neutrality between religion and religion, and between religion and non-
religion ..." When the government acts with the ostensible and predominant purpose of advancing religion, it
violates that central Establishment Clause value of official religious neutrality, there being no neutrality when
the government's ostensible object is to take sides ...

Despite the intuitive importance of official purpose to the realization of Establishment Clause values, the Coun-
ties ask us to abandon Lemon's purpose test, or at least to truncate any enquiry into purpose here. Their first
argument is that the very consideration of purpose is deceptive: according to them, true "purpose" is unknow-
able, and its search merely an excuse for courts to act selectively and unpredictably in picking out evidence of
subjective intent. The assertions are as seismic as they are unconvincing ...
190 | ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE IN THE PUBLIC SQUARE

As we said, the Court often does accept governmental statements of purpose, in keeping with the respect owed
in the first instance to such official claims. But in those unusual cases where the claim was an apparent sham,
or the secular purpose secondary, the unsurprising results have been findings of no adequate secular object, as
against a predominantly religious one ...

The Counties' second proffered limitation can be dispatched quickly. They argue that purpose in a case like this
one should be inferred, if at all, only from the latest news about the last in a series of governmental actions,
however close they may all be in time and subject. But the world is not made brand new every morning, and
the Counties are simply asking us to ignore perfectly probative evidence; they want an absentminded objective
observer, not one presumed to be familiar with the history of the government's actions and competent to learn
what history has to show ... The Counties' position just bucks common sense: reasonable observers have reason-
able memories, and our precedents sensibly forbid an observer "to turn a blind eye to the context in which [the]
policy arose ..."

The reasonable observer could only think that the Counties meant to emphasize and celebrate the Command-
ments' religious message. This is not to deny that the Commandments have had influence on civil or secular
law; a major text of a majority religion is bound to be felt. The point is simply that the original text viewed in
its entirety is an unmistakably religious statement dealing with religious obligations and with morality subject
to religious sanction. When the government initiates an effort to place this statement alone in public view, a reli-
gious object is unmistakable ...

Historical evidence thus supports no solid argument for changing course (whatever force the argument might
have when directed at the existing precedent), whereas public discourse at the present time certainly raises no
doubt about the value of the interpretative approach invoked for 60 years now. We are centuries away from the
St. Bartholomew's Day massacre and the treatment of heretics in early Massachusetts, but the divisiveness of reli-
gion in current public life is inescapable. This is no time to deny the prudence of understanding the Establish-
ment Clause to require the Government to stay neutral on religious belief, which is reserved for the conscience
of the individual ...

Given the ample support for the District Court's finding of a predominantly religious purpose behind the
Counties' third display, we affirm the Sixth Circuit in upholding the preliminary injunction.

It is so ordered.

The question here is whether the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment allows the display of a monu-
ment inscribed with the Ten Commandments on the Texas State Capitol grounds. We hold that it does ...

The 22 acres surrounding the Texas State Capitol contain 17 monuments and 21 historical markers com-
memorating the "people, ideals, and events that compose Texan identity." Tex. H. Con. Res. 38, 77th Leg.
(2001).1 The monolith challenged here stands 6-feet high and 3-feet wide. It is located to the north of the Capi-
tol building, between the Capitol and the Supreme Court building. Its primary content is the text of the Ten
Commandments. An eagle grasping the American flag, an eye inside of a pyramid, and two small tablets with
what appears to be an ancient script are carved above the text of the Ten Commandments. Below the text are
two Stars of David and the superimposed Greek letters Chi and Rho, which represent Christ. The bottom of
the monument bears the inscription "PRESENTED TO THE PEOPLE AND YOUTH OF TEXAS BY THE
FRATERNAL ORDER OF EAGLES OF TEXAS 1961." App. to Pet. for Cert. 21.

...

Our cases, Januslike, point in two directions in applying the Establishment Clause. One face looks toward the
strong role played by religion and religious traditions throughout our Nation's history ...

The other face looks toward the principle that governmental intervention in religious matters can itself endanger
religious freedom.

This case, like all Establishment Clause challenges, presents us with the difficulty of respecting both faces. Our
institutions presuppose a Supreme Being, yet these institutions must not press religious observances upon their
citizens. One face looks to the past in acknowledgment of our Nation's heritage, while the other looks to the pre-
sent in demanding a separation between church and state. Reconciling these two faces requires that we neither
abdicate our responsibility to maintain a division between church and state nor evince a hostility to religion by
disabling the government from in some ways recognizing our religious heritage ...
192 | ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE IN THE PUBLIC SQUARE

These two faces are evident in representative cases both upholding and invalidating laws under the Establish-
ment Clause. Over the last 25 years, we have sometimes pointed to Lemon v. Kurtzman, (1971), as providing the
governing test in Establishment Clause challenges ...

Whatever may be the fate of the Lemon test in the larger scheme of Establishment Clause jurisprudence, we
think it not useful in dealing with the sort of passive monument that Texas has erected on its Capitol grounds.
Instead, our analysis is driven both by the nature of the monument and by our Nation's history ...

Of course, the Ten Commandments are religious-they were so viewed at their inception and so remain. The
monument, therefore, has religious significance. According to Judeo-Christian belief, the Ten Commandments
were given to Moses by God on Mt. Sinai. But Moses was a lawgiver as well as a religious leader. And the Ten
Commandments have an undeniable historical meaning, as the foregoing examples demonstrate. Simply having
religious content or promoting a message consistent with a religious doctrine does not run afoul of the Estab-
lishment Clause ...

The placement of the Ten Commandments monument on the Texas State Capitol grounds is a far more passive
use of those texts than was the case in Stone, where the text confronted elementary school students every day.
Indeed, Van Orden, the petitioner here, apparently walked by the monument for a number of years before bring-
ing this lawsuit. The monument is therefore also quite different from the prayers involved in Schempp and Lee
v. Weisman. Texas has treated her Capitol grounds monuments as representing the several strands in the State's
political and legal history. The inclusion of the Ten Commandments monument in this group has a dual signif-
icance, partaking of both religion and government. We cannot say that Texas' display of this monument violates
the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

ALITO, J., ANNOUNCED THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT AND DELIVERED THE OPINION
OF THE COURT.

Since 1925, the Bladensburg Peace Cross (Cross) has stood as a tribute to 49 area soldiers who gave their lives in
the First World War. Eighty-nine years after the dedication of the Cross, respondents filed this lawsuit, claiming
that they are offended by the sight of the memorial on public land and that its presence there and the expenditure
of public funds to maintain it violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. To remedy this viola-
tion, they asked a federal court to order the relocation or demolition of the Cross or at least the removal of its
arms. The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit agreed that the memorial is unconstitutional and remanded
for a determination of the proper remedy. We now reverse ...

Although the cross has long been a preeminent Christian symbol, its use in the Bladensburg memorial has a
special significance. After the First World War, the picture of row after row of plain white crosses marking the
overseas graves of soldiers who had lost their lives in that horrible conflict was emblazoned on the minds of
Americans at home, and the adoption of the cross as the Bladensburg memorial must be viewed in that histor-
ical context. For nearly a century, the Bladensburg Cross has expressed the community's grief at the loss of the
young men who perished, its thanks for their sacrifice, and its dedication to the ideals for which they fought. It
has become a prominent community landmark, and its removal or radical alteration at this date would be seen
by many not as a neutral act but as the manifestation of "a hostility toward religion that has no place in our
Establishment Clause traditions ..."

...
194 | ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE IN THE PUBLIC SQUARE

The cross came into widespread use as a symbol of Christianity by the fourth century, and it retains that meaning
today. But there are many contexts in which the symbol has also taken on a secular meaning. Indeed, there are
instances in which its message is now almost entirely secular.

A cross appears as part of many registered trademarks held by businesses and secular organizations ... Many of
these marks relate to health care, and it is likely that the association of the cross with healing had a religious ori-
gin. But the current use of these marks is indisputably secular ...

The familiar symbol of the Red Cross--a red cross on a white background--shows how the meaning of a sym-
bol that was originally religious can be transformed. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
selected that symbol in 1863 because it was thought to call to mind the flag of Switzerland, a country widely
known for its neutrality ... Thus, the ICRC selected this symbol for an essentially secular reason ... But the cross
was originally chosen for the Swiss flag for religious reasons. So an image that began as an expression of faith was
transformed.

The image used in the Bladensburg memorial--a plain Latin cross--also took on new meaning after World War
I." During and immediately after the war, the army marked soldiers' graves with temporary wooden crosses or
Stars of David"--a departure from the prior practice of marking graves in American military cemeteries with
uniform rectangular slabs. G. Piehler (1995) The vast majority of these grave markers consisted of crosses, and
thus when Americans saw photographs of these cemeteries, what struck them were rows and rows of plain white
crosses. As a result, the image of a simple white cross "developed into a `central symbol' " of the conflict.

Since its dedication, the Cross has served as the site of patriotic events honoring veterans, including gatherings
on Veterans Day, Memorial Day, and Independence Day. Like the dedication itself, these events have typically
included an invocation, a keynote speaker, and a benediction. Over the years, memorials honoring the veterans
of other conflicts have been added to the surrounding area, which is now known as Veterans Memorial Park.
These include a World War II Honor Scroll; a Pearl Harbor memorial; a Korea-Vietnam veterans memorial; a
September 11 garden; a War of 1812 memorial; and two recently added 38-foot-tall markers depicting British
and American soldiers in the Battle of Bladensburg. Because the Cross is located on a traffic island with limited
space, the closest of these other monuments is about 200 feet away in a park across the road ...

...

The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment provides that "Congress shall make no law respecting an
establishment of religion." While the concept of a formally established church is straightforward, pinning down
the meaning of a "law respecting an establishment of religion" has proved to be a vexing problem ... After grap-
pling with such cases for more than 20 years, Lemon ambitiously attempted to distill from the Court's existing
case law a test that would bring order and predictability to Establishment Clause decision making. That test, as
noted, called on courts to examine the purposes and effects of a challenged government action, as well as any
entanglement with religion that it might entail ...
                                                                           ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE IN THE PUBLIC SQUARE | 195

If the Lemon Court thought that its test would provide a framework for all future Establishment Clause deci-
sions, its expectation has not been met. In many cases, this Court has either expressly declined to apply the test
or has simply ignored it ...

For at least four reasons, the Lemon test presents particularly daunting problems in cases, including the one now
before us, that involve the use, for ceremonial, celebratory, or commemorative purposes, of words or symbols
with religious associations. Together, these considerations counsel against efforts to evaluate such cases under
Lemon and toward application of a presumption of constitutionality for longstanding monuments, symbols,
and practices.

First, these cases often concern monuments, symbols, or practices that were first established long ago, and in
such cases, identifying their original purpose or purposes may be especially difficult ... Second, as time goes by,
the purposes associated with an established monument, symbol, or practice often multiply ... Third, just as the
purpose for maintaining a monument, symbol, or practice may evolve, "[t]he `message' conveyed ... may change
over time ..." Fourth, when time's passage imbues a religiously expressive monument, symbol, or practice with
this kind of familiarity and historical significance, removing it may no longer appear neutral, especially to the
local community for which it has taken on particular meaning. A government that roams the land, tearing down
monuments with religious symbolism and scrubbing away any reference to the divine will strike many as aggres-
sively hostile to religion. Militantly secular regimes have carried out such projects in the past, and for those with
a knowledge of history, the image of monuments being taken down will be evocative, disturbing, and divisive.

These four considerations show that retaining established, religiously expressive monuments, symbols, and prac-
tices is quite different from erecting or adopting new ones. The passage of time gives rise to a strong presump-
tion of constitutionality ...

As we have explained, the Bladensburg Cross carries special significance in commemorating World War I. Due in
large part to the image of the simple wooden crosses that originally marked the graves of American soldiers killed
in the war, the cross became a symbol of their sacrifice, and the design of the Bladensburg Cross must be under-
stood in light of that background. That the cross originated as a Christian symbol and retains that meaning in
many contexts does not change the fact that the symbol took on an added secular meaning when used in World
War I memorials.

Not only did the Bladensburg Cross begin with this meaning, but with the passage of time, it has acquired his-
torical importance. It reminds the people of Bladensburg and surrounding areas of the deeds of their predeces-
sors and of the sacrifices they made in a war fought in the name of democracy. As long as it is retained in its
original place and form, it speaks as well of the community that erected the monument nearly a century ago and
has maintained it ever since. The memorial represents what the relatives, friends, and neighbors of the fallen sol-
diers felt at the time and how they chose to express their sentiments. And the monument has acquired additional
layers of historical meaning in subsequent years. The Cross now stands among memorials to veterans of later
wars. It has become part of the community ...

Applying these principles, we conclude that the Bladensburg Cross does not violate the Establishment Clause ...
196 | ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE IN THE PUBLIC SQUARE

The cross is undoubtedly a Christian symbol, but that fact should not blind us to everything else that the
Bladensburg Cross has come to represent. For some, that monument is a symbolic resting place for ancestors
who never returned home. For others, it is a place for the community to gather and honor all veterans and their
sacrifices for our Nation. For others still, it is a historical landmark. For many of these people, destroying or
defacing the Cross that has stood undisturbed for nearly a century would not be neutral and would not further

Prayer at Government Meetings

Marsh v. Chambers

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER delivered the opinion of the Court.

The question presented is whether the Nebraska Legislature's practice of opening each legislative day with a
prayer by a chaplain paid by the State violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.

The Nebraska Legislature begins each of its sessions with a prayer offered by a chaplain who is chosen biennially
by the Executive Board of the Legislative Council and paid out of public funds. Robert E. Palmer, a Presbyterian
minister, has served as chaplain since 1965 at a salary of $319.75 per month for each month the legislature is in
session.

Ernst Chambers is a member of the Nebraska Legislature and a taxpayer of Nebraska. Claiming that the
Nebraska Legislature's chaplaincy practice violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, he
brought this action ... seeking to enjoin enforcement of this practice.

...

The opening of sessions of legislative and other deliberative public bodies with prayer is deeply embedded in the
history and tradition of this country. From colonial times through the founding of the Republic and ever since,
the practice of legislative prayer has coexisted with the principles of disestablishment and religious freedom. In
the very courtrooms in which the United States District Judge and later three Circuit Judges heard and decided
this case, the proceedings opened with an announcement that concluded, "God save the United States and this
Honorable Court." The same invocation occurs at all sessions of this Court ...

Standing alone, historical patterns cannot justify contemporary violations of constitutional guarantees, but
there is far more here than simply historical patterns. In this context, historical evidence sheds light not only
on what the draftsmen intended the Establishment Clause to mean, but also on how they thought that Clause
198 | PRAYER AT GOVERNMENT MEETINGS

applied to the practice authorized by the First Congress -- their actions reveal their intent. An Act "passed by
the first Congress assembled under the Constitution, many of whose members had taken part in framing that
instrument, ... is contemporaneous and weighty evidence of its true meaning."

...

Beyond the bare fact that a prayer is offered, three points have been made: first, that a clergyman of only one
denomination-Presbyterian-has been selected for 16 years; second, that the chaplain is paid at public expense;
and third, that the prayers are in the Judeo-Christian tradition. Weighed against the historical background, these
factors do not serve to invalidate Nebraska's practice ...

Absent proof that the chaplain's reappointment stemmed from an impermissible motive, we conclude that his
long tenure does not in itself conflict with the Establishment Clause. Nor is the compensation of the chaplain
from public funds a reason to invalidate the Nebraska Legislature's chaplaincy; remuneration is grounded in his-
toric practice initiated, as we noted earlier by the same Congress that drafted the Establishment Clause of the
First Amendment ...

The unbroken practice for two centuries in the National Congress and for more than a century in Nebraska and
in many other states gives abundant assurance that there is no real threat "while this Court sits ..."

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Reversed.

Town of Greece v. Galloway

JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part II-B.

...

The Court must decide whether the town of Greece, New York, imposes an impermissible establishment of reli-
gion by opening its monthly board meetings with a prayer. It must be concluded, consistent with the Court's
opinion in Marsh v. Chambers, (1983), that no violation of the Constitution has been shown.

Greece, a town with a population of 94,000, is in upstate New York. For some years, it began its monthly town
board meetings with a moment of silence. In 1999, the newly elected town supervisor, John Auberger, decided
to replicate the prayer practice he had found meaningful while serving in the county legislature. Following the
roll call and recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance, Auberger would invite a local clergyman to the front of the
room to deliver an invocation. After the prayer, Auberger would thank the minister for serving as the board's
"chaplain for the month" and present him with a commemorative plaque. The prayer was intended to place
town board members in a solemn and deliberative frame of mind, invoke divine guidance in town affairs, and
follow a tradition practiced by Congress and dozens of state legislatures.

The town followed an informal method for selecting prayer givers, all of whom were unpaid volunteers. A town
employee would call the congregations listed in a local directory until she found a minister available for that
month's meeting. The town eventually compiled a list of willing "board chaplains" who had accepted invita-
tions and agreed to return in the future. The town at no point excluded or denied an opportunity to a would-be
prayer giver. Its leaders maintained that a minister or layperson of any persuasion, including an atheist, could
give the invocation. But nearly all of the congregations in town were Christian; and from 1999 to 2007, all of
the participating ministers were too.

...

Marsh is sometimes described as "carving out an exception" to the Court's Establishment Clause jurisprudence,
because it sustained legislative prayer without subjecting the practice to "any of the formal `tests' that have tradi-
tionally structured" this inquiry. The Court in Marsh found those tests unnecessary because history supported
200 | PRAYER AT GOVERNMENT MEETINGS

the conclusion that legislative invocations are compatible with the Establishment Clause. The First Congress
made it an early item of business to appoint and pay official chaplains, and both the House and Senate have
maintained the office virtually uninterrupted since that time ...

Respondents maintain that prayer must be nonsectarian, or not identifiable with any one religion; and they fault
the town for permitting guest chaplains to deliver prayers that "use overtly Christian terms" or "invoke specifics
of Christian theology. ..."

This proposition is irreconcilable with the facts of Marsh and with its holding and reasoning. Marsh nowhere
suggested that the constitutionality of legislative prayer turns on the neutrality of its content. The opinion noted
that Nebraska's chaplain, the Rev. Robert E. Palmer, modulated the "explicitly Christian" nature of his prayer
and "removed all references to Christ" after a Jewish lawmaker complained. With this footnote, the Court did
no more than observe the practical demands placed on a minister who holds a permanent, appointed position in
a legislature and chooses to write his or her prayers to appeal to more members, or at least to give less offense to
those who object ...

Respondents point to other invocations that disparaged those who did not accept the town's prayer practice.
One guest minister characterized objectors as a "minority" who are "ignorant of the history of our country ..."
while another lamented that other towns did not have "God-fearing" leaders ... Although these two remarks
strayed from the rationale set out in Marsh, they do not despoil a practice that on the whole reflects and
embraces our tradition. Absent a pattern of prayers that over time denigrate, proselytize, or betray an impermis-
sible government purpose, a challenge based solely on the content of a prayer will not likely establish a constitu-
tional violation. Marsh, indeed, requires an inquiry into the prayer opportunity as a whole, rather than into the
contents of a single prayer ...

Finally, the Court disagrees with the view taken by the Court of Appeals that the town of Greece contravened
the Establishment Clause by inviting a predominantly Christian set of ministers to lead the prayer. The town
made reasonable efforts to identify all of the congregations located within its borders and represented that it
would welcome a prayer by any minister or layman who wished to give one. That nearly all of the congregations
in town turned out to be Christian does not reflect an aversion or bias on the part of town leaders against minor-
ity faiths. So long as the town maintains a policy of nondiscrimination, the Constitution does not require it to
search beyond its borders for non-Christian prayer givers in an effort to achieve religious balancing. The quest
to promote "a `diversity' of religious views" would require the town "to make wholly inappropriate judgments
about the number of religions [it] should sponsor and the relative frequency with which it should sponsor
each," a form of government entanglement with religion that is far more troublesome than the current approach
...

Ceremonial prayer is but a recognition that, since this Nation was founded and until the present day, many
Americans deem that their own existence must be understood by precepts far beyond the authority of govern-
ment to alter or define and that willing participation in civic affairs can be consistent with a brief acknowledg-
ment of their belief in a higher power, always with due respect for those who adhere to other beliefs. The prayer
in this case has a permissible ceremonial purpose. It is not an unconstitutional establishment of religion ...
                                                                                             PRAYER AT GOVERNMENT MEETINGS | 201

The town of Greece does not violate the First Amendment by opening its meetings with prayer that comports
with our tradition and does not coerce participation by nonadherents.

The judgment of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is reversed.

It is so ordered.

Justice Kagan, with whom Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer and Justice Sotomayor join, dissenting.

For centuries now, people have come to this country from every corner of the world to share in the blessing of
religious freedom. Our Constitution promises that they may worship in their own way, without fear of penalty
or danger, and that in itself is a momentous offering. Yet our Constitution makes a commitment still more
remarkable--that however those individuals worship, they will count as full and equal American citizens. A
Christian, a Jew, a Muslim (and so forth)--each stands in the same relationship with her country, with her state
and local communities, and with every level and body of government. So that when each person performs the
duties or seeks the benefits of citizenship, she does so not as an adherent to one or another religion, but simply
as an American.

I respectfully dissent from the Court's opinion because I think the Town of Greece's prayer practices violate that
norm of religious equality--the breathtakingly generous constitutional idea that our public institutions belong
no less to the Buddhist or Hindu than to the Methodist or Episcopalian. I do not contend that principle trans-
lates here into a bright separationist line. To the contrary, I agree with the Court's decision in Marsh v. Cham­
bers (1983), upholding the Nebraska Legislature's tradition of beginning each session with a chaplain's prayer.
And I believe that pluralism and inclusion in a town hall can satisfy the constitutional requirement of neutral-
ity; such a forum need not become a religion-free zone. But still, the Town of Greece should lose this case. The
practice at issue here differs from the one sustained in Marsh because Greece's town meetings involve participa-
tion by ordinary citizens, and the invocations given--directly to those citizens--were predominantly sectarian
in content. Still more, Greece's Board did nothing to recognize religious diversity: In arranging for clergy mem-
bers to open each meeting, the Town never sought (except briefly when this suit was filed) to involve, accom-
modate, or in any way reach out to adherents of non-Christian religions. So month in and month out for over
a decade, prayers steeped in only one faith, addressed toward members of the public, commenced meetings to
discuss local affairs and distribute government benefits. In my view, that practice does not square with the First
Amendment's promise that every citizen, irrespective of her religion, owns an equal share in her government.

To begin to see what has gone wrong in the Town of Greece, consider several hypothetical scenarios in which
sectarian prayer--taken straight from this case's record--infuses governmental activities. None involves, as this
case does, a proceeding that could be characterized as a legislative session, but they are useful to elaborate some
general principles. In each instance, assume (as was true in Greece) that the invocation is given pursuant to gov-
ernment policy and is representative of the prayers generally offered in the designated setting:

You are a party in a case going to trial; let's say you have filed suit against the government for violating one of
your legal rights. The judge bangs his gavel to call the court to order, asks a minister to come to the front of the
room, and instructs the 10 or so individuals present to rise for an opening prayer. The clergyman faces those in
202 | PRAYER AT GOVERNMENT MEETINGS

attendance and says: "Lord, God of all creation,. ... We acknowledge the saving sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the
cross. We draw strength ... from his resurrection at Easter. Jesus Christ, who took away the sins of the world,
destroyed our death, through his dying and in his rising, he has restored our life. Blessed are you, who has raised
up the Lord Jesus, you who will raise us, in our turn, and put us by His side. ... Amen." App. 88a-89a. The
judge then asks your lawyer to begin the trial.

It's election day, and you head over to your local polling place to vote. As you and others wait to give your names
and receive your ballots, an election official asks everyone there to join him in prayer. He says: "We pray this [day]
for the guidance of the Holy Spirit as [we vote]. ... Let's just say the Our Father together. `Our Father, who art in
Heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy Kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven. ... ' " Id., at 56a.
And after he concludes, he makes the sign of the cross, and appears to wait expectantly for you and the other
prospective voters to do so too.

You are an immigrant attending a naturalization ceremony to finally become a citizen. The presiding official tells
you and your fellow applicants that before administering the oath of allegiance, he would like a minister to pray
for you and with you. The pastor steps to the front of the room, asks everyone to bow their heads, and recites:
"[F]ather, son, and Holy Spirit--it is with a due sense of reverence and awe that we come before you [today]
seeking your blessing. ... You are ... a wise God, oh Lord, ... as evidenced even in the plan of redemption that is
fulfilled in Jesus Christ. We ask that you would give freely and abundantly wisdom to one and to all ... in the
name of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, who lives with you and the Holy Spirit, one God for ever and ever.
Amen." Id., at 99a-100a.

I would hold that the government officials responsible for the above practices--that is, for prayer repeatedly
invoking a single religion's beliefs in these settings--crossed a constitutional line. I have every confidence the
Court would agree. And even Greece's attorney conceded that something like the first hypothetical (he was not
asked about the others) would violate the First Amendment. Why?

The reason, of course, has nothing to do with Christianity as such. This opinion is full of Christian prayers,
because those were the only invocations offered in the Town of Greece. But if my hypotheticals involved the
prayer of some other religion, the outcome would be exactly the same. Suppose, for example, that government
officials in a predominantly Jewish community asked a rabbi to begin all public functions with a chanting of the
Sh'ma and V'ahavta. ("Hear O Israel! The Lord our God, the Lord is One. ... Bind [these words] as a sign upon
your hand; let them be a symbol before your eyes; inscribe them on the doorposts of your house, and on your
gates.") Or assume officials in a mostly Muslim town requested a muezzin to commence such functions, over
and over again, with a recitation of the Adhan. ("God is greatest, God is greatest. I bear witness that there is no
deity but God. I bear witness that Muhammed is the Messenger of God.") In any instance, the question would
be why such government-sponsored prayer of a single religion goes beyond the constitutional pale.

A glaring problem is that the government in all these hypotheticals has aligned itself with, and placed its impri-
matur on, a particular religious creed ...

And making matters still worse: They have done so in a place where individuals come to interact with, and par-
ticipate in, the institutions and processes of their government. ...
                                                                                             PRAYER AT GOVERNMENT MEETINGS | 203

... When a person goes to court, a polling place, or an immigration proceeding--I could go on: to a zoning
agency, a parole board hearing, or the DMV--government officials do not engage in sectarian worship, nor do
they ask her to do likewise. They all participate in the business of government not as Christians, Jews, Muslims
(and more), but only as Americans--none of them different from any other for that civic purpose. Why not,
then, at a town meeting?

In both Greece's and the majority's view, everything I have discussed is irrelevant here because this case involves
"the tradition of legislative prayer outlined" in Marsh v. Chambers. And before I dispute the Town and Court, I
want to give them their due: They are right that, under Marsh, legislative prayer has a distinctive constitutional
warrant by virtue of tradition ... Relying on that "unbroken" national tradition, Marsh upheld (I think cor-
rectly) the Nebraska Legislature's practice of opening each day with a chaplain's prayer as "a tolerable acknowl-
edgment of beliefs widely held among the people of this country."

Where I depart from the majority is in my reply to that question. The town hall here is a kind of hybrid. Greece's
Board indeed has legislative functions, as Congress and state assemblies do--and that means some opening
prayers are allowed there. But much as in my hypotheticals, the Board's meetings are also occasions for ordinary
citizens to engage with and petition their government, often on highly individualized matters. That feature calls
for Board members to exercise special care to ensure that the prayers offered are inclusive--that they respect each
and every member of the community as an equal citizen. But the Board, and the clergy members it selected,
made no such effort. Instead, the prayers given in Greece, addressed directly to the Town's citizenry, were more
sectarian, and less inclusive, than anything this Court sustained in Marsh. For those reasons, the prayer in Greece
departs from the legislative tradition that the majority takes as its benchmark.

Start by comparing two pictures, drawn precisely from reality. The first is of Nebraska's (unicameral) Legisla-
ture, as this Court and the state senators themselves described it. The second is of town council meetings in
Greece, as revealed in this case's record ...

Let's count the ways in which these pictures diverge. First, the governmental proceedings at which the prayers
occur differ significantly in nature and purpose. The Nebraska Legislature's floor sessions--like those of the
U. S. Congress and other state assemblies--are of, by, and for elected lawmakers. Members of the public take
no part in those proceedings; any few who attend are spectators only, watching from a high-up visitors' gallery
... Greece's town meetings, by contrast, revolve around ordinary members of the community. Each and every
aspect of those sessions provides opportunities for Town residents to interact with public officials. And the
most important parts enable those citizens to petition their government. In the Public Forum, they urge (or
oppose) changes in the Board's policies and priorities; and then, in what are essentially adjudicatory hearings,
they request the Board to grant (or deny) applications for various permits, licenses, and zoning variances. So the
meetings, both by design and in operation, allow citizens to actively participate in the Town's governance--shar-
ing concerns, airing grievances, and both shaping the community's policies and seeking their benefits.

(And following from what I just said), the prayers in these two settings have different audiences. In the Nebraska
Legislature, the chaplain spoke to, and only to, the elected representatives ... The same is true in the U. S. Con-
gress and, I suspect, in every other state legislature ...
204 | PRAYER AT GOVERNMENT MEETINGS

The very opposite is true in Greece: Contrary to the majority's characterization, the prayers there are directed
squarely at the citizens. Remember that the chaplain of the month stands with his back to the Town Board; his
real audience is the group he is facing--the 10 or so members of the public, perhaps including children. And he
typically addresses those people, as even the majority observes, as though he is "directing [his] congregation." ...

And third, the prayers themselves differ in their content and character. Marsh characterized the prayers in the
Nebraska Legislature as "in the Judeo-Christian tradition," and stated, as a relevant (even if not dispositive) part
of its analysis, that the chaplain had removed all explicitly Christian references at a senator's request. And as the
majority acknowledges, Marsh hinged on the view that "that the prayer opportunity ha[d] [not] been exploited
to proselytize or advance any one ... faith or belief"; had it been otherwise, the Court would have reached a dif-
ferent decision.

But no one can fairly read the prayers from Greece's Town meetings as anything other than explicitly Christ-
ian--constantly and exclusively so. From the time Greece established its prayer practice in 1999 until litigation
loomed nine years later, all of its monthly chaplains were Christian clergy. And after a brief spell surrounding
the filing of this suit (when a Jewish layman, a Wiccan priestess, and a Baha'i minister appeared at meetings), the
Town resumed its practice of inviting only clergy from neighboring Protestant and Catholic churches. About
two-thirds of the prayers given over this decade or so invoked "Jesus," "Christ," "Your Son," or "the Holy Spirit";
in the 18 months before the record closed, 85% included those references. Many prayers contained elaborations
of Christian doctrine or recitations of scripture ... And the prayers usually close with phrases like "in the name
of Jesus Christ" or "in the name of Your son." See, e.g., id., at 55a, 65a, 73a, 85a.

...

Those three differences, taken together, remove this case from the protective ambit of Marsh and the history on
which it relied.

...

In 1790, George Washington traveled to Newport, Rhode Island, a longtime bastion of religious liberty and
the home of the first community of American Jews. Among the citizens he met there was Moses Seixas, one of
that congregation's lay officials. The ensuing exchange between the two conveys, as well as anything I know, the
promise this country makes to members of every religion.

Seixas wrote first, welcoming Washington to Newport. He spoke of "a deep sense of gratitude" for the new
American Government--"a Government, which to bigotry gives no sanction, to persecution no assistance--but
generously affording to All liberty of conscience, and immunities of Citizenship: deeming every one, of whatever
Nation, tongue, or language, equal parts of the great governmental Machine." Address from Newport Hebrew
Congregation (Aug. 17, 1790), in 6 PGW 286, n. 1 (M. Mastromarino ed. 1996). The first phrase there is the
more poetic: a government that to "bigotry gives no sanction, to persecution no assistance." But the second
is actually the more startling and transformative: a government that, beyond not aiding persecution, grants
"immunities of citizenship" to the Christian and the Jew alike, and makes them "equal parts" of the whole coun-
try.
                                                                                             PRAYER AT GOVERNMENT MEETINGS | 205

Washington responded the very next day. Like any successful politician, he appreciated a great line when he saw
one--and knew to borrow it too. And so he repeated, word for word, Seixas's phrase about neither sanctioning
bigotry nor assisting persecution. But he no less embraced the point Seixas had made about equality of citizen-
ship. "It is now no more," Washington said, "that toleration is spoken of, as if it was by the indulgence of one
class of people" to another, lesser one. For "[a]ll possess alike ... immunities of citizenship." Letter to Newport
Hebrew Congregation (Aug. 18, 1790), in 6 PGW 285. That is America's promise in the First Amendment: full
and equal membership in the polity for members of every religious group, assuming only that they, like anyone
"who live[s] under [the Government's] protection[,] should demean themselves as good citizens." Ibid.

... that remarkable guarantee means at least this much: When the citizens of this country approach their gov-
ernment, they do so only as Americans, not as members of one faith or another. And that means that even in
a partly legislative body, they should not confront government-sponsored worship that divides them along reli-
gious lines. I believe, for all the reasons I have given, that the Town of Greece betrayed that promise. I therefore
respectfully dissent from the Court's decision.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.

...

The issues in this case concern the constitutional validity of Maryland criminal statutes, commonly known as
Sunday Closing Laws or Sunday Blue Laws. These statutes, with exceptions to be noted hereafter, generally pro-
scribe all labor, business and other commercial activities on Sunday. The questions presented are whether the
classifications within the statutes bring about a denial of equal protection of the law, whether the laws are so
vague as to fail to give reasonable notice of the forbidden conduct and therefore violate due process, and whether
the statutes are laws respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ...

Appellants argue that the Maryland statutes violate the "Equal Protection" Clause of the Fourteenth Amend-
ment ...

It would seem that a legislature could reasonably find that the Sunday sale of the exempted commodities was
necessary either for the health of the populace or for the enhancement of the recreational atmosphere of the
day-that a family which takes a Sunday ride into the country will need gasoline for the automobile and may find
pleasant a soft drink or fresh fruit; that those who go to the beach may wish ice cream or some other item nor-
mally sold there; that some people will prefer alcoholic beverages or games of chance to add to their relaxation;
that newspapers and drug products should always be available to the public. The record is barren of any indica-
tion that this apparently reasonable basis does not exist, that the statutory distinctions are invidious, that local
tradition and custom might not rationally call for this legislative treatment ...
                                                                                                                     SUNDAY BLUE LAWS | 207

The final questions for decision are whether the Maryland Sunday Closing Laws conflict with the Federal Con-
stitution's provisions for religious liberty. First, appellants contend here that the statutes applicable to Anne
Arundel County violate the constitutional guarantee of freedom of religion in that the statutes' effect is to pro-
hibit the free exercise of religion in contravention of the First Amendment, made applicable to the States by
the Fourteenth Amendment. But appellants allege only economic injury to themselves; they do not allege any
infringement of their own religious freedoms due to Sunday closing. In fact, the record is silent as to what appel-
lants' religious beliefs are. Since the general rule is that "a litigant may only assert his own constitutional rights
or immunities," we hold that appellants have no standing to raise this contention ...

Sunday Closing Laws go far back into American history, having been brought to the colonies with a background
of English legislation dating to the thirteenth century ... But, despite the strongly religious origin of these laws,
beginning before the eighteenth century, nonreligious arguments for Sunday closing began to be heard more
distinctly and the statutes began to lose some of their totally religious flavor ...

However, the State's purpose is not merely to provide a one-day-in-seven work stoppage. In addition to this, the
State seeks to set one day apart from all others as a day of rest, repose, recreation and tranquility-a day which all
members of the family and community have the opportunity to spend and enjoy together, a day on which there
exists relative quiet and disassociation from the everyday intensity of commercial activities, a day on which peo-
ple may visit friends and relatives who are not available during working days ...

Obviously, a State is empowered to determine that a rest-one-day-in-seven statute would not accomplish this
purpose; that it would not provide for a general cessation of activity, a special atmosphere of tranquility, a day
which all members of the family or friends and relatives might spend together. Furthermore, it seems plain that
the problems involved in enforcing such a provision would be exceedingly more difficult than those in enforcing
a common-day-of-rest provision. Moreover, it is common knowledge that the first day of the week has come to
have special significance as a rest day in this country. People of all religions and people with no religion regard
Sunday as a time for family activity, for visiting friends and relatives, for late sleeping, for passive and active enter-
tainments, for dining out, and the like ... The cause is irrelevant; the fact exists. It would seem unrealistic for
enforcement purposes and perhaps detrimental to the general welfare to require a State to choose a common day
of rest other than that which most persons would select of their own accord. For these reasons, we hold that the
Maryland statutes are not laws respecting an establishment of religion ...
208 | SUNDAY BLUE LAWS

Finally, we should make clear that this case deals only with the constitutionality of § 521 of the Maryland statute
before us. We do not hold that Sunday legislation may not be a violation of the "Establishment" Clause if it can
be demonstrated that its purpose-evidenced either on the face of the legislation, in conjunction with its legisla-
tive history, or in its operative effect-is to use the State's coercive power to aid religion. Accordingly, the decision
is

Affirmed.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.

...

On the trial, the plaintiff in error, the accused, proved that at the time of his alleged second marriage he was, and
for many years before had been, a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, commonly called
the Mormon Church, and a believer in its doctrines; that it was an accepted doctrine of that church `that it was
the duty of male members of said church, circumstances permitting, to practice polygamy ; ... that this duty was
enjoined by different books which the members of said church believed to be of divine origin, and among oth-
ers the Holy Bible, and also that the members of the church believed that the practice of polygamy was directly
enjoined upon the male members thereof by the Almighty God, in a revelation to Joseph Smith, the founder and
prophet of said church; that the failing or refusing to practice polygamy by such male members of said church,
when circumstances would admit, would be punished, and that the penalty for such failure and refusal would be
damnation in the life to come.' He also proved `that he had received permission from the recognized authorities
in said church to enter into polygamous marriage; ... that Daniel H. Wells, one having authority in said church
to perform the marriage ceremony, married the said defendant on or about the time the crime is alleged to have
been committed, to some woman by the name of Schofield, and that such marriage ceremony was performed
under and pursuant to the doctrines of said church.' ...

Upon this charge ... the question is raised, whether religious belief can be accepted as a justification of an overt
act made criminal by the law of the land. The inquiry is not as to the power of Congress to prescribe criminal
laws for the Territories, but as to the guilt of one who knowingly violates a law which has been properly enacted,
if he entertains a religious belief that the law is wrong.

Congress cannot pass a law for the government of the Territories which shall prohibit the free exercise of religion.
The first amendment to the Constitution expressly forbids such legislation. Religious freedom is guaranteed
everywhere throughout the United States, so far as congressional interference is concerned. The question to be
determined is, whether the law now under consideration comes within this prohibition.
210 | VALID SECULAR POLICY

The word `religion' is not defined in the Constitution. We must go elsewhere, therefore, to ascertain its meaning,
and nowhere more appropriately, we think, than to the history of the times in the midst of which the provision
was adopted. The precise point of the inquiry is, what is the religious freedom which has been guaranteed.

Before the adoption of the Constitution, attempts were made in some of the colonies and States to legislate not
only in respect to the establishment of religion, but in respect to its doctrines and precepts as well. The people
were taxed, against their will, for the support of religion, and sometimes for the support of particular sects to
whose tenets they could not and did not subscribe. Punishments were prescribed for a failure to attend upon
public worship, and sometimes for entertaining heretical opinions. The controversy upon this general subject
was animated in many of the States, but seemed at last to culminate in Virginia. In 1784, the House of Dele-
gates of that State having under consideration `a bill establishing provision for teachers of the Christian religion,'
postponed it until the next session, and directed that the bill should be published and distributed, and that the
people be requested `to signify their opinion respecting the adoption of such a bill at the next session of assem-
bly.'

This brought out a determined opposition. Amongst others, Mr. Madison prepared a "Memorial and Remon-
strance," which was widely circulated and signed, and in which he demonstrated "that religion, or the duty we
owe the Creator," was not within the cognizance of civil government. Semple's Virginia Baptists, Appendix.
At the next session, the proposed bill was not only defeated, but another, "for establishing religious freedom,"
drafted by Mr. Jefferson, was passed. 1 Jeff. Works, 45; 2 Howison, Hist. of Va. 298. In the preamble of this act
(12 Hening's Stat. 84) religious freedom is defined, and, after a recital

"that to suffer the civil magistrate to intrude his powers into the field of opinion, and to restrain the profession
or propagation of principles on supposition of their ill tendency is a dangerous fallacy which at once destroys all
religious liberty,"

It is declared "that it is time enough for the rightful purposes of civil government for its officers to interfere when
principles break out into overt acts against peace and good order."

In these two sentences is found the true distinction between what properly belongs to the church and what to
the State.

...

Polygamy has always been odious among the northern and western nations of Europe, and, until the establish-
ment of the Mormon Church, was almost exclusively a feature of the life of Asiatic and of African people. At
common law, the second marriage was always void, and from the earliest history of England polygamy has been
treated as an offence against society ... After the establishment of the ecclesiastical courts, and until the time of
James I, it was punished through the instrumentality of those tribunals ...

By the statute of 1 James I (c. 11), the offence, if committed in England or Wales, was made punishable in the
civil courts, and the penalty was death. ... [I]t was at a very early period reenacted ... in all the colonies. In con-
nection with the case we are now considering, it is a significant fact that, on the 8th of December, 1788, after
                                                                                                                 VALID SECULAR POLICY | 211

the passage of the act establishing religious freedom, and after the convention of Virginia had recommended as
an amendment to the Constitution of the United States the declaration in a bill of rights that "all men have an
equal, natural, and unalienable right to the free exercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience," the
legislature of that State substantially enacted the statute of James I., death penalty included ... From that day to
this, we think it may safely be said there never has been a time in any State of the Union when polygamy has
not been an offence against society, cognizable by the civil courts and punishable with more or less severity. In
the face of all this evidence, it is impossible to believe that the constitutional guaranty of religious freedom was
intended to prohibit legislation in respect to this most important feature of social life. Marriage, while from its
very nature a sacred obligation, is nevertheless, in most civilized nations, a civil contract, and usually regulated
by law. Upon it society may be said to be built, and out of its fruits spring social relations and social obligations
and duties, with which government is necessarily required to deal. In fact, according as monogamous or polyg-
amous marriages are allowed, do we find the principles on which the government of the people, to a greater or
less extent, rests. Professor Lieber says, polygamy leads to the patriarchal principle, and which, when applied to
large communities, fetters the people in stationary despotism, while that principle cannot long exist in connec-
tion with monogamy ...

In our opinion, the statute immediately under consideration is within the legislative power of Congress. It is
constitutional and valid as prescribing a rule of action for all those residing in the Territories, and in places over
which the United States have exclusive control. This being so, the only question which remains is, whether those
who make polygamy a part of their religion are excepted from the operation of the statute. If they are, then those
who do not make polygamy a part of their religious belief may be found guilty and punished, while those who
do, must be acquitted and go free. This would be introducing a new element into criminal law. Laws are made
for the government of actions, and while they cannot interfere with mere religious belief and opinions, they may
with practices. Suppose one believed that human sacrifices were a necessary part of religious worship, would it
be seriously contended that the civil government under which he lived could not interfere to prevent a sacrifice?
Or if a wife religiously believed it was her duty to burn herself upon the funeral pile of her dead husband, would
it be beyond the power of the civil government to prevent her carrying her belief into practice?

...

A criminal intent is generally an element of crime, but every man is presumed to intend the necessary and legit-
imate consequences of what he knowingly does. Here the accused knew he had been once married, and that his
first wife was living. He also knew that his second marriage was forbidden by law. When, therefore, he married
the second time, he is presumed to have intended to break the law. And the breaking of the law is the crime.
Every act necessary to constitute the crime was knowingly done, and the crime was therefore knowingly com-
mitted. Ignorance of a fact may sometimes be taken as evidence of a want of criminal intent, but not ignorance
of the law. The only defense of the accused in this case is his belief that the law ought not to have been enacted.
It matters not that his belief was a part of his professed religion: it was still belief, and belief only.

... Congress, in 1862, saw fit to make bigamy a crime in the Territories. This was done because of the evil conse-
quences that were supposed to flow from plural marriages. All the court did was to call the attention of the jury
to the peculiar character of the crime for which the accused was on trial, and to remind them of the duty they
§212 | VALID SECULAR POLICY

had to perform. There was no appeal to the passions, no instigation of prejudice. Upon the showing made by
the accused himself, he was guilty of a violation of the law under which he had been indicted: and the effort of
the court seems to have been not to withdraw the minds of the jury from the issue to be tried, but to bring them
to it; not to make them partial, but to keep them impartial.

Upon a careful consideration of the whole case, we are satisfied that no error was committed by the court below.

Judgment affirmed.

    Vote: 9-0

...

MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.

Newton Cantwell and his two sons, Jesse and Russell, members of a group known as Jehovah's Witnesses, and
claiming to be ordained ministers, were arrested in New Haven, Connecticut, and each was charged by infor-
mation in five counts, with statutory and common law offenses. After trial in the Court of Common Pleas of
New Haven County each of them was convicted on the third count, which charged a violation' of § 6294 of
the General' Statutes of Connecticut, and on the fifth count, which charged commission of the common law
offense of inciting a breach of the peace. On appeal to the Supreme Court the conviction of all three on the third
count was affirmed. The conviction of Jesse Cantwell, on the fifth count, was also affirmed, but the conviction
of Newton and Russell on that count was reversed and a new trial ordered as to them.

By demurrers to the information, by requests for rulings of law at the trial, and by their assignments of error in
the State Supreme Court, the appellants pressed the contention that the statute under which the third count
was drawn was offensive to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because, on its face and as con-
strued and applied, it denied them freedom of speech and prohibited their free exercise of religion ...

The facts which were held to support the conviction of Jesse Cantwell on the fifth count were that he stopped
two men in the street, asked, and received, permission to play a phonograph record, and played the record "Ene-
mies," which attacked the religion and church of the two men, who were Catholics. Both were incensed by the
                                                                                                                 VALID SECULAR POLICY | 213

contents of the record and were tempted to strike Cantwell unless he went away. On being told to be on his way
he left their presence. There was no evidence that he was personally offensive or entered into any argument with
those he interviewed.

The court held that the charge was not assault or breach of the peace or threats on Cantwell's part, but invoking
or inciting others to breach of the peace, and that the facts supported the conviction of that offense.

First. We hold that the statute, as construed and applied to the appellants, deprives them of their liberty without
due process of law in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment. The fundamental concept of liberty
embodied in that Amendment embraces the liberties guaranteed by the First Amendment. The First Amend-
ment declares that Congress shall make no law respect in the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free
exercise thereof. The Fourteenth Amendment has rendered the legislatures of the states as incompetent as Con-
gress to enact such laws. The constitutional inhibition of legislation on the subject of religion has a double
aspect. On the one hand, it forestalls compulsion by law of the acceptance of any creed or the practice of any
form of worship. Freedom of conscience and freedom to adhere to such religious organization or form of wor-
ship as the individual may choose cannot be restricted by law. On the other hand, it safeguards the free exercise
of the chosen form of religion. Thus, the Amendment embraces two concepts, freedom to believe and freedom
to act. The first is absolute but, in the nature of things the second cannot be. Conduct remains subject to regu-
lation for the protection of society. The freedom to act must have appropriate definition to preserve the enforce-
ment of that protection. In every case the power to regulate must be so exercised as not, in attaining a permissible
end, unduly to infringe the protected freedom. No one would contest the proposition that a State may not, by
statute; wholly deny the right to preach or to disseminate religious views. Plainly such a previous and absolute
restraint would violate the terms of the guarantee. It is equally clear that a State may by general and non-discrim-
inatory legislation regulate the times, the places, and the manner of soliciting upon its streets, and of holding
meetings thereon; and may in other respects safeguard the peace, good order and comfort of the community,
without unconstitutionally invading the liberties protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. The appellants are
right in their insistence that the Act in question is not such a regulation. If a certificate is pro-cured, solicitation
is permitted without restraint but, in the absence of a certificate, solicitation is altogether prohibited.

The appellants urge that to require them to obtain a certificate as a condition of soliciting support for their views
amounts to a prior restraint on the exercise of their religion within the meaning of the Constitution. The State
insists that the Act, as construed by the Supreme Court of Connecticut, imposes no previous restraint upon the
dissemination of religious views or teaching, but merely safeguards against the perpetration of frauds under the
cloak of religion. Conceding that this is so, the question remains whether the method adopted by Connecticut
to that end transgresses the liberty safeguarded by the Constitution.

The general regulation, in the public interest, of solicitation, which does not involve any religious test and does
not unreasonably obstruct or delay the collection of funds, is not open to any constitutional objection, even
though the collection be for a religious purpose. Such regulation would not constitute a prohibited previous
restraint on the free exercise of religion or interpose an inadmissible obstacle to its exercise. It will be noted, how-
ever, that the Act requires an application to the secretary of the public welfare council of the State; that he is
empowered to determine whether the cause is a religious one, and that the issue of a certificate depends upon his
214 | VALID SECULAR POLICY

affirmative action. If he finds that the cause is not that of religion, to solicit for it becomes a crime. He is not to
issue a certificate as a matter of course. His decision to issue or refuse it involves appraisal of facts, the exercise
of judgment, and the formation of an opinion. He is authorized to withhold his approval if he determines that
the cause is not a religious one. Such a censorship of religion as the means of determining its right to survive is
a denial of liberty protected by the First Amendment and included in the liberty which is within the protection
of the Fourteenth ...

It is suggested that the statute is to be read as requiring the officer to issue a certificate unless the cause in question
is clearly not a religious one, and that, if he violates his duty, his action will be corrected by a court.

To this suggestion there are several sufficient answers. The line between a discretionary and a ministerial act is
not always easy to mark, and the statute has not been construed by the state court to impose a mere ministerial
duty on the secretary of the welfare council. Upon his decision as to the nature of the cause the right to solicit
depends. Moreover, the availability of a judicial remedy for abuses in the system of licensing still leaves that sys-
tem one of previous restraint which, in the field of free speech and press, we have held inadmissible. A statute
authorizing previous restraint upon the exercise of the guaranteed freedom by judicial decision after trial is as
obnoxious to the Constitution as one providing for like restraint by administrative action.

Nothing we have said is intended even remotely to imply that, under the cloak of religion, persons may, with
impunity, commit frauds upon the public. Certainly penal laws are available to punish such conduct. Even the
exercise of religion may be at some slight inconvenience in order that the State may protect its citizens from
injury. Without doubt, a State may protect its citizens from fraudulent solicitation by requiring a stranger in
the community, before permitting him publicly to solicit funds for any purpose, to establish his identity and his
authority to act for the cause which he purports to represent. The State is likewise free to regulate the time and
manner of solicitation generally, in the interest of public safety, peace, comfort or convenience. But to condition
the solicitation of aid for the perpetuation of religious views or systems upon a license, the grant of which rests
in the exercise of a determination by state authority as to what is a religious cause, is to lay a forbidden burden
upon the exercise of liberty protected by the Constitution.

Second. We hold that, in the circumstances disclosed, the conviction of Jesse Cantwell on the fifth count must
be set aside. Decision as to the lawfulness of the conviction demands the weighing of two conflicting interests.
The fundamental law declares the interest of the United States that the free exercise of religion be not prohib-
ited and that freedom to communicate information and opinion be not abridged. The State of Connecticut has
an obvious interest in the preservation and protection of peace and good order within her borders. We must
determine whether the alleged protection of the State's interest, means to which end would, in the absence of
limitation by the Federal Constitution, lie wholly within the State's discretion, has been pressed, in this instance,
to a point where it has come into fatal collision with the overriding interest protected by the federal compact ...

We find in the instant case no assault or threatening of bodily harm, no truculent bearing, no intentional dis-
courtesy, no personal abuse. On the contrary, we find only an effort to persuade a willing listener to buy a book
or to contribute money in the interest of what Cantwell, however misguided others may think him, conceived
to be true religion.
                                                                                                                 VALID SECULAR POLICY | 215

In the realm of religious faith, and in that of political belief, sharp differences arise. In both fields the tenets of
one man may seem the rankest error to his neighbor. To persuade others to his own point of view, the pleader, as
we know, at times, resorts to exaggeration, to vilification of men who have been, or are, prominent in church or
state, and even to false statement. But the people of this nation have ordained in the light of history, that, in spite
of the probability of excesses and abuses, these liberties are, in the long view, essential to enlightened opinion
and right conduct on the part of the citizens of a democracy. The essential characteristic of these liberties is that,
under their shield many types of life, character, opinion and belief can develop unmolested and unobstructed.
Nowhere is this shield more necessary than in our own country for a people composed of many races and of
many creeds. There are limits to the exercise of these liberties. The danger in these times from the coercive activ-
ities of those who in the delusion of racial or religious conceit would incite violence and breaches of the peace
in order to deprive others of their equal right to the exercise of their liberties, is emphasized by events familiar to
all. These and other transgressions of those limits the States appropriately may punish.

Although the contents of the record not unnaturally aroused animosity, we think that, in the absence of a statute
narrowly drawn to define and punish specific conduct as constituting a clear and present danger to a substan-
tial interest of the State, the petitioner's communication, considered in the light of the constitutional guaran-
tees, raised no such clear and present menace to public peace and order as to render him liable to conviction of
the common law offense in question. The judgment affirming the convictions on the third and fifth counts is
reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

Reversed.

Mr. Justice Warren announced the judgment of the Court

This case concerns the constitutional validity of the application to appellants of the Pennsylvania criminal
statute, enacted in 1959, which proscribes the Sunday retail sale of certain enumerated commodities ... Thus,
the only question for consideration is whether the statute interferes with the free exercise of appellants' religion.

Appellants are merchants in Philadelphia who engage in the retail sale of clothing and home furnishings within
the proscription of the statute in issue. Each of the appellants is a member of the Orthodox Jewish faith, which
requires the closing of their places of business and a total abstention from all manner of work from nightfall each
Friday until nightfall each Saturday. They instituted a suit in the court below seeking a permanent injunction
against the enforcement of the 1959 statute. Their complaint, as amended, alleged that appellants had previously
kept their places of business open on Sunday; that each of appellants had done a substantial amount of business
on Sunday, compensating somewhat for their closing on Saturday; that Sunday closing will result in impairing
the ability of all appellants to earn a livelihood, and will render appellant Braunfeld unable to continue in his
business, thereby losing his capital investment; that the statute is unconstitutional for the reasons stated above.

...

Concededly, appellants and all other persons who wish to work on Sunday will be burdened economically by the
State's day of rest mandate, and appellants point out that their religion requires them to refrain from work on
Saturday as well. Our inquiry, then, is whether, in these circumstances, the First and Fourteenth Amendments
forbid application of the Sunday Closing Law to appellants.

Certain aspects of religious exercise cannot in any way be restricted or burdened by either federal or state legisla-
tion. Compulsion by law of the acceptance of any creed or the practice of any form of worship is strictly forbid-
den. The freedom to hold religious beliefs and opinions is absolute. Cantwell v. Connecticut; Reynolds v. United
States. Thus, in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, this Court held that state action compelling
school children to salute the flag, on pain of expulsion from public school, was contrary to the First and Four-
teenth Amendments when applied to those students whose religious beliefs forbade saluting a flag. But this is
                                                                                                                 VALID SECULAR POLICY | 217

not the case at bar; the statute before us does not make criminal the holding of any religious belief or opinion,
nor does it force anyone to embrace any religious belief or to say or believe anything in conflict with his religious
tenets.

However, the freedom to act, even when the action is in accord with one's religious convictions, is not totally
free from legislative restrictions. Cantwell v. Connecticut. As pointed out in Reynolds v. United States, legislative
power over mere opinion is forbidden, but it may reach people's actions when they are found to be in violation
of important social duties or subversive of good order, even when the actions are demanded by one's religion.

...

To strike down, without the most critical scrutiny, legislation which imposes only an indirect burden on the
exercise of religion, i.e., legislation which does not make unlawful the religious practice itself, would radically
restrict the operating latitude of the legislature. Statutes which tax income and limit the amount which may be
deducted for religious contributions impose an indirect economic burden on the observance of the religion of
the citizen whose religion requires him to donate a greater amount to his church; statutes which require the
courts to be closed on Saturday and Sunday impose a similar indirect burden on the observance of the religion
of the trial lawyer whose religion requires him to rest on a weekday. The list of legislation of this nature is nearly
limitless.

MR. JUSTICE STEWART, dissenting.

I agree with substantially all that MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN has written. Pennsylvania has passed a law which
compels an Orthodox Jew to choose between his religious faith and his economic survival. That is a cruel choice.
It is a choice which I think no State can constitutionally demand. For me, this is not something that can be swept
under the rug and forgotten in the interest of enforced Sunday togetherness. I think the impact of this law upon
these appellants grossly violates their constitutional right to the free exercise of their religion.

JUSTICE BRENNAN DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.

Appellant, a member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, was discharged by her South Carolina employer
because she would not work on Saturday, the Sabbath Day of her faith. When she was unable to obtain other
employment because, from conscientious scruples, she would not take Saturday work, she filed a claim for
unemployment compensation benefits under the South Carolina Unemployment Compensation Act. That law
provides that, to be eligible for benefits, a claimant must be "able to work and ... available for work"; and, further,
that a claimant is ineligible for benefits "[i]f ... he has failed, without good cause ... to accept available suitable
work when offered him by the employment office or the employer. ..."

The appellee Employment Security Commission, in administrative proceedings under the statute, found that
appellant's restriction upon her availability for Saturday work brought her within the provision disqualifying for
benefits insured workers who fail, without good cause, to accept "suitable work when offered ... by the employ-
ment office or the employer ..." The Commission's finding was sustained by the Court of Common Pleas for
Spartanburg County. That court's judgment was in turn affirmed by the South Carolina Supreme Court, which
rejected appellant's contention that, as applied to her, the disqualifying provisions of the South Carolina statute
abridged her right to the free exercise of her religion secured under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amend-
ment through the Fourteenth Amendment. The State Supreme Court held specifically that appellant's ineligi-
bility infringed no constitutional liberties because such a construction of the statute "places no restriction upon
the appellant's freedom of religion nor does it in any way prevent her in the exercise of her right and freedom to
observe her religious beliefs in accordance with the dictates of her conscience." We noted probable jurisdiction
of appellant's appeal. We reverse the judgment of the South Carolina Supreme Court and remand for further
proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
                                                                                                          APPLYING STRICT SCRUTINY | 219

The door of the Free Exercise Clause stands tightly closed against any governmental regulation of religious beliefs
as such. Government may neither compel affirmation of a repugnant belief, , nor penalize or discriminate against
individuals or groups because they hold religious views abhorrent to the authorities, nor employ the taxing
power to inhibit the dissemination of particular religious views,. On the other hand, the Court has rejected chal-
lenges under the Free Exercise Clause to governmental regulation of certain overt acts prompted by religious
beliefs or principles, for "even when the action is in accord with one's religious convictions, [it] is not totally free
from legislative restrictions." The conduct or actions so regulated have invariably posed some substantial threat
to public safety, peace or order.

Plainly enough, appellant's conscientious objection to Saturday work constitutes no conduct prompted by reli-
gious principles of a kind within the reach of state legislation. If, therefore, the decision of the South Carolina
Supreme Court is to withstand appellant's constitutional challenge, it must be either because her disqualifi-
cation as a beneficiary represents no infringement by the State of her constitutional rights of free exercise, or
because any incidental burden on the free exercise of appellant's religion may be justified by a "compelling state
interest in the regulation of a subject within the State's constitutional power to regulate. ..."

We turn first to the question whether the disqualification for benefits imposes any burden on the free exercise
of appellant's religion. We think it is clear that it does. In a sense the consequences of such a disqualification to
religious principles and practices may be only an indirect result of welfare legislation within the State's general
competence to enact; it is true that no criminal sanctions directly compel appellant to work a six-day week. But
this is only the beginning, not the end, of our inquiry. For "[i]f the purpose or effect of a law is to impede the
observance of one or all religions or is to discriminate invidiously between religions, that law is constitution-
ally invalid even though the burden may be characterized as being only indirect." Here not only is it apparent
that appellant's declared ineligibility for benefits derives solely from the practice of her religion, but the pressure
upon her to forego that practice is unmistakable. The ruling forces her to choose between following the precepts
of her religion and forfeiting benefits, on the one hand, and abandoning one of the precepts of her religion in
order to accept work, on the other hand. Governmental imposition of such a choice puts the same kind of bur-
den upon the free exercise of religion as would a fine imposed against appellant for her Saturday worship.

Nor may the South Carolina court's construction of the statute be saved from constitutional infirmity on the
ground that unemployment compensation benefits are not appellant's "right" but merely a "privilege." It is too
late in the day to doubt that the liberties of religion and expression may be infringed by the denial of or placing
of conditions upon a benefit or privilege ... Likewise, to condition the availability of benefits upon this appel-
lant's willingness to violate a cardinal principle of her religious faith effectively penalizes the free exercise of her
constitutional liberties.

Significantly South Carolina expressly saves the Sunday worshipper from having to make the kind of choice
which we here hold infringes the Sabbatarian's religious liberty. When in times of "national emergency" the
textile plants are authorized by the State Commissioner of Labor to operate on Sunday, "no employee shall be
required to work on Sunday ... who is conscientiously opposed to Sunday work; and if any employee should
refuse to work on Sunday on account of conscientious ... objections he or she shall not jeopardize his or her
seniority by such refusal or be discriminated against in any other manner." S. C. Code, § 64-4. No question
220 | APPLYING STRICT SCRUTINY

of the disqualification of a Sunday worshipper for benefits is likely to arise, since we cannot suppose that
an employer will discharge him in violation of this statute. The unconstitutionality of the disqualification of
the Sabbatarian is thus compounded by the religious discrimination which South Carolina's general statutory
scheme necessarily effects.

We must next consider whether some compelling state interest enforced in the eligibility provisions of the South
Carolina statute justifies the substantial infringement of appellant's First Amendment right. It is basic that no
showing merely of a rational relationship to some colorable state interest would suffice; in this highly sensitive
constitutional area, "[o]nly the gravest abuses, endangering paramount interests, give occasion for permissible
limitation." No such abuse or danger has been advanced in the present case. The appellees suggest no more
than a possibility that the filing of fraudulent claims by unscrupulous claimants feigning religious objections
to Saturday work might not only dilute the unemployment compensation fund but also hinder the schedul-
ing by employers of necessary Saturday work. But that possibility is not apposite here because no such objec-
tion appears to have been made before the South Carolina Supreme Court, and we are unwilling to assess the
importance of an asserted state interest without the views of the state court. Nor, if the contention had been
made below, would the record appear to sustain it; there is no proof whatever to warrant such fears of malin-
gering or deceit as those which the respondents now advance. Even if consideration of such evidence is not fore-
closed by the prohibition against judicial inquiry into the truth or falsity of religious beliefs--a question as to
which we intimate no view since it is not before us--it is highly doubtful whether such evidence would be suf-
ficient to warrant a substantial infringement of religious liberties. For even if the possibility of spurious claims
did threaten to dilute the fund and disrupt the scheduling of work, it would plainly be incumbent upon the
appellees to demonstrate that no alternative forms of regulation would combat such abuses without infringing
First Amendment rights.

In these respects, then, the state interest asserted in the present case is wholly dissimilar to the interests which
were found to justify the less direct burden upon religious practices in Braunfeld v. Brown. The Court recog-
nized that the Sunday closing law which that decision sustained undoubtedly served "to make the practice of
[the Orthodox Jewish merchants'] ... religious beliefs more expensive." But the statute was nevertheless saved by
a countervailing factor which finds no equivalent in the instant case--a strong state interest in providing one
uniform day of rest for all workers. That secular objective could be achieved, the Court found, only by declar-
ing Sunday to be that day of rest. Requiring exemptions for Sabbatarians, while theoretically possible, appeared
to present an administrative problem of such magnitude, or to afford the exempted class so great a competitive
advantage, that such a requirement would have rendered the entire statutory scheme unworkable. In the present
case no such justifications underlie the determination of the state court that appellant's religion makes her ineli-
gible to receive benefits.

In holding as we do, plainly we are not fostering the "establishment" of the Seventh-day Adventist religion in
South Carolina, for the extension of unemployment benefits to Sabbatarians in common with Sunday worship-
pers reflects nothing more than the governmental obligation of neutrality in the face of religious differences, and
does not represent that involvement of religious with secular institutions which it is the object of the Establish-
ment Clause to forestall. Nor does the recognition of the appellant's right to unemployment benefits under the
state statute serve to abridge any other person's religious liberties. Nor do we, by our decision today, declare the
                                                                                                          APPLYING STRICT SCRUTINY | 221

existence of a constitutional right to unemployment benefits on the part of all persons whose religious convic-
tions are the cause of their unemployment. This is not a case in which an employee's religious convictions serve
to make him a nonproductive member of society. Finally, nothing we say today constrains the States to adopt
any particular form or scheme of unemployment compensation. Our holding today is only that South Carolina
may not constitutionally apply the eligibility provisions so as to constrain a worker to abandon his religious
convictions respecting the day of rest. This holding but reaffirms a principle that we announced a decade and
a half ago, namely that no State may "exclude individual Catholics, Lutherans, Mohammedans, Baptists, Jews,
Methodists, Non-believers, Presbyterians, or the members of any other faith, because of their faith, or lack of it,
from receiving the benefits of public welfare legislation."

In view of the result we have reached under the First and Fourteenth Amendments' guarantee of free exercise
of religion, we have no occasion to consider appellant's claim that the denial of benefits also deprived her of the
equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.

The judgment of the South Carolina Supreme Court is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceed-
ings not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS, CONCURRING.

The case we have for decision seems to me to be of small dimensions, though profoundly important. The ques-
tion is whether the South Carolina law which denies unemployment compensation to a Seventh-day Adventist
who, because of her religion, has declined to work on her Sabbath, is a law "prohibiting the free exercise" of reli-
gion as those words are used in the First Amendment.

It seems obvious to me that this law does run afoul of that clause.

Religious scruples of Moslems require them to attend a mosque on Friday and to pray five times daily. Religious
scruples of a Sikh require him to carry a regular or a symbolic sword. Religious scruples of a Jehovah's Witness
teach him to be a colporteur, going from door to door, from town to town, distributing his religious pam-
phlets. Religious scruples of a Quaker compel him to refrain from swearing and to affirm, instead. Religious
scruples of a Buddhist may require him to refrain from partaking of any flesh, even of fish. The examples could
be multiplied, including those of the Seventh-day Adventist, whose Sabbath is Saturday and who is advised not
to eat some meats. These suffice, however, to show that many people hold beliefs alien to the majority of our
society -- beliefs that are protected by the First Amendment but which could easily be trod upon under the
guise of "police" or "health" regulations reflecting the majority's views.

Some have thought that a majority of a community can, through state action, compel a minority to observe their
particular religious scruples so long as the majority's rule can be said to perform some valid secular function.
§222 | APPLYING STRICT SCRUTINY

That was the essence of the Court's decision in the Sunday Blue Law Cases, a ruling from which I then dissented
and still dissent. That ruling of the Court travels part of the distance that South Carolina asks us to go now. She
asks us to hold that, when it comes to a day of rest, a Sabbatarian must conform with the scruples of the majority
in order to obtain unemployment benefits.

The result turns not on the degree of injury, which may indeed be nonexistent by ordinary standards. The harm
is the interference with the individual's scruples or conscience --an important area of privacy which the First
Amendment fences off from government. The interference here is as plain as it is in Soviet Russia, where a
churchgoer is given a second-class citizenship, resulting in harm though perhaps not in measurable damages.

This case is resolvable not in terms of what an individual can demand of government, but solely in terms of what
government may not do to an individual in violation of his religious scruples. The fact that government cannot
exact from me a surrender of one iota of my religious scruples does not, of course, mean that I can demand of
government a sum of money, the better to exercise them. For the Free Exercise Clause is written in terms of what
the government cannot do to the individual, not in terms of what the individual can exact from the government.

Those considerations, however, are not relevant here. If appellant is otherwise qualified for unemployment ben-
efits, payments will be made to her not as a Seventh-day Adventist, but as an unemployed worker. Conceivably
these payments will indirectly benefit her church, but no more so than does the salary of any public employee.
Thus, this case does not involve the problems of direct or indirect state assistance to a religious organization
--matters relevant to the Establishment Clause, not in issue here.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER delivered the opinion of the Court.

On petition of the State of Wisconsin, we granted the writ of certiorari in this case to review a decision of the
Wisconsin Supreme Court holding that respondents' convictions of violating the State's compulsory school
                                                                                                          APPLYING STRICT SCRUTINY | 223

attendance law were invalid under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Consti-
tution made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment. For the reasons hereafter stated we affirm
the judgment of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin.

Respondents Jonas Yoder and Wallace Miller are members of the Old Order Amish religion, and respondent
Adin Yutzy is a member of the Conservative Amish Mennonite Church. They and their families are residents
of Green County, Wisconsin. Wisconsin's compulsory school-attendance law required them to cause their chil-
dren to attend public or private school until reaching age 16 but the respondents declined to send their children,
ages 14 and 15, to public school after they completed the eighth grade. The children were not enrolled in any
private school, or within any recognized exception to the compulsory-attendance law, and they are conceded to
be subject to the Wisconsin statute ...

On complaint of the school district administrator for the public schools, respondents were charged, tried, and
convicted of violating the compulsory attendance law in Green County Court, and were fined the sum of $5
each. Respondents defended on the ground that the application of the compulsory attendance law violated their
rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

...

In support of their position, respondents presented as expert witnesses scholars on religion and education whose
testimony is uncontradicted. They expressed their opinions on the relationship of the Amish belief concerning
school attendance to the more general tenets of their religion, and described the impact that compulsory high
school attendance could have on the continued survival of Amish communities as they exist in the United States
today ... Amish beliefs require members of the community to make their living by farming or closely related
activities. Broadly speaking, the Old Order Amish religion pervades and determines the entire mode of life of
its adherents. Their conduct is regulated in great detail by the Ordnung, or rules, of the church community.
Adult baptism, which occurs in late adolescence, is the time at which Amish young people voluntarily under-
take heavy obligations, not unlike the Bar Mitzvah of the Jews, to abide by the rules of the church community.
Amish objection to formal education beyond the eighth grade is firmly grounded in these central religious con-
cepts. They object to the high school, and higher education generally, because the values they teach are in marked
variance with Amish values and the Amish way of life; they view secondary school education as an impermis-
sible exposure of their children to a "worldly". influence in conflict with their beliefs. The high school tends
to emphasize intellectual and scientific accomplishments, self-distinction, competitiveness, worldly success, and
social life with other students. Amish society emphasizes informal learning-through-doing; a life of "goodness,"
rather than a life of intellect; wisdom, rather than technical knowledge; community welfare, rather than compe-
tition; and separation from, rather than integration with, contemporary worldly society.

Formal high school education beyond the eighth grade is contrary to Amish beliefs not only because it places
Amish children in an environment hostile to Amish beliefs, with increasing emphasis on competition in class
work and sports and with pressure to conform to the styles, manners, and ways of the peer group, but also
because it takes them away from their community, physically and emotionally, during the crucial and formative
adolescent period of life. During this period, the children must acquire Amish attitudes favoring manual work
224 | APPLYING STRICT SCRUTINY

and self-reliance and the specific skills needed to perform the adult role of an Amish farmer or housewife. They
must learn to enjoy physical labor. Once a child has learned basic reading, writing, and elementary mathematics,
these traits, skills, and attitudes admittedly fall within the category of those best learned through example and
"doing," rather than in a classroom. And, at this time in life, the Amish child must also grow in his faith and his
relationship to the Amish community if he is to be prepared to accept the heavy obligations imposed by adult
baptism. In short, high school attendance with teachers who are not of the Amish faith -- and may even be
hostile to it -- interposes a serious barrier to the integration of the Amish child into the Amish religious com-
munity. Dr. John Hostetler, one of the experts on Amish society, testified that the modern high school is not
equipped, in curriculum or social environment, to impart the values promoted by Amish society.

The Amish do not object to elementary education through the first eight grades as a general proposition because
they agree that their children must have basic skills in the "three R's" in order to read the Bible, to be good farm-
ers and citizens, and to be able to deal with non-Amish people when necessary in the course of daily affairs. They
view such a basic education as acceptable because it does not significantly expose their children to worldly values
or interfere with their development in the Amish community during the crucial adolescent period. While Amish
accept compulsory elementary education generally, wherever possible they have established their own elemen-
tary schools in many respects like the small local schools of the past ...

There is no doubt as to the power of a State, having a high responsibility for education of its citizens, to impose
reasonable regulations for the control and duration of basic education. Providing public schools ranks at the
very apex of the function of a State. Yet even this paramount responsibility was, in Pierce, made to yield to the
right of parents to provide an equivalent education in a privately operated system ...

... Thus, a State's interest in universal education, however highly we rank it, is not totally free from a balancing
process when it impinges on fundamental rights and interests, such as those specifically protected by the Free
Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, and the traditional interest of parents with respect to the religious
upbringing of their children so long as they, in the words of Pierce, "prepare [them] for additional obligations
..."

It follows that, in order for Wisconsin to compel school attendance beyond the eighth grade against a claim that
such attendance interferes with the practice of a legitimate religious belief, it must appear either that the State
does not deny the free exercise of religious belief by its requirement or that there is a state interest of sufficient
magnitude to override the interest claiming protection under the Free Exercise Clause ...

The essence of all that has been said and written on the subject is that only those interests of the highest order
and those not otherwise served can overbalance legitimate claims to the free exercise of religion. We can accept
it as settled, therefore, that, however strong the State's interest in universal compulsory education, it is by no
means absolute to the exclusion or subordination of all other interests.

We come then to the quality of the claims of the respondents concerning the alleged encroachment of Wiscon-
sin's compulsory school attendance statute on their rights and the rights of their children to the free exercise
of the religious beliefs they and their forebears have adhered to for almost three centuries. In evaluating those
claims, we must be careful to determine whether the Amish religious faith and their mode of life are, as they
                                                                                                          APPLYING STRICT SCRUTINY | 225

claim, inseparable and interdependent. A way of life, however virtuous and admirable, may not be interposed
as a barrier to reasonable state regulation of education if it is based on purely secular considerations; to have the
protection of the Religion Clauses, the claims must be rooted in religious belief. Although a determination of
what is a "religious" belief or practice entitled to constitutional protection may present a most delicate question,
the very concept of ordered liberty precludes allowing every person to make his own standards on matters of
conduct in which society as a whole has important interests. Thus, if the Amish asserted their claims because of
their subjective evaluation and rejection of the contemporary secular values accepted by the majority, much as
Thoreau rejected the social values of his time and isolated himself at Walden Pond, their claims would not rest
on a religious basis. Thoreau's choice was philosophical and personal, rather than religious, and such belief does
not rise to the demands of the Religion Clauses.

Giving no weight to such secular considerations, however, we see that the record in this case abundantly sup-
ports the claim that the traditional way of life of the Amish is not merely a matter of personal preference, but
one of deep religious conviction, shared by an organized group, and intimately related to daily living ...

The conclusion is inescapable that secondary schooling, by exposing Amish children to worldly influences in
terms of attitudes, goals, and values contrary to beliefs, and by substantially interfering with the religious devel-
opment of the Amish child and his integration into the way of life of the Amish faith community at the crucial
adolescent stage of development, contravenes the basic religious tenets and practice of the Amish faith, both as
to the parent and the child.

We turn, then, to the State's broader contention that its interest in its system of compulsory education is so com-
pelling that even the established religious practices of the Amish must give way. Where fundamental claims of
religious freedom are at stake, however, we cannot accept such a sweeping claim; despite its admitted validity in
the generality of cases, we must searchingly examine the interests that the State seeks to promote by its require-
ment for compulsory education to age 16, and the impediment to those objectives that would flow from recog-
nizing the claimed Amish exemption.

The State advances two primary arguments in support of its system of compulsory education. It notes, as
Thomas Jefferson pointed out early in our history, that some degree of education is necessary to prepare citizens
to participate effectively and intelligently in our open political system if we are to preserve freedom and inde-
pendence. Further, education prepares individuals to be self-reliant and self-sufficient participants in society. We
accept these propositions.

However, the evidence adduced by the Amish in this case is persuasively to the effect that an additional one or
two years of formal high school for Amish children in place of their long-established program of informal voca-
tional education would do little to serve those interests ...

... Whatever their idiosyncrasies as seen by the majority, this record strongly shows that the Amish community
has been a highly successful social unit within our society, even if apart from the conventional "mainstream." Its
members are productive and very law-abiding members of society; they reject public welfare in any of its usual
modern forms. The Congress itself recognized their self-sufficiency by authorizing exemption of such groups as
the Amish from the obligation to pay social security taxes.
226 | APPLYING STRICT SCRUTINY

For the reasons stated we hold, with the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, that the First and Fourteenth Amend-
ments prevent the State from compelling respondents to cause their children to attend formal high school to age
16. Our disposition of this case, however, in no way alters our recognition of the obvious fact that courts are
not school boards or legislatures, and are ill-equipped to determine the "necessity" of discrete aspects of a State's
program of compulsory education. This should suggest that courts must move with great circumspection in per-
forming the sensitive and delicate task of weighing a State's legitimate social concern when faced with religious
claims for exemption from generally applicable educational requirements. It cannot be overemphasized that we
are not dealing with a way of life and mode of education by a group claiming to have recently discovered some
"progressive" or more enlightened process for rearing children for modern life.

Aided by a history of three centuries as an identifiable religious sect and a long history as a successful and self-
sufficient segment of American society, the Amish in this case have convincingly demonstrated the sincerity of
their religious beliefs, the interrelationship of belief with their mode of life, the vital role that belief and daily
conduct play in the continued survival of Old Order Amish communities and their religious organization, and
the hazards presented by the State's enforcement of a statute generally valid as to others. Beyond this, they have
carried the even more difficult burden of demonstrating the adequacy of their alternative mode of continuing
informal vocational education in terms of precisely those overall interests that the State advances in support of
its program of compulsory high school education. In light of this convincing showing, one that probably few
other religious groups or sects could make, and weighing the minimal difference between what the State would
require and what the Amish already accept, it was incumbent on the State to show with more particularity how
its admittedly strong interest in compulsory education would be adversely affected by granting an exemption to
the Amish.

Nothing we hold is intended to undermine the general applicability of the State's compulsory school attendance
statutes or to limit the power of the State to promulgate reasonable standards that, while not impairing the free
exercise of religion, provide for continuing agricultural vocational education under parental and church guid-
ance by the Old Order Amish or others similarly situated. The States have had a long history of amicable and
effective relationships with church-sponsored schools, and there is no basis for assuming that, in this related
context, reasonable standards cannot be established concerning the content of the continuing vocational educa-
tion of Amish children under parental guidance, provided always that state regulations are not inconsistent with
what we have said in this opinion.

JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.

Petitioner S. Simcha Goldman contends that the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United
States Constitution permits him to wear a yarmulke while in uniform, notwithstanding an Air Force regulation
mandating uniform dress for Air Force personnel. The District Court for the District of Columbia permanently
enjoined the Air Force from enforcing its regulation against petitioner and from penalizing him for wearing
his yarmulke. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed on the ground that the Air
Force's strong interest in discipline justified the strict enforcement of its uniform dress requirements. We granted
certiorari because of the importance of the question, and now affirm ...

Until 1981, petitioner was not prevented from wearing his yarmulke on the base. He avoided controversy by
remaining close to his duty station in the health clinic and by wearing his service cap over the yarmulke when out
of doors. But in April 1981, after he testified as a defense witness at a court-martial wearing his yarmulke but not
his service cap, opposing counsel lodged a complaint with Colonel Joseph Gregory, the Hospital Commander,
arguing that petitioner's practice of wearing his yarmulke was a violation of Air Force Regulation (AFR) 35-10.
This regulation states in pertinent part that "[h]eadgear will not be worn ... [w]hile indoors except by armed
security police in the performance of their duties ..."

Our review of military regulations challenged on First Amendment grounds is far more deferential than con-
stitutional review of similar laws or regulations designed for civilian society. The military need not encourage
debate or tolerate protest to the extent that such tolerance is required of the civilian state by the First Amend-
ment; to accomplish its mission the military must foster instinctive obedience, unity, commitment, and esprit de
corps ... The essence of military service "is the subordination of the desires and interests of the individual to the
needs of the service."

...

Not only are courts "`ill-equipped to determine the impact upon discipline that any particular intrusion upon
military authority might have,"` but the military authorities have been charged by the Executive and Legislative
228 | APPLYING STRICT SCRUTINY

Branches with carrying out our Nation's military policy."[J]udicial deference ... is at its apogee when legislative
action under the congressional authority to raise and support armies and make rules and regulations for their
governance is challenged ..."

The considered professional judgment of the Air Force is that the traditional outfitting of personnel in standard-
ized uniforms encourages the subordination of personal preferences and identities in favor of the overall group
mission. Uniforms encourage a sense of hierarchical unity by tending to eliminate outward individual distinc-
tions except for those of rank. The Air Force considers them as vital during peacetime as during war because its
personnel must be ready to provide an effective defense on a moment's notice; the necessary habits of discipline
and unity must be developed in advance of trouble. We have acknowledged that "[t]he inescapable demands of
military discipline and obedience to orders cannot be taught on battlefields; the habit of immediate compliance
with military procedures and orders must be virtually reflex with no time for debate or reflection ..."

Petitioner Goldman contends that the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment requires the Air Force to
make an exception to its uniform dress requirements for religious apparel unless the accouterments create a
"clear danger" of undermining discipline and esprit de corps. He asserts that in general, visible but "unobtrusive"
apparel will not create such a danger and must therefore be accommodated. He argues that the Air Force failed
to prove that a specific exception for his practice of wearing an unobtrusive yarmulke would threaten discipline.
He contends that the Air Force's assertion to the contrary is mere ipse dixit, with no support from actual experi-
ence or a scientific study in the record, and is contradicted by expert testimony that religious exceptions to AFR
35-10 are in fact desirable and will increase morale by making the Air Force a more humane place. But whether
or not expert witnesses may feel that religious exceptions to AFR 35-10 are desirable is quite beside the point.
The desirability of dress regulations in the military is decided by the appropriate military officials, and they are
under no constitutional mandate to abandon their considered professional judgment. Quite obviously, to the
extent the regulations do not permit the wearing of religious apparel such as a yarmulke, a practice described by
petitioner as silent devotion akin to prayer, military life may be more objectionable for petitioner and probably
others. But the First Amendment does not require the military to accommodate ...

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Affirmed.

JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.

...

This case requires us to decide whether the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment permits the State of
Oregon to include religiously inspired peyote use within the reach of its general criminal prohibition on use
of that drug, and thus permits the State to deny unemployment benefits to persons dismissed from their jobs
because of such religiously inspired use.

Oregon law prohibits the knowing or intentional possession of a "controlled substance" unless the substance
has been prescribed by a medical practitioner. Ore. Rev. Stat. § 475.992(4) (1987). The law defines "controlled
substance" as a drug classified in Schedules I through V of the Federal Controlled Substances Act, 21 U. S.
C. §§811-812, as modified by the State Board of Pharmacy. Ore. Rev. Stat. §475.005(6) (1987). Persons who
violate this provision by possessing a controlled substance listed on Schedule I are "guilty of a Class B felony."
§475.992(4)(a). As compiled by the State Board of Pharmacy under its statutory authority, see §475.035, Sched-
ule I contains the drug peyote, a hallucinogen derived from the plant Lophophora williamsii Lemaire. Ore.
Admin. Rule 855-80-021(3)(s) (1988).

Respondents Alfred Smith and Galen Black were fired from their jobs with a private drug rehabilitation orga-
nization because they ingested peyote for sacramental purposes at a ceremony of the Native American Church,
of which both are members. When respondents applied to petitioner Employment Division for unemployment
compensation, they were determined to be ineligible for benefits because they had been discharged for work-
related "misconduct". The Oregon Court of Appeals reversed that determination, holding that the denial of
benefits violated respondents' free exercise rights under the First Amendment.

On appeal to the Oregon Supreme Court, petitioner argued that the denial of benefits was permissible because
respondents' consumption of peyote was a crime under Oregon law. The Oregon Supreme Court reasoned,
however, that the criminality of respondents' peyote use was irrelevant to resolution of their constitutional claim
230 | THE SMITH TEST

-- since the purpose of the "misconduct" provision under which respondents had been disqualified was not to
enforce the State's criminal laws, but to preserve the financial integrity of the compensation fund, and since that
purpose was inadequate to justify the burden that disqualification imposed on respondents' religious practice.
Citing our decisions in Sherbert v. Verner (1963), and Thomas v. Review Board, Indiana Employment Security
Div. (1981), the court concluded that respondents were entitled to payment of unemployment benefits. Smith
v. Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources (1986). We granted certiorari.

Before this Court in 1987, petitioner continued to maintain that the illegality of respondents' peyote consump-
tion was relevant to their constitutional claim. We agreed, concluding that "if a State has prohibited through its
criminal laws certain kinds of religiously motivated conduct without violating the First Amendment, it certainly
follows that it may impose the lesser burden of denying unemployment compensation benefits to persons who
engage in that conduct ..."

Subsequent decisions have consistently held that the right of free exercise does not relieve an individual of the
obligation to comply with a "valid and neutral law of general applicability on the ground that the law proscribes
(or prescribes) conduct that his religion prescribes (or proscribes) ..."

Our most recent decision involving a neutral, generally applicable regulatory law that compelled activity forbid-
den by an individual's religion was United States v. Lee. There, an Amish employer, on behalf of himself and
his employees, sought exemption from collection and payment of Social Security taxes on the ground that the
Amish faith prohibited participation in governmental support programs. We rejected the claim that an exemp-
tion was constitutionally required. There would be no way, we observed, to distinguish the Amish believer's
objection to Social Security taxes from the religious objections that others might have to the collection or use of
other taxes."If, for example, a religious adherent believes war is a sin, and if a certain percentage of the federal
budget can be identified as devoted to war-related activities, such individuals would have a similarly valid claim
to be exempt from paying that percentage of the income tax ...

The only decisions in which we have held that the First Amendment bars application of a neutral, generally
applicable law to religiously motivated action have involved not the Free Exercise Clause alone, but the Free Exer-
cise Clause in conjunction with other constitutional protections, such as freedom of speech and of the press, see
Cantwell v. Connecticut (invalidating a licensing system for religious and charitable solicitations under which
the administrator had discretion to deny a license to any cause he deemed nonreligious); Murdock v. Pennsyl-
vania (1943) (invalidating a flat tax on solicitation as applied to the dissemination of religious ideas); Follett v.
McCormick (1944) (same), or the right of parents, acknowledged in Pierce v. Society of Sisters (1925), to direct
the education of their children, see Wisconsin v. Yoder (1972) (invalidating compulsory school-attendance laws
as applied to Amish parents who refused on religious grounds to send their children to school) ...

Some of our cases prohibiting compelled expression, decided exclusively upon free speech grounds, have also
involved freedom of religion ... The present case does not present such a hybrid situation, but a free exercise
claim unconnected with any communicative activity or parental right. Respondents urge us to hold, quite sim-
ply, that when otherwise prohibitable conduct is accompanied by religious convictions, not only the convictions
but the conduct itself must be free from governmental regulation. We have never held that, and decline to do so
                                                                                                                           THE SMITH TEST | 231

now. There being no contention that Oregon's drug law represents an attempt to regulate religious beliefs, the
communication of religious beliefs, or the raising of one's children in those beliefs, the rule to which we have
adhered ever since Reynolds plainly controls."Our cases do not at their farthest reach support the proposition
that a stance of conscientious opposition relieves an objector from any colliding duty fixed by a democratic gov-
ernment ..."

... Although, as noted earlier, we have sometimes used the Sherbert test to analyze free exercise challenges to such
laws ... we have never applied the test to invalidate one.

We conclude today that the sounder approach, and the approach in accord with the vast majority of our prece-
dents, is to hold the test inapplicable to such challenges. The government's ability to enforce generally applica-
ble prohibitions of socially harmful conduct, like its ability to carry out other aspects of public policy, "cannot
depend on measuring the effects of a governmental action on a religious objector's spiritual development." To
make an individual's obligation to obey such a law contingent upon the law's coincidence with his religious
beliefs, except where the State's interest is "compelling" -permitting him, by virtue of his beliefs, "to become a
law unto himself," contradicts both constitutional tradition and common sense ...

The "compelling government interest" requirement seems benign, because it is familiar from other fields. But
using it as the standard that must be met before the government may accord different treatment on the basis of
race ... or before the government may regulate the content of speech ... is not remotely comparable to using it
for the purpose asserted here. What it produces in those other fields - equality of treatment and an unrestricted
flow of contending speech-are constitutional norms; what it would produce here -a private right to ignore gen-
erally applicable laws -is a constitutional anomaly ...

If the "compelling interest" test is to be applied at all, then, it must be applied across the board, to all actions
thought to be religiously commanded. Moreover, if "compelling interest" really means what it says (and watering
it down here would subvert its rigor in the other fields where it is applied), many laws will not meet the test. Any
society adopting such a system would be courting anarchy, but that danger increases in direct proportion to the
society's diversity of religious beliefs, and its determination to coerce or suppress none of them. Precisely because
"we are a cosmopolitan nation made up of people of almost every conceivable religious preference" and precisely
because we value and protect that religious divergence, we cannot afford the luxury of deeming presumptively
invalid, as applied to the religious objector, every regulation of conduct that does not protect an interest of the
highest order. The rule respondents favor would open the prospect of constitutionally required religious exemp-
tions from civic obligations of almost every conceivable kind ... The First Amendment's protection of religious
liberty does not require this.

Values that are protected against government interference through enshrinement in the Bill of Rights are not
thereby banished from the political process. Just as a society that believes in the negative protection accorded to
the press by the First Amendment is likely to enact laws that affirmatively foster the dissemination of the printed
word, so also a society that believes in the negative protection accorded to religious belief can be expected to
be solicitous of that value in its legislation as well. It is therefore not surprising that a number of States have
made an exception to their drug laws for sacramental peyote use. But to say that a nondiscriminatory religious
§232 | THE SMITH TEST

practice exemption is permitted, or even that it is desirable, is not to say that it is constitutionally required, and
that the appropriate occasions for its creation can be discerned by the courts. It may fairly be said that leaving
accommodation to the political process will place at a relative disadvantage those religious practices that are not
widely engaged in; but that unavoidable consequence of democratic government must be preferred to a system
in which each conscience is a law unto itself or in which judges weigh the social importance of all laws against
the centrality of all religious beliefs.

Because respondents' ingestion of peyote was prohibited under Oregon law, and because that prohibition is con-
stitutional, Oregon may, consistent with the Free Exercise Clause, deny respondents unemployment compensa-
tion when their dismissal results from use of the drug. The decision of the Oregon Supreme Court is accordingly
reversed.

It is so ordered.

Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part II-A-2.

The principle that government may not enact laws that suppress religious belief or practice is so well understood
that few violations are recorded in our opinions. Concerned that this fundamental nonpersecution principle of
the First Amendment was implicated here, however, we granted certiorari.

Our review confirms that the laws in question were enacted by officials who did not understand, failed to per-
ceive, or chose to ignore the fact that their official actions violated the Nation's essential commitment to religious
freedom. The challenged laws had an impermissible object; and in all events the principle of general applicability
was violated because the secular ends asserted in defense of the laws were pursued only with respect to conduct
motivated by religious beliefs. We invalidate the challenged enactments and reverse the judgment of the Court
of Appeals.

This case involves practices of the Santeria religion, which originated in the nineteenth century. When hundreds
of thousands of members of the Yoruba people were brought as slaves from eastern Africa to Cuba, their
traditional African religion absorbed significant elements of Roman Catholicism. The resulting syncretion,
or fusion, is Santeria, "the way of the saints." The Cuban Yoruba express their devotion to spirits,
called orishas, through the iconography of Catholic saints, Catholic symbols are often present at Santeria rites,
and Santeria devotees attend the Catholic sacraments.

The Santeria faith teaches that every individual has a destiny from God, a destiny fulfilled with the aid and energy
of the orishas. The basis of the Santeria religion is the nurture of a personal relation with the orishas, and one of
the principal forms of devotion is an animal sacrifice ...

Petitioner Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. (Church), is a not-for-profit corporation organized under
Florida law in 1973. The Church and its congregants practice the Santeria religion ... In April 1987, the Church
leased land in the city of Hialeah, Florida, and announced plans to establish a house of worship as well as a
school, cultural center, and museum. Pichardo indicated that the Church's goal was to bring the practice of the
Santeria faith, including its ritual of animal sacrifice, into the open. The Church began the process of obtaining
utility service and receiving the necessary licensing, inspection, and zoning approvals. Although the Church's
efforts at obtaining the necessary licenses and permits were far from smooth, see 723 F.Supp., at 1477-1478, it
appears that it received all needed approvals by early August 1987.

The prospect of a Santeria church in their midst was distressing to many members of the Hialeah community,
and the announcement of the plans to open a Santeria church in Hialeah prompted the city council to hold an
emergency public session on June 9, 1987. The resolutions and ordinances passed at that and later meetings are
set forth in the appendix following this opinion.

A summary suffices here, beginning with the enactments passed at the June 9 meeting ... In September 1987, the
city council adopted three substantive ordinances addressing the issue of religious animal sacrifice. Ordinance
87-52 defined "sacrifice" as "to unnecessarily kill, torment, torture, or mutilate an animal in a public or private
ritual or ceremony not for the primary purpose of food consumption," and prohibited owning or possessing an
animal "intending to use such animal for food purposes." It restricted application of this prohibition, however,
to any individual or group that "kills, slaughters or sacrifices animals for any type of ritual, regardless of whether
or not the flesh or blood of the animal is to be consumed." The ordinance contained an exemption for slaughter-
ing by "licensed establishment[s]" of animals "specifically raised for food purposes." Declaring, moreover, that
the city council "has determined that the sacrificing of animals within the city limits is contrary to the public
health, safety, welfare and morals of the community," the city council adopted Ordinance 87-71. That ordinance
defined sacrifice as had Ordinance 87-52, and then provided that "[i]t shall be unlawful for any person, persons,
corporations or associations to sacrifice any animal within the corporate limits of the City of Hialeah, Florida."
The final Ordinance, 87-72, defined "slaughter" as "the killing of animals for food" and prohibited slaughter
outside of areas zoned for slaughterhouse use. The ordinance provided an exemption, however, for the slaughter
or processing for sale of "small numbers of hogs and/or cattle per week in accordance with an exemption pro-
234 | THE SMITH TEST

vided by state law." All ordinances and resolutions passed the city council by unanimous vote. Violations of each
of the four ordinances were punishable by fines not exceeding $500 or imprisonment not exceeding 60 days, or
both.

Following enactment of these ordinances, the Church and Pichardo filed this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §
1983 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida ... After a 9-day bench trial on the
remaining claims, the District Court ruled for the city, finding no violation of petitioners' rights under the Free
Exercise Clause ... The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed in a one-paragraph per curiam opin-
ion.

... Although the practice of animal sacrifice may seem abhorrent to some, "religious beliefs need not be accept-
able, logical, consistent, or comprehensible to others in order to merit First Amendment protection." ... Neither
the city nor the courts below, moreover, have questioned the sincerity of petitioners' professed desire to conduct
animal sacrifices for religious reasons. We must consider petitioners' First Amendment claim.

In addressing the constitutional protection for free exercise of religion, our cases establish the general proposi-
tion that a law that is neutral and of general applicability need not be justified by a compelling governmental
interest even if the law has the incidental effect of burdening a particular religious practice. Neutrality and gen-
eral applicability are interrelated, and, as becomes apparent in this case, failure to satisfy one requirement is a
likely indication that the other has not been satisfied. A law failing to satisfy these requirements must be justified
by a compelling governmental interest and must be narrowly tailored to advance that interest. These ordinances
fail to satisfy the Smith requirements ...

The record in this case compels the conclusion that suppression of the central element of the Santeria worship
service was the object of the ordinances. First, though use of the words "sacrifice" and "ritual" does not compel
a finding of improper targeting of the Santeria religion, the choice of these words is support for our conclu-
sion. There are further respects in which the text of the city council's enactments discloses the improper attempt
to target Santeria. Resolution 87-66, adopted June 9, 1987, recited that "residents and citizens of the City of
Hialeah have expressed their concern that certain religions may propose to engage in practices which are incon-
sistent with public morals, peace or safety," and "reiterate[d]" the city's commitment to prohibit "any and all
[such] acts of any and all religious groups." No one suggests, and on this record it cannot be maintained, that
city officials had in mind a religion other than Santeria.

It becomes evident that these ordinances target Santeria sacrifice when the ordinances' operation is considered.
Apart from the text, the effect of a law in its real operation is strong evidence of its object. To be sure, adverse
impact will not always lead to a finding of impermissible targeting ... But the ordinances when considered
together disclose an object remote from these legitimate concerns. The design of these laws accomplishes instead
a "religious gerrymander," an impermissible attempt to target petitioners and their religious practices.

It is a necessary conclusion that almost the only conduct subject to Ordinances 87-40, 87-52, and 87-71 is the
religious exercise of Santeria church members. The texts show that they were drafted in tandem to achieve this
result ...
                                                                                                                           THE SMITH TEST | 235

We also find significant evidence of the ordinances' improper targeting of Santeria sacrifice in the fact that they
proscribe more religious conduct than is necessary to achieve their stated ends. It is not unreasonable to infer, at
least when there are no persuasive indications to the contrary, that a law which visits "gratuitous restrictions" on
religious conduct, seeks not to effectuate the stated governmental interests, but to suppress the conduct because
of its religious motivation.

The legitimate governmental interests in protecting the public health and preventing cruelty to animals could
be addressed by restrictions stopping far short of a flat prohibition of all Santeria sacrificial practice. If improper
disposal, not the sacrifice itself, is the harm to be prevented, the city could have imposed a general regulation on
the disposal of organic garbage. It did not do so. Indeed, counsel for the city conceded at oral argument that,
under the ordinances, Santeria sacrifices would be illegal even if they occurred in licensed, inspected, and zoned
slaughterhouses. Thus, these broad ordinances prohibit Santeria sacrifice even when it does not threaten the
city's interest in the public health ... The neutrality of a law is suspect if First Amendment freedoms are curtailed
to prevent isolated collateral harms not themselves prohibited by direct regulation.

Under similar analysis, narrower regulation would achieve the city's interest in preventing cruelty to animals.
With regard to the city's interest in ensuring the adequate care of animals, regulation of conditions and treat-
ment, regardless of why an animal is kept, is the logical response to the city's concern, not a prohibition on pos-
session for the purpose of sacrifice. The same is true for the city's interest in prohibiting cruel methods of killing
...

We turn next to a second requirement of the Free Exercise Clause, the rule that laws burdening religious practice
must be of general applicability ...

We conclude, in sum, that each of Hialeah's ordinances pursues the city's governmental interests only against
conduct motivated by religious belief. The ordinances "ha[ve] every appearance of a prohibition that society is
prepared to impose upon [Santeria worshippers] but not upon itself." This precise evil is what the requirement
of general applicability is designed to prevent.

A law burdening religious practice that is not neutral or not of general application must undergo the most rig-
orous of scrutiny. To satisfy the commands of the First Amendment, a law restrictive of religious practice must
advance " `interests of the highest order' " and must be narrowly tailored in pursuit of those interests ... A law
that targets religious conduct for distinctive treatment or advances legitimate governmental interests only against
conduct with a religious motivation will survive strict scrutiny only in rare cases. It follows from what we have
already said that these ordinances cannot withstand this scrutiny ...

The Free Exercise Clause commits government itself to religious tolerance, and upon even slight suspicion that
proposals for state intervention stem from animosity to religion or distrust of its practices, all officials must pause
236 | THE SMITH TEST

to remember their own high duty to the Constitution and to the rights it secures. Those in office must be res-
olute in resisting importunate demands and must ensure that the sole reasons for imposing the burdens of law
and regulation are secular. Legislators may not devise mechanisms, overt or disguised, designed to persecute or
oppress a religion or its practices. The laws here in question were enacted contrary to these constitutional prin-
ciples, and they are void.

[Disclaimer that the case is not a constitutional issue. The excerpt is included because it provides a key building

...

JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.

We must decide in these cases whether the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), 107 Stat. 1488,
42 U. S. C. §2000bb et seq., permits the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
to demand that three closely held corporations provide health-insurance coverage for methods of contracep-
tion that violate the sincerely held religious beliefs of the companies' owners. We hold that the regulations that
impose this obligation violate RFRA, which prohibits the Federal Government from taking any action that sub-
stantially burdens the exercise of religion unless that action constitutes the least restrictive means of serving a
compelling government interest ...

In holding that the HHS mandate is unlawful, we reject HHS's argument that the owners of the companies
forfeited all RFRA protection when they decided to organize their businesses as corporations rather than sole
proprietorships or general partnerships. The plain terms of RFRA make it perfectly clear that Congress did not
discriminate in this way against men and women who wish to run their businesses as for-profit corporations in
the manner required by their religious beliefs. Since RFRA applies in these cases, we must decide whether the
challenged HHS regulations substantially burden the exercise of religion, and we hold that they do. The owners
of the businesses have religious objections to abortion, and according to their religious beliefs the four contra-
ceptive methods at issue are abortifacients. If the owners comply with the HHS mandate, they believe they will
be facilitating abortions, and if they do not comply, they will pay a very heavy price--as much as $1.3 million per
day, or about $475 million per year, in the case of one of the companies. If these consequences do not amount
to a substantial burden, it is hard to see what would. Under RFRA, a Government action that imposes a sub-
stantial burden on religious exercise must serve a compelling government interest, and we assume that the HHS
238 | A NEW ERA?

regulations satisfy this requirement. But in order for the HHS mandate to be sustained, it must also constitute
the least restrictive means of serving that interest, and the mandate plainly fails that test. There are other ways in
which Congress or HHS could equally ensure that every woman has cost-free access to the particular contracep-
tives at issue here and, indeed, to all FDA-approved contraceptives ...

Because RFRA applies in these cases, we must next ask whether the HHS contraceptive mandate "substantially
burden[s]" the exercise of religion. 42 U. S. C. §2000bb- 1(a). We have little trouble concluding that it does.

As we have noted, the Hahns and Greens have a sincere religious belief that life begins at conception. They
therefore object on religious grounds to providing health insurance that covers methods of birth control that, as
HHS acknowledges, see Brief for HHS in No. 13-354, at 9, n. 4, may result in the destruction of an embryo. By
requiring the Hahns and Greens and their companies to arrange for such coverage, the HHS mandate demands
that they engage in conduct that seriously violates their religious beliefs. If the Hahns and Greens and their com-
panies do not yield to this demand, the economic consequences will be severe ...

The least-restrictive-means standard is exceptionally demanding and it is not satisfied here. HHS has not shown
that it lacks other means of achieving its desired goal without imposing a substantial burden on the exercise of
religion by the objecting parties in these cases ... The contraceptive mandate, as applied to closely held corpora-
tions, violates RFRA. Our decision on that statutory question makes it unnecessary to reach the First Amend-
ment claim raised by Conestoga and the Hahns.

The judgment of the Tenth Circuit in No. 13-354 is affirmed; the judgment of the Third Circuit in No. 13-356
is reversed, and that case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.

In 2012 a same-sex couple visited Masterpiece Cakeshop, a bakery in Colorado, to make inquiries about ordering
a cake for their wedding reception. The shop's owner told the couple that he would not create a cake for their
wedding because of his religious opposition to same sex marriages--marriages the State of Colorado itself did
not recognize at that time. The couple filed a charge with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission alleging dis-
crimination on the basis of sexual orientation in violation of the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act.

The Commission determined that the shop's actions violated the Act and ruled in the couple's favor. The Col-
orado state courts affirmed the ruling and its enforcement order, and this Court now must decide whether the
Commission's order violated the Constitution.

The case presents difficult questions as to the proper reconciliation of at least two principles. The first is the
authority of a State and its governmental entities to protect the rights and dignity of gay persons who are, or
wish to be, married but who face discrimination when they seek goods or services. The second is the right of
all persons to exercise fundamental freedoms under the First Amendment, as applied to the States through the
Fourteenth Amendment ...

Today, the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act (CADA) carries forward the state's tradition of prohibiting dis-
crimination in places of public accommodation. Amended in 2007 and 2008 to prohibit discrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation as well as other protected characteristics, CADA in relevant part provides as follows:
"It is a discriminatory practice and unlawful for a person, directly or indirectly, to refuse, withhold from, or
deny to an individual or a group, because of disability, race, creed, color, sex, sexual orientation, marital status,
national origin, or ancestry, the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages,
or accommodations of a place of public accommodation." Colo. Rev. Stat. §24-34-601(2)(a) (2017). The Act
defines "public accommodation" broadly to include any "place of business engaged in any sales to the public and
any place offering services ... to the public," but excludes "a church, synagogue, mosque, or other place that is
principally used for religious purposes ..."
240 | A NEW ERA?

Our society has come to the recognition that gay persons and gay couples cannot be treated as social outcasts or
as inferior in dignity and worth. For that reason, the laws and the Constitution can, and in some instances must,
protect them in the exercise of their civil rights. The exercise of their freedom on terms equal to others must be
given great weight and respect by the courts. At the same time, the religious and philosophical objections to gay
marriage are protected views and, in some instances, protected forms of expression ...

As this Court observed in Obergefell v. Hodges (2015), "[t]he First Amendment ensures that religious organi-
zations and persons are given proper protection as they seek to teach the principles that are so fulfilling and so
central to their lives and faiths." Nevertheless, while those religious and philosophical objections are protected, it
is a general rule that such objections do not allow business owners and other actors in the economy and in soci-
ety to deny protected persons equal access to goods and services under a neutral and generally applicable public
accommodations law ...

It is unexceptional that Colorado law can protect gay persons, just as it can protect other classes of individuals,
in acquiring whatever products and services they choose on the same terms and conditions as are offered to other
members of the public. And there are no doubt innumerable goods and services that no one could argue impli-
cate the First Amendment. Petitioners conceded, moreover, that if a baker refused to sell any goods or any cakes
for gay weddings, that would be a different matter and the State would have a strong case under this Court's
precedents that this would be a denial of goods and services that went beyond any protected rights of a baker
who offers goods and services to the general public and is subject to a neutrally applied and generally applicable
public accommodations law.

Phillips claims, however, that a narrower issue is presented. He argues that he had to use his artistic skills to make
an expressive statement, a wedding endorsement in his own voice and of his own creation. As Phillips would see
the case, this contention has a significant First Amendment speech component and implicates his deep and sin-
cere religious beliefs. In this context the baker likely found it difficult to find a line where the customers' rights
to goods and services became a demand for him to exercise the right of his own personal expression for their
message, a message he could not express in a way consistent with his religious beliefs.

Phillips' dilemma was particularly understandable given the background of legal principles and administration
of the law in Colorado at that time ... At that point, Colorado did not recognize the validity of gay marriages
performed in its own State. At the time of the events in question, this Court had not issued its decisions either
in United States v. Windsor (2013), or Obergefell ...

At the time, state law also afforded storekeepers some latitude to decline to create specific messages the store-
keeper considered offensive. Indeed, while enforcement proceedings against Phillips were ongoing, the Colorado
Civil Rights Division itself endorsed this proposition in cases involving other bakers' creation of cakes, con-
cluding on at least three occasions that a baker acted lawfully in declining to create cakes with decorations that
demeaned gay persons or gay marriages.

... But, nonetheless, Phillips was entitled to the neutral and respectful consideration of his claims in all the cir-
cumstances of the case.
                                                                                                                                 A NEW ERA? | 241

The neutral and respectful consideration to which Phillips was entitled was compromised here, however. The
Civil Rights Commission's treatment of his case has some elements of a clear and impermissible hostility toward
the sincere religious beliefs that motivated his objection. That hostility surfaced at the Commission's formal,
public hearings, as shown by the record ... [T]hese statements are susceptible of different interpretations. On the
one hand, they might mean simply that a business cannot refuse to provide services based on sexual orientation,
regardless of the proprietor's personal views. On the other hand, they might be seen as inappropriate and dis-
missive comments showing lack of due consideration for Phillips' free exercise rights and the dilemma he faced.
In view of the comments that followed, the latter seems the more likely ...

For the reasons just described, the Commission's treatment of Phillips' case violated the State's duty under the
First Amendment not to base laws or regulations on hostility to a religion or religious viewpoint. In Church of
Lukumi Babalu Aye, the Court made clear that the government, if it is to respect the Constitution's guarantee
of free exercise, cannot impose regulations that are hostile to the religious beliefs of affected citizens and cannot
act in a manner that passes judgment upon or presupposes the illegitimacy of religious beliefs and practices. The
Free Exercise Clause bars even "subtle departures from neutrality" on matters of religion. Here, that means the
Commission was obliged under the Free Exercise Clause to proceed in a manner neutral toward and tolerant of
Phillips' religious beliefs. The Constitution "commits government itself to religious tolerance, and upon even
slight suspicion that proposals for state intervention stem from animosity to religion or distrust of its practices,
all officials must pause to remember their own high duty to the Constitution and to the rights it secures ..."

While the issues here are difficult to resolve, it must be concluded that the State's interest could have been
weighed against Phillips' sincere religious objections in a way consistent with the requisite religious neutrality
that must be strictly observed. The official expressions of hostility to religion in some of the commissioners' com-
ments--comments that were not disavowed at the Commission or by the State at any point in the proceedings
that led to affirmance of the order--were inconsistent with what the Free Exercise Clause requires. The Com-
mission's disparate consideration of Phillips' case compared to the cases of the other bakers suggests the same.
For these reasons, the order must be set aside ...

The Commission's hostility was inconsistent with the First Amendment's guarantee that our laws be applied in
a manner that is neutral toward religion. Phillips was entitled to a neutral decisionmaker who would give full
and fair consideration to his religious objection as he sought to assert it in all of the circumstances in which
this case was presented, considered, and decided. In this case the adjudication concerned a context that may well
be different going forward in the respects noted above. However later cases raising these or similar concerns are
resolved in the future, for these reasons the rulings of the Commission and of the state court that enforced the
Commission's order must be invalidated.
§242 | A NEW ERA?

The outcome of cases like this in other circumstances must await further elaboration in the courts, all in the
context of recognizing that these disputes must be resolved with tolerance, without undue disrespect to sincere
religious beliefs, and without subjecting gay persons to indignities when they seek goods and services in an open
market. The judgment of the Colorado Court of Appeals is reversed.

It is so ordered.

    Vote: 6-3
    Per Curiam Opinion
    Decision: Reversed
    Dissent: Kagan, joined by Breyer, Sotomayor

PER CURIAM.

The Ninth Circuit's failure to grant an injunction pending appeal was erroneous. This Court's decisions have
made the following points clear.

First, government regulations are not neutral and generally applicable, and therefore trigger strict scrutiny under
the Free Exercise Clause, whenever they treat any comparable secular activity more favorably than religious exer-
cise. It is no answer that a State treats some comparable secular businesses or other activities as poorly as or even
less favorably than the religious exercise at issue ...

Second, whether two activities are comparable for purposes of the Free Exercise Clause must be judged against
the asserted government interest that justifies the regulation at issue. Comparability is concerned with the risks
various activities pose, not the reasons why people gather ...

Third, the government has the burden to establish that the challenged law satisfies strict scrutiny. To do so in
this context, it must do more than assert that certain risk factors "are always present in worship, or always absent
from the other secular activities" the government may allow ... Instead, narrow tailoring requires the government
to show that measures less restrictive of the First Amendment activity could not address its interest in reducing
the spread of COVID. Where the government permits other activities to proceed with precautions, it must show
that the religious exercise at issue is more dangerous than those activities even when the same precautions are
applied. Otherwise, precautions that suffice for other activities suffice for religious exercise too ...

Fourth, even if the government withdraws or modifies a COVID restriction in the course of litigation, that does
not necessarily moot the case. And so long as a case is not moot, litigants otherwise entitled to emergency injunc-
tive relief remain entitled to such relief where the applicants "remain under a constant threat" that government
officials will use their power to reinstate the challenged restrictions ...

Applicants are likely to succeed on the merits of their free exercise claim; they are irreparably harmed by the loss
of free exercise rights "for even minimal periods of time"; and the State has not shown that "public health would
be imperiled" by employing less restrictive measures. Accordingly, applicants are entitled to an injunction pend-
ing appeal ...

This is the fifth time the Court has summarily rejected the Ninth Circuit's analysis of California's COVID
restrictions on religious exercise ...

It is unsurprising that such litigants are entitled to relief. California's Blueprint System contains myriad excep-
tions and accommodations for comparable activities, thus requiring the application of strict scrutiny. And his-
torically, strict scrutiny requires the State to further "interests of the highest order" by means "narrowly tailored
in pursuit of those interests ..."

...

JUSTICE KAGAN, with whom JUSTICE BREYER and JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR join, dissenting.

I would deny the application largely for the reasons stated in South Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom,
(KAGAN, J., dissenting). The First Amendment requires that a State treat religious conduct as well as the State
treats comparable secular conduct. Sometimes finding the right secular analogue may raise hard questions. But
not today. California limits religious gatherings in homes to three households. If the State also limits all secular
gatherings in homes to three households, it has complied with the First Amendment. And the State does exactly
that: It has adopted a blanket restriction on at home gatherings of all kinds, religious and secular alike. Califor-
nia need not, as the per curiam insists, treat at-home religious gatherings the same as hardware stores and hair
salons--and thus unlike at-home secular gatherings, the obvious comparator here. As the per curiam's reliance
on separate opinions and unreasoned orders signals, the law does not require that the State equally treat apples
and watermelons ...

First, "when people gather in social settings, their interactions are likely to be longer than they would be in a
commercial setting," with participants "more likely to be involved in prolonged conversations." Tandon v. New-
som (2021). Second, "private houses are typically smaller and less ventilated than commercial establishments."
Ibid. And third, "social distancing and mask-wearing are less likely in private settings and enforcement is more
difficult." Ibid. These are not the mere musings of two appellate judges: The district court found each of these
facts based on the uncontested testimony of California's public-health experts ... No doubt this evidence is
inconvenient for the per curiam's preferred result. But the Court has no warrant to ignore the record in a case
that (on its own view, see ante, at 2) turns on risk assessments. In ordering California to weaken its restrictions
on at home gatherings, the majority yet again "insists on treating unlike cases, not like ones, equivalently ..." And
§244 | A NEW ERA?

it once more commands California "to ignore its experts' scientific findings," thus impairing "the State's effort
to address a public health emergency." Ibid. Because the majority continues to disregard law and facts alike, I
respectfully dissent from this latest per curiam decision ...

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.

...

The Montana Legislature established a program to provide tuition assistance to parents who send their children
to private schools. The program grants a tax credit to anyone who donates to certain organizations that in turn
award scholarships to selected students attending such schools. When petitioners sought to use the scholarships
at a religious school, the Montana Supreme Court struck down the program. The Court relied on the "no-aid"
provision of the State Constitution, which prohibits any aid to a school controlled by a "church, sect, or denom-
ination." The question presented is whether the Free Exercise Clause of the United States Constitution barred
that application of the no-aid provision ...

This suit was brought by three mothers whose children attend Stillwater Christian School in northwestern Mon-
tana. Stillwater is a private Christian school that meets the statutory criteria for "qualified education providers."
It serves students in prekindergarten through 12th grade, and petitioners chose the school in large part because
it "teaches the same Christian values that [they] teach at home." The child of one petitioner has already received
scholarships from Big Sky, and the other petitioners' children are eligible for scholarships and planned to apply.
While in effect, however, Rule 1 blocked petitioners from using scholarship funds for tuition at Stillwater.
To overcome that obstacle, petitioners sued the Department of Revenue in Montana state court. Petitioners
claimed that Rule 1 conflicted with the statute that created the scholarship program and could not be justified
                                                                                                                                 A NEW ERA? | 245

on the ground that it was compelled by the Montana Constitution's no-aid provision. Petitioners further alleged
that the Rule discriminated on the basis of their religious views and the religious nature of the school they had
chosen for their children ...

The question for this Court is whether the Free Exercise Clause precluded the Montana Supreme Court from
applying Montana's no-aid provision to bar religious schools from the scholarship program. For purposes of
answering that question, we accept the Montana Supreme Court's interpretation of state law--including its
determination that the scholarship program provided impermissible "aid" within the meaning of the Montana
Constitution--and we assess whether excluding religious schools and affected families from that program was
consistent with the Federal Constitution ...

The Free Exercise Clause, which applies to the States under the Fourteenth Amendment, "protects religious
observers against unequal treatment" and against "laws that impose special disabilities on the basis of religious
status." Trinity Lutheran ...

Most recently, Trinity Lutheran distilled these and other decisions to the same effect into the "unremarkable"
conclusion that disqualifying otherwise eligible recipients from a public benefit "solely because of their religious
character" imposes "a penalty on the free exercise of religion that triggers the most exacting scrutiny." In Trinity
Lutheran, Missouri provided grants to help nonprofit organizations pay for playground resurfacing, but a state
policy disqualified any organization "owned or controlled by a church, sect, or other religious entity." Because of
that policy, an otherwise eligible church-owned preschool was denied a grant to resurface its playground. Mis-
souri's policy discriminated against the Church "simply because of what it is--a church," and so the policy was
subject to the "strictest scrutiny," which it failed. We acknowledged that the State had not "criminalized" the way
in which the Church worshipped or "told the Church that it cannot subscribe to a certain view of the Gospel."
But the State's discriminatory policy was "odious to our Constitution all the same."

Here too Montana's no-aid provision bars religious schools from public benefits solely because of the religious
character of the schools. The provision also bars parents who wish to send their children to a religious school
from those same benefits, again solely because of the religious character of the school. This is apparent from the
plain text. The provision bars aid to any school "controlled in whole or in part by any church, sect, or denomi-
nation ..." The provision's title-- "Aid prohibited to sectarian schools"--confirms that the provision singles out
schools based on their religious character ... And the Montana Supreme Court explained that the provision for-
bids aid to any school that is "sectarian," "religiously affiliated," or "controlled in whole or in part by churches
..."

This case also turns expressly on religious status and not religious use. The Montana Supreme Court applied
the no-aid provision solely by reference to religious status. The Court repeatedly explained that the no-aid pro-
vision bars aid to "schools controlled in whole or in part by churches," "sectarian schools," and "religiously-affil-
iated schools." Applying this provision to the scholarship program, the Montana Supreme Court noted that
most of the private schools that would benefit from the program were "religiously affiliated" and "controlled by
churches," and the Court ultimately concluded that the scholarship program ran afoul of the Montana Consti-
246 | A NEW ERA?

tution by aiding "schools controlled by churches." The Montana Constitution discriminates based on religious
status just like the Missouri policy in Trinity Lutheran, which excluded organizations "owned or controlled by a
church, sect, or other religious entity."

...

The Montana Supreme Court asserted that the no-aid provision serves Montana's interest in separating church
and State "more fiercely" than the Federal Constitution. But "that interest cannot qualify as compelling" in the
face of the infringement of free exercise here. A State's interest "in achieving greater separation of church and
State than is already ensured under the Establishment Clause ... is limited by the Free Exercise Clause ..."

The Department, for its part, asserts that the no-aid provision actually promotes religious freedom. In the
Department's view, the no-aid provision protects the religious liberty of taxpayers by ensuring that their taxes
are not directed to religious organizations, and it safeguards the freedom of religious organizations by keeping
the government out of their operations. An infringement of First Amendment rights, however, cannot be justi-
fied by a State's alternative view that the infringement advances religious liberty. Our federal system prizes state
experimentation, but not "state experimentation in the suppression of free speech," and the same goes for the
free exercise of religion ...

Furthermore, we do not see how the no-aid provision promotes religious freedom. As noted, this Court has
repeatedly upheld government programs that spend taxpayer funds on equal aid to religious observers and orga-
nizations, particularly when the link between government and religion is attenuated by private choices. A school,
concerned about government involvement with its religious activities, might reasonably decide for itself not to
participate in a government program. But we doubt that the school's liberty is enhanced by eliminating any
option to participate in the first place ... A State need not subsidize private education. But once a State decides
to do so, it cannot disqualify some private schools solely because they are religious ...

The Department argues that, at the end of the day, there is no free exercise violation here because the Montana
Supreme Court ultimately eliminated the scholarship program altogether. According to the Department, now
that there is no program, religious schools and adherents cannot complain that they are excluded from any gen-
erally available benefit ... The descriptions are not accurate. The Montana Legislature created the scholarship
program; the Legislature never chose to end it, for policy or other reasons ... [S]eeing no other "mechanism" to
make absolutely sure that religious schools received no aid, the court chose to invalidate the entire program.

The final step in this line of reasoning eliminated the program, to the detriment of religious and non-religious
schools alike. But the Court's error of federal law occurred at the beginning. When the Court was called upon
to apply a state law no-aid provision to exclude religious schools from the program, it was obligated by the Fed-
eral Constitution to reject the invitation. Had the Court recognized that this was, indeed, "one of those cases"
in which application of the no-aid provision "would violate the Free Exercise Clause ... the Court would not
have proceeded to find a violation of that provision. And, in the absence of such a state law violation, the Court
would have had no basis for terminating the program. Because the elimination of the program flowed directly
from the Montana Supreme Court's failure to follow the dictates of federal law, it cannot be defended as a neu-
tral policy decision, or as resting on adequate and independent state law grounds.
§                                                                                                                                A NEW ERA? | 247

The Supremacy Clause provides that "the Judges in every State shall be bound" by the Federal Constitution,
"any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding ..." "[T]his Clause creates
a rule of decision" directing state courts that they "must not give effect to state laws that conflict with federal
law ... Given the conflict between the Free Exercise Clause and the application of the no-aid provision here, the
Montana Supreme Court should have "disregard[ed]" the no-aid provision and decided this case "conformably
to the [C]onstitution" of the United States ... That "supreme law of the land" condemns discrimination against
religious schools and the families whose children attend them. Id., at 180. They are "member[s] of the commu-
nity too," and their exclusion from the scholarship program here is "odious to our Constitution" and "cannot
stand ..."

Fulton v. Philadelphia

593 U.S. ___ (2021)

Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court.

Catholic Social Services is a foster care agency in Philadelphia. The City stopped referring children to CSS upon
discovering that the agency would not certify same-sex couples to be foster parents due to its religious beliefs
about marriage. The City will renew its foster care contract with CSS only if the agency agrees to certify same-
sex couples. The question presented is whether the actions of Philadelphia violate the First Amendment.

The Catholic Church has served the needy children of Philadelphia for over two centuries ...
248 | A NEW ERA?

The Philadelphia foster care system depends on cooperation between the City and private foster agencies like
CSS. When children cannot remain in their homes, the City's Department of Human Services assumes custody
of them. The Department enters standard annual contracts with private foster agencies to place some of those
children with foster families.

The placement process begins with review of prospective foster families. Pennsylvania law gives the authority to
certify foster families to state-licensed foster agencies like CSS. 55 Pa. Code §3700.61 (2020) ...

When the Department seeks to place a child with a foster family, it sends its contracted agencies a request, known
as a referral. The agencies report whether any of their certified families are available, and the Department places
the child with what it regards as the most suitable family. The agency continues to support the family through-
out the placement.

The religious views of CSS inform its work in this system. CSS believes that "marriage is a sacred bond between a
man and a woman." App. 171. Because the agency understands the certification of prospective foster families to
be an endorsement of their relationships, it will not certify unmarried couples--regardless of their sexual orien-
tation--or same-sex married couples. CSS does not object to certifying gay or lesbian individuals as single foster
parents or to placing gay and lesbian children. No same-sex couple has ever sought certification from CSS. If one
did, CSS would direct the couple to one of the more than 20 other agencies in the City, all of which currently
certify same-sex couples. For over 50 years, CSS successfully contracted with the City to provide foster care ser-
vices while holding to these beliefs.

But things changed in 2018. After receiving a complaint about a different agency, a newspaper ran a story in
which a spokesman for the Archdiocese of Philadelphia stated that CSS would not be able to consider prospec-
tive foster parents in same-sex marriages. The City Council called for an investigation, saying that the City had
"laws in place to protect its people from discrimination that occurs under the guise of religious freedom." App.
to Pet. for Cert. 147a. The Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations launched an inquiry. And the Com-
missioner of the Department of Human Services held a meeting with the leadership of CSS. She remarked that
"things have changed since 100 years ago," and "it would be great if we followed the teachings of Pope Francis,
the voice of the Catholic Church." App. 366. Immediately after the meeting, the Department informed CSS
that it would no longer refer children to the agency. The City later explained that the refusal of CSS to certify
same-sex couples violated a non-discrimination provision in its contract with the City as well as the non-discrim-
ination requirements of the citywide Fair Practices Ordinance. The City stated that it would not enter a full
foster care contract with CSS in the future unless the agency agreed to certify same-sex couples.

CSS and three foster parents affiliated with the agency filed suit against the City, the Department, and the Com-
mission ... As relevant here, CSS alleged that the referral freeze violated the Free Exercise and Free Speech Clauses
of the First Amendment ... The District Court denied preliminary relief ... The court also determined that the
free speech claims were unlikely to succeed because CSS performed certifications as part of a government pro-
gram. Id., at 695-700.

The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed. Because the contract between the parties had expired, the
court focused on whether the City could insist on the inclusion of new language forbidding discrimination on
                                                                                                                                 A NEW ERA? | 249

the basis of sexual orientation as a condition of contract renewal. The court concluded that the proposed con-
tractual terms were a neutral and generally applicable policy under Smith. The court rejected the agency's free
speech claims on the same grounds as the District Court.

CSS and the foster parents sought review. They challenged the Third Circuit's determination that the City's
actions were permissible under Smith and also asked this Court to reconsider that precedent.

We granted certiorari.

As an initial matter, it is plain that the City's actions have burdened CSS's religious exercise by putting it to the
choice of curtailing its mission or approving relationships inconsistent with its beliefs. The City disagrees. In
its view, certification reflects only that foster parents satisfy the statutory criteria, not that the agency endorses
their relationships. But CSS believes that certification is tantamount to endorsement. And "religious beliefs need
not be acceptable, logical, consistent, or comprehensible to others in order to merit First Amendment protec-
tion." Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Employment Security Div. Our task is to decide whether the burden the City
has placed on the religious exercise of CSS is constitutionally permissible.

Smith held that laws incidentally burdening religion are ordinarily not subject to strict scrutiny under the Free
Exercise Clause so long as they are neutral and generally applicable. CSS urges us to overrule Smith, and the con-
currences in the judgment argue in favor of doing so, see post, p. 1 (opinion of Alito, J.); post, p. 1 (opinion of
Gorsuch, J.). But we need not revisit that decision here. This case falls outside Smith because the City has bur-
dened the religious exercise of CSS through policies that do not meet the requirement of being neutral and gen-
erally applicable.

Government fails to act neutrally when it proceeds in a manner intolerant of religious beliefs or restricts practices
because of their religious nature. See Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Comm'n ...

A law is not generally applicable if it "invite[s]" the government to consider the particular reasons for a person's
conduct by providing " `a mechanism for individualized exemptions.' " Smith ... Smith later explained that the
unemployment benefits law in Sherbert was not generally applicable because the "good cause" standard permit-
ted the government to grant exemptions based on the circumstances underlying each application. Smith went
on to hold that "where the State has in place a system of individual exemptions, it may not refuse to extend that
system to cases of `religious hardship' without compelling reason."

A law also lacks general applicability if it prohibits religious conduct while permitting secular conduct that
undermines the government's asserted interests in a similar way ... In Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye,
Inc. v. Hialeah, for instance, the City of Hialeah adopted several ordinances prohibiting animal sacrifice, a prac-
tice of the Santeria faith. Id., at 524-528. The City claimed that the ordinances were necessary in part to pro-
tect public health, which was "threatened by the disposal of animal carcasses in open public places." But the
ordinances did not regulate hunters' disposal of their kills or improper garbage disposal by restaurants, both of
which posed a similar hazard. The Court concluded that this and other forms of underinclusiveness meant that
the ordinances were not generally applicable ...
250 | A NEW ERA?

The City initially argued that CSS's practice violated section 3.21 of its standard foster care contract. We con-
clude, however, that this provision is not generally applicable as required by Smith ...

Like the good cause provision in Sherbert, section 3.21 incorporates a system of individual exemptions, made
available in this case at the "sole discretion" of the Commissioner. The City has made clear that the Commis-
sioner "has no intention of granting an exception" to CSS ...

... We have never suggested that the government may discriminate against religion when acting in its managerial
role. And Smith itself drew support for the neutral and generally applicable standard from cases involving inter-
nal government affairs ...

... The City and intervenor-respondents accordingly ask only that courts apply a more deferential approach in
determining whether a policy is neutral and generally applicable in the contracting context. We find no need to
resolve that narrow issue in this case. No matter the level of deference we extend to the City, the inclusion of
a formal system of entirely discretionary exceptions in section 3.21 renders the contractual non-discrimination
requirement not generally applicable ...

The City and intervenor-respondents add that, notwithstanding the system of exceptions in section 3.21, a sepa-
rate provision in the contract independently prohibits discrimination in the certification of foster parents. That
provision, section 15.1, bars discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, and it does not on its face allow
for exceptions. But state law makes clear that "one part of a contract cannot be so interpreted as to annul another
part." Applying that "fundamental" rule here, Shehadi, 474 Pa., at 236, 378 A. 2d, at 306, an exception from
section 3.21 also must govern the prohibition in section 15.1, lest the City's reservation of the authority to grant
such an exception be a nullity. As a result, the contract as a whole contains no generally applicable non-discrim-
ination requirement.

Finally, the City and intervenor-respondents contend that the availability of exceptions under section 3.21 is
irrelevant because the Commissioner has never granted one. That misapprehends the issue. The creation of a for-
mal mechanism for granting exceptions renders a policy not generally applicable, regardless whether any excep-
tions have been given, because it "invite[s]" the government to decide which reasons for not complying with the
policy are worthy of solicitude--here, at the Commissioner's "sole discretion."

The contractual non-discrimination requirement imposes a burden on CSS's religious exercise and does not
qualify as generally applicable. The concurrence protests that the "Court granted certiorari to decide whether to
overrule [Smith]," and chides the Court for seeking to "sidestep the question." Post, at 1 (opinion of Gorsuch,
J.). But the Court also granted review to decide whether Philadelphia's actions were permissible under our prece-
dents. See Pet. for Cert. i. CSS has demonstrated that the City's actions are subject to "the most rigorous of
scrutiny" under those precedents. Lukumi. Because the City's actions are therefore examined under the strictest
scrutiny regardless of Smith, we have no occasion to reconsider that decision here.

A government policy can survive strict scrutiny only if it advances "interests of the highest order" and is narrowly
tailored to achieve those interests. Lukumi, (internal quotation marks omitted). Put another way, so long as the
government can achieve its interests in a manner that does not burden religion, it must do so.
                                                                                                                                 A NEW ERA? | 251

The City asserts that its non-discrimination policies serve three compelling interests: maximizing the number of
foster parents, protecting the City from liability, and ensuring equal treatment of prospective foster parents and
foster children. The City states these objectives at a high level of generality, but the First Amendment demands
a more precise analysis ... The question, then, is not whether the City has a compelling interest in enforcing its
non-discrimination policies generally, but whether it has such an interest in denying an exception to CSS.

Once properly narrowed, the City's asserted interests are insufficient. Maximizing the number of foster families
and minimizing liability are important goals, but the City fails to show that granting CSS an exception will put
those goals at risk. If anything, including CSS in the program seems likely to increase, not reduce, the number
of available foster parents. As for liability, the City offers only speculation that it might be sued over CSS's cer-
tification practices. Such speculation is insufficient to satisfy strict scrutiny, particularly because the authority to
certify foster families is delegated to agencies by the State, not the City, see 55 Pa. Code §3700.61.

That leaves the interest of the City in the equal treatment of prospective foster parents and foster children. We
do not doubt that this interest is a weighty one, for "[o]ur society has come to the recognition that gay persons
and gay couples cannot be treated as social outcasts or as inferior in dignity and worth." Masterpiece Cakeshop,
On the facts of this case, however, this interest cannot justify denying CSS an exception for its religious exercise.
The creation of a system of exceptions under the contract undermines the City's contention that its non-dis-
crimination policies can brook no departures. The City offers no compelling reason why it has a particular inter-
est in denying an exception to CSS while making them available to others.

As Philadelphia acknowledges, CSS has "long been a point of light in the City's foster-care system." Brief for
City Respondents 1. CSS seeks only an accommodation that will allow it to continue serving the children of
Philadelphia in a manner consistent with its religious beliefs; it does not seek to impose those beliefs on anyone
else. The refusal of Philadelphia to contract with CSS for the provision of foster care services unless it agrees to
certify same-sex couples as foster parents cannot survive strict scrutiny, and violates the First Amendment.

In view of our conclusion that the actions of the City violate the Free Exercise Clause, we need not consider
whether they also violate the Free Speech Clause.

The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded
for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

Justice Gorsuch delivered the opinion of the Court.

Joseph Kennedy lost his job as a high school football coach because he knelt at midfield after games to offer a
quiet prayer of thanks. Mr. Kennedy prayed during a period when school employees were free to speak with
a friend, call for a reservation at a restaurant, check email, or attend to other personal matters. He offered his
prayers quietly while his students were otherwise occupied. Still, the Bremerton School District disciplined him
anyway. It did so because it thought anything less could lead a reasonable observer to conclude (mistakenly)
that it endorsed Mr. Kennedy's religious beliefs. That reasoning was misguided. Both the Free Exercise and Free
Speech Clauses of the First Amendment protect expressions like Mr. Kennedy's. Nor does a proper understand-
ing of the Amendment's Establishment Clause require the government to single out private religious speech for
special disfavor. The Constitution and the best of our traditions counsel mutual respect and tolerance, not cen-
sorship and suppression, for religious and nonreligious views alike.

Joseph Kennedy began working as a football coach at Bremerton High School in 2008 after nearly two decades
of service in the Marine Corps. App. 167. Like many other football players and coaches across the country, Mr.
Kennedy made it a practice to give "thanks through prayer on the playing field" at the conclusion of each game.
Id., at 168, 171 ... Initially, Mr. Kennedy prayed on his own. See Ibid. But over time, some players asked whether
they could pray alongside him. 991 F. 3d 1004, 1010 (CA9 2021); App. 169 ... The number of players who
joined Mr. Kennedy eventually grew to include most of the team, at least after some games. Sometimes team
members invited opposing players to join ... Eventually, Mr. Kennedy began incorporating short motivational
speeches with his prayer when others were present. See id., at 170 ... Mr. Kennedy explained that he "never told
any student that it was important they participate in any religious activity." Ibid. In particular, he "never pres-
sured or encouraged any student to join" his postgame midfield prayers. Ibid.

... It seems the District's superintendent first learned of [the prayers] only in September 2015 ... At that point,
the District reacted quickly ... The District explained that it sought to establish "clear parameters" "going
forward." Ibid. It instructed Mr. Kennedy to avoid any motivational "talks with students" that "include[d]
religious expression, including prayer," and to avoid "suggest[ing], encourag[ing] (or discourag[ing]), or super-
vis[ing]" any prayers of students, which students remained free to "engage in." Id., at 44. The District also
explained that any religious activity on Mr. Kennedy's part must be "nondemonstrative (i.e., not outwardly dis-
cernible as religious activity)" if "students are also engaged in religious conduct" in order to "avoid the percep-
tion of endorsement." Id., at 45. In offering these directives, the District appealed to what it called a "direct
                                                                                                                                 A NEW ERA? | 253

tension between" the "Establishment Clause" and "a school employee's [right to] free[ly] exercise" his religion.
Id., at 43. To resolve that "tension," the District explained, an employee's free exercise rights "must yield so far as
necessary to avoid school endorsement of religious activities." Ibid.

... Mr. Kennedy further felt pressured to abandon his practice of saying his own quiet, on-field postgame prayer.
See id., at 172. Driving home after a game, however, Mr. Kennedy felt upset that he had "broken [his] commit-
ment to God" by not offering his own prayer, so he turned his car around and returned to the field. Ibid. By that
point, everyone had left the stadium, and he walked to the 50-yard line and knelt to say a brief prayer of thanks.
See Ibid ...

On October 14, through counsel, Mr. Kennedy sent a letter to school officials informing them that, because
of his "sincerely-held religious beliefs," he felt "compelled" to offer a "post-game personal prayer" of thanks at
midfield. Id., at 62-63, 172 ... Mr. Kennedy emphasized that he sought only the opportunity to "wai[t] until
the game is over and the players have left the field and then wal[k] to mid-field to say a short, private, personal
prayer." Id., at 69 ...

Yet instead of accommodating Mr. Kennedy's request to offer a brief prayer on the field while students were
busy with other activities--whether heading to the locker room, boarding the bus, or perhaps singing the school
fight song-- the District issued an ultimatum. It forbade Mr. Kennedy from engaging in "any overt actions" that
could "appea[r] to a reasonable observer to endorse ... prayer ... while he is on duty as a District-paid coach." Id.,
at 81 ...

After receiving this letter, Mr. Kennedy offered a brief prayer following the October 16 game. See id., at 90.
When he bowed his head at midfield after the game, "most [Bremerton] players were ... engaged in the tradi-
tional singing of the school fight song to the audience." Ibid. Though Mr. Kennedy was alone when he began
to pray, players from the other team and members of the community joined him before he finished his prayer.
See id., at 82, 297. This event spurred media coverage of Mr. Kennedy's dilemma and a public response from the
District ... Still, the District explained that a "reasonable observer" could think government endorsement of reli-
gion had occurred when a "District employee, on the field only by virtue of his employment with the District,
still on duty" engaged in "overtly religious conduct." Id., at 91, 93. The District thus made clear that the only
option it would offer Mr. Kennedy was to allow him to pray after a game in a "private location" behind closed
doors and "not observable to students or the public." Id., at 93- 94.

...

Shortly after the October 26 game, the District placed Mr. Kennedy on paid administrative leave and prohibited
him from "participat[ing], in any capacity, in ... football program activities." Ibid ...

After these events, Mr. Kennedy sued in federal court, alleging that the District's actions violated the First
Amendment's Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses ... These Clauses work in tandem. Where the Free Exercise
Clause protects religious exercises, whether communicative or not, the Free Speech Clause provides overlapping
254 | A NEW ERA?

protection for expressive religious activities. That the First Amendment doubly protects religious speech is no
accident. It is a natural outgrowth of the framers' distrust of government attempts to regulate religion and sup-
press dissent ...

Under this Court's precedents, a plaintiff bears certain burdens to demonstrate an infringement of his rights
under the Free Exercise and Free Speech Clauses. If the plaintiff carries these burdens, the focus then shifts to
the defendant to show that its actions were nonetheless justified and tailored consistent with the demands of our
case law. See, e.g., Fulton v. Philadelphia, (2021) ... We begin by examining whether Mr. Kennedy has discharged
his burdens, first under the Free Exercise Clause, then under the Free Speech Clause.

The Free Exercise Clause ... protects not only the right to harbor religious beliefs inwardly and secretly. It does
perhaps its most important work by protecting the ability of those who hold religious beliefs of all kinds to live
out their faiths in daily life through "the performance of (or abstention from) physical acts." Employment Div.,
Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, (1990).

Under this Court's precedents, a plaintiff may carry the burden of proving a free exercise violation in various
ways, including by showing that a government entity has burdened his sincere religious practice pursuant to a
policy that is not "neutral" or "generally applicable." Id., at 879- 881. Should a plaintiff make a showing like
that, this Court will find a First Amendment violation unless the government can satisfy "strict scrutiny" by
demonstrating its course was justified by a compelling state interest and was narrowly tailored in pursuit of that
interest. Lukumi.

That Mr. Kennedy has discharged his burdens is effectively undisputed. No one questions that he seeks to
engage in a sincerely motivated religious exercise ... Nor does anyone question that, in forbidding Mr. Kennedy's
brief prayer, the District failed to act pursuant to a neutral and generally applicable rule. A government policy
will not qualify as neutral if it is "specifically directed at ... religious practice." Smith ... In this case, the District's
challenged policies were neither neutral nor generally applicable. By its own admission, the District sought to
restrict Mr. Kennedy's actions at least in part because of their religious character ...

When it comes to Mr. Kennedy's free speech claim, our precedents remind us that the First Amendment's
protections extend to "teachers and students," neither of whom "shed their constitutional rights to freedom
of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate." Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist.,
(1969) ... Of course, none of this means the speech rights of public school employees are so boundless that they
may deliver any message to anyone anytime they wish. In addition to being private citizens, teachers and coaches
are also government employees paid in part to speak on the government's behalf and convey its intended mes-
sages ...

To account for the complexity associated with the interplay between free speech rights and government employ-
ment, this Court's decisions [Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. (1968), Garcetti] ... suggest
proceeding in two steps. The first step involves a threshold inquiry into the nature of the speech at issue. If a
public employee speaks "pursuant to [his or her] official duties," this Court has said the Free Speech Clause gen-
erally will not shield the individual from an employer's control and discipline because that kind of speech is--for
constitutional purposes at least--the government's own speech.
                                                                                                                                 A NEW ERA? | 255

At the same time and at the other end of the spectrum, when an employee "speaks as a citizen addressing a matter
of public concern," our cases indicate that the First Amendment may be implicated and courts should proceed
to a second step. At this second step, our cases suggest that courts should attempt to engage in "a delicate balanc-
ing of the competing interests surrounding the speech and its consequences." ...

... [I]t seems clear to us that Mr. Kennedy has demonstrated that his speech was private speech, not government
speech. When Mr. Kennedy uttered the three prayers that resulted in his suspension, he was not engaged in
speech "ordinarily within the scope" of his duties as a coach. He did not speak pursuant to government policy.
He was not seeking to convey a government-created message. He was not instructing players, discussing strategy,
encouraging better on-field performance, or engaged in any other speech the District paid him to produce as a
coach. See Part I-B, supra. Simply put: Mr. Kennedy's prayers did not "ow[e their] existence" to Mr. Kennedy's
responsibilities as a public employee. Garcetti ...

Of course, acknowledging that Mr. Kennedy's prayers represented his own private speech does not end the
matter. So far, we have recognized only that Mr. Kennedy has carried his threshold burden. Under the Pick-
ering-Garcetti framework, a second step remains where the government may seek to prove that its interests as
employer outweigh even an employee's private speech on a matter of public concern.

Whether one views the case through the lens of the Free Exercise or Free Speech Clause, at this point the burden
shifts to the District ... Under the Free Exercise Clause, a government entity normally must satisfy at least "strict
scrutiny," showing that its restrictions on the plaintiff 's protected rights serve a compelling interest and are nar-
rowly tailored to that end. See Lukumi ... A similar standard generally obtains under the Free Speech Clause ...

As we have seen, the District argues that its suspension of Mr. Kennedy was essential to avoid a violation of the
Establishment Clause. Id., at 35-42. On its account, Mr. Kennedy's prayers might have been protected by the
Free Exercise and Free Speech Clauses. But his rights were in "direct tension" with the competing demands of
the Establishment Clause. App. 43. To resolve that clash, the District reasoned, Mr. Kennedy's rights had to
"yield." Ibid. The Ninth Circuit pursued this same line of thinking ...

What the District and the Ninth Circuit overlooked, however, is that the "shortcomings" associated with this
"ambitiou[s]," abstract, and ahistorical approach to the Establishment Clause became so "apparent" that this
Court long ago abandoned Lemon and its endorsement test offshoot ... The Court has explained that these tests
"invited chaos" in lower courts, led to "differing results" in materially identical cases, and created a "minefield"
for legislators ... This Court has since made plain, too, that the Establishment Clause does not include anything
like a "modified heckler's veto, in which ... religious activity can be proscribed" based on "`perceptions'" or "`dis-
comfort.'" Good News Club v. Milford Central School, (2001) ... Nor does the Clause "compel the government
to purge from the public sphere" anything an objective observer could reasonably infer endorses or "partakes of
the religious." Van Orden v. Perry, (2005) ...

In place of Lemon and the endorsement test, this Court has instructed that the Establishment Clause must
be interpreted by "`reference to historical practices and understandings.'" Town of Greece (2013) ... An analysis
focused on original meaning and history, this Court has stressed, has long represented the rule rather than some
"`exception'" within the "Court's Establishment Clause jurisprudence." Town of Greece (2013) ...
256 | A NEW ERA?

[Gorsuch then covers the Districts other reasons and concerns about the Coach's religious prayers and dismisses
each argument.]

In the end, the District's case hinges on the need to generate conflict between an individual's rights under the
Free Exercise and Free Speech Clauses and its own Establishment Clause duties--and then develop some expla-
nation why one of these Clauses in the First Amendment should "`trum[p]'" the other two. But the project
falters badly. Not only does the District fail to offer a sound reason to prefer one constitutional guarantee over
another. It cannot even show that they are at odds. In truth, there is no conflict between the constitutional com-
mands before us. There is only the "mere shadow" of a conflict, a false choice premised on a misconstruction
of the Establishment Clause ... And in no world may a government entity's concerns about phantom constitu-
tional violations justify actual violations of an individual's First Amendment rights ...

Respect for religious expressions is indispensable to life in a free and diverse Republic--whether those expres-
sions take place in a sanctuary or on a field, and whether they manifest through the spoken word or a bowed
head. Here, a government entity sought to punish an individual for engaging in a brief, quiet, personal religious
observance doubly protected by the Free Exercise and Free Speech Clauses of the First Amendment. And the
only meaningful justification the government offered for its reprisal rested on a mistaken view that it had a duty
to ferret out and suppress religious observances even as it allows comparable secular speech. The Constitution
neither mandates nor tolerates that kind of discrimination. Mr. Kennedy is entitled to summary judgment on
his First Amendment claims. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Reversed.

Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Breyer and Kagan join dissenting.

This case is about whether a public school must permit a school official to kneel, bow his head, and say a prayer
at the center of a school event. The Constitution does not authorize, let alone require, public schools to embrace
this conduct. Since Engel v. Vitale (1962), this Court consistently has recognized that school officials leading
prayer is constitutionally impermissible. Official-led prayer strikes at the core of our constitutional protections
for the religious liberty of students and their parents, as embodied in both the Establishment Clause and the
Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. The Court now charts a different path, yet again paying almost
exclusive attention to the Free Exercise Clause's protection for individual religious exercise while giving short
shrift to the Establishment Clause's prohibition on state establishment of religion. See Carson v. Makin, (2022)
(BREYER, J., dissenting). To the degree the Court portrays petitioner Joseph Kennedy's prayers as private and
quiet, it misconstrues the facts. The record reveals that Kennedy had a longstanding practice of conducting
demonstrative prayers on the 50- yard line of the football field. Kennedy consistently invited others to join his
prayers and for years led student athletes in prayer at the same time and location. The Court ignores this history.
The Court also ignores the severe disruption to school events caused by Kennedy's conduct, viewing it as irrel-
evant because the Bremerton School District (District) stated that it was suspending Kennedy to avoid it being
viewed as endorsing religion. Under the Court's analysis, presumably this would be a different case if the Dis-
trict had cited Kennedy's repeated disruptions of school programming and violations of school policy regarding
public access to the field as grounds for suspending him. As the District did not articulate those grounds, the
                                                                                                                                 A NEW ERA? | 257

Court assesses only the District's Establishment Clause concerns. It errs by assessing them divorced from the
context and history of Kennedy's prayer practice. Today's decision goes beyond merely misreading the record.
The Court overrules Lemon v. Kurtzman, (1971), and calls into question decades of subsequent precedents that
it deems "offshoot[s]" of that decision. Ante, at 22. In the process, the Court rejects longstanding concerns sur-
rounding government endorsement of religion and replaces the standard for reviewing such questions with a
new "history and tradition" test. In addition, while the Court reaffirms that the Establishment Clause prohibits
the government from coercing participation in religious exercise, it applies a nearly toothless version of the coer-
cion analysis, failing to acknowledge the unique pressures faced by students when participating in school-spon-
sored activities. This decision does a disservice to schools and the young citizens they serve, as well as to our
Nation's longstanding commitment to the separation of church and state. I respectfully dissent.

As the majority tells it, Kennedy, a coach for the District's football program, "lost his job" for "pray[ing] quietly
while his students were otherwise occupied." Ante, at 1. The record before us, however, tells a different story.

The District serves approximately 5,057 students and employs 332 teachers and 400 nonteaching personnel in
Kitsap County, Washington. The county is home to Bahá'ís, Buddhists, Hindus, Jews, Muslims, Sikhs, Zoroas-
trians, and many denominations of Christians, as well as numerous residents who are religiously unaffiliated. See
Brief for Religious and Denominational Organizations et al. as Amici Curiae.

... The District also set requirements for Kennedy's interactions with players, obliging him, like all coaches, to
"exhibit sportsmanlike conduct at all times," "utilize positive motivational strategies to encourage athletic per-
formance," and serve as a "mentor and role model for the student athletes." App., at 56. In addition, Kennedy's
position made him responsible for interacting with members of the community. In this capacity, the District
required Kennedy and other coaches to "maintain positive media relations," "always approach officials with
composure" with the expectation that they were "constantly being observed by others," and "communicate
effectively" with parents. Ibid.

Finally, District coaches had to "[a]dhere to [District] policies and administrative regulations" more generally.
Id., at 30-31.

In September 2015, a coach from another school's football team informed BHS' principal that Kennedy had
asked him and his team to join Kennedy in prayer ... The District initiated an inquiry into whether its policy on
Religious-Related Activities and Practices had been violated. It learned that, since his hiring in 2008, Kennedy
had been kneeling on the 50-yard line to pray immediately after shaking hands with the opposing team. Kennedy
recounted that he initially prayed alone and that he never asked any student to join him. Over time, however,
a majority of the team came to join him, with the numbers varying from game to game. Kennedy's practice
evolved into postgame talks in which Kennedy would hold aloft student helmets and deliver speeches with
"overtly religious references," which Kennedy described as prayers, while the players kneeled around him. Id., at
40 ...
258 | A NEW ERA?

                            J. Kennedy standing in group of kneeling players

While the District's inquiry was pending, its athletic director attended BHS' September 11, 2015, football game
and told Kennedy that he should not be conducting prayers with players. After the game, while the athletic
director watched, Kennedy led a prayer out loud, holding up a player's helmet as the players kneeled around him.
While riding the bus home with the team, Kennedy posted on Facebook that he thought he might have just been
fired for praying.
On September 17, the District's superintendent sent Kennedy a letter informing him that leading prayers with
students on the field and in the locker room would likely be found to violate the Establishment Clause, exposing
the District to legal liability. The District acknowledged that Kennedy had "not actively encouraged, or required,
participation" but emphasized that "school staff may not indirectly encourage students to engage in religious
activity" or "endors[e]" religious activity; rather, the District explained, staff "must remain neutral" "while per-
forming their job duties." Id., at 41-43. The District instructed Kennedy that any motivational talks to students
must remain secular, "so as to avoid alienation of any team member." Id., at 44.
The District reiterated that "all District staff are free to engage in religious activity, including prayer, so long as it
does not interfere with job responsibilities." Id., at 45. To avoid endorsing student religious exercise, the District
instructed that such activity must be nondemonstrative or conducted separately from students, away from stu-
dent activities. Ibid ...
Kennedy stopped participating in locker room prayers and, after a game the following day, gave a secular speech.
He returned to pray in the stadium alone after his duties were over and everyone had left the stadium, to which
the District had no objection. Kennedy then hired an attorney, who, on October 14, sent a letter explaining that
Kennedy was "motivated by his sincerely-held religious beliefs to pray following each football game." Id., at 63
... The letter further announced that Kennedy would resume his 50-yard-line prayer practice the next day after
the October 16 homecoming game.1 Before the homecoming game, Kennedy made multiple media appearances
                                                                                                                                 A NEW ERA? | 259

to publicize his plans to pray at the 50- yard line, leading to an article in the Seattle News and a local television
broadcast about the upcoming homecoming game. In the wake of this media coverage, the District began receiv-
ing a large number of emails, letters, and calls, many of them threatening.
... While Kennedy's letter asserted that his prayers "occurr[ed] `on his own time,' after his duties as a District
employee had ceased," the District pointed out that Kennedy "remain[ed] on duty" when his prayers occurred
"immediately following completion of the football game, when students are still on the football field, in uni-
form, under the stadium lights, with the audience still in attendance, and while Mr. Kennedy is still in his Dis-
trict-issued and District-logoed attire." Id., at 78 (emphasis deleted).
... The District stated that it had no objection to Kennedy returning to the stadium when he was off duty to pray
at the 50-yard line, nor with Kennedy praying while on duty if it did not interfere with his job duties or suggest
the District's endorsement of religion ...
On October 16, after playing of the game had concluded, Kennedy shook hands with the opposing team, and
as advertised, knelt to pray while most BHS players were singing the school's fight song. He quickly was joined
by coaches and players from the opposing team. Television news cameras surrounded the group. Members of
the public rushed the field to join Kennedy, jumping fences to access the field and knocking over student band
members. After the game, the District received calls from Satanists who "`intended to conduct ceremonies on
the field after football games if others were allowed to.'" Id., at 181. To secure the field and enable subsequent
games to continue safely, the District was forced to make security arrangements with the local police and to post
signs near the field and place robocalls to parents reiterating that the field was not open to the public.

                            10/16/2015

The District sent Kennedy another letter on October 23, explaining that his conduct at the October 16 game
was inconsistent with the District's requirements ... Again, the District emphasized that it was happy to accom-
modate Kennedy's desire to pray on the job in a way that did not interfere with his duties or risk perceptions of
endorsement ...
260 | A NEW ERA?

Kennedy did not directly respond or suggest a satisfactory accommodation. Instead, his attorneys told the media
that he would accept only demonstrative prayer on the 50- yard line immediately after games. During the Octo-
ber 23 and October 26 games, Kennedy again prayed at the 50- yard line immediately following the game, while
postgame activities were still ongoing ...

... After the issues with Kennedy arose, several parents reached out to the District saying that their children had
participated in Kennedy's prayers solely to avoid separating themselves from the rest of the team. No BHS stu-
dents appeared to pray on the field after Kennedy's suspension ...

Kennedy then filed suit. He contended, as relevant, that the District violated his rights under the Free Speech
and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment ... Properly understood, this case is not about the limits on an
individual's ability to engage in private prayer at work. This case is about whether a school district is required to
allow one of its employees to incorporate a public, communicative display of the employee's personal religious
beliefs into a school event, where that display is recognizable as part of a longstanding practice of the employee
ministering religion to students as the public watched. A school district is not required to permit such conduct;
in fact, the Establishment Clause prohibits it from doing so ...

The Establishment Clause protects this freedom by "command[ing] a separation of church and state." Cutter v.
Wilkinson, (2005) ...

Indeed, "[t]he Court has been particularly vigilant in monitoring compliance with the Establishment Clause in
elementary and secondary schools." Edwards v. Aguillard, (1987). The reasons motivating this vigilance inhere
in the nature of schools themselves and the young people they serve. Two are relevant here. First, government
neutrality toward religion is particularly important in the public school context given the role public schools play
in our society ... Accordingly, the Establishment Clause "proscribes public schools from `conveying or attempt-
ing to convey a message that religion or a particular religious belief is favored or preferred'" or otherwise endors-
ing religious beliefs. Lee, (Blackmun, J., concurring).

Second, schools face a higher risk of unconstitutionally "coerc[ing] ... support or participat[ion] in religion or its
exercise" than other government entities. Id., at 587 (opinion of the Court) ... Moreover, the State exercises that
great authority over children, who are uniquely susceptible to "subtle coercive pressure." Lee ... Accordingly, this
Court has emphasized that "the State may not, consistent with the Establishment Clause, place primary and sec-
ondary school children" in the dilemma of choosing between "participating, with all that implies, or protesting"
a religious exercise in a public school. Lee.

Given the twin Establishment Clause concerns of endorsement and coercion, it is unsurprising that the Court
has consistently held integrating prayer into public school activities to be unconstitutional, including when stu-
dent participation is not a formal requirement or prayer is silent ...

Under these precedents, the Establishment Clause violation at hand is clear ... Kennedy's tradition of a 50-yard
line prayer thus strikes at the heart of the Establishment Clause's concerns about endorsement. For students and
community members at the game, Coach Kennedy was the face and the voice of the District during football
games ... Although the football game itself had ended, the football game events had not; Kennedy himself
                                                                                                                                 A NEW ERA? | 261

acknowledged that his responsibilities continued until the players went home. Kennedy's postgame responsibil-
ities were what placed Kennedy on the 50-yard line in the first place; that was, after all, where he met the oppos-
ing team to shake hands after the game. Permitting a school coach to lead students and others he invited onto
the field in prayer at a predictable time after each game could only be viewed as a postgame tradition occurring
"with the approval of the school administration." Santa Fe.

Kennedy's prayer practice also implicated the coercion concerns at the center of this Court's Establishment
Clause jurisprudence ... The record before the Court bears this out ...

Kennedy does not defend his longstanding practice of leading the team in prayer out loud on the field as they
kneeled around him. Instead, he responds, and the Court accepts, that his highly visible and demonstrative
prayer at the last three games before his suspension did not violate the Establishment Clause because these
prayers were quiet and thus private. This Court's precedents, however, do not permit isolating government
actions from their context in determining whether they violate the Establishment Clause. To the contrary, this
Court has repeatedly stated that Establishment Clause inquiries are fact specific and require careful considera-
tion of the origins and practical reality of the specific practice at issue ... This Court's precedent thus does not
permit treating Kennedy's "new" prayer practice as occurring on a blank slate, any more than those in the Dis-
trict's school community would have experienced Kennedy's changed practice (to the degree there was one) as
erasing years of prior actions by Kennedy. ...

Finally, Kennedy stresses that he never formally required students to join him in his prayers. But existing prece-
dents do not require coercion to be explicit, particularly when children are involved ...

Despite the overwhelming precedents establishing that school officials leading prayer violates the Establishment
Clause, the Court today holds that Kennedy's midfield prayer practice did not violate the Establishment Clause.
This decision rests on an erroneous understanding of the Religion Clauses. It also disregards the balance this
Court's cases strike among the rights conferred by the Clauses. The Court relies on an assortment of pluralities,
concurrences, and dissents by Members of the current majority to effect fundamental changes in this Court's
Religion Clauses jurisprudence, all the while proclaiming that nothing has changed at all ...

The Free Exercise Clause and Establishment Clause are equally integral in protecting religious freedom in our
society. The first serves as "a promise from our government," while the second erects a "backstop that disables
our government from breaking it" and "start[ing] us down the path to the past, when [the right to free exer-
cise] was routinely abridged." Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer, (2017) (Sotomayor, J., dis-
senting). Today, the Court once again weakens the backstop. It elevates one individual's interest in personal
religious exercise, in the exact time and place of that individual's choosing, over society's interest in protecting
the separation between church and state, eroding the protections for religious liberty for all. Today's decision is
particularly misguided because it elevates the religious rights of a school official, who voluntarily accepted pub-
lic employment and the limits that public employment entails, over those of his students, who are required to
attend school and who this Court has long recognized are particularly vulnerable and deserving of protection. In
262 | A NEW ERA?

doing so, the Court sets us further down a perilous path in forcing States to entangle themselves with religion,
with all of our rights hanging in the balance. As much as the Court protests otherwise, today's decision is no
victory for religious liberty. I respectfully dissent.

    Majority: Holmes, joined by White, McKenna, Day, Van Devanter, Pitney, McReynolds, Brandeis and
    Clarke

Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.

This is an indictment in three counts. The first charges a conspiracy to violate the Espionage Act ... by causing
and attempting to cause insubordination, &c., in the military and naval forces of the United States, and to
obstruct the recruiting and enlistment service of the United States, when the United States was at war with the
German Empire, to-wit, that the defendant willfully conspired to have printed and circulated to men who had
been called and accepted for military service under the Act of May 18, 1917 ... a document set forth and alleged
to be calculated to cause such insubordination and obstruction. The second count alleges a conspiracy to com-
mit an offense against the United States, to-wit, to use the mails for the transmission of matter declared to be
non-mailable by ... the Act of June 15, 1917 ... The third count charges an unlawful use of the mails for the
transmission of the same matter and otherwise as above. The defendants were found guilty on all the counts.
They set up the First Amendment to the Constitution forbidding Congress to make any law abridging the free-
dom of speech, or of the press, and bringing the case here on that ground have argued some other points also of
which we must dispose.

...

The document in question, upon its first printed side, recited the first section of the Thirteenth Amendment,
said that the idea embodied in it was violated by the Conscription Act, and that a conscript is little better than
a convict. In impassioned language, it intimated that conscription was despotism in its worst form, and a mon-
strous wrong against humanity in the interest of Wall Street's chosen few. It said "Do not submit to intimida-
tion," but in form, at least, confined itself to peaceful measures such as a petition for the repeal of the act. The
other and later printed side of the sheet was headed "Assert Your Rights." It stated reasons for alleging that any-
one violated the Constitution when he refused to recognize "your right to assert your opposition to the draft,"
and went on

"If you do not assert and support your rights, you are helping to deny or disparage rights which it is the solemn
duty of all citizens and residents of the United States to retain."
                                                                                                    DEFINING DANGER AND SPEECH | 267

It described the arguments on the other side as coming from cunning politicians and a mercenary capitalist press,
and even silent consent to the conscription law as helping to support an infamous conspiracy. It denied the
power to send our citizens away to foreign shores to shoot up the people of other lands, and added that words
could not express the condemnation such cold-blooded ruthlessness deserves, &c., &c., winding up, "You must
do your share to maintain, support and uphold the rights of the people of this country." Of course, the docu-
ment would not have been sent unless it had been intended to have some effect, and we do not see what effect it
could be expected to have upon persons subject to the draft except to influence them to obstruct the carrying of
it out. The defendants do not deny that the jury might find against them on this point.

But it is said, suppose that that was the tendency of this circular, it is protected by the First Amendment to the
Constitution. Two of the strongest expressions are said to be quoted respectively from well-known public men.
It well may be that the prohibition of laws abridging the freedom of speech is not confined to previous restraints,
although to prevent them may have been the main purpose. Patterson v Colorado, (1907). We admit that in many
places and in ordinary times the defendants in saying all that was said in the circular would have been within
their constitutional rights. But the character of every act depends upon the circumstances in which it is done.
The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and
causing a panic. It does not even protect a man from an injunction against uttering words that may have all the
effect of force. The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of
such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress
has a right to prevent. It is a question of proximity and degree. When a nation is at war many things that might
be said in time of peace are such a hindrance to its effort that their utterance will not be endured so long as men
fight and that no Court could regard them as protected by any constitutional right. It seems to be admitted that
if an actual obstruction of the recruiting service were proved, liability for words that produced that effect might
be enforced. The statute of 1917 in section 4 (Comp. St. 1918, § 10212d) punishes conspiracies to obstruct as
well as actual obstruction. If the act, (speaking, or circulating a paper,) its tendency and the intent with which it
is done are the same, we perceive no ground for saying that success alone warrants making the act a crime ...

Judgments affirmed.

Abrams v. United States

250 U.S. 216 (1919)

    Vote: 7-2
    Decision: for the United States
    Majority: Clarke, joined by White, McKenna, Day, Van Devanter, Pitney, and McReynolds
    Dissent: Holmes, joined by Brandeis

Mr. Justice Clarke delivered the opinion of the Court.

On a single indictment, containing four counts, the five plaintiffs in error, hereinafter designated the defendants,
were convicted of conspiring to violate provisions of the Espionage Act of Congress.

Each of the first three counts charged the defendants with conspiring, when the United States was at war with
the Imperial Government of Germany, to unlawfully utter, print, write and publish: in the first count, "disloyal,
scurrilous and abusive language about the form of Government of the United States;" in the second count, lan-
guage "intended to bring the form of Government of the United States into contempt, scorn, contumely and
disrepute;" and in the third count, language "intended to incite, provoke and encourage resistance to the United
States in said war." The charge in the fourth count was that the defendants conspired,

"when the United States was at war with the Imperial German Government, unlawfully and willfully, by utter-
ance, writing, printing and publication, to urge, incite and advocate curtailment of production of things and
products, to-wit, ordnance and ammunition, necessary and essential to the prosecution of the war."

The offenses were charged in the language of the act of Congress.

It was charged in each count of the indictment that it was a part of the conspiracy that the defendants would
attempt to accomplish their unlawful purpose by printing, writing and distributing in the City of New York
many copies of a leaflet or circular, printed in the English language, and of another printed in the Yiddish lan-
guage, copies of which, properly identified, were attached to the indictment.

All of the five defendants were born in Russia. They were intelligent, had considerable schooling, and, at the
time they were arrested, they had lived in the United States terms varying from five to ten years, but none of
them had applied for naturalization. Four of them testified as witnesses in their own behalf, and, of these, three
frankly avowed that they were "rebels," "revolutionists," "anarchists," that they did not believe in government
in any form, and they declared that they had no interest whatever in the Government of the United States. The
fourth defendant testified that he was a "socialist," and believed in "a proper kind of government, not capitalis-
tic," but, in his classification, the Government of the United States was "capitalistic."

It was admitted on the trial that the defendants had united to print and distribute the described circulars, and
that five thousand of them had been printed and distributed about the 22nd day of August, 1918.
                                                                                                    DEFINING DANGER AND SPEECH | 271

The defendants pleaded "not guilty," and the case of the Government consisted in showing the facts we have
stated, and in introducing in evidence copies of the two printed circulars attached to the indictment ...

* * * [The Court excerpted the leaflets].

These excerpts sufficiently show that, while the immediate occasion for this particular outbreak of lawlessness on
the part of the defendant alien anarchists may have been resentment caused by our Government's sending troops
into Russia as a strategic operation against the Germans on the eastern battlefront, yet the plain purpose of their
propaganda was to excite, at the supreme crisis of the war, disaffection, sedition, riots, and, as they hoped, revo-
lution, in this country for the purpose of embarrassing, and, if possible, defeating the military plans of the Gov-
ernment in Europe. A technical distinction may perhaps be taken between disloyal and abusive language applied
to the form of our government or language intended to bring the form of our government into contempt and
disrepute, and language of like character and intended to produce like results directed against the President and
Congress, the agencies through which that form of government must function in time of war. But it is not nec-
essary to a decision of this case to consider whether such distinction is vital or merely formal, for the language
of these circulars was obviously intended to provoke and to encourage resistance to the United States in the war,
as the third count runs, and the defendants, in terms, plainly urged and advocated a resort to a general strike of
workers in ammunition factories for the purpose of curtailing the production of ordnance and munitions nec-
essary and essential to the prosecution of the war as is charged in the fourth count. Thus, it is clear not only that
some evidence, but that much persuasive evidence, was before the jury tending to prove that the defendants were
guilty as charged in both the third and fourth counts of the indictment, and, under the long established rule of
law hereinbefore stated, the judgment of the District Court must be

Affirmed.

Mr. Justice Holmes Dissenting [Mr. Justice Brandeis Joins].

...

The first of these leaflets says that the President's cowardly silence about the intervention in Russia reveals the
hypocrisy of the plutocratic gang in Washington. It intimates that "German militarism combined with allied
capitalism to crush the Russian evolution " -- goes on that the tyrants of the world fight each other until they see
a common enemy -- working class enlightenment, when they combine to crush it, and that now militarism and
capitalism combined, though not openly, to crush the Russian revolution. It says that there is only one enemy
of the workers of the world, and that is capitalism; that it is a crime for workers of America, &c., to fight the
workers' republic of Russia, and ends "Awake! Awake, you Workers of the World, Revolutionists!" A note adds

"It is absurd to call us pro-German. We hate and despise German militarism more than do you hypocritical
tyrants. We have more reasons for denouncing German militarism than has the coward of the White House."

The other leaflet, headed "Workers -- Wake Up," with abusive language says that America together with the
Allies will march for Russia to help the Czecko-Slovaks in their struggle against the Bolsheviki, and that this time
the hypocrites shall not fool the Russian emigrants and friends of Russia in America ... The leaflet winds up by
272 | DEFINING DANGER AND SPEECH

saying "Workers, our reply to this barbaric intervention has to be a general strike!" and, after a few words on the
spirit of revolution, exhortations not to be afraid, and some usual tall talk ends, "Woe unto those who will be in
the way of progress. Let solidarity live! The Rebels."

No argument seems to me necessary to show that these pronunciamentos in no way attack the form of govern-
ment of the United States ... With regard to that, it seems too plain to be denied that the suggestion to workers
in the ammunition factories that they are producing bullets to murder their dearest, and the further advocacy of
a general strike, both in the second leaflet, do urge curtailment of production of things necessary to the prosecu-
tion of the war ... But to make the conduct criminal, that statute requires that it should be "with intent by such
curtailment to cripple or hinder the United States in the prosecution of the war." It seems to me that no such
intent is proved.

I am aware, of course, that the word intent as vaguely used in ordinary legal discussion means no more than
knowledge at the time of the act that the consequences said to be intended will ensue. Even less than that will sat-
isfy the general principle of civil and criminal liability. A man may have to pay damages, may be sent to prison, at
common law might be hanged, if, at the time of his act, he knew facts from which common experience showed
that the consequences would follow, whether he individually could foresee them or not. But, when words are
used exactly, a deed is not done with intent to produce a consequence unless that consequence is the aim of the
deed. It may be obvious, and obvious to the actor, that the consequence will follow, and he may be liable for it
even if he regrets it, but he does not do the act with intent to produce it unless the aim to produce it is the prox-
imate motive of the specific act, although there may be some deeper motive behind.

It seems to me that this statute must be taken to use its words in a strict and accurate sense. They would be
absurd in any other. A patriot might think that we were wasting money on aeroplanes, or making more cannon
of a certain kind than we needed, and might advocate curtailment with success, yet, even if it turned out that the
curtailment hindered and was thought by other minds to have been obviously likely to hinder the United States
in the prosecution of the war, no one would hold such conduct a crime ...

But, as against dangers peculiar to war, as against others, the principle of the right to free speech is always the
same. It is only the present danger of immediate evil or an intent to bring it about that warrants Congress in
setting a limit to the expression of opinion where private rights are not concerned. Congress certainly cannot
forbid all effort to change the mind of the country. Now nobody can suppose that the surreptitious publish-
ing of a silly leaflet by an unknown man, without more, would present any immediate danger that its opinions
would hinder the success of the government arms or have any appreciable tendency to do so. Publishing those
opinions for the very purpose of obstructing, however, might indicate a greater danger, and, at any rate, would
have the quality of an attempt ... It is necessary where the success of the attempt depends upon others because,
if that intent is not present, the actor's aim may be accomplished without bringing about the evils sought to be
checked. An intent to prevent interference with the revolution in Russia might have been satisfied without any
hindrance to carrying on the war in which we were engaged.

... Persecution for the expression of opinions seems to me perfectly logical. If you have no doubt of your premises
or your power, and want a certain result with all your heart, you naturally express your wishes in law, and sweep
§                                                                                                   DEFINING DANGER AND SPEECH | 273

away all opposition. To allow opposition by speech seems to indicate that you think the speech impotent, as
when a man says that he has squared the circle, or that you do not care wholeheartedly for the result, or that
you doubt either your power or your premises. But when men have realized that time has upset many fighting
faiths, they may come to believe even more than they believe the very foundations of their own conduct that the
ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas -- that the best test of truth is the power of the
thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market, and that truth is the only ground upon which
their wishes safely can be carried out. That, at any rate, is the theory of our Constitution. It is an experiment, as
all life is an experiment. Every year, if not every day, we have to wager our salvation upon some prophecy based
upon imperfect knowledge. While that experiment is part of our system, I think that we should be eternally vig-
ilant against attempts to check the expression of opinions that we loathe and believe to be fraught with death,
unless they so imminently threaten immediate interference with the lawful and pressing purposes of the law that
an immediate check is required to save the country. I wholly disagree with the argument of the Government that
the First Amendment left the common law as to seditious libel in force. History seems to me against the notion.
I had conceived that the United States, through many years, had shown its repentance for the Sedition Act of
1798, by repaying fines that it imposed. Only the emergency that makes it immediately dangerous to leave the
correction of evil counsels to time warrants making any exception to the sweeping command, "Congress shall
make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech." Of course, I am speaking only of expressions of opinion and
exhortations, which were all that were uttered here, but I regret that I cannot put into more impressive words
my belief that, in their conviction upon this indictment, the defendants were deprived of their rights under the
Constitution of the United States.

Gitlow v. New York

268 U.S. 652 (1925)

    Vote: 7-2
    Majority: Sanford, joined by Taft, Van Devanter, McReynolds, Sutherland, Butler, Sanford and Stone
    Dissent: Homes, joined by Brandeis

Mr. Justice Sanford delivered the opinion of the Court.

Benjamin Gitlow was indicted in the Supreme Court of New York, with three others, for the statutory crime of
criminal anarchy. New York Penal Laws, §§ 160, 161. * * * The contention here is that the statute, by its terms
and as applied in this case, is repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Its material
provisions are:
274 | DEFINING DANGER AND SPEECH

"§ 160. Criminal anarchy defined. Criminal anarchy is the doctrine that organized government should be over-
thrown by force or violence, or by assassination of the executive head or of any of the executive officials of gov-
ernment, or by any unlawful means. The advocacy of such doctrine either by word of mouth or writing is a
felony."

"§ 161. Advocacy of criminal anarchy. Any person who:"

"1. By word of mouth or writing advocates, advises or teaches the duty, necessity or propriety of overthrowing
or overturning organized government by force or violence, or by assassination of the executive head or of any of
the executive officials of government, or by any unlawful means; or,"

"2. Prints, publishes, edits, issues or knowingly circulates, sells, distributes or publicly displays any book, paper,
document, or written or printed matter in any form, containing or advocating, advising or teaching the doctrine
that organized government should be overthrown by force, violence or any unlawful means"

"Is guilty of a felony and punishable by imprisonment or fine, or both."

The indictment was in two counts. The first charged that the defendant had advocated, advised and taught the
duty, necessity and propriety of overthrowing and overturning organized government by force, violence and
unlawful means, by certain writings therein set forth entitled "The Left Wing Manifesto"; the second, that he
had printed, published and knowingly circulated and distributed a certain paper called "The Revolutionary
Age," containing the writings set forth in the first count advocating, advising and teaching the doctrine that
organized government should be overthrown by force, violence and unlawful means. * * *

... The Left Wing Section was organized nationally at a conference in New York City in June, 1919, attended by
ninety delegates from twenty different States. The conference elected a National Council, of which the defen-
dant was a member, and left to it the adoption of a "Manifesto." This was published in The Revolutionary
Age, the official organ of the Left Wing. * * * Sixteen thousand copies were printed, which were delivered at the
premises in New York City used as the office of the Revolutionary Age and the headquarters of the Left Wing,
and occupied by the defendant and other officials. These copies were paid for by the defendant, as business man-
ager of the paper. Employees at this office wrapped and mailed out copies of the paper under the defendant's
direction, and copies were sold from this office. It was admitted that the defendant signed a card subscribing to
the Manifesto and Program of the Left Wing, which all applicants were required to sign before being admitted
to membership; that he went to different parts of the State to speak to branches of the Socialist Party about the
principles of the Left Wing and advocated their adoption, and that he was responsible for the Manifesto as it
appeared, that "he knew of the publication, in a general way, and he knew of its publication afterwards, and is
responsible for its circulation."

There was no evidence of any effect resulting from the publication and circulation of the Manifesto. * * *

Coupled with a review of the rise of Socialism, [the Manifesto] condemned the dominant "moderate Socialism"
for its recognition of the necessity of the democratic parliamentary state; repudiated its policy of introducing
Socialism by legislative measures, and advocated, in plain and unequivocal language, the necessity of accomplish-
                                                                                                    DEFINING DANGER AND SPEECH | 275

ing the "Communist Revolution" by a militant and "revolutionary Socialism", based on "the class struggle" and
mobilizing the "power of the proletariat in action," through mass industrial revolts developing into mass polit-
ical strikes and "revolutionary mass action", for the purpose of conquering and destroying the parliamentary
state and establishing in its place, through a "revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat", the system of Com-
munist Socialism. The then recent strikes ... were cited as instances of ... revolutionary action ... it was urged ... to
broaden the strike, make it general and militant, and develop it into mass political strikes and revolutionary mass
action for the annihilation of the parliamentary state.

* * * [Gitlow was convicted and the convictions upheld by the New York courts.]

The sole contention here is, essentially, that as there was no evidence of any concrete result flowing from the
publication of the Manifesto or of circumstances showing the likelihood of such result, the statute as construed
and applied by the trial court penalizes the mere utterance, as such, of "doctrine" having no quality of incite-
ment, without regard either to the circumstances of its utterance or to the likelihood of unlawful sequences, and
that, as the exercise of the right of free expression with relation to government is only punishable "in circum-
stances involving likelihood of substantive evil," the statute contravenes the due process clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment. The argument in support of this contention rests primarily upon the following propositions: 1st,
that the "liberty" protected by the Fourteenth Amendment includes the liberty of speech and of the press, and
2nd, that while liberty of expression "is not absolute," it may be restrained "only in circumstances where its exer-
cise bears a causal relation with some substantive evil, consummated, attempted or likely," and as the statute
"takes no account of circumstances," it unduly restrains this liberty and is therefore unconstitutional.

The precise question presented, and the only question which we can consider under this writ of error, then is
whether the statute, as construed and applied in this case by the state courts, deprived the defendant of his lib-
erty of expression in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

The statute does not penalize the utterance or publication of abstract "doctrine" or academic discussion having
no quality of incitement to any concrete action. It is not aimed against mere historical or philosophical essays. It
does not restrain the advocacy of changes in the form of government by constitutional and lawful means. What
it prohibits is language advocating, advising or teaching the overthrow of organized government by unlawful
means. These words imply urging to action. Advocacy is defined in the Century Dictionary as: "1. The act of
pleading for, supporting, or recommending; active espousal." It is not the abstract "doctrine" of overthrowing
organized government by unlawful means which is denounced by the statute, but the advocacy of action for the
accomplishment of that purpose ...

The Manifesto, plainly, is neither the statement of abstract doctrine nor, as suggested by counsel, mere predic-
tion that industrial disturbances and revolutionary mass strikes will result spontaneously in an inevitable process
of evolution in the economic system. It advocates and urges in fervent language mass action which shall pro-
gressively foment industrial disturbances and, through political mass strikes and revolutionary mass action, over-
throw and destroy organized parliamentary government. It concludes with a call to action in these words:

"The proletariat revolution and the Communist reconstruction of society -- the struggle for these -- is now
indispensable. ... The Communist International calls the proletariat of the world to the final struggle!"
276 | DEFINING DANGER AND SPEECH

This is not the expression of philosophical abstraction, the mere prediction of future events; it is the language of
direct incitement.

... That the jury were warranted in finding that the Manifesto advocated not merely the abstract doctrine of over-
throwing organized government by force, violence and unlawful means, but action to that end, is clear ...

It is a fundamental principle, long established, that the freedom of speech and of the press which is secured by
the Constitution does not confer an absolute right to speak or publish, without responsibility, whatever one
may choose, or an unrestricted and unbridled license that gives immunity for every possible use of language and
prevents the punishment of those who abuse this freedom. * * * Reasonably limited ... this freedom is an ines-
timable privilege in a free government; without such limitation, it might become the scourge of the republic.

That a State in the exercise of its police power may punish those who abuse this freedom by utterances inimical
to the public welfare, tending to corrupt public morals, incite to crime, or disturb the public peace, is not open
to question. * * *

And, for yet more imperative reasons, a State may punish utterances endangering the foundations of organized
government and threatening its overthrow by unlawful means ... And a State may penalize utterances which
openly advocate the overthrow of the representative and constitutional form of government of the United States
and the several States, by violence or other unlawful means. In short, this freedom does not deprive a State of the
primary and essential right of self-preservation, which, so long as human governments endure, they cannot be
denied. * * *

That utterances inciting to the overthrow of organized government by unlawful means present a sufficient dan-
ger of substantive evil to bring their punishment within the range of legislative discretion is clear. Such utter-
ances, by their very nature, involve danger to the public peace and to the security of the State. They threaten
breaches of the peace, and ultimate revolution. And the immediate danger is none the less real and substantial
because the effect of a given utterance cannot be accurately foreseen. The State cannot reasonably be required
to measure the danger from every such utterance in the nice balance of a jeweler's scale. A single revolutionary
spark may kindle a fire that, smouldering for a time, may burst into a sweeping and destructive conflagration.
It cannot be said that the State is acting arbitrarily or unreasonably when, in the exercise of its judgment as to
the measures necessary to protect the public peace and safety, it seeks to extinguish the spark without waiting
until it has enkindled the flame or blazed into the conflagration. It cannot reasonably be required to defer the
adoption of measures for its own peace and safety until the revolutionary utterances lead to actual disturbances
of the public peace or imminent and immediate danger of its own destruction; but it may, in the exercise of its
judgment, suppress the threatened danger in its incipiency.

We cannot hold that the present statute is an arbitrary or unreasonable exercise of the police power of the State
unwarrantably infringing the freedom of speech or press, and we must and do sustain its constitutionality.
§                                                                                                   DEFINING DANGER AND SPEECH | 277

And finding, for the reasons stated, that the statute is not, in itself, unconstitutional, and that it has not been
applied in the present case in derogation of any constitutional right, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Affirmed.

Petitioner after jury trial was found guilty of disorderly conduct in violation of a city ordinance of Chicago, and
fined. The case grew out of an address he delivered in an auditorium in Chicago under the auspices of the Chris-
tian Veterans of America. The meeting commanded considerable public attention. The auditorium was filled to
capacity, with over eight hundred persons present. Others were turned away. Outside of the auditorium, a crowd
of about one thousand persons gathered to protest against the meeting. A cordon of policemen was assigned to
the meeting to maintain order, but they were not able to prevent several disturbances. The crowd outside was
angry and turbulent.

Petitioner in his speech condemned the conduct of the crowd outside and vigorously, if not viciously, criticized
various political and racial groups whose activities he denounced as inimical to the nation's welfare.

The trial court charged that `breach of the peace' consists of any `misbehavior which violates the public peace
and decorum'; and that the `misbehavior may constitute a breach of the peace if it stirs the public to anger,
invites dispute, brings about a condition of unrest, or creates a disturbance, or if it molests the inhabitants in the
enjoyment of peace and quiet by arousing alarm.'

Petitioner did not take exception to that instruction. But he maintained at all times that the ordinance as applied
to his conduct violated his right of free speech ... The case is here on a petition for certiorari which we granted
because of the importance of the question presented.
278 | DEFINING DANGER AND SPEECH

... As we have noted, the statutory words `breach of the peace' were defined in instructions to the jury to include
speech which `stirs the public to anger, invites dispute, brings about a condition or unrest, or creates a distur-
bance ...

The vitality of civil and political institutions in our society depends on free discussion ... it is only through free
debate and free exchange of ideas that government remains responsive to the will of the people and peaceful
change is effected. The right to speak freely and to promote diversity of ideas and programs is therefore one of
the chief distinctions that sets us apart from totalitarian regimes.

Accordingly a function of free speech under our system of government is to invite dispute. It may indeed best
serve its high purpose when it induces a condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction with conditions as they are,
or even stirs people to anger. Speech is often provocative and challenging. It may strike at prejudices and pre-
conceptions and have profound unsettling effects as it presses for acceptance of an idea. That is why freedom of
speech, though not absolute, Chaplinsky v NH, (1942), is nevertheless protected against censorship or punish-
ment, unless shown likely to produce a clear and present danger of a serious substantive evil that rises far above
public inconvenience, annoyance, or unrest. Bridges v California, (1941). There is no room under our Consti-
tution for a more restrictive view. For the alternative would lead to standardization of ideas either by legislatures,
courts, or dominant political or community groups.

The ordinance as construed by the trial court seriously invaded this province. It permitted conviction of peti-
tioner if his speech stirred people to anger, invited public dispute, or brought about a condition of unrest. A
conviction resting on any of those grounds may not stand ...

... As we have said, the gloss which Illinois placed on the ordinance gives it a meaning and application which
are conclusive on us. We need not consider whether as construed it is defective in its entirety. As construed and
applied it at least contains parts that are unconstitutional. The verdict was a general one; and we do not know
on this record but what it may rest on the invalid clauses.

The statute as construed in the charge to the jury was passed on by the Illinois courts and sustained by them over
the objection that as so read it violated the Fourteenth Amendment. The fact that the parties did not dispute its
construction makes the adjudication no less ripe for our review ... We can only take the statute as the state courts
read it ... The pinch of the statute is in its application. It is that question which the petitioner has brought here
...

But it is said that throughout the appellate proceedings the Illinois courts assumed that the only conduct pun-
ishable and punished under the ordinance was conduct constituting `fighting words.' That emphasizes, how-
ever, the importance of the rule of the Stromberg case. Petitioner was not convicted under a statute so narrowly
construed. For all anyone knows he was convicted under the parts of the ordinance (as construed) which, for
example, make it an offense merely to invite dispute or to bring about a condition of unrest. We cannot avoid
that issue by saying that all Illinois did was to measure petitioner's conduct, not the ordinance, against the Con-
stitution. Petitioner raised both points that his speech was protected by the constitution; that the inclusion of
his speech within the ordinance was a violation of the Constitution. We would, therefore, strain at technicalities
§                                                                                                   DEFINING DANGER AND SPEECH | 279

to conclude that the constitutionality of the ordinance as construed and applied to petitioner was not before the
Illinois courts. The record makes clear that petitioner at all times challenged the constitutionality of the ordi-
nance as construed and applied to him.

Reversed.

Mr. Chief Justice Vinson announced the judgment of the Court.

Petitioners were indicted in July, 1948, for violation of the conspiracy provisions of the Smith Act, during the
period of April, 1945, to July, 1948. The pretrial motion to quash the indictment on the grounds, inter alia, that
the statute was unconstitutional was denied. A verdict of guilty as to all the petitioners was returned by the jury.
The Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions. We granted certiorari, limited to the following two questions:
(1) Whether either § 2 or § 3 of the Smith Act, inherently or as construed and applied in the instant case, vio-
lates the First Amendment and other provisions of the Bill of Rights; (2) whether either § 2 or § 3 of the Act,
inherently or as construed and applied in the instant case, violates the First and Fifth Amendments because of
indefiniteness.

Sections 2 and 3 of the Smith Act, 54 Stat. 671, 18 U. S. C. (1946 ed.) §§ 10, 11 (see present 18 U. S. C. § 2385),
provide as follows:

"SEC. 2. (a) It shall be unlawful for any person--

"(1) to knowingly or willfully advocate, abet, advise, or teach the duty, necessity, desirability, or propriety of
overthrowing or destroying any government in the United States by force or violence, or by the assassination of
any officer of any such government;
280 | DEFINING DANGER AND SPEECH

"(2) with intent to cause the overthrow or destruction of any government in the United States, to print, publish,
edit, issue, circulate, sell, distribute, or publicly display any written or printed matter advocating, advising, or
teaching the duty, necessity, desirability, or propriety of overthrowing or destroying any government in the
United States by force or violence;

"(3) to organize or help to organize any society, group, or assembly of persons who teach, advocate, or encourage
the overthrow or destruction of any government in the United States by force or violence; or to be or become a
member of, or affiliate with, any such society, group, or assembly of persons, knowing the purposes thereof.

"(b) For the purposes of this section, the term `government in the United States' means the Government of the
United States, the government of any State, Territory, or possession of the United States, the government of the
District of Columbia, or the government of any political subdivision of any of them.

"SEC. 3. It shall be unlawful for any person to attempt to commit, or to conspire to commit, any of the acts
prohibited by the provisions of this title."

The indictment charged the petitioners with willfully and knowingly conspiring (1) to organize as the Commu-
nist Party of the United States of America a society, group and assembly of persons who teach and advocate the
overthrow and destruction of the Government of the United States by force and violence, and (2) knowingly
and willfully to advocate and teach the duty and necessity of overthrowing and destroying the Government of
the United States by force and violence. The indictment further alleged that § 2 of the Smith Act proscribes these
acts and that any conspiracy to take such action is a violation of § 3 of the Act.

The trial of the case extended over nine months, six of which were devoted to the taking of evidence, resulting
in a record of 16,000 pages ... Whether, on this record, the petitioners did, in fact advocate the overthrow of the
Government ... is not before us, and we must base any discussion of this point upon the conclusions states in the
opinion in the Court of Appeals ... That court held the record in this case amply supports the necessary finding
of the jury that petitioners, were unwilling to work within our framework of democracy ...

...

The obvious purpose of the statute is to protect existing Government not from change by peaceable, lawful
and constitutional means, but from change by violence, revolution and terrorism. That it is within the power
of the Congress to protect the Government of the United States from armed rebellion is a proposition which
requires little discussion. Whatever theoretical merit there may be to the argument that there is a "right" to rebel-
lion against dictatorial governments is without force where the existing structure of the government provides
for peaceful and orderly change. We reject any principle of governmental helplessness in the face of preparation
for revolution, which principle, carried to its logical conclusion, must lead to anarchy. No one could conceive
that it is not within the power of Congress to prohibit acts intended to overthrow the Government by force and
violence. The question with which we are concerned here is not whether Congress has such power, but whether
the means which it has employed conflict with the First and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution.
                                                                                                    DEFINING DANGER AND SPEECH | 281

One of the bases for the contention that the means which Congress has employed are invalid takes the form of
an attack on the face of the statute on the grounds that, by its terms, it prohibits academic discussion of the mer-
its of Marxism-Leninism, that it stifles ideas and is contrary to all concepts of a free speech and a free press.

... The very language of the Smith Act negates the interpretation which petitioners would have us impose on that
Act. It is directed at advocacy, not discussion. Thus, the trial judge properly charged the jury that they could not
convict if they found that petitioners did "no more than pursue peaceful studies and discussions or teaching and
advocacy in the realm of ideas." He further charged that it was not unlawful "to conduct in an American college
or university a course explaining the philosophical theories set forth in the books which have been placed in evi-
dence." Such a charge is in strict accord with the statutory language, and illustrates the meaning to be placed on
those words. Congress did not intend to eradicate the free discussion of political theories, to destroy the tradi-
tional rights of Americans to discuss and evaluate ideas without fear of governmental sanction. Rather Congress
was concerned with the very kind of activity in which the evidence showed these petitioners engaged.

But although the statute is not directed at the hypothetical cases which petitioners have conjured, its application
in this case has resulted in convictions for the teaching and advocacy of the overthrow of the Government by
force and violence, which, even though coupled with the intent to accomplish that overthrow, contains an ele-
ment of speech. For this reason, we must pay special heed to the demands of the First Amendment marking out
the boundaries of speech ...

No important case involving free speech was decided by this Court prior to Schenck v. United States (1919).
Indeed, the summary treatment accorded an argument based upon an individual's claim that the First Amend-
ment protected certain utterances indicates that the Court at earlier dates placed no unique emphasis upon that
right. It was not until the classic dictum of Justice Holmes in the Schenck Case that speech per se received that
emphasis in a majority opinion ...

The next important case before the Court in which free speech was the crux of the conflict was Gitlow v. New
York (1925) ... Its reasoning was as follows: The "clear and present danger" test was applied to the utterance itself
in Schenck because the question was merely one of sufficiency of evidence under an admittedly constitutional
statute. Gitlow, however, presented a different question. There a legislature had found that a certain kind of
speech was, itself, harmful and unlawful. The constitutionality of such a state statute had to be adjudged by this
Court just as it determined the constitutionality of any state statute, namely, whether the statute was "reason-
able." Since it was entirely reasonable for a state to attempt to protect itself from violent overthrow, the statute
was perforce reasonable. The only question remaining in the case became whether there was evidence to support
the conviction, a question which gave the majority no difficulty. Justices Holmes and Brandeis refused to accept
this approach, but insisted that wherever speech was the evidence of the violation, it was necessary to show that
the speech created the "clear and present danger" of the substantive evil which the legislature had the right to
prevent ...

... [T]here is little doubt that subsequent opinions have inclined toward the Holmes-Brandeis rationale ... But
we further suggested that neither Justice Holmes nor Justice Brandeis ever envisioned that a shorthand phrase
should be crystallized into a rigid rule to be applied inflexibly without regard to the circumstances of each case.
282 | DEFINING DANGER AND SPEECH

Speech is not an absolute, above and beyond control by the legislature when its judgment, subject to review here,
is that certain kinds of speech are so undesirable as to warrant criminal sanction. Nothing is more certain in
modern society than the principle that there are no absolutes, that a name, a phrase, a standard has meaning only
when associated with the considerations which gave birth to the nomenclature. To those who would paralyze
our Government in the face of impending threat by encasing it in a semantic straitjacket we must reply that all
concepts are relative.

In this case we are squarely presented with the application of the "clear and present danger" test, and must decide
what that phrase imports. We first note that many of the cases in which this Court has reversed convictions by
use of this or similar tests have been based on the fact that the interest which the State was attempting to protect
was itself too insubstantial to warrant restriction of speech. * * * Overthrow of the Government by force and vio-
lence is certainly a substantial enough interest for the Government to limit speech. Indeed, this is the ultimate
value of any society, for if a society cannot protect its very structure from armed internal attack, it must follow
that no subordinate value can be protected. If, then, this interest may be protected, the literal problem which is
presented is what has been meant by the use of the phrase "clear and present danger" of the utterances bringing
about the evil within the power of Congress to punish.

Obviously, the words cannot mean that before the Government may act, it must wait until the putsch is about
to be executed, the plans have been laid and the signal is awaited. If Government is aware that a group aiming at
its overthrow is attempting to indoctrinate its members and to commit them to a course whereby they will strike
when the leaders feel the circumstances permit, action by the Government is required ... Certainly an attempt to
overthrow the Government by force, even though doomed from the outset because of inadequate numbers of
power of the revolutionists, is a sufficient evil for Congress to prevent. The damage which such attempts create
both physically and politically to a nation makes it impossible to measure the validity in terms of the probability
of success, or the immediacy of a successful attempt ... We must therefore reject the contention that success or
probability of success is the criterion.

... It is the existence of the conspiracy which creates the danger. If the ingredients of the reaction are present, we
cannot bind the Government to wait until the catalyst is added.

Affirmed.

Mr. Justice Frankfurter, concurring in affirmance of the judgment.

... But even the all-embracing power and duty of self-preservation are not absolute. Like the war power, which
is indeed an aspect of the power of self-preservation, it is subject to applicable constitutional limitations. Our
Constitution has no provision lifting restrictions upon governmental authority during periods of emergency,
although the scope of a restriction may depend on the circumstances in which it is invoked.

The First Amendment is such a restriction. It exacts obedience even during periods of war; it is applicable when
war clouds are not figments of the imagination no less than when they are.
                                                                                                    DEFINING DANGER AND SPEECH | 283

... The right of a man to think what he pleases, to write what he thinks, and to have his thoughts made available
for others to hear or read has an engaging ring of universality. The Smith Act and this conviction under it no
doubt restrict the exercise of free speech and assembly. Does that, without more, dispose of the matter?

Just as there are those who regard as invulnerable every measure for which the claim of national survival is
invoked, there are those who find in the Constitution a wholly unfettered right of expression. Such literalness
treats the words of the Constitution as though they were found on a piece of outworn parchment instead of
being words that have called into being a nation with a past to be preserved for the future. * * *

The language of the First Amendment is to be read not as barren words found in a dictionary but as symbols of
historic experience illuminated by the presuppositions of those who employed them. Not what words did Madi-
son and Hamilton use, but what was it in their minds which they conveyed? Free speech is subject to prohibition
of those abuses of expression which a civilized society may forbid. As in the case of every other provision of the
Constitution that is not crystallized by the nature of its technical concepts, the fact that the First Amendment is
not self-defining and self-enforcing neither impairs its usefulness nor compels its paralysis as a living instrument.

... The demands of free speech in a democratic society as well as the interest in national security are better served
by candid and informed weighing of the competing interests, within the confines of the judicial process, than by
announcing dogmas too inflexible for the non-Euclidian problems to be solved.

But how are competing interests to be assessed? Since they are not subject to quantitative ascertainment, the
issue necessarily resolves itself into asking, who is to make the adjustment?--who is to balance the relevant fac-
tors and ascertain which interest is in the circumstances to prevail? Full responsibility for the choice cannot be
given to the courts. Courts are not representative bodies. They are not designed to be a good reflex of a democra-
tic society. Their judgment is best informed, and therefore most dependable, within narrow limits. Their essen-
tial quality is detachment, founded on independence. History teaches that the independence of the judiciary
is jeopardized when courts become embroiled in the passions of the day and assume primary responsibility in
choosing between competing political, economic and social pressures.

... But in no case has a majority of this Court held that a legislative judgment, even as to freedom of utterance,
may be overturned merely because the Court would have made a different choice between the competing inter-
ests had the initial legislative judgment been for it to make ... Even though advocacy of overthrow deserves little
protection, we should hesitate to prohibit it if we thereby inhibit the interchange of rational ideas so essential to
representative government and free society ...

Mr. Justice Black, dissenting.

* * * At the outset I want to emphasize what the crime involved in this case is, and what it is not. These petitioners
were not charged with an attempt to overthrow the Government. They were not charged with overt acts of any
kind designed to overthrow the Government. They were not even charged with saying anything or writing any-
thing designed to overthrow the Government. The charge was that they agreed to assemble and to talk and pub-
lish certain ideas at a later date: The indictment is that they conspired to organize the Communist Party and to
use speech or newspapers and other publications in the future to teach and advocate the forcible overthrow of
§284 | DEFINING DANGER AND SPEECH

the Government. No matter how it is worded, this is a virulent form of prior censorship of speech and press,
which I believe the First Amendment forbids. I would hold § 3 of the Smith Act authorizing this prior restraint
unconstitutional on its face and as applied.

... The opinions for affirmance indicate that the chief reason for jettisoning the rule is the expressed fear that
advocacy of Communist doctrine endangers the safety of the Republic. Undoubtedly, a governmental policy
of unfettered communication of ideas does entail dangers. To the Founders of this Nation, however, the bene-
fits derived from free expression were worth the risk. They embodied this philosophy in the First Amendment's
command that "Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press. ..." I have always
believed that the First Amendment is the keystone of our Government, that the freedoms it guarantees provide
the best insurance against destruction of all freedom. At least as to speech in the realm of public matters, I believe
that the "clear and present danger" test does not "mark the furthermost constitutional boundaries of protected
expression" but does "no more than recognize a minimum compulsion of the Bill of Rights."

...

Public opinion being what it now is, few will protest the conviction of these Communist petitioners. There is
hope, however, that in calmer times, when present pressures, passions and fears subside, this or some later Court
will restore the First Amendment liberties to the high preferred place where they belong in a free society.

Mr. Chief Justice VINSON delivered the opinion of the Court.

Petitioner was convicted of the offense of disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor under the New York penal laws
... and was sentenced to thirty days in the county penitentiary. The conviction was affirmed by the Onondaga
County Court and the New York Court of Appeals ... The case is here on certiorari ... petitioner having claimed
that the conviction is in violation of his right of free speech under the Fourteenth Amendment.
                                                                                                    DEFINING DANGER AND SPEECH | 285

... On the evening of March 8, 1949, petitioner Irving Feiner was addressing an open-air meeting ... At approx-
imately 6:30 p.m., the police received a telephone complaint concerning the meeting, and two officers were
detailed to investigate. One of these officers went to the scene immediately, the other arriving some twelve min-
utes later. They found a crowd of about seventy-five or eighty people, both Negro and white, filling the sidewalk
and spreading out into the street. Petitioner, standing on a large wooden box on the sidewalk, was addressing
the crowd through a loud-speaker system attached to an automobile. Although the purpose of his speech was
to urge his listeners to attend a meeting to be held that night in the Syracuse Hotel, in its course he was making
derogatory remarks concerning President Truman, the American Legion, the Mayor of Syracuse, and other local
political officials.

The police officers made no effort to interfere with petitioner's speech, but were first concerned with the effect
of the crowd on both pedestrian and vehicular traffic. They observed the situation from the opposite side of the
street, noting that some pedestrians were forced to walk in the street to avoid the crowd. Since traffic was passing
at the time, the officers attempted to get the people listening to petitioner back on the sidewalk. The crowd was
restless and there was some pushing, shoving and milling around. One of the officers telephoned the police sta-
tion from a nearby store, and then both policemen crossed the street and mingled with the crowd without any
intention of arresting the speaker.

At this time, petitioner was speaking in a `loud, high-pitched voice.' He gave the impression that he was endeav-
oring to arouse the Negro people against the whites, urging that they rise up in arms and fight for equal rights.
The statements before such a mixed audience `stirred up a little excitement.' Some of the onlookers made
remarks to the police about their inability to handle the crowd and at least one threatened violence if the police
did not act. There were others who appeared to be favoring petitioner's arguments. Because of the feeling that
existed in the crowd both for and against the speaker, the officers finally `stepped in to prevent it from resulting
in a fight.' One of the officers approached the petitioner, not for the purpose of arresting him, but to get him to
break up the crowd. He asked petitioner to get down off the box, but the latter refused to accede to his request
and continued talking. The officer waited for a minute and then demanded that he cease talking. Although the
officer had thus twice requested petitioner to stop over the course of several minutes, petitioner not only ignored
him but continued talking. During all this time, the crowd was pressing closer around petitioner and the officer.
Finally, the officer told petitioner he was under arrest and ordered him to get down from the box, reaching up
to grab him. Petitioner stepped down, announcing over the microphone that `the law has arrived, and I suppose
they will take over now.' In all, the officer had asked petitioner to get down off the box three times over a space
of four or five minutes. Petitioner had been speaking for over a half hour.

On these facts, petitioner was specifically charged with violation of § 722 of the Penal Law of New York,
Mc.K.Consol. Laws, c. 40 ... The bill of particulars, demanded by petitioner and furnished by the State, gave
in detail the facts upon which the prosecution relied to support the charge of disorderly conduct. Paragraph
C is particularly pertinent here: `By ignoring and refusing to heed and obey reasonable police orders issued at
the time and place mentioned in the Information to regulate and control said crowd and to prevent a breach or
breaches of the peace and to prevent injury to pedestrians attempting to use said walk, and being forced into the
highway adjacent to the place in question, and prevent injury to the public generally.'
286 | DEFINING DANGER AND SPEECH

We are not faced here with blind condonation by a state court of arbitrary police action. Petitioner was accorded
a full, fair trial. The trial judge heard testimony supporting and contradicting the judgment of the police officers
that a clear danger of disorder was threatened. After weighing this contradictory evidence, the trial judge reached
the conclusion that the police officers were justified in taking action to prevent a breach of the peace. The exercise
of the police officers' proper discretionary power to prevent a breach of the peace was thus approved by the trial
court and later by two courts on review. The courts below recognized petitioner's right to hold a street meeting
at this locality, to make use of loud-speaking equipment in giving his speech, and to make derogatory remarks
concerning public officials and the American Legion. They found that the officers in making the arrest were
motivated solely by a proper concern for the preservation of order and protection of the general welfare, and that
there was no evidence which could lend color to a claim that the acts of the police were a cover for suppression of
petitioner's views and opinions. Petitioner was thus neither arrested nor convicted for the making or the content
of his speech. Rather, it was the reaction which it actually engendered.

The language of Cantwell v. State of Connecticut, (1940), is appropriate here.

`The offense known as breach of the peace embraces a great variety of conduct destroying or menacing public
order and tranquility. It includes not only violent acts but acts and words likely to produce violence in others.
On one would have the hardihood to suggest that the principle of freedom of speech sanctions incitement to
riot or that religious liberty connotes the privilege to exhort others to physical attack upon those belonging to
another sect. When clear and present danger of riot, disorder, interference with traffic upon the public streets,
or other immediate threat to public safety, peace, or order, appears, the power of the State to prevent or punish
is obvious.'

The findings of the New York courts as to the condition of the crowd and the refusal of petitioner to obey the
police requests, supported as they are by the record of this case, are persuasive that the conviction of petitioner
for violation of public peace, order and authority does not exceed the bounds of proper state police action. This
Court respects, as it must, the interest of the community in maintaining peace and order on its streets ... We can-
not say that the preservation of that interest here encroaches on the constitutional rights of this petitioner.

We are well aware that the ordinary murmurings and objections of a hostile audience cannot be allowed to
silence a speaker, and are also mindful of the possible danger of giving overzealous police officials complete dis-
cretion to break up otherwise lawful public meetings. `A State may not unduly suppress free communication of
views, religious or other, under the guise of conserving desirable conditions.' Cantwell v. State of Connecticut.
But we are not faced here with such a situation. It is one thing to say that the police cannot be used as an
instrument for the suppression of unpopular views, and another to say that, when as here the speaker passes the
bounds of argument or persuasion and undertakes incitement to riot, they are powerless to prevent a breach of
the peace. Nor in this case can we condemn the considered judgment of three New York courts approving the
means which the police, faced with a crisis, used in the exercise of their power and duty to preserve peace and
order.
§                                                                                                   DEFINING DANGER AND SPEECH | 287

The findings of the state courts as to the existing situation and the imminence of greater disorder coupled with
petitioner's deliberate defiance of the police officers convince us that we should not reverse this conviction in the
name of free speech.

Affirmed.

Opinion for the Court.

The appellant, a leader of a Ku Klux Klan group, was convicted under the Ohio Criminal Syndicalism statute for
"advocat[ing] ... the duty, necessity, or propriety of crime, sabotage, violence, or unlawful methods of terrorism
as a means of accomplishing industrial or political reform" and for "voluntarily assembl[ing] with any society,
group, or assemblage of persons formed to teach or advocate the doctrines of criminal syndicalism." Ohio Rev.
Code Ann. § 2923.13. He was fined $1,000 and sentenced to one to 10 years' imprisonment. The appellant chal-
lenged the constitutionality of the criminal syndicalism statute under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to
the United States Constitution, but the intermediate appellate court of Ohio affirmed his conviction without
opinion ... Appeal was taken to this Court, and we noted probable jurisdiction. We reverse.

The record shows that a man, identified at trial as the appellant, telephoned an announcer-reporter on the staff
of a Cincinnati television station and invited him to come to a Ku Klux Klan "rally" to be held at a farm in
Hamilton County. With the cooperation of the organizers, the reporter and a cameraman attended the meeting
and filmed the events. Portions of the films were later broadcast on the local station and on a national network.

The prosecution's case rested on the films and on testimony identifying the appellant as the person who com-
municated with the reporter and who spoke at the rally ...

One film showed 12 hooded figures, some of whom carried firearms. They were gathered around a large wooden
cross, which they burned. No one was present other than the participants and the newsmen who made the film.

Most of the words uttered during the scene were incomprehensible when the film was projected, but scattered
phrases could be understood that were derogatory of Negroes and, in one instance, of Jews. Another scene on
the same film showed the appellant, in Klan regalia, making a speech. The speech, in full, was as follows:

"This is an organizers' meeting. We have had quite a few members here today which are--we have hundreds,
hundreds of members throughout the State of Ohio. I can quote from a newspaper clipping from the Colum-
bus, Ohio Dispatch, five weeks ago Sunday morning. The Klan has more members in the State of Ohio than
does any other organization. We're not a revengent organization, but if our President, our Congress, our
Supreme Court, continues to suppress the white, Caucasian race, it's possible that there might have to be some
revengeance taken.

"We are marching on Congress July the Fourth, four hundred thousand strong. From there we are dividing into
two groups, one group to march on St. Augustine, Florida, the other group to march into Mississippi. Thank
you."

The second film showed six hooded figures one of whom, later identified as the appellant, repeated a speech very
similar to that recorded on the first film. The reference to the possibility of "revengeance" was omitted, and one
sentence was added: "Personally, I believe the nigger should be returned to Africa, the Jew returned to Israel."
Though some of the figures in the films carried weapons, the speaker did not.

... [L]ater decisions have fashioned the principle that the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press
do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such
advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such
action ..."the mere abstract teaching ... of the moral propriety or even moral necessity for a resort to force and
violence, is not the same as preparing a group for violent action and steeling it to such action." A statute which
fails to draw this distinction impermissibly intrudes upon the freedoms guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth
Amendments. It sweeps within its condemnation speech which our Constitution has immunized from govern-
mental control.

Measured by this test, Ohio's Criminal Syndicalism Act cannot be sustained. The Act punishes persons who
"advocate or teach the duty, necessity, or propriety" of violence "as a means of accomplishing industrial or politi-
cal reform"; or who publish or circulate or display any book or paper containing such advocacy; or who "justify"
the commission of violent acts "with intent to exemplify, spread or advocate the propriety of the doctrines of
criminal syndicalism"; or who "voluntarily assemble" with a group formed "to teach or advocate the doctrines
of criminal syndicalism." Neither the indictment nor the trial judge's instructions to the jury in any way refined
the statute's bald definition of the crime in terms of mere advocacy not distinguished from incitement to immi-
nent lawless action.

Accordingly, we are here confronted with a statute which, by its own words and as applied, purports to punish
mere advocacy and to forbid, on pain of criminal punishment, assembly with others merely to advocate the
described type of action. Such a statute falls within the condemnation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
The contrary teaching of Whitney v. California, cannot be supported, and that decision is therefore overruled.

Hess v. Indiana

414 U.S. 105 (1973)

    Per Curiam Opinion for the Court. Justice Rehnquist Filed a dissenting opinion, in which the Chief Justice
    and Justice Blackmun joined.

Per Curiam Opinion for the Court.

Gregory Hess appeals from his conviction in the Indiana courts for violating the State's disorderly conduct
statute. Appellant contends that his conviction should be reversed because the statute is unconstitutionally
vague, because the statute is overbroad in that it forbids activity that is protected under the First and Fourteenth
Amendments, and because the statute, as applied here, abridged his constitutionally protected freedom of
speech. These contentions were rejected in the City Court, where Hess was convicted, and in the Superior
Court, which reviewed his conviction. The Supreme Court of Indiana, with one dissent, considered and rejected
each of Hess' constitutional contentions, and accordingly affirmed his conviction.

The events leading to Hess' conviction began with an antiwar demonstration on the campus of Indiana Univer-
sity. In the course of the demonstration, approximately 100 to 150 of the demonstrators moved onto a public
street and blocked the passage of vehicles. When the demonstrators did not respond to verbal directions from
the sheriff to clear the street, the sheriff and his deputies began walking up the street, and the demonstrators in
their path moved to the curbs on either side, joining a large number of spectators who had gathered. Hess was
standing off the street as the sheriff passed him. The sheriff heard Hess utter the word "fuck" in what he later
described as a loud voice and immediately arrested him on the disorderly conduct charge. It was later stipulated
that what appellant had said was "We'll take the fucking street later," or "We'll take the fucking street again."
Two witnesses who were in the immediate vicinity testified, apparently without contradiction, that they heard
Hess' words and witnessed his arrest. They indicated that Hess did not appear to be exhorting the crowd to go
back into the street, that he was facing the crowd and not the street when he uttered the statement, that his state-
ment did not appear to be addressed to any particular person or group, and that his tone, although loud, was no
louder than that of the other people in the area.
290 | DEFINING DANGER AND SPEECH

Indiana's disorderly conduct statute was applied in this case to punish only spoken words. It hardly needs repeat-
ing that "[t]he constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech forbid the States to punish the use of words or
language not within `narrowly limited classes of speech.'"

The words here did not fall within any of these "limited classes." In the first place, it is clear that the Indiana
court specifically abjured any suggestion that Hess' words could be punished as obscene ... Indeed, after Cohen v.
California, such a contention with regard to the language at issue would not be tenable. By the same token, any
suggestion that Hess' speech amounted to "fighting words," could not withstand scrutiny. Even if under other
circumstances this language could be regarded as a personal insult, the evidence is undisputed that Hess' state-
ment was not directed to any person or group in particular ... Thus, under our decisions, the State could not
punish this speech as "fighting words."

...

The Indiana Supreme Court placed primary reliance on the trial court's finding that Hess' statement "was
intended to incite further lawless action on the part of the crowd in the vicinity of appellant and was likely to
produce such action." At best, however, the statement could be taken as counsel for present moderation; at
worst, it amounted to nothing more than advocacy of illegal action at some indefinite future time. This is not
sufficient to permit the State to punish Hess' speech. Under our decisions, "the constitutional guarantees of free
speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law viola-
tion except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to
incite or produce such action." Brandenburg v. Ohio, (1969). (Emphasis added.) Since the uncontroverted evi-
dence showed that Hess' statement was not directed to any person or group of persons, it cannot be said that
he was advocating, in the normal sense, any action. And since there was no evidence, or rational inference from
the import of the language, that his words were intended to produce, and likely to produce, imminent disorder,
those words could not be punished by the State on the ground that they had "a `tendency to lead to violence.'

Accordingly, the motion to proceed in forma pauperis granted and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Indi-
ana is reversed.

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, with whom the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Blackmun join, dissenting.

The Court's per curiam opinion rendered today aptly demonstrates the difficulties inherent in substituting a dif-
ferent complex of factual inferences for the inferences reached by the courts below. Since it is not clear to me that
the Court has a sufficient basis for its action, I dissent.

... The majority makes much of this "uncontroverted evidence," but I am unable to find anywhere in the opinion
an explanation of why it must be believed. Surely the sentence "We'll take the fucking street later (or again)" is
susceptible of characterization as an exhortation, particularly when uttered in a loud voice while facing a crowd.
The opinions of two defense witnesses cannot be considered proof to the contrary, since the trial court was per-
fectly free to reject this testimony if it so desired. Perhaps, as these witnesses and the majority opinion seem to
suggest, appellant was simply expressing his views to the world at large, but that is surely not the only rational
explanation.
                                                                                                    DEFINING DANGER AND SPEECH | 291

The majority also places great emphasis on appellant's use of the word "later," even suggesting at one point
that the statement "could be taken as counsel for present moderation." The opinion continues: "[A]t worst, it
amounted to nothing more than advocacy of illegal action at some indefinite future time." From that observa-
tion, the majority somehow concludes that the advocacy was not directed towards inciting imminent action.
But whatever other theoretical interpretations may be placed upon the remark, there are surely possible con-
structions of the statement which would encompass more or less immediate and continuing action against the
harassed police. They should not be rejected out of hand because of an unexplained preference for other accept-
able alternatives.

The simple explanation for the result in this case is that the majority has interpreted the evidence differently
from the courts below. In doing so, however, I believe the Court has exceeded the proper scope of our review.
Rather than considering the "evidence" in the light most favorable to the appellee and resolving credibility ques-
tions against the appellant, as many of our cases have required, the Court has instead fashioned its own version
of events from a paper record, some "uncontroverted evidence," and a large measure of conjecture. Since this is
not the traditional function of any appellate court, and is surely not a wise or proper use of the authority of this
Court, I dissent.

Stromberg v. People of the State of California

283 U.S. 359 (1931)

    Vote: 7-2
    Majority: Hughes, joined by Holmes, Van Devanter, Brandeis, Sutherland, Stone and Roberts
    Concur/dissent: McReynolds
    Dissent: Butler

Chief Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the Court.

The appellant was convicted in the superior court of San Bernardino county, California, for violation of section
403a of the Penal Code of that State. That section provides:

`Any person who displays a red flag, banner or badge or any flag, badge, banner, or device of any color or form
whatever in any public place or in any meeting place or public assembly, or from or on any house, building or
window as a sign, symbol or emblem of opposition to organized government or as an invitation or stimulus to
anarchistic action or as an aid to propaganda that is of a seditious character is guilty of a felony.'

The information, in its first count, charged that the appellant and other defendants, at the time and place set
forth, `did willfully, unlawfully and feloniously display a red flag and banner in a public place and in a meeting
place as a sign, symbol and emblem of opposition to organized government and as an invitation and stimulus to
anarchistic action and as an aid to propaganda that is and was of a seditious character.'

...

On the argument of a general demurrer to the information, the appellant contended, as was permitted by the
practice in California, that the statute was invalid because repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment of the
Federal Constitution. The demurrer was overruled, and the appellant pleaded not guilty. Conviction followed,
motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment were denied, and on appeal to the District Court of Appeal the
judgment was affirmed ... Petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court of California was denied, and an appeal
has been taken to this Court.

... It appears that the appellant, a young woman of nineteen, a citizen of the United States by birth, was one of
the supervisors of a summer camp for children, between ten and fifteen years of age, in the foothills of the San
Bernardino mountains ... Appellant was a member of the Young Communist League, an international organi-
zation affiliated with the Communist Party. The charge against her concerned a daily ceremony at the camp, in
which the appellant supervised and directed the children in raising a red flag, `a camp-made reproduction of the
flag of Soviet Russia, which was also the flag of the Communist Party in the United States.' In connection with
                                                                                                             SPEECH AND EXPRESSION | 293

the flag-raising, there was a ritual at which the children stood at salute and recited a pledge of allegiance `to the
workers' red flag, and to the cause for which it stands, one aim throughout our lives, freedom for the working
class.' ...

The charge in the information, as to the purposes for which the flag was raised, was laid conjunctively, uniting
the three purposes which the statute condemned. But in the instructions to the jury, the trial court followed the
express terms of the statute and treated the described purposes disjunctively, holding that the appellant should
be convicted if the flag was displayed for any one of the three purposes named. The instruction was as follows:

`In this connection you are instructed that if the jury should believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the defen-
dants, or either of them, displayed, or caused to be displayed, a red flag, banner, or badge, or any flag, badge,
banner, or device of any color or form whatever in any public place or in any meeting place, as charged in count
one of the information, and if you further believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that said flag,
badge, banner, or device was displayed, or caused to be displayed, as a sign, symbol, or emblem of opposition to
organized government, or was an invitation or stimulus to anarchistic action, or was in aid to propaganda that is
of a seditious character, you will find such defendants guilty as charged in count one of the information ... Proof,
beyond a reasonable doubt of any one or more of the three purposes alleged in said information is sufficient to
justify a verdict of guilty under count one of said information.'

... The opinions make it clear that the appellant insisted that, under the Fourteenth Amendment, the statute was
invalid as being `an unwarranted limitation on the right of free speech.'

... We are not left in doubt as to the construction placed by the state court upon each of the clauses of the statute.
The first purpose described, that is, relating to the display of a flag or banner `as a sign, symbol or emblem of
opposition to organized government,' is discussed by the two concurring justices. After referring, in the language
above quoted, to the constitutional question raised by the appellant with respect to this clause, these justices said
in their opinion:

`If opposition to organized government were the only act prohibited by this section, we might be forced to agree
with appellant ... With respect to the second purpose described in the statute, the display of a flag or banner `as
an invitation or stimulus to anarchistic action,' the concurring justices quoted accepted definitions and judicial
decisions as to the meaning of `anarchistic action.' These authorities, as set forth and approved in the opinion,
show clearly that the term was regarded by the state court as referring to the overthrow by force and violence of
the existing law and order, to the use of `unlawful, violent and felonious means to destroy property and human
life.' The conclusion was thus stated: `It is therefore clear that when section 403a of the Penal Code prohibits a
display of a red flag as an invitation or stimulus to anarchistic action it prohibits acts which have a well-defined
and well-settled meaning in the law of our land, a teaching which, if allowed to be put into force and effect,
would mean revolution in its most dreaded form.'

The state court further gave its interpretation of the third clause of the statute, that is, in relation to the display
of a flag or banner `as an aid to propaganda that is of a seditious character.' Both opinions dealt with the mean-
ing of this clause. Thus in one opinion it is said: `Appellants' counsel concedes that sedition laws which `interdict
against the use of force or violence' are consistently upheld by the courts, and all of the authorities cited by him
294 | SPEECH AND EXPRESSION

support that proposition ... `Sedition' is defined as the stirring up of disorder in the state, tending toward trea-
son, but lacking an overt act. Certainly the `advocacy of force or violence' in overturning the government of a
state falls within that definition.' The other opinion takes a similar view ...

Having reached these conclusions as to the meaning of the three clauses of the statute, and doubting the con-
stitutionality of the first clause, the state court rested its decision upon the remaining clauses. The basis of the
decision, as more fully stated in the opinion of the two concurring justices, was this: `The constitutionality of
the phrase of this section, `of opposition to organized government,' is questionable. This phrase can be elimi-
nated from the section without materially changing its purposes. The section is complete without it and with it
eliminated it can be upheld as a constitutional enactment by the Legislature of the State of California.' Accord-
ingly, disregarding the first clause of the statute, and upholding the other clauses, the conviction of the appellant
was sustained.

We are unable to agree with this disposition of the case. The verdict against the appellant was a general one. It
did not specify the ground upon which it rested. As there were three purposes set forth in the statute, and the
jury was instructed that their verdict might be given with respect to any one of them, independently considered,
it is impossible to say under which clause of the statute the conviction was obtained. If any one of these clauses,
which the state court has held to be separable, was invalid, it cannot be determined upon this record that the
appellant was not convicted under that clause. It may be added that this is far from being a merely academic
proposition, as it appears, upon an examination of the original record filed with this Court, that the State's attor-
ney upon the trial emphatically urged upon the jury that they could convict the appellant under the first clause
alone, without regard to the other clauses. It follows that instead of its being permissible to hold, with the state
court, that the verdict could be sustained if any one of the clauses of the statute were found to be valid, the nec-
essary conclusion from the manner in which the case was sent to the jury is that, if any of the clauses in question
is invalid under the Federal Constitution, the conviction cannot be upheld.

We are thus brought to the question whether any one of the three clauses, as construed by the state court, is upon
its face repugnant to the Federal Constitution so that it could not constitute a lawful foundation for a criminal
prosecution. The principles to be applied have been clearly set forth in our former decisions. It has been deter-
mined that the conception of liberty under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment embraces the
right of free speech. Gitlow v. New York, (1925). The right is not an absolute one, and the State in the exercise
of its police power may punish the abuse of this freedom. There is no question but that the State may thus pro-
vide for the punishment of those who indulge in utterances which incite to violence and crime and threaten the
overthrow of organized government by unlawful means. There is no constitutional immunity for such conduct
abhorrent to our institutions. Gitlow v. New York. We have no reason to doubt the validity of the second and
third clauses of the statute as construed by the state court to relate to such incitements to violence.

The question is thus narrowed to that of the validity of the first clause, that is, with respect to the display of the
flag `as a sign, symbol or emblem of opposition to organized government,' and the construction which the state
court has placed upon this clause removes every element of doubt. The state court recognized the indefiniteness
and ambiguity of the clause. The court considered that it might be construed as embracing conduct which the
State could not constitutionally prohibit. Thus it was said that the clause `might be construed to include the
§                                                                                                           SPEECH AND EXPRESSION | 295

peaceful and orderly opposition to a government as organized and controlled by one political party by those of
another political party equally high minded and patriotic, which did not agree with the one in power. It might
also be construed to include peaceful and orderly opposition to government by legal means and within constitu-
tional limitations.' The maintenance of the opportunity for free political discussion to the end that government
may be responsive to the will of the people and that changes may be obtained by lawful means, an opportunity
essential to the security of the Republic is a fundamental principle of our constitutional system. A statute which
upon its face, and as authoritatively construed, is so vague and indefinite as to permit the punishment of the fair
use of this opportunity is repugnant to the guarantee of liberty contained in the Fourteenth Amendment. The
first clause of the statute being invalid upon its face, the conviction of the appellant, which so far as the record
discloses may have rested upon that clause exclusively, must be set aside.

As for this reason the case must be remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion, and
other facts may be adduced in such proceedings ... Judgment reversed.

Minersville School Dist. et al. v. Gobitis et al.

310 U.S. 586 (1940)

    Vote: 8-1
    Majority: Frankfurter, joined by Hughes, McReynolds, Roberts, Black, Reed, Douglas and Murphy
    Dissent: Stone

Justice Frankfurter delivered the opinion of the Court

A grave responsibility confronts this Court whenever in course of litigation it must reconcile the conflicting
claims of liberty and authority. But when the liberty invoked is liberty of conscience, and the authority is author-
ity to safeguard the nation's fellowship, judicial conscience is put to its severest test. Of such a nature is the pre-
sent controversy.

Lillian Gobitis, aged twelve, and her brother William, aged ten, were expelled from the public schools ... for
refusing to salute the national flag as part of a daily school exercise ... The Gobitis family are affiliated with
`Jehovah's Witnesses', for whom the Bible as the Word of God is the supreme authority. The children had been
brought up conscientiously to believe that such a gesture of respect for the flag was forbidden by command of
scripture.

...
296 | SPEECH AND EXPRESSION

We must decide whether the requirement of participation in such a ceremony, exacted from a child who refuses
upon sincere religious grounds, infringes without due process of law the liberty guaranteed by the Fourteenth
Amendment ...

Situations like the present are phases of the profoundest problem confronting a democracy--the problem which
Lincoln cast in memorable dilemma: `Must a government of necessity be too strong for the liberties of its people,
or too weak to maintain its own existence?' No mere textual reading or logical talisman can solve the dilemma.
And when the issue demands judicial determination, it is not the personal notion of judges of what wise adjust-
ment requires which must prevail.

... The ultimate foundation of a free society is the binding tie of cohesive sentiment. Such a sentiment is fostered
by all those agencies of the mind and spirit which may serve to gather up the traditions of a people, transmit
them from generation to generation, and thereby create that continuity of a treasured common life which con-
stitutes a civilization. `We live by symbols.' The flag is the symbol of our national unity, transcending all internal
differences, however large, within the framework of the Constitution. This Court has had occasion to say that `*
* * the flag is the symbol of the nation's power,--the emblem of freedom in its truest, best sense. * * * it signifies
government resting on the consent of the governed; liberty regulated by law; the protection of the weak against
the strong; security against the exercise of arbitrary power; and absolute safety for free institutions against for-
eign aggression.' Halter v. Nebraska, (1907).

... The precise issue, then, for us to decide is whether the legislatures of the various states and the authorities in a
thousand counties and school districts of this country are barred from determining the appropriateness of vari-
ous means to evoke that unifying sentiment without which there can ultimately be no liberties, civil or religious.

... That the flag salute is an allowable portion of a school program for those who do not invoke conscientious
scruples is surely not debatable. But for us to insist that, though the ceremony may be required, exceptional
immunity must be given to dissidents, is to maintain that there is no basis for a legislative judgment that such an
exemption might introduce elements of difficulty into the school discipline, might cast doubts in the minds of
the other children which would themselves weaken the effect of the exercise.

...

Reversed.

West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette

319 U.S. 624 (1943)

    Vote: 6-3
    Majority: Jackson, joined by Stone, Black, Douglas, Murphy and Rutledge
    Dissent: Frankfurter, Reed and Roberts

Justice Jackson delivered the opinion of the Court.

Following the decision by this Court on June 3, 1940, in Minersville School District v. Gobitis, the West Virginia
legislature amended its statutes to require all schools therein to conduct courses of instruction in history, civics,
and in the Constitutions of the United States and of the State "for the purpose of teaching, fostering and per-
petuating the ideals, principles and spirit of Americanism, and increasing the knowledge of the organization and
machinery of the government." * * *

The Board of Education on January 9, 1942, adopted a resolution containing recitals taken largely from the
Court's Gobitis Opinion and ordering that the salute to the flag become "a regular part of the program of activ-
ities in the public schools," that all teachers and pupils "shall be required to participate in the salute honoring
the Nation represented by the Flag; provided, however, that refusal to salute the Flag be regarded as an act of
insubordination, and shall be dealt with accordingly."

... Failure to conform is "insubordination" dealt with by expulsion. Readmission is denied by statute until com-
pliance. Meanwhile the expelled child is "unlawfully absent" and may be proceeded against as a delinquent. His
parents or guardians are liable to prosecution, and if convicted are subject to fine not exceeding $50 and jail term
not exceeding thirty days.

Appellees, citizens of the United States and of West Virginia, brought suit in the United States District Court
for themselves and others similarly situated asking its injunction to restrain enforcement of these laws and reg-
ulations against Jehovah's Witnesses. The Witnesses are an unincorporated body teaching that the obligation
imposed by law of God is superior to that of laws enacted by temporal government ... They consider that the flag
is an "image" within this command. For this reason they refuse to salute it.

Children of this faith have been expelled from school and are threatened with exclusion for no other cause. Offi-
cials threaten to send them to reformatories maintained for criminally inclined juveniles. Parents of such chil-
dren have been prosecuted and are threatened with prosecutions for causing delinquency.

* * *

This case calls upon us to reconsider a precedent decision, as the Court throughout its history often has been
required to do. Before Turning to the Gobitis Case, however, it is desirable to notice certain characteristics by
which this controversy is distinguished.
298 | SPEECH AND EXPRESSION

The freedom asserted by these appellees does not bring them into collision with rights asserted by any other indi-
vidual. It is such conflicts which most frequently require intervention of the State to determine where the rights
of one end and those of another begin. But the refusal of these persons to participate in the ceremony does not
interfere with or deny rights of others to do so. Nor is there any question in this case that their behavior is peace-
able and orderly. The sole conflict is between authority and rights of the individual. The State asserts power to
condition access to public education on making a prescribed sign and profession and at the same time to coerce
attendance by punishing both parent and child. The latter stand on a right of self-determination in matters that
touch individual opinion and personal attitude.

* * *

There is no doubt that, in connection with the pledges, the flag salute is a form of utterance. Symbolism is a
primitive but effective way of communicating ideas. The use of an emblem or flag to symbolize some system,
idea, institution, or personality, is a short cut from mind to mind ... Symbols of State often convey political ideas
just as religious symbols come to convey theological ones. Associated with many of these symbols are appropri-
ate gestures of acceptance or respect: a salute, a bowed or bared head, a bended knee ...

Over a decade ago Chief Justice Hughes led this Court in holding that the display of a red flag as a symbol of
opposition by peaceful and legal means to organized government was protected by the free speech guaranties of
the Constitution. Here it is the State that employs a flag as a symbol of adherence to government as presently
organized. It requires the individual to communicate by word and sign his acceptance of the political ideas it
thus bespeaks. Objection to this form of communication when coerced is an old one, well known to the framers
of the Bill of Rights ...

... here the power of compulsion is invoked without any allegation that remaining passive during a flag salute
ritual creates a clear and present danger that would justify an effort even to muffle expression. To sustain the
compulsory flag salute we are required to say that a Bill of Rights which guards the individual's right to speak his
own mind, left it open to public authorities to compel him to utter what is not in his mind.

Whether the First Amendment to the Constitution will permit officials to order observance of ritual of this
nature does not depend upon whether as a voluntary exercise we would think it to be good, bad or merely
innocuous ... Hence validity of the asserted power to force an American citizen publicly to profess any statement
of belief or to engage in any ceremony of assent to one, presents questions of power that must be considered
independently of any idea we may have as to the utility of the ceremony in question.

Nor does the issue as we see it turn on one's possession of particular religious views or the sincerity with which
they are held ...

The Gobitis Decision, however, assumed, as did the argument in that case and in this, that power exists in the
State to impose the flag salute discipline upon school children in general. The Court only examined and rejected
a claim based on religious beliefs of immunity from an unquestioned general rule. The question which under-

may be imposed upon the individual by official authority under powers committed to any political organization
under our Constitution. We examine rather than assume existence of this power and, against this broader defin-
ition of issues in this case, reexamine specific grounds assigned for the Gobitis Decision ...

We think these issues may be examined free of pressure or restraint growing out of such considerations.

...

... It is important to note that while it is the Fourteenth Amendment which bears directly upon the State it is the
more specific limiting principles of the First Amendment that finally govern this case.

Nor does our duty to apply the Bill of Rights to assertions of official authority depend upon our possession of
marked competence in the field where the invasion of rights occurs. True, the task of translating the majestic
generalities of the Bill of Rights, conceived as part of the pattern of liberal government in the eighteenth century,
into concrete restraints on officials dealing with the problems of the twentieth century, is one to disturb self-
confidence ... We cannot, because of modest estimates of our competence in such specialties as public education,
withhold the judgment that history authenticates as the function of this Court when liberty is infringed.

Lastly, and this is the very heart of the Gobitis Opinion, it reasons that "National unity is the basis of national
security," that the authorities have "the right to select appropriate means for its attainment," and hence reaches
the conclusion that such compulsory measures toward "national unity" are constitutional. Upon the verity of
this assumption depends our answer in this case.

The case is made difficult not because the principles of its decision are obscure but because the flag involved is
our own. Nevertheless, we apply the limitations of the Constitution with no fear that freedom to be intellectu-
ally and spiritually diverse or even contrary will disintegrate the social organization. To believe that patriotism
will not flourish if patriotic ceremonies are voluntary and spontaneous instead of a compulsory routine is to
make an unflattering estimate of the appeal of our institutions to free minds. We can have intellectual individual-
ism and the rich cultural diversities that we owe to exceptional minds only at the price of occasional eccentricity
and abnormal attitudes. When they are so harmless to others or to the State as those we deal with here, the price
is not too great. But freedom to differ is not limited to things that do not matter much. That would be a mere
shadow of freedom. The test of its substance is the right to differ as to things that touch the heart of the existing
order.

If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what
shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by
word or act their faith therein. If there are any circumstances which permit an exception, they do not now occur
to us.

We think the action of the local authorities in compelling the flag salute and pledge transcends constitutional
limitations on their power and invades the sphere of intellect and spirit which it is the purpose of the First
Amendment to our Constitution to reserve from all official control.

Giboney et al. v. Empire Storage & Ice Co.

336 U.S. 490 (1949)

    Vote: 9-0
    Majority: Black, joined by Reed, Frankfurter, Douglas, Murphy, Jackson, Rutledge, Burton and Vinson

Mr. Justice Black delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case here on appeal [...] raises questions concerning the constitutional power of a state to apply its antitrade
restraint law to labor union activities, and to enjoin union members from peaceful picketing carried on as an
essential and inseparable part of a course of conduct which is in violation of the state law. The picketing occurred
in Kansas City, Missouri. The injunction was issued by a Missouri state court.

The appellants are members and officers of the Ice and Coal Drivers and Handlers Local Union No. 953, affili-
ated with the American Federation of Labor. Its membership includes about 160 of 200 retail ice peddlers who
drive their own trucks in selling ice from door to door in Kansas City. The union began efforts to induce all
the nonunion peddlers to join. One objective of the organizational drive was to better wage and working con-
ditions of peddlers and their helpers. Most of the nonunion peddlers refused to join the union. To break down
their resistance the union adopted a plan which was designed to make it impossible for nonunion peddlers to
buy ice to supply their retail customers in Kansas City. Pursuant to the plan the union set about to obtain from
all Kansas City wholesale ice distributors agreements that they would not sell ice to nonunion peddlers. Agree-
ments were obtained from all distributors except the appellee, Empire Storage and Ice Company. Empire refused
to agree. The union thereupon informed Empire that it would use other means at its disposal to force Empire
to come around to the union view. Empire still refused to agree. Its place of business was promptly picketed by
union members although the only complaint registered against Empire, as indicated by placards carried by the
pickets, was its continued sale of ice to nonunion peddlers.

Thus the avowed immediate purpose of the picketing was to compel Empire to agree to stop selling ice to
nonunion peddlers. Missouri statutes, set out in note 1, make such an agreement a crime punishable by a fine of
                                                                                                             SPEECH AND EXPRESSION | 301

not more than $5,000 and by imprisonment in the penitentiary for not more than five years. Furthermore, had
Empire made the agreement, the ice peddlers could have brought actions for triple damages for any injuries they
sustained as a result of the agreement under § 8308 of the Missouri Revised Statutes 1939, Mo.R.S.A.

About 85% of the truck drivers working for Empire's customers were members of labor unions. These union
truck drivers refused to deliver goods to or from Empire's place of business. Had any one of them crossed the
picket line he would have been subject to fine or suspension by the union of which he was a member.

Because of the foregoing facts shown either by admissions, by undisputed evidence, or by unchallenged findings,
the picketing had an instantaneous adverse effect on Empire's business. It was reduced 85%. In this dilemma,
Empire was faced with three alternatives: It could continue to sell ice to nonunion peddlers, in which event it
would be compelled to wage a fight for survival against overwhelming odds; it could stop selling ice to nonunion
peddlers thereby relieving itself from further conflict with the union, in which event it would be subject to pros-
ecution for crime and suits for triple damages; it could invoke the protection of the law. The last alternative was
adopted.

Empire's complaint charged that the concerted efforts of union members to restrain Empire from selling to
nonunion members was a violation of the antitrade restraint statute and that an agreement by Empire to refuse
to make such sales would violate the same statute. It prayed for an injunction against the picketing. In answering,
appellants asserted a constitutional right to picket Empire's premises in order to force it to discontinue sale of
ice to nonunion peddlers. They contended that their right to do so was `guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth
Amendments' because there was `a labor dispute existing' between appellants and appellee, and because the pick-
eters publicized only the truthful information that appellee was `selling ice to peddlers who are not members of
the said defendant union.'

The trial court heard evidence, made findings and issued an injunction restraining the appellants from `placing
pickets or picketing around or about the buildings' of Empire.

The State Supreme Court affirmed ... It agreed with the findings of the trial court that the conduct of appellants
was pursuant to a local transportation combination used to compel Empire to stop selling ice to nonunion ped-
dlers and that the purpose of the picketing was to force Empire to become a party to such combination. It held
that such activities were unlawful because in violation of § 8301 of the Missouri statutes and further held that
the injunction to prevent picketing for such unlawful purpose did not contravene the appellants' right of free
speech.

... Attacking the Missouri statute as construed and applied, appellants broadly challenge the power of the state
to issue any injunction against their conduct since, they assert, the primary objective of their combination and
picketing was to improve wage and working conditions. On this premise they argue that their right to com-
bine, to picket, and to publish must be determined by focusing attention exclusively upon their lawful purpose
to improve labor conditions, and that their violation of the state antitrade restraint laws must be dismissed as
merely incidental to this lawful purpose.
302 | SPEECH AND EXPRESSION

First. States have constitutional power to prohibit competing dealers and their aiders and abettors from combin-
ing to restrain freedom of trade is beyond question ... There is nothing in the Constitution of the United States
which precludes a state from adopting and enforcing such policy ...

Second. It is contended that though the Missouri statute can be applied validly to combinations of businessmen
who agree not to sell to certain persons, it cannot be applied constitutionally to combinations of union workers
who agree in their self-interest to use their joint power to prevent sales to nonunion workers. This contention
appears to be grounded on the guaranties of freedom of speech and press stemming from the Fourteenth and
First Amendments. Aside from the element of disseminating information through peaceful picketers, later dis-
cussed, it is difficult to perceive how it could be thought that these constitutional guaranties afford labor union
members a peculiar immunity from laws against trade restraint combinations, unless, as appellants contend,
labor unions are given special constitutional protection denied all other people.

The objective of unions to improve wages and working conditions has sometimes commended itself to Congress
and to state legislatures. To the extent that the states or Congress, for this or other reasons, have seen fit to exempt
unions from antitrust laws, this Court has sustained legislative power to grant the exemptions ... On the other
hand where statutes have not granted exemptions, we have declared that violations of antitrust laws could not be
defended on the ground that a particular accused combination would not injure but would actually help manu-
facturers, laborers, retailers, consumers, or the public in general. Fashion Guild v. Trade Comm'n, (1941).

The foregoing holdings rest on the premise that legislative power to regulate trade and commerce includes the
power to determine what groups, if any, shall be regulated, and whether certain regulations will help or injure
businessmen, workers, and the public in general. In making this determination Missouri has decided to apply its
law without exception to all persons who combine to restrain freedom of trade. We are without constitutional
authority to modify or upset Missouri's determination that it is in the public interest to make combinations of
workers subject to laws designed to keep the channels of trade wholly free and open. To exalt all labor union con-
duct in restraint of trade above all state control would greatly reduce the traditional powers of states over their
domestic economy and might conceivably make it impossible for them to enforce their antitrade restraint laws.
Allen Bradley Co. v. Union, (1945).

Third. It is contended that the injunction against picketing adjacent to Empire's place of business is an uncon-
stitutional abridgment of free speech because the picketers were attempting peacefully to publicize truthful
facts about a labor dispute ... But the record here does not permit this publicizing to be treated in isolation.
For according to the pleadings, the evidence, the findings, and the argument of the appellants, the sole immedi-
ate object of the publicizing adjacent to the premises of Empire, as well as the other activities of the appellants
and their allies, was to compel Empire to agree to stop selling ice to nonunion peddlers. Thus all of appellants'
activities--their powerful transportation combination, their patrolling, their formation of a picket line warning
union men not to cross at peril of their union membership, their publicizing--constituted a single and inte-
grated course of conduct, which was in violation of Missouri's valid law. In this situation, the injunction did not
more than enjoin an offense against Missouri law, a felony.
                                                                                                            SPEECH AND EXPRESSION | 303

It rarely has been suggested that the constitutional freedom for speech and press extends its immunity to speech
or writing used as an integral part of conduct in violation of a valid criminal statute. We reject the contention
now. Nothing that was said or decided in any of the cases relied on by appellants calls for different holding ...

We think the circumstances here and the reasons advanced by the Missouri courts justify restraint of the pick-
eting which was done in violation of Missouri's valid law for the sole immediate purpose of continuing a vio-
lation of law. In holding this, we are mindful of the essential importance to our society of a vigilant protection
of freedom of speech and press. Bridges v. California, (1941). States cannot consistently with our Constitution
abridge those freedoms to obviate slight inconveniences or annoyances. Schneider v. State, (1939). But placards
used as an essential and inseparable part of a grave offense against an important public law cannot immunize that
unlawful conduct from state control. VA Electric Co. v. Board, (1943). Nor can we say that the publication here
should not have been restrained because of the possibility of separating the picketing conduct into illegal and
legal parts. Thomas v. Collins, (1945). For the placards were to effectuate the purposes of an unlawful combina-
tion, and their sole, unlawful immediate objective was to induce Empire to violate the Missouri law by acquiesc-
ing in unlawful demands to agree not to sell ice to nonunion peddlers. It is true that the agreements and course
of conduct here were as in most instances brought about through speaking or writing. But it has never been
deemed an abridgement of freedom of speech or press to make a course of conduct illegal merely because the
conduct was in part initiated, evidenced, or carried out by means of language, either spoken, written, or printed
... Such an expansive interpretation of the constitutional guaranties of speech and press would make it practi-
cally impossible ever to enforce laws against agreements in restraint of trade as well as many other agreements
and conspiracies deemed injurious to society.

The interest of Missouri in enforcement of its antitrust laws cannot be classified as an effort to outlaw only a
slight public inconvenience or annoyance. The Missouri policy against restraints of trade is of long standing and
is in most respects the same as that which the Federal Government has followed for more than half a century.
It is clearly drawn in an attempt to afford all persons an equal opportunity to buy goods. There was clear dan-
ger, imminent and immediate, that unless restrained, appellants would succeed in making that policy a dead
letter insofar as purchases by nonunion men were concerned. Appellants' power with that of their allies was irre-
sistible. And it is clear that appellants were doing more than exercising a right of free speech or press. Fox v. WA,
(1915). They were exercising their economic power together with that of their allies to compel Empire to abide
by union rather than by state regulation of trade.

...

While the State of Missouri is not a party in this case it is plain that the basic issue is whether Missouri or a
labor union has paramount constitutional power to regulate and govern the manner in which certain trade prac-
tices shall be carried on in Kansas City, Missouri. Missouri has by statute regulated trade one way. The appellant
union members have adopted a program to regulate it another way. The state has provided for enforcement of
its statutory rule by imposing civil and criminal sanctions. The union has provided for enforcement of its rule by
sanctions against union members who cross picket lines ... We hold that the state's power to govern in this field is
paramount, and that nothing in the constitutional guaranties of speech or press compels a state to apply or not
§304 | SPEECH AND EXPRESSION

to apply its antitrade restraint law to groups of workers, businessmen or others. Of course this Court does not
pass on the wisdom of the Missouri statute. We hold only that as here construed and applied it does not violate
the Federal Constitution.

United States v. O'Brien

391 U.S. 367 (1968)

    Vote: 7-1
    Majority: Warren, joined by Black, Warren, Harlan, Brennan, Stewart, White and Fortas
    Concurrence: Harlan
    Dissent: Douglas
    Not participating: Justice Marshall

Chief Justice Warren delivered the opinion of the Court.

On the morning of March 31, 1966, David Paul O'Brien and three companions burned their Selective Service
registration certificates on the steps of the South Boston Courthouse. A sizable crowd, including several agents
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, witnessed the event. Immediately after the burning, members of the
crowd began attacking O'Brien and his companions. An FBI agent ushered O'Brien to safety inside the cour-
thouse. After he was advised of his right to counsel and to silence, O'Brien stated to FBI agents that he had
burned his registration certificate because of his beliefs, knowing that he was violating federal law. He produced
the charred remains of the certificate, which, with his consent, were photographed.

For this act, O'Brien was indicted, tried, convicted, and sentenced in the United States District Court for the
District of Massachusetts. He did not contest the fact that he had burned the certificate. He stated in argument
to the jury that he burned the certificate publicly to influence others to adopt his antiwar beliefs, as he put it, "so
that other people would reevaluate their positions with Selective Service, with the armed forces, and reevaluate
their place in the culture of today, to hopefully consider my position."

The indictment upon which he was tried charged that he "willfully and knowingly did mutilate, destroy, and
change by burning ... [his] Registration Certificate (Selective Service System Form No. 2); in violation of Title
50, App., United States Code, Section 462 (b)." * * * [It had been] amended by Congress in 1965, 79 Stat. 586
(adding the words italicized below), so that at the time O'Brien burned his certificate an offense was committed
by any person, "who forges, alters, knowingly destroys, knowingly mutilates, or in any manner changes any such
certificate. ..." (Italics supplied.)
                                                                                                            SPEECH AND EXPRESSION | 305

In the District Court, O'Brien argued that the 1965 Amendment prohibiting the knowing destruction or muti-
lation of certificates was unconstitutional because it was enacted to abridge free speech, and because it served
no legitimate legislative purpose. The District Court rejected these arguments, holding that the statute on its
face did not abridge First Amendment rights, that the court was not competent to inquire into the motives of
Congress in enacting the 1965 Amendment, and that the Amendment was a reasonable exercise of the power of
Congress to raise armies.

On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held the 1965 Amendment unconstitutional as a law
abridging freedom of speech. * * * [This] decision conflicted with decisions by the Courts of Appeals for the Sec-
ond and Eighth Circuit Upholding the 1965 Amendment against identical constitutional challenges. * * * We
hold that the 1965 Amendment is constitutional both as enacted and as applied. * * *

When a male reaches the age of 18, he is required by the Universal Military Training and Service Act to register
with a local draft board. He is assigned a Selective Service number ... Subsequently, and based on a questionnaire
completed by the registrant, he is assigned a classification denoting his eligibility for induction, and "[a]s soon as
practicable" thereafter he is issued a Notice of Classification (SSS Form No. 110) ...

Both the registration and classification certificates are small white cards, approximately 2 by 3 inches. The reg-
istration certificate specifies the name of the registrant, the date of registration, and the number and address of
the local board with which he registered ... and his Selective Service number. The Selective Service number itself
indicates the State of registration, his local board, his year of birth, and his chronological position in the local
board's classification record.

...

Congress demonstrated its concern that certificates issued by the Selective Service System might be abused well
before the 1965 Amendment here challenged ...

By the 1965 Amendment, Congress added to § 12 (b) (3) of the 1948 Act the provision here at issue, subjecting
to criminal liability not only one who "forges, alters, or in any manner changes" but also one who "knowingly
destroys, [or] knowingly mutilates" a certificate. We note at the outset that the 1965 Amendment plainly does
not abridge free speech on its face, and we do not understand O'Brien to argue otherwise. Amended § 12 (b) (3)
on its face deals with conduct having no connection with speech. It prohibits the knowing destruction of certifi-
cates issued by the Selective Service System, and there is nothing necessarily expressive about such conduct. The
Amendment does not distinguish between public and private destruction, and it does not punish only destruc-
tion engaged in for the purpose of expressing views. A law prohibiting destruction of Selective Service certificates
no more abridges free speech on its face than a motor vehicle law prohibiting the destruction of drivers' licenses,
or a tax law prohibiting the destruction of books and records.

O'Brien nonetheless argues that the 1965 Amendment is unconstitutional in its application to him, and is
unconstitutional as enacted because what he calls the "purpose" of Congress was "to suppress freedom of
speech." We consider these arguments separately.
306 | SPEECH AND EXPRESSION

O'Brien first argues that the 1965 Amendment is unconstitutional as applied to him because his act of burning
his registration certificate was protected "symbolic speech" within the First Amendment. His argument is that
the freedom of expression which the First Amendment guarantees includes all modes of "communication of
ideas by conduct," and that his conduct is within this definition because he did it in "demonstration against the
war and against the draft."

We cannot accept the view that an apparently limitless variety of conduct can be labeled "speech" whenever the
person engaging in the conduct intends thereby to express an idea. However, even on the assumption that the
alleged communicative element in O'Brien's conduct is sufficient to bring into play the First Amendment, it
does not necessarily follow that the destruction of a registration certificate is constitutionally protected activity.
This Court has held that when "speech" and "nonspeech" elements are combined in the same course of con-
duct, a sufficiently important governmental interest in regulating the nonspeech element can justify incidental
limitations on First Amendment freedoms. To characterize the quality of the governmental interest which must
appear, the Court has employed a variety of descriptive terms: compelling; substantial; subordinating; para-
mount; cogent; strong. Whatever imprecision inheres in these terms, we think it clear that a government regula-
tion is sufficiently justified if it is within the constitutional power of the Government; if it furthers an important
or substantial governmental interest; if the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expres-
sion; and if the incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the
furtherance of that interest. We find that the 1965 Amendment to § 12 (b) (3) of the Universal Military Train-
ing and Service Act meets all of these requirements, and consequently that O'Brien can be constitutionally con-
victed for violating it.

The constitutional power of Congress to raise and support armies and to make all laws necessary and proper to
that end is broad and sweeping. * * * The issuance of certificates indicating the registration and eligibility classi-
fication of individuals is a legitimate and substantial administrative aid in the functioning of this system. And
legislation to insure the continuing availability of issued certificates serves a legitimate and substantial purpose
in the system's administration.

...

We think it apparent that the continuing availability to each registrant of his Selective Service certificates substan-
tially furthers the smooth and proper functioning of the system that Congress has established to raise armies. We
think it also apparent that the Nation has a vital interest in having a system for raising armies that functions with
maximum efficiency and is capable of easily and quickly responding to continually changing circumstances. For
these reasons, the Government has a substantial interest in assuring the continuing availability of issued Selective
Service certificates.

It is equally clear that the 1965 Amendment specifically protects this substantial governmental interest. We
perceive no alternative means that would more precisely and narrowly assure the continuing availability of
issued Selective Service certificates than a law which prohibits their willful mutilation or destruction. The 1965
Amendment prohibits such conduct and does nothing more. In other words, both the governmental interest
and the operation of the 1965 Amendment are limited to the noncommunicative aspect of O'Brien's conduct.
                                                                                                            SPEECH AND EXPRESSION | 307

The governmental interest and the scope of the 1965 Amendment are limited to preventing harm to the smooth
and efficient functioning of the Selective Service System. When O'Brien deliberately rendered unavailable his
registration certificate, he willfully frustrated this governmental interest. For this noncommunicative impact of
his conduct, and for nothing else, he was convicted.

...

In conclusion, we find that because of the Government's substantial interest in assuring the continuing avail-
ability of issued Selective Service certificates, because amended § 462 (b) is an appropriately narrow means of
protecting this interest and condemns only the independent noncommunicative impact of conduct within its
reach, and because the noncommunicative impact of O'Brien's act of burning his registration certificate frus-
trated the Government's interest, a sufficient governmental interest has been shown to justify O'Brien's convic-
tion.

O'Brien finally argues that the 1965 Amendment is unconstitutional as enacted because what he calls the "pur-
pose" of Congress was "to suppress freedom of speech." We reject this argument because under settled principles
the purpose of Congress, as O'Brien uses that term, is not a basis for declaring this legislation unconstitutional.

...

Since the 1965 Amendment to § 12 (b) (3) of the Universal Military Training and Service Act is constitutional
as enacted and as applied * * * we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and reinstate the judgment and
sentence of the District Court ...

It is so ordered.

Spence v. Washington

418 U.S. 405 (1974)

    Per Curiam
    Concurrence: Blackmun
    Concurrence: Douglas
    Dissent: Burger
    Dissent: Rehnquist, joined by Burger and White

Appellant displayed a United States flag, which he owned, out of the window of his apartment. Affixed to both
surfaces of the flag was a large peace symbol fashioned of removable tape. Appellant was convicted under a Wash-
ington statute forbidding the exhibition of a United States flag to which is attached or superimposed figures,
symbols, or other extraneous material. The Supreme Court of Washington affirmed appellant's conviction. It
rejected appellant's contentions that the statute under which he was charged, on its face and as applied, con-
travened the First Amendment, as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment, and was void for vagueness.
We noted probable jurisdiction. We reverse on the ground that as applied to appellant's activity the Washington
statute impermissibly infringed protected expression.

On May 10, 1970, appellant, a college student, hung his United States flag from the window of his apartment
on private property in Seattle, Washington. The flag was upside down, and attached to the front and back was a
peace symbol (i. e., a circle enclosing a trident) made of removable black tape. The window was above the ground
floor. The flag measured approximately three by five feet and was plainly visible to passersby. The peace symbol
occupied roughly half of the surface of the flag.

Three Seattle police officers observed the flag and entered the apartment house. They were met at the main door
by appellant, who said: "I suppose you are here about the flag. I didn't know there was anything wrong with
it. I will take it down." Appellant permitted the officers to enter his apartment, where they seized the flag and
arrested him. Appellant cooperated with the officers. There was no disruption or altercation.

Appellant was not charged under Washington's flag-desecration statute ... Rather, the State relied on the so-
called "improper use" statute, Wash. Rev. Code § 9.86.020. This statute provides, in pertinent part:

"No person shall, in any manner, for exhibition or display:

"(1) Place or cause to be placed any word, figure, mark, picture, design, drawing or advertisement of any nature
upon any flag, standard, color, ensign or shield of the United States or of this state ... or

"(2) Expose to public view any such flag, standard, color, ensign or shield upon which shall have been printed,
painted or otherwise produced, or to which shall have been attached, appended, affixed or annexed any such
word, figure, mark, picture, design, drawing or advertisement. ..."
                                                                                                            SPEECH AND EXPRESSION | 309

... [At trial] he testified that he put a peace symbol on the flag and displayed it to public view as a protest against
the invasion of Cambodia and the killings at Kent State University, events which occurred a few days prior to his
arrest. He said that his purpose was to associate the American flag with peace instead of war and violence:

"I felt there had been so much killing and that this was not what America stood for. I felt that the flag stood for
America and I wanted people to know that I thought America stood for peace."

Appellant further testified that he chose to fashion the peace symbol from tape so that it could be removed with-
out damaging the flag. The State made no effort to controvert any of appellant's testimony.

The trial court instructed the jury in essence that the mere act of displaying the flag with the peace symbol
attached, if proved beyond a reasonable doubt, was sufficient to convict. There was no requirement of specific
intent to do anything more than display the flag in that manner. The jury returned a verdict of guilty. The court
sentenced appellant to 10 days in jail, suspended, and to a $75 fine. The Washington Court of Appeals reversed
the conviction. It held the improper-use statute overbroad and invalid on its face under the First and Fourteenth
Amendments. With one justice dissenting and two concurring in the result, the Washington Supreme Court
reversed and reinstated the conviction.

A number of factors are important in the instant case. First, this was a privately owned flag. In a technical prop-
erty sense it was not the property of any government. We have no doubt that the State or National Governments
constitutionally may forbid anyone from mishandling in any manner a flag that is public property. But this is a
different case. Second, appellant displayed his flag on private property. He engaged in no trespass or disorderly
conduct. Nor is this a case that might be analyzed in terms of reasonable time, place, or manner restraints on
access to a public area. Third, the record is devoid of proof of any risk of breach of the peace. It was not appel-
lant's purpose to incite violence or even stimulate a public demonstration. There is no evidence that any crowd
gathered or that appellant made any effort to attract attention beyond hanging the flag out of his own window.
Indeed, on the facts stipulated by the parties there is no evidence that anyone other than the three police officers
observed the flag.

Fourth, the State concedes, as did the Washington Supreme Court, that appellant engaged in a form of com-
munication. Although the stipulated facts fail to show that any member of the general public viewed the flag,
the State's concession is inevitable on this record ... To be sure, appellant did not choose to articulate his views
through printed or spoken words. It is therefore necessary to determine whether his activity was sufficiently
imbued with elements of communication to fall within the scope of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, for
as the Court noted in United States v. O'Brien,"[w]e cannot accept the view that an apparently limitless variety
of conduct can be labeled `speech' whenever the person engaging in the conduct intends thereby to express an
idea." But the nature of appellant's activity, combined with the factual context and environment in which it was
undertaken, lead to the conclusion that he engaged in a form of protected expression.

The Court for decades has recognized the communicative connotations of the use of flags. In many of their uses
flags are a form of symbolism comprising a "primitive but effective way of communicating ideas ...," and "a short
310 | SPEECH AND EXPRESSION

cut from mind to mind." Board of Education v. Barnette (1943). On this record there can be little doubt that
appellant communicated through the use of symbols. The symbolism included not only the flag but also the
superimposed peace symbol.

Moreover, the context in which a symbol is used for purposes of expression is important, for the context may
give meaning to the symbol ... A flag bearing a peace symbol and displayed upside down by a student today might
be interpreted as nothing more than bizarre behavior, but it would have been difficult for the great majority of
citizens to miss the drift of appellant's point at the time that he made it.

It may be noted, further, that this was not an act of mindless nihilism. Rather, it was a pointed expression of
anguish by appellant about the then-current domestic and foreign affairs of his government. An intent to con-
vey a particularized message was present, and in the surrounding circumstances the likelihood was great that the
message would be understood by those who viewed it.

We are confronted then with a case of prosecution for the expression of an idea through activity ... Accordingly,
we must examine with particular care the interests advanced by appellee to support its prosecution.

* * * [The] state court's thesis [was] that Washington has an interest in preserving the national flag as an unalloyed
symbol of our country. The court did not define this interest; it simply asserted it. Mr. Justice Rehnquist's dis-
senting opinion today, adopts essentially the same approach. Presumably, this interest might be seen as an effort
to prevent the appropriation of a revered national symbol by an individual, interest group, or enterprise where
there was a risk that association of the symbol with a particular product or viewpoint might be taken erroneously
as evidence of governmental endorsement. Alternatively, it might be argued that the interest asserted by the state
court is based on the uniquely universal character of the national flag as a symbol. For the great majority of us,
the flag is a symbol of patriotism, of pride in the history of our country, and of the service, sacrifice, and valor of
the millions of Americans who in peace and war have joined together to build and to defend a Nation in which
self-government and personal liberty endure. It evidences both the unity and diversity which are America. For
others the flag carries in varying degrees a different message ... It might be said that we all draw something from
our national symbol, for it is capable of conveying simultaneously a spectrum of meanings. If it may be destroyed
or permanently disfigured, it could be argued that it will lose its capability of mirroring the sentiments of all who
view it.

But we need not decide in this case whether the interest advanced by the court below is valid. We assume,
arguendo, that it is. The statute is nonetheless unconstitutional as applied to appellant's activity. There was no
risk that appellant's acts would mislead viewers into assuming that the Government endorsed his viewpoint. To
the contrary, he was plainly and peacefully protesting the fact that it did not. Appellant was not charged under
the desecration statute nor did he permanently disfigure the flag or destroy it. He displayed it as a flag of his
country in a way closely analogous to the manner in which flags have always been used to convey ideas. More-
over, his message was direct, likely to be understood, and within the contours of the First Amendment. Given
the protected character of his expression and in light of the fact that no interest the State may have in preserving
the physical integrity of a privately owned flag was significantly impaired on these facts, the conviction must be
invalidated.
                           SPEECH AND EXPRESSION | 311

The judgment is reversed.

It is so ordered.

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, with whom The Chief Justice and Mr. Justice White join, dissenting.

... Although I agree with the Court that appellant's activity was a form of communication, I do not agree that
the First Amendment prohibits the State from restricting this activity in furtherance of other important inter-
ests. And I believe the rationale by which the Court reaches its conclusion is unsound.

... This Court has long recognized, for example, that some forms of expression are not entitled to any protection
at all under the First Amendment, despite the fact that they could reasonably be thought protected under its
literal language ...

Since a State concededly may impose some limitations on speech directly, it would seem to follow a fortiori that
a State may legislate to protect important state interests even though an incidental limitation on free speech
results. Virtually any law enacted by a State, when viewed with sufficient ingenuity, could be thought to inter-
fere with some citizen's preferred means of expression. But no one would argue, I presume, that a State could
not prevent the painting of public buildings simply because a particular class of protesters believed their message
would best be conveyed through that medium. Had appellant here chosen to tape his peace symbol to a federal
courthouse, I have little doubt that he could be prosecuted under a statute properly drawn to protect public
property.

Yet the Court today holds that the State of Washington cannot limit use of the American flag, at least insofar
as its statute prevents appellant from using a privately owned flag to convey his personal message. Expressing its
willingness to assume, arguendo, that Washington has a valid interest in preserving the integrity of the flag, the
Court nevertheless finds that interest to be insufficient in this case. To achieve this result the Court first deval-
ues the State's interest under these circumstances, noting that "no interest the State may have in preserving the
physical integrity of a privately owned flag was significantly impaired on these facts. ..." The Court takes pains
to point out that appellant did not "permanently disfigure the flag or destroy it," and emphasizes that the flag
was displayed "in a way closely analogous to the manner in which flags have always been used to convey ideas."
The Court then restates the notion that such state interests are secondary to messages which are "direct, likely
to be understood, and within the contours of the First Amendment." In my view the first premise demonstrates
a total misunderstanding of the State's interest in the integrity of the American flag, and the second premise
places the Court in the position either of ultimately favoring appellant's message because of its subject matter,
a position about which almost all members of the majority have only recently expressed doubt, or, alternatively,
of making the flag available for a limitless succession of political and commercial messages. * * *

What appellant here seeks is simply license to use the flag however he pleases, so long as the activity can be tied
to a concept of speech, regardless of any state interest in having the flag used only for more limited purposes. I
find no reasoning in the Court's opinion which convinces me that the Constitution requires such license to be
given.
§312 | SPEECH AND EXPRESSION

The fact that the State has a valid interest in preserving the character of the flag does not mean, of course, that
it can employ all conceivable means to enforce it. It certainly could not require all citizens to own the flag, or
compel citizens to salute one. Board of Education v. Barnette (1943). It presumably cannot punish criticism of
the flag, or the principles for which it stands, any more than it could punish criticism of this country's policies or
ideas. But the statute in this case demands no such allegiance. Its operation does not depend upon whether the
flag is used for communicative or noncommunicative purposes; upon whether a particular message is deemed
commercial or political; upon whether the use of the flag is respectful or contemptuous; or upon whether any
particular segment of the State's citizenry might applaud or oppose the intended message. It simply withdraws
a unique national symbol from the roster of materials that may be used as a background for communications.
Since I do not believe the Constitution prohibits Washington from making that decision, I dissent.

Mr. Chief Justice BURGER delivered the opinion of the Court.

The issue on appeal is whether the State of New Hampshire may constitutionally enforce criminal sanctions
against persons who cover the motto "Live Free or Die" on passenger vehicle license plates because that motto is
repugnant to their moral and religious beliefs.

Since 1969 New Hampshire has required that noncommercial vehicles bear license plates embossed with the
state motto, "Live Free or Die." ... Another New Hampshire statute makes it a misdemeanor "knowingly (to
obscure) ... the figures or letters on any number plate." ... The term "letters" in this section has been interpreted
by the State's highest court to include the state motto ...

Appellees George Maynard and his wife Maxine are followers of the Jehovah's Witnesses faith. The Maynards
consider the New Hampshire State motto to be repugnant to their moral, religious, and political beliefs, and
therefore assert it objectionable to disseminate this message by displaying it on their automobiles. Pursuant to
these beliefs, the Maynards began early in 1974 to cover up the motto on their license plates.
                                                                                                             SPEECH AND EXPRESSION | 313

On November 27, 1974, Mr. Maynard was issued a citation for violating [the law above mentioned] ... After
waiving his right to counsel, he entered a plea of not guilty and proceeded to explain his religious objection to
the motto. The state trial judge expressed sympathy ... but considered himself bound [precedent] ... to hold May-
nard guilty. A $25 fine was imposed, but execution was suspended during "good behavior."

On December 28, 1974, Mr. Maynard was again charged ... again chose to represent himself; he was found guilty,
and fined $50, and sentenced to six months in the Grafton County House of Corrections. The court suspended
this jail sentence but ordered Mr. Maynard to also pay the $25 fine for the first offense. Maynard informed the
court that, as a matter of conscience, he refused to pay the two fines. The court thereupon sentenced him to jail
for a period of 15 days. He has served his full sentence.

Prior to trial on the second offense Mr. Maynard was charged with yet a third violation of § 262:27-c on January
3, 1975. He appeared on this complaint on the same day as for the second offense, and was, again, found guilty.
This conviction was "continued for sentence" so that Maynard received no punishment in addition to the 15
days.

On March 4, 1975, appellees brought the present ... They sought injunctive and declaratory relief against
enforcement ... insofar as these [laws] required displaying the state motto on their vehicle license plates, and
made it a criminal offense to obscure the motto. On March 11, 1975, the single District Judge issued a temporary
restraining order against further arrests and prosecutions of the Maynards. Because the appellees sought an
injunction against a state statute on grounds of its unconstitutionality, a three-judge District Court was con-
vened pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2281. Following a hearing on the merits, the District Court entered an order
enjoining the State "from arresting and prosecuting (the Maynards) at any time in the future for covering over
that portion of their license plates that contains the motto `Live Free or Die.' " ... We noted probable jurisdiction
of the appeal ...

The District Court held that by covering up the state motto "Live Free or Die" on his automobile license plate,
Mr. Maynard was engaging in symbolic speech and that "New Hampshire's interest in the enforcement of its
defacement statute is not sufficient to justify the restriction on (appellee's) constitutionally protected expres-
sion." ... We find it unnecessary to pass on the "symbolic speech" issue, since we find more appropriate First
Amendment grounds to affirm the judgment of the District Court. We turn instead to what in our view is the
essence of appellees' objection to the requirement that they display the motto "Live Free or Die" on their auto-
mobile license plates. This is succinctly summarized in the statement made by Mr. Maynard in his affidavit filed
with the District Court:

"I refuse to be coerced by the State into advertising a slogan which I find morally, ethically, religiously and polit-
ically abhorrent."

We are thus faced with the question of whether the State may constitutionally require an individual to partici-
pate in the dissemination of an ideological message by displaying it on his private property in a manner and for
the express purpose that it be observed and read by the public. We hold that the State may not do so.
314 | SPEECH AND EXPRESSION

We begin with the proposition that the right of freedom of thought protected by the First Amendment against
state action includes both the right to speak freely and the right to refrain from speaking at all. A system which
secures the right to proselytize religious, political, and ideological causes must also guarantee the concomitant
right to decline to foster such concepts. The right to speak and the right to refrain from speaking are comple-
mentary components of the broader concept of "individual freedom of mind." ...

The Court in Barnette was faced with a state statute which required public school students to participate in daily
public ceremonies by honoring the flag both with words and traditional salute gestures ... Compelling the affir-
mative act of a flag salute involved a more serious infringement upon personal liberties than the passive act of
carrying the state motto on a license plate, but the difference is essentially one of degree. Here, as in Barnette,
we are faced with a state measure which forces an individual, as part of his daily life indeed constantly while his
automobile is in public view to be an instrument for fostering public adherence to an ideological point of view
he finds unacceptable ...

New Hampshire's statute in effect requires that appellees use their private property as a "mobile billboard" for
the State's ideological message or suffer a penalty, as Maynard already has. As a condition to driving an automo-
bile a virtual necessity for most Americans the Maynards must display "Live Free or Die" to hundreds of people
each day. The fact that most individuals agree with the thrust of New Hampshire's motto is not the test; most
Americans also find the flag salute acceptable. The First Amendment protects the right of individuals to hold a
point of view different from the majority and to refuse to foster, in the way New Hampshire commands, an idea
they find morally objectionable.

Identifying the Maynards' interests as implicating First Amendment protections does not end our inquiry how-
ever. We must also determine whether the State's countervailing interest is sufficiently compelling to justify
requiring appellees to display the state motto on their license plates. US v. O'Brien, (1968). The two interests
advanced by the State are that display of the motto (1) facilitates the identification of passenger vehicles, and (2)
promotes appreciation of history, individualism, and state pride.

The State first points out that passenger vehicles, but not commercial, trailer, or other vehicles are required
to display the state motto. Thus, the argument proceeds, officers of the law are more easily able to determine
whether passenger vehicles are carrying the proper plates. However, the record here reveals that New Hampshire
passenger license plates normally consist of a specific configuration of letters and numbers, which makes them
readily distinguishable from other types of plates, even without reference to the state motto. Even were we to
credit the State's reasons and "even though the governmental purpose be legitimate and substantial, that pur-
pose cannot be pursued by means that broadly stifle fundamental personal liberties when the end can be more
narrowly achieved ...

The State's second claimed interest is not ideologically neutral. The State is seeking to communicate to others an
official view as to proper appreciation of history, state pride, and individualism. Of course, the State may legit-
imately pursue such interests in any number of ways. However, where the State's interest is to disseminate an
ideology, no matter how acceptable to some, such interest cannot outweigh an individual's First Amendment
right to avoid becoming the courier for such message.
§                                                                                                            SPEECH AND EXPRESSION | 315

We conclude that the State of New Hampshire may not require appellees to display the state motto upon their
vehicle license plates; and, accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.

Affirmed.

Justice White delivered the opinion of the Court.

The issue in this case is whether a National Park Service regulation prohibiting camping in certain parks
violates the First Amendment when applied to prohibit demonstrators from sleeping in Lafayette Park and the
[National] Mall in connection with a demonstration intended to call attention to the plight of the homeless. We
hold that it does not and reverse the contrary judgment of the Court of Appeals.

* The Interior Department, through the National Park Service, is charged with responsibility for the manage-
ment and maintenance of the National Parks and is authorized to promulgate rules and regulations for the use
of the parks in accordance with the purposes for which they were established ... The network of National Parks
includes the National Memorial-core parks, Lafayette Park and the Mall, which are set in the heart of Washing-
ton, D.C., and which are unique resources that the Federal Government holds in trust for the American people
... Under the regulations involved in this case, camping in National Parks is permitted only in campgrounds des-
ignated for that purpose ... No such campgrounds have ever been designated in Lafayette Park or the Mall.

The Interior Department, through the National Park Service, is charged with responsibility for management
and maintenance of the National Parks and is authorized to promulgate rules and regulations for the use of the
parks in accordance with the purposes for which they were established ...

Under the regulations involved in this case, camping in the National Parks is permitted only in campgrounds
designated for that purpose. No such campgrounds have ever been designated in Lafayette Park the Mall. Camp-
ing is defined as "the use of park land for living accommodation purposes such as sleeping activities, or making
316 | SPEECH AND EXPRESSION

preparations to sleep (including the laying down of bedding for the purpose of sleeping), or storing personal
belongings, or making any fire, or using any tents or ... other structure ... for sleeping or doing any digging or
earth breaking or carrying on cooking activities."

These activities, the regulation provides,

"constitute camping when it reasonably appears, in light of all the circumstances, that the participants, in con-
ducting these activities, are in fact using the area as a living accommodation regardless of the intent of the partic-
ipants or the nature of any other activities in which they may also be engaging."

Demonstrations for the airing of views or grievances are permitted in the Memorial-core parks, but for the most
part only by Park Service permits ... Temporary structures may be erected for demonstration purposes but may
not be used for camping ...

In 1982, the Park Service issued a renewable permit to respondent Community for Creative Non-Violence
(CCNV) to conduct a wintertime demonstration in Lafayette Park and the Mall for the purpose of demon-
strating the plight of the homeless. The permit authorized the erection of two symbolic tent cities: 20 tents in
Lafayette Park that would accommodate 50 people and 40 tents in the Mall with a capacity of up to 100. The
Park Service, however, relying on the above regulations, specifically denied CCNV's request that demonstrators
be permitted to sleep in the symbolic tents.

CCNV and several individuals then filed an action to prevent the application of the no-camping regulations to
the proposed demonstration, which, it was claimed, was not covered by the regulation. It was also submitted
that the regulations were unconstitutionally vague, had been discriminatorily applied, and could not be applied
to prevent sleeping in the tents without violating the First Amendment. The District Court granted summary
judgment in favor of the Park Service. The Court of Appeals, sitting en banc, reversed. The 11 judges produced
6 opinions. Six of the judges believed that application of the regulations so as to prevent sleeping in the tents
would infringe the demonstrators' First Amendment right of free expression. The other five judges disagreed
and would have sustained the regulations as applied to CCNV's proposed demonstration. We granted the Gov-
ernment's petition for certiorari and now reverse.

... We need not differ with the view of the Court of Appeals that overnight sleeping in connection with the
demonstration is expressive conduct protected to some extent by the First Amendment. We assume for present
                                                                                                             SPEECH AND EXPRESSION | 317

purposes, but do not decide, that such is the case, cf. United States v. O'Brien ... but this assumption only begins
the inquiry. Expression, whether oral or written or symbolized by conduct, is subject to reasonable time, place,
or manner restrictions. We have often noted that restrictions of this kind are valid provided that they are justified
without reference to the content of the regulated speech, that they are narrowly tailored to serve a significant
governmental interest, and that they leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the informa-
tion ...

It is also true that a message may be delivered by conduct that is intended to be communicative and that, in con-
text, would reasonably be understood by the viewer to be communicative ... Symbolic expression of this kind
may be forbidden or regulated if the conduct itself may constitutionally be regulated, if the regulation is nar-
rowly drawn to further a substantial governmental interest, and if the interest is unrelated to the suppression of
free speech. United States v. O'Brien, supra.

We need not differ with the view of the Court of Appeals that overnight sleeping in connection with the demon-
stration is expressive conduct protected to some extent by the First Amendment. We assume for present pur-
poses, but do not decide, that such is the case, but this assumption only begins the inquiry. Expression, whether
oral or written or symbolized by conduct, is subject to reasonable time, place, or manner restrictions. We have
often noted that restrictions of this kind are valid provided that they are justified without reference to the con-
tent of the regulated speech, that they are narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, and that
they leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information.

Petitioners submit, as they did in the Court of Appeals, that the regulation forbidding sleeping is defensible
either as a time, place, or manner restriction or as a regulation of symbolic conduct. We agree with that assess-
ment. The permit that was issued authorized the demonstration but required compliance with 36 CFR § 50.19
(1913), which prohibits "camping" on park lands, that is, the use of park lands for living accommodations ...
These provisions, including the ban on sleeping, are clearly limitations on the manner in which the demonstra-
tion could be carried out. That sleeping, like the symbolic tents themselves, may be expressive and part of the
message delivered by the demonstration does not make the ban any less a limitation on the manner of demon-
strating, for reasonable time, place, or manner regulations normally have the purpose and direct effect of limiting
expression but are nevertheless valid ... Neither does the fact that sleeping, arguendo, may be expressive conduct,
rather than oral or written expression, render the sleeping prohibition any less a time, place, or manner regula-
tion. To the contrary, the Park Service neither attempts to ban sleeping generally nor to ban it everywhere in the
parks. It has established areas for camping and forbids it elsewhere, including Lafayette Park and the Mall. Con-
sidered as such, we have very little trouble concluding that the Park Service may prohibit overnight sleeping in
the parks involved here.

The requirement that the regulation be content-neutral is clearly satisfied. The courts below accepted that view,
and it is not disputed here that the prohibition on camping, and on sleeping specifically, is content-neutral and
is not being applied because of disagreement with the message presented. Neither was the regulation faulted, nor
could it be, on the ground that without overnight sleeping the plight of the homeless could not be communi-
cated in other ways. The regulation otherwise left the demonstration intact, with its symbolic city, signs, and the
318 | SPEECH AND EXPRESSION

presence of those who were willing to take their turns in a day-and-night vigil. Respondents do not suggest that
there was, or is, any barrier to delivering to the media, or to the public by other means, the intended message
concerning the plight of the homeless.

It is also apparent to us that the regulation narrowly focuses on the Government's substantial interest in main-
taining the parks in the heart of our Capital in an attractive and intact condition, readily available to the millions
of people who wish to see and enjoy them by their presence. To permit camping--using these areas as living
accommodations--would be totally inimical to these purposes, as would be readily understood by those who
have frequented the National Parks across the country and observed the unfortunate consequences of the activ-
ities of those who refuse to confine their camping to designated areas.

It is urged by respondents, and the Court of Appeals was of this view, that if the symbolic city of tents was to
be permitted and if the demonstrators did not intend to cook, dig, or engage in aspects of camping other than
sleeping, the incremental benefit to the parks could not justify the ban on sleeping, which was here an expressive
activity said to enhance the message concerning the plight of the poor and homeless. We cannot agree. In the
first place, we seriously doubt that the First Amendment requires the Park Service to permit a demonstration in
Lafayette Park and the Mall involving a 24-hour vigil and the erection of tents to accommodate 150 people ...
The sleeping ban, if enforced, would thus effectively limit the nature, extent, and duration of the demonstration
and to that extent ease the pressure on the parks.

... With the prohibition, however, as is evident in the case before us, at least some around-the-clock demonstra-
tions lasting for days on end will not materialize, others will be limited in size and duration, and the purposes
of the regulation will thus be materially served. Perhaps these purposes would be more effectively and not so
clumsily achieved by preventing tents and 24-hour vigils entirely in the core areas. But the Park Service's deci-
sion to permit nonsleeping demonstrations does not, in our view, impugn the camping prohibition as a valuable,
but perhaps imperfect, protection to the parks. If the Government has a legitimate interest in ensuring that the
National Parks are adequately protected, which we think it has, and if the parks would be more exposed to harm
without the sleeping prohibition than with it, the ban is safe from invalidation under the First Amendment as a
reasonable regulation of the manner in which a demonstration may be carried out ...

We have difficulty, therefore, in understanding why the prohibition against camping, with its ban on sleeping
overnight, is not a reasonable time, place, or manner regulation that withstands constitutional scrutiny. Surely
the regulation is not unconstitutional on its face. None of its provisions appears unrelated to the ends that it was
designed to serve. Nor is it any less valid when applied to prevent camping in Memorial-core parks by those who
wish to demonstrate and deliver a message to the public and the central Government. Damage to the parks as
well as their partial inaccessibility to other members of the public can as easily result from camping by demon-
strators as by non demonstrators. In neither case must the Government tolerate it. All those who would resort
to the parks must abide by otherwise valid rules for their use, just as they must observe the traffic laws, sanitation
regulations, and laws to preserve the public peace. This is no more than a reaffirmation that reasonable time,
place, or manner restrictions on expression are constitutionally acceptable.
§                                                                                                            SPEECH AND EXPRESSION | 319

... We are unmoved by the Court of Appeals' view that the challenged regulation is unnecessary, and hence
invalid, because there are less speech-restrictive alternatives that could have satisfied the Government interest in
preserving park lands. There is no gainsaying that preventing overnight sleeping will avoid a measure of actual
or threatened damage to Lafayette Park and the Mall. The Court of Appeals' suggestions that the Park Service
minimize the possible injury by reducing the size, duration, or frequency of demonstrations would still curtail
the total allowable expression in which demonstrators could engage, whether by sleeping or otherwise, and these
suggestions represent no more than a disagreement with the Park Service over how much protection the core
parks require or how an acceptable level of preservation is to be attained. We do not believe, however, that either
O'Brien or the time, place, or manner decisions assign to the judiciary the authority to replace the Park Service as
the manager of the Nation's parks or endow the judiciary with the competence to judge how much protection
of park lands is wise and how that level of conservation is to be attained.

Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Reversed.

Justice Brennan delivered the opinion of the Court.

After publicly burning an American flag as a means of political protest, Gregory Lee Johnson was convicted of
desecrating a flag in violation of Texas law. This case presents the question whether his conviction is consistent
with the First Amendment. We hold that it is not.

While the Republican National Convention was taking place in Dallas in 1984, respondent Johnson partici-
pated in a political demonstration dubbed the "Republican War Chest Tour." As explained in literature distrib-
uted by the demonstrators and in speeches made by them, the purpose of this event was to protest the policies of
the Reagan administration and of certain Dallas-based corporations. The demonstrators marched through the
Dallas streets, chanting political slogans and stopping at several corporate locations to stage "die-ins" intended

to dramatize the consequences of nuclear war. On several occasions they spray-painted the walls of buildings
and overturned potted plants, but Johnson himself took no part in such activities. He did, however, accept an
American flag handed to him by a fellow protestor who had taken it from a flagpole outside one of the targeted
buildings.

The demonstration ended in front of Dallas City Hall, where Johnson unfurled the American flag, doused
it with kerosene, and set it on fire. While the flag burned, the protestors chanted: "America, the red, white,
and blue, we spit on you." After the demonstrators dispersed, a witness to the flag burning collected the flag's
remains and buried them in his backyard. No one was physically injured or threatened with injury, though sev-
eral witnesses testified that they had been seriously offended by the flag burning.

Of the approximately 100 demonstrators, Johnson alone was charged with a crime. The only criminal offense
with which he was charged was the desecration of a venerated object in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann.
42.09(a)(3) (1989). After a trial, he was convicted, sentenced to one year in prison, and fined $2,000. The Court
of Appeals for the Fifth District of Texas at Dallas affirmed Johnson's conviction, but the Texas Court of Crim-
inal Appeals reversed, holding that the State could not, consistent with the First Amendment, punish Johnson
for burning the flag in these circumstances.

...

Because it reversed Johnson's conviction on the ground that § 42.09 was unconstitutional as applied to him, the
state court did not address Johnson's argument that the statute was, on its face, unconstitutionally vague and
overbroad. We granted certiorari and now affirm.

Johnson was convicted of flag desecration for burning the flag rather than for uttering insulting words. This fact
somewhat complicates our consideration of his conviction under the First Amendment. We must first deter-
mine whether Johnson's burning of the flag constituted expressive conduct, permitting him to invoke the First
Amendment in challenging his conviction. Spence v. Washington, (1974). If his conduct was expressive, we next
decide whether the State's regulation is related to the suppression of free expression. US v. O'Brien, (1968). If
the State's regulation is not related to expression, then the less stringent standard we announced in O'Brien for
regulations of noncommunicative conduct controls. If it is, then we are outside of O'Brien`s test, and we must
ask whether this interest justifies Johnson's conviction under a more demanding standard. A third possibility is
that the State's asserted interest is simply not implicated on these facts, and in that event the interest drops out
of the picture.

The First Amendment literally forbids the abridgment only of "speech," but we have long recognized that its
protection does not end at the spoken or written word. While we have rejected "the view that an apparently lim-
itless variety of conduct can be labeled `speech' whenever the person engaging in the conduct intends thereby
to express an idea," O'Brien, we have acknowledged that conduct may be "sufficiently imbued with elements of
communication to fall within the scope of the First and Fourteenth Amendments," Spence.
                                                                                                             SPEECH AND EXPRESSION | 321

In deciding whether particular conduct possesses sufficient communicative elements to bring the First Amend-
ment into play, we have asked whether "[a]n intent to convey a particularized message was present, and
[whether] the likelihood was great that the message would be understood by those who viewed it." Spence ...

Especially pertinent to this case are our decisions recognizing the communicative nature of conduct relating to
flags. That we have had little difficulty identifying an expressive element in conduct relating to flags should not
be surprising. The very purpose of a national flag is to serve as a symbol of our country; it is, one might say, "the
one visible manifestation of two hundred years of nationhood." * * * Pregnant with expressive content, the flag
as readily signifies this Nation as does the combination of letters found in "America."

* * * The State of Texas conceded for purposes of its oral argument in this case that Johnson's conduct was expres-
sive conduct, and this concession seems to us as prudent as was Washington's in Spence ... The expressive, overtly
political nature of this conduct was both intentional and overwhelmingly apparent. * * *

The government generally has a freer hand in restricting expressive conduct than it has in restricting the written
or spoken word. See O'Brien. It may not, however, proscribe particular conduct because it has expressive ele-
ments. * * * It is, in short, not simply the verbal or nonverbal nature of the expression, but the governmental
interest at stake, that helps to determine whether a restriction on that expression is valid.

Thus, although we have recognized that where "`speech' and `nonspeech' elements are combined in the same
course of conduct, a sufficiently important governmental interest in regulating the nonspeech element can
justify incidental limitations on First Amendment freedoms," O'Brien, we have limited the applicability of
O'Brien's relatively lenient standard to those cases in which "the governmental interest is unrelated to the sup-
pression of free expression." [We] have highlighted the requirement that the governmental interest in question
be unconnected to expression in order to come under O'Brien's less demanding rule.

In order to decide whether O'Brien's test applies here, therefore, we must decide whether Texas has asserted an
interest in support of Johnson's conviction that is unrelated to the suppression of expression. If we find that an
interest asserted by the State is simply not implicated on the facts before us, we need not ask whether O'Brien's
test applies. The State offers two separate interests to justify this conviction: preventing breaches of the peace
and preserving the flag as a symbol of nationhood and national unity. We hold that the first interest is not impli-
cated on this record and that the second is related to the suppression of expression.

Texas claims that its interest in preventing breaches of the peace justifies Johnson's conviction for flag desecra-
tion. However, no disturbance of the peace actually occurred or threatened to occur because of Johnson's burn-
ing of the flag. Although the State stresses the disruptive behavior of the protestors during their march toward
City Hall, it admits that "no actual breach of the peace occurred at the time of the flag burning or in response to
the flag burning."

* * * The State's position, therefore, amounts to a claim that an audience that takes serious offense at particular
expression is necessarily likely to disturb the peace and that the expression may be prohibited on this basis. Our
precedents do not countenance such a presumption. * * *
322 | SPEECH AND EXPRESSION

Thus, we have not permitted the government to assume that every expression of a provocative idea will incite a
riot, but have instead required careful consideration of the actual circumstances surrounding such expression,
asking whether the expression "is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite
or produce such action." Brandenburg v. Ohio, (1969) ...

We thus conclude that the State's interest in maintaining order is not implicated on these facts. The State need
not worry that our holding will disable it from preserving the peace ... And, in fact, Texas already has a statute
specifically prohibiting breaches of the peace, which tends to confirm that Texas need not punish this flag dese-
cration in order to keep the peace.

The State also asserts an interest in preserving the flag as a symbol of nationhood and national unity. In Spence,
we acknowledged that the government's interest in preserving the flag's special symbolic value "is directly related
to expression in the context of activity" such as affixing a peace symbol to a flag. We are equally persuaded that
this interest is related to expression in the case of Johnson's burning of the flag. The State, apparently, is con-
cerned that such conduct will lead people to believe either that the flag does not stand for nationhood and
national unity, but instead reflects other, less positive concepts, or that the concepts reflected in the flag do not
in fact exist, that is, that we do not enjoy unity as a Nation. These concerns blossom only when a person's treat-
ment of the flag communicates some message, and thus are related "to the suppression of free expression" within
the meaning of O'Brien. We are thus outside of O'Brien's test altogether.

It remains to consider whether the State's interest in preserving the flag as a symbol of nationhood and national
unity justifies Johnson's conviction.

* * * Johnson was not, we add, prosecuted for the expression of just any idea; he was prosecuted for his expression
of dissatisfaction with the policies of this country, expression situated at the core of our First Amendment values.

Moreover, Johnson was prosecuted because he knew that his politically charged expression would cause "serious
offense." If he had burned the flag as a means of disposing of it because it was dirty or torn, he would not have
been convicted of flag desecration under this Texas law: federal law designates burning as the preferred means
of disposing of a flag "when it is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem for display," 36 U.S.C.
176(k), and Texas has no quarrel with this means of disposal. The Texas law is thus not aimed at protecting
the physical integrity of the flag in all circumstances, but is designed instead to protect it only against impair-
ments that would cause serious offense to others. Texas concedes as much. * * * Johnson's political expression
was restricted because of the content of the message he conveyed. We must therefore subject the State's asserted
interest in preserving the special symbolic character of the flag to "the most exacting scrutiny."

Texas argues that its interest in preserving the flag as a symbol of nationhood and national unity survives this
close analysis. Quoting extensively from the writings of this Court chronicling the flag's historic and symbolic
role in our society, the State emphasizes the "`special place'" reserved for the flag in our Nation. The State's argu-
ment is not that it has an interest simply in maintaining the flag as a symbol of something, no matter what it
symbolizes; indeed, if that were the State's position, it would be difficult to see how that interest is endangered
by highly symbolic conduct such as Johnson's. Rather, the State's claim is that it has an interest in preserving the
flag as a symbol of nationhood and national unity, a symbol with a determinate range of meanings. According to
                                                                                                             SPEECH AND EXPRESSION | 323

Texas, if one physically treats the flag in a way that would tend to cast doubt on either the idea that nationhood
and national unity are the flag's referents or that national unity actually exists, the message conveyed thereby is a
harmful one and therefore may be prohibited.

If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the government may not prohibit the
expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.

We have not recognized an exception to this principle even where our flag has been involved. * * *

In short, nothing in our precedents suggests that a State may foster its own view of the flag by prohibiting expres-
sive conduct relating to it. To bring its argument outside our precedents, Texas attempts to convince us that even
if its interest in preserving the flag's symbolic role does not allow it to prohibit words or some expressive conduct
critical of the flag, it does permit it to forbid the outright destruction of the flag. The State's argument cannot
depend here on the distinction between written or spoken words and nonverbal conduct. That distinction, we
have shown, is of no moment where the nonverbal conduct is expressive, as it is here, and where the regulation
of that conduct is related to expression, as it is here. In addition, both Barnette and Spence involved expressive
conduct, not only verbal communication, and both found that conduct protected.

Texas' focus on the precise nature of Johnson's expression, moreover, misses the point of our prior decisions:
their enduring lesson, that the government may not prohibit expression simply because it disagrees with its mes-
sage, is not dependent on the particular mode in which one chooses to express an idea. If we were to hold that
a State may forbid flag burning wherever it is likely to endanger the flag's symbolic role, but allow it wherever
burning a flag promotes that role - as where, for example, a person ceremoniously burns a dirty flag - we would
be saying that when it comes to impairing the flag's physical integrity, the flag itself may be used as a symbol -
as a substitute for the written or spoken word or a "short cut from mind to mind" - only in one direction. We
would be permitting a State to "prescribe what shall be orthodox" by saying that one may burn the flag to convey
one's attitude toward it and its referents only if one does not endanger the flag's representation of nationhood
and national unity.

We never before have held that the Government may ensure that a symbol be used to express only one view of
that symbol or its referents. * * *

There is, moreover, no indication - either in the text of the Constitution or in our cases interpreting it - that
a separate juridical category exists for the American flag alone ... The First Amendment does not guarantee that
other concepts virtually sacred to our Nation as a whole - such as the principle that discrimination on the
basis of race is odious and destructive - will go unquestioned in the marketplace of ideas. See Brandenburg. We
decline, therefore, to create for the flag an exception to the joust of principles protected by the First Amendment
...

We are tempted to say, in fact, that the flag's deservedly cherished place in our community will be strengthened,
not weakened, by our holding today. Our decision is a reaffirmation of the principles of freedom and inclusive-
ness that the flag best reflects, and of the conviction that our toleration of criticism such as Johnson's is a sign
324 | SPEECH AND EXPRESSION

and source of our strength. Indeed, one of the proudest images of our flag, the one immortalized in our own
national anthem, is of the bombardment it survived at Fort McHenry. It is the Nation's resilience, not its rigid-
ity, that Texas sees reflected in the flag - and it is that resilience that we reassert today.

The way to preserve the flag's special role is not to punish those who feel differently about these matters. It is
to persuade them that they are wrong ... And, precisely because it is our flag that is involved, one's response to
the flag burner may exploit the uniquely persuasive power of the flag itself. We can imagine no more appropri-
ate response to burning a flag than waving one's own, no better way to counter a flag burner's message than by
saluting the flag that burns, no surer means of preserving the dignity even of the flag that burned than by - as
one witness here did - according its remains a respectful burial. We do not consecrate the flag by punishing its
desecration, for in doing so we dilute the freedom that this cherished emblem represents.

... The judgment of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals is therefore

Affirmed.

Justice Kennedy, concurring

I write not to qualify the words Justice BRENNAN chooses so well, for he says with power all that is necessary
to explain our ruling. I join his opinion without reservation, but with a keen sense that this case, like others
before us from time to time, exacts its personal toll. This prompts me to add to our pages these few remarks.

The case before us illustrates better than most that the judicial power is often difficult in its exercise. We cannot
here ask another Branch to share responsibility, as when the argument is made that a statute is flawed or incom-
plete. For we are presented with a clear and simple statute to be judged against a pure command of the Consti-
tution. The outcome can be laid at no door but ours.

The hard fact is that sometimes we must make decisions we do not like. We make them because they are right,
right in the sense that the law and the Constitution, as we see them, compel the result. And so great is our com-
mitment to the process that, except in the rare case, we do not pause to express distaste for the result, perhaps for
fear of undermining a valued principle that dictates the decision. This is one of those rare cases.

Our colleagues in dissent advance powerful arguments why respondent may be convicted for his expression,
reminding us that among those who will be dismayed by our holding will be some who have had the singular
honor of carrying the flag in battle. And I agree that the flag holds a lonely place of honor in an age when
absolutes are distrusted and simple truths are burdened by unneeded apologetics.

With all respect to those views, I do not believe the Constitution gives us the right to rule as the dissenting Mem-
bers of the Court urge, however painful this judgment is to announce. Though symbols often are what we our-
selves make of them, the flag is constant in expressing beliefs Americans share, beliefs in law and peace and that
freedom which sustains the human spirit. The case here today forces recognition of the costs to which those
beliefs commit us. It is poignant but fundamental that the flag protects those who hold it in contempt.
                                                                                                             SPEECH AND EXPRESSION | 325

For all the record shows, this respondent was not a philosopher and perhaps did not even possess the ability to
comprehend how repellent his statements must be to the Republic itself. But whether or not he could appreci-
ate the enormity of the offense he gave, the fact remains that his acts were speech, in both the technical and the
fundamental meaning of the Constitution. So I agree with the Court that he must go free.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice White and Justice O'Connor join, dissenting.

... For more than 200 years, the American flag has occupied a unique position as the symbol of our Nation, a
uniqueness that justifies a governmental prohibition against flag burning in the way respondent Johnson did
here. * * *

... The flag is not simply another "idea" or "point of view" competing for recognition in the marketplace of ideas.
Millions and millions of Americans regard it with an almost mystical reverence regardless of what sort of social,
political, or philosophical beliefs they may have. I cannot agree that the First Amendment invalidates the Act of
Congress, and the laws of 48 of the 50 States, which make criminal the public burning of the flag. * * *

Our Constitution wisely places limits on powers of legislative majorities to act, ... Uncritical extension of consti-
tutional protection to the burning of the flag risks the frustration of the very purpose for which organized gov-
ernments are instituted. The Court decides that the American flag is just another symbol, about which not only
must opinions pro and con be tolerated, but for which the most minimal public respect may not be enjoined.
The government may conscript men into the Armed Forces where they must fight and perhaps die for the flag,
but the government may not prohibit the public burning of the banner under which they fight. I would uphold
the Texas statute as applied in this case.

Stevens, J., dissenting.

... In my judgment rules that apply to a host of other symbols, such as state flags, armbands, or various privately
promoted emblems of political or commercial identity, are not necessarily controlling. Even if flag burning could
be considered just another species of symbolic speech under the logical application of the rules that the Court
has developed in its interpretation of the First Amendment in other contexts, this case has an intangible dimen-
sion that makes those rules inapplicable.

A country's flag is a symbol of more than "nationhood and national unity." It also signifies the ideas that char-
acterize the society that has chosen that emblem as well as the special history that has animated the growth and
power of those ideas. The fleurs-de-lis and the tricolor both symbolized "nationhood and national unity," but
they had vastly different meanings. The message conveyed by some flags - the swastika, for example - may sur-
vive long after it has outlived its usefulness as a symbol of regimented unity in a particular nation.

So it is with the American flag. It is more than a proud symbol of the courage, the determination, and the gifts of
nature that transformed 13 fledgling Colonies into a world power. It is a symbol of freedom, of equal opportu-
nity, of religious tolerance, and of good will for other peoples who share our aspirations. The symbol carries its
message to dissidents both at home and abroad who may have no interest at all in our national unity or survival.
326 | SPEECH AND EXPRESSION

The value of the flag as a symbol cannot be measured. Even so, I have no doubt that the interest in preserving that
value for the future is both significant and legitimate. Conceivably that value will be enhanced by the Court's
conclusion that our national commitment to free expression is so strong that even the United States as ultimate
guarantor of that freedom is without power to prohibit the desecration of its unique symbol. But I am unper-
suaded. The creation of a federal right to post bulletin boards and graffiti on the Washington Monument might
enlarge the market for free expression, but at a cost I would not pay. Similarly, in my considered judgment, sanc-
tioning the public desecration of the flag will tarnish its value - both for those who cherish the ideas for which
it waves and for those who desire to don the robes of martyrdom by burning it. That tarnish is not justified by
the trivial burden on free expression occasioned by requiring that an available, alternative mode of expression -
including uttering words critical of the flag, be employed.

It is appropriate to emphasize certain propositions that are not implicated by this case. The statutory prohibition
of flag desecration does not "prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters
of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein." West Virginia Board of Education v.
Barnette (1943). The statute does not compel any conduct or any profession of respect for any idea or any sym-
bol.

... The Court is therefore quite wrong in blandly asserting that respondent "was prosecuted for his expression of
dissatisfaction with the policies of this country, expression situated at the core of our First Amendment values."
Respondent was prosecuted because of the method he chose to express his dissatisfaction with those policies.
Had he chosen to spray-paint - or perhaps convey with a motion picture projector - his message of dissatisfac-
tion on the facade of the Lincoln Memorial, there would be no question about the power of the Government to
prohibit his means of expression. The prohibition would be supported by the legitimate interest in preserving
the quality of an important national asset ...

I respectfully dissent.

    Decision: Reversed
    Majority: Brennan, joined by Marshall, Blackmun, Scalia and Kennedy
    Dissent: Stevens, joined by Rehnquist, White and O'Connor

Justice Brennan delivered the opinion of the court.

In these consolidated appeals, we consider whether appellees' prosecution for burning a United States flag in
violation of the Flag Protection Act of 1989 is consistent with the First Amendment. Applying our recent deci-
sion in Texas v. Johnson, the District Courts held that the Act cannot constitutionally be applied to appellees. We
affirm.

* In No. 89-1433, the United States prosecuted certain appellees for violating the Flag Protection Act of 1989,
103 Stat. 777, 18 U.S.C. § 700 (1988 ed. and Supp. I), by knowingly setting fire to several United States flags on
the steps of the United States Capitol while protesting various aspects of the Government's domestic and for-
eign policy. In No. 89-1434, the United States prosecuted other appellees for violating the Act by knowingly set-
ting fire to a United States flag in Seattle while protesting the Act's passage. In each case, the respective appellees
moved to dismiss the flag-burning charge on the ground that the Act, both on its face and as applied, violates
the First Amendment. Both the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington (1990),
and the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (1990), following Johnson, supra, held the Act
unconstitutional as applied to appellees and dismissed the charges. The United States appealed both decisions
directly to this Court ...

Last Term in Johnson, we held that a Texas statute criminalizing the desecration of venerated objects, including
the United States flag, was unconstitutional as applied to an individual who had set such a flag on fire during a
political demonstration ...

After our decision in Johnson, Congress passed the Flag Protection Act of 1989. The Act provides in relevant
part:

After our decision in Johnson, Congress passed the Flag Protection Act of 1989. The Act provides in relevant
part:

"(a)(1) Whoever knowingly mutilates, defaces, physically defiles, burns, maintains on the floor or ground, or
tramples upon any flag of the United States shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than one
year, or both.

"(2) This subsection does not prohibit any conduct consisting of the disposal of a flag when it has become worn
or soiled.
328 | SPEECH AND EXPRESSION

"(b) As used in this section, the term `flag of the United States' means any flag of the United States, or any part
thereof, made of any substance, of any size, in a form that is commonly displayed." 18 U.S.C. § 700 (1988 ed.,
Supp. I).

... The only remaining question is whether the Flag Protection Act is sufficiently distinct from the Texas statute
that it may constitutionally be applied to proscribe appellees' expressive conduct.

The Government contends that the Flag Protection Act is constitutional because, unlike the statute addressed in
Johnson, the Act does not target expressive conduct on the basis of the content of its message. The Government
asserts an interest in "protect[ing] the physical integrity of the flag under all circumstances" in order to safeguard
the flag's identity " `as the unique and unalloyed symbol of the Nation.'" ... The Act proscribes conduct (other
than disposal) that damages or mistreats a flag, without regard to the actor's motive, his intended message, or the
likely effects of his conduct on onlookers. By contrast, the Texas statute expressly prohibited only those acts of
physical flag desecration "that the actor knows will seriously offend" onlookers, and the former federal statute
prohibited only those acts of desecration that "cas[t] contempt upon" the flag.

Although the Flag Protection Act contains no explicit content-based limitation on the scope of prohibited
conduct, it is nevertheless clear that the Government's asserted interest is "related `to the suppression of free
expression,'" and concerned with the content of such expression. The Government's interest in protecting the
"physical integrity" of a privately owned flag rests upon a perceived need to preserve the flag's status as a sym-
bol of our Nation and certain national ideals. But the mere destruction or disfigurement of a particular phys-
ical manifestation of the symbol, without more, does not diminish or otherwise affect the symbol itself in any
way. For example, the secret destruction of a flag in one's own basement would not threaten the flag's recognized
meaning. Rather, the Government's desire to preserve the flag as a symbol for certain national ideals is impli-
cated "only when a person's treatment of the flag communicates [a] message" to others that is inconsistent with
those ideals ... Moreover, the precise language of the Act's prohibitions confirms Congress' interest in the com-
municative impact of flag destruction. The Act criminalizes the conduct of anyone who "knowingly mutilates,
defaces, physically defiles, burns, maintains on the floor or ground, or tramples upon any flag.". ... Each of the
specified terms--with the possible exception of "burns"--unmistakably connotes disrespectful treatment of the
flag and suggests a focus on those acts likely to damage the flag's symbolic value. And the explicit exemption in §
700(a)(2) for disposal of "worn or soiled" flags protects certain acts traditionally associated with patriotic respect
for the flag.

As we explained in Johnson, ..."[I]f we were to hold that a State may forbid flag burning wherever it is likely to
endanger the flag's symbolic role, but allow it wherever burning a flag promotes that role--as where, for exam-
ple, a person ceremoniously burns a dirty flag--we would be ... permitting a State to `prescribe what shall be
orthodox' by saying that one may burn the flag to convey one's attitude toward it and its referents only if one
does not endanger the flag's representation of nationhood and national unity." Although Congress cast the Flag
Protection Act of 1989 in somewhat broader terms than the Texas statute at issue in Johnson, the Act still suffers
from the same fundamental flaw: It suppresses expression out of concern for its likely communicative impact
... The Act therefore must be subjected to "the most exacting scrutiny," and for the reasons stated in Johnson ...
the Government's interest cannot justify its infringement on First Amendment rights. We decline the Govern-
§                                                                                                            SPEECH AND EXPRESSION | 329

ment's invitation to reassess this conclusion in light of Congress' recent recognition of a purported "national
consensus" favoring a prohibition on flag burning. ... Even assuming such a consensus exists, any suggestion that
the Government's interest in suppressing speech becomes more weighty as popular opposition to that speech
grows is foreign to the First Amendment.

... Government may create national symbols, promote them, and encourage their respectful treatment. But the
Flag Protection Act of 1989 goes well beyond this by criminally proscribing expressive conduct because of its
likely communicative impact.

... "If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the Government may not prohibit
the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable." ... Punishing des-
ecration of the flag dilutes the very freedom that makes this emblem so revered, and worth revering. The judg-
ments of the District Courts are

Affirmed.

    Vote: 8-0
    Majority: Roberts, joined by Stevens, Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, Thomas, Ginsburg and Breyer

Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court

When law schools began restricting the access of military recruiters to their students because of disagreement
with the Government's policy on homosexuals in the military, Congress responded by enacting the Solomon
Amendment ... That provision specifies that if any part of an institution of higher education denies military
recruiters access equal to that provided other recruiters, the entire institution would lose certain federal funds.
The law schools responded by suing, alleging that the Solomon Amendment infringed their First Amendment
freedoms of speech and association. The District Court disagreed but was reversed by a divided panel of the
Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which ordered the District Court to enter a preliminary injunction
against enforcement of the Solomon Amendment. We granted certiorari.

Respondent Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc. (FAIR), is an association of law schools and law
faculties ... Its declared mission is "to promote academic freedom, support educational institutions in oppos-
ing discrimination and vindicate the rights of institutions of higher education." ... FAIR members have adopted
330 | SPEECH AND EXPRESSION

policies expressing their opposition to discrimination based on, among other factors, sexual orientation ... They
would like to restrict military recruiting on their campuses because they object to the policy Congress has
adopted with respect to homosexuals in the military ... The Solomon Amendment, however, forces institutions
to choose between enforcing their nondiscrimination policy against military recruiters in this way and continu-
ing to receive specified federal funding.

In 2003, FAIR sought a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the Solomon Amendment, which at
that time--it has since been amended--prevented the Department of Defense (DOD) from providing speci-
fied federal funds to any institution of higher education "that either prohibits, or in effect prevents" military
recruiters "from gaining entry to campuses." ... Although the statute required only "entry to campuses," the
Government--after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001--adopted an informal policy of " `requir[ing]
universities to provide military recruiters access to students equal in quality and scope to that provided to other
recruiters.' " ... Prior to the adoption of this policy, some law schools sought to promote their nondiscrimina-
tion policies while still complying with the Solomon Amendment by having military recruiters interview on the
undergraduate campus ... But under the equal access policy, military recruiters had to be permitted to interview
at the law schools, if other recruiters did so.

FAIR argued that this forced inclusion and equal treatment of military recruiters violated the law schools' First
Amendment freedoms of speech and association. According to FAIR, the Solomon Amendment was uncon-
stitutional because it forced law schools to choose between exercising their First Amendment right to decide
whether to disseminate or accommodate a military recruiter's message, and ensuring the availability of federal
funding for their universities.

We granted certiorari.

... The statute provides an exception for an institution with "a longstanding policy of pacifism based on historical
religious affiliation." ... The Government and FAIR agree on what this statute requires: In order for a law school
and its university to receive federal funding, the law school must offer military recruiters the same access to its
campus and students that it provides to the nonmilitary recruiter receiving the most favorable access ...

... [I]t [the Solomon Amendment] looks to the result achieved by the policy and compares the "access ... pro-
vided" military recruiters to that provided other recruiters. Applying the same policy to all recruiters is therefore
insufficient to comply with the statute if it results in a greater level of access for other recruiters than for the mili-
tary. Law schools must ensure that their recruiting policy operates in such a way that military recruiters are given
access to students at least equal to that "provided to any other employer." (Emphasis added.)

Not only does the text support this view, but this interpretation is necessary to give effect to the Solomon
Amendment's recent revision. Under the prior version, the statute required "entry" without specifying how mil-
itary recruiters should be treated once on campus ... Congress responded directly to this decision by codifying
the DOD policy ...
                                                                                                             SPEECH AND EXPRESSION | 331

We therefore read the Solomon Amendment the way both the Government and FAIR interpret it. It is insuffi-
cient for a law school to treat the military as it treats all other employers who violate its nondiscrimination policy.
Under the statute, military recruiters must be given the same access as recruiters who comply with the policy.

The Constitution grants Congress the power to "provide for the common Defence," "[t]o raise and support
Armies," and "[t]o provide and maintain a Navy." Congress' power in this area is "broad and sweeping," ...
But the fact that legislation that raises armies is subject to First Amendment constraints does not mean that we
ignore the purpose of this legislation when determining its constitutionality ...

Although Congress has broad authority to legislate on matters of military recruiting, it nonetheless chose
to secure campus access for military recruiters indirectly, through its Spending Clause power. The Solomon
Amendment gives universities a choice: Either allow military recruiters the same access to students afforded any
other recruiter or forgo certain federal funds. Congress' decision to proceed indirectly does not reduce the defer-
ence given to Congress in the area of military affairs. Congress' choice to promote its goal by creating a funding
condition deserves at least as deferential treatment as if Congress had imposed a mandate on universities.

...

This case does not require us to determine when a condition placed on university funding goes beyond the "rea-
sonable" choice ... and becomes an unconstitutional condition. It is clear that a funding condition cannot be
unconstitutional if it could be constitutionally imposed directly. Speiser v. Randall, (1958). Because the First
Amendment would not prevent Congress from directly imposing the Solomon Amendment's access require-
ment, the statute does not place an unconstitutional condition on the receipt of federal funds.

The Solomon Amendment neither limits what law schools may say nor requires them to say anything. Law
schools remain free under the statute to express whatever views they may have on the military's congressionally
mandated employment policy, all the while retaining eligibility for federal funds ... As a general matter, the
Solomon Amendment regulates conduct, not speech. It affects what law schools must do--afford equal access
to military recruiters--not what they may or may not say.

...

Some of this Court's leading First Amendment precedents have established the principle that freedom of speech
prohibits the government from telling people what they must say. ...

The Solomon Amendment does not require any similar expression by law schools. Nonetheless, recruiting assis-
tance provided by the schools often includes elements of speech. For example, schools may send e-mails or post
notices on bulletin boards on an employer's behalf ... Law schools offering such services to other recruiters must
also send e-mails and post notices on behalf of the military to comply with the Solomon Amendment. As FAIR
points out, these compelled statements of fact ("The U. S. Army recruiter will meet interested students in Room
123 at 11 a.m."), like compelled statements of opinion, are subject to First Amendment scrutiny ...
332 | SPEECH AND EXPRESSION

This sort of recruiting assistance, however, is a far cry from the compelled speech in Barnette and Wooley. The
Solomon Amendment, unlike the laws at issue in those cases, does not dictate the content of the speech at all,
which is only "compelled" if, and to the extent, the school provides such speech for other recruiters. There is
nothing in this case approaching a Government-mandated pledge or motto that the school must endorse.

The compelled speech to which the law schools point is plainly incidental to the Solomon Amendment's reg-
ulation of conduct ... Congress, for example, can prohibit employers from discriminating in hiring on the basis
of race. The fact that this will require an employer to take down a sign reading "White Applicants Only" hardly
means that the law should be analyzed as one regulating the employer's speech rather than conduct ... Com-
pelling a law school that sends scheduling e-mails for other recruiters to send one for a military recruiter is simply
not the same as forcing a student to pledge allegiance, or forcing a Jehovah's Witness to display the motto "Live
Free or Die," and it trivializes the freedom protected in Barnette and Wooley to suggest that it is.

... The compelled-speech violation in each of our prior cases, however, resulted from the fact that the complain-
ing speaker's own message was affected by the speech it was forced to accommodate. The expressive nature of a
parade was central to our holding in Hurley ... As a result, we held that the State's public accommodation law,
as applied to a private parade, "violates the fundamental rule of protection under the First Amendment, that a
speaker has the autonomy to choose the content of his own message."

... In this case, accommodating the military's message does not affect the law schools' speech, because the schools
are not speaking when they host interviews and recruiting receptions. Unlike a parade organizer's choice of
parade contingents, a law school's decision to allow recruiters on campus is not inherently expressive. Law
schools facilitate recruiting to assist their students in obtaining jobs. A law school's recruiting services lack the
expressive quality of a parade, a newsletter, or the editorial page of a newspaper; its accommodation of a military
recruiter's message is not compelled speech because the accommodation does not sufficiently interfere with any
message of the school.

...

Having rejected the view that the Solomon Amendment impermissibly regulates speech, we must still consider
whether the expressive nature of the conduct regulated by the statute brings that conduct within the First
Amendment 's protection. In O'Brien, we recognized that some forms of "`symbolic speech'" were deserving of
First Amendment protection. But we rejected the view that "conduct can be labeled `speech' whenever the per-
son engaging in the conduct intends thereby to express an idea." Instead, we have extended First Amendment
protection only to conduct that is inherently expressive. In Texas v. Johnson, for example, we applied O'Brien and
held that burning the American flag was sufficiently expressive to warrant First Amendment protection.

Unlike flag burning, the conduct regulated by the Solomon Amendment is not inherently expressive ... The
expressive component of a law school's actions is not created by the conduct itself but by the speech that accom-
panies it. The fact that such explanatory speech is necessary is strong evidence that the conduct at issue here is
not so inherently expressive that it warrants protection under O'Brien. If combining speech and conduct were
enough to create expressive conduct, a regulated party could always transform conduct into "speech" simply by
talking about it ... Neither O'Brien nor its progeny supports such a result.
                                                                                                             SPEECH AND EXPRESSION | 333

... We have held that "an incidental burden on speech is no greater than is essential, and therefore is permissible
under O'Brien, so long as the neutral regulation promotes a substantial government interest that would be
achieved less effectively absent the regulation." The Solomon Amendment clearly satisfies this requirement. Mil-
itary recruiting promotes the substantial Government interest in raising and supporting the Armed Forces--an
objective that would be achieved less effectively if the military were forced to recruit on less favorable terms than
other employers ... The issue is not whether other means of raising an army and providing for a navy might be
adequate ... That is a judgment for Congress, not the courts ... It suffices that the means chosen by Congress add
to the effectiveness of military recruitment. Accordingly, even if the Solomon Amendment were regarded as reg-
ulating expressive conduct, it would not violate the First Amendment under O'Brien.

... FAIR argues that the Solomon Amendment violates law schools' freedom of expressive association. According
to FAIR, law schools' ability to express their message that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is
wrong is significantly affected by the presence of military recruiters on campus and the schools' obligation to
assist them ...

... The Solomon Amendment, however, does not similarly affect a law school's associational rights. To comply
with the statute, law schools must allow military recruiters on campus and assist them in whatever way the
school chooses to assist other employers. Law schools therefore "associate" with military recruiters in the sense
that they interact with them. But recruiters are not part of the law school. Recruiters are, by definition, out-
siders who come onto campus for the limited purpose of trying to hire students--not to become members of
the school's expressive association. This distinction is critical ...

... Students and faculty are free to associate to voice their disapproval of the military's message; nothing about the
statute affects the composition of the group by making group membership less desirable. The Solomon Amend-
ment therefore does not violate a law school's First Amendment rights. A military recruiter's mere presence on
campus does not violate a law school's right to associate, regardless of how repugnant the law school considers
the recruiter's message.

...

In this case, FAIR has attempted to stretch a number of First Amendment doctrines well beyond the sort
of activities these doctrines protect. The law schools object to having to treat military recruiters like other
recruiters, but that regulation of conduct does not violate the First Amendment . To the extent that the Solomon
Amendment incidentally affects expression, the law schools' effort to cast themselves as just like the schoolchild-
ren in Barnette, the parade organizers in Hurley, and the Boy Scouts in Dale plainly overstates the expressive
nature of their activity and the impact of the Solomon Amendment on it, while exaggerating the reach of our
First Amendment precedents.

Because Congress could require law schools to provide equal access to military recruiters without violating the
schools' freedoms of speech or association, the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the Solomon Amend-
ment likely violates the First Amendment . We therefore reverse the judgment of the Third Circuit and remand
the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

315 U.S. 568 (1942)

    Vote: 9-0
    Decision: Affirmed
    Majority: Murphy, joined by Stone, Roberts, Black, Reed, Douglas, Byrnes, Jackson

Mr. Justice Murphy delivered the opinion of the Court.

Appellant, a member of the sect known as Jehovah's Witnesses, was convicted in the municipal court of
Rochester, New Hampshire, for violation of Chapter 378, § 2, of the Public Laws of New Hampshire:

      No person shall address any offensive, derisive or annoying word to any other person who is lawfully in any street
      or other public place, nor call him by any offensive or derisive name, nor make any noise or exclamation in his pres-
      ence and hearing with intent to deride, offend or annoy him, or to prevent him from pursuing his lawful business
      or occupation.

The complaint charged that appellant,

      with force and arms, in a certain public place in said city of Rochester, to-wit, on the public sidewalk on the east-
      erly side of Wakefield Street, near unto the entrance of the City Hall, did unlawfully repeat the words following,
      addressed to the complainant, that is to say, "You are a God damned racketeer" and "a damned Fascist and the
      whole government of Rochester are Fascists or agents of Fascists," the same being offensive, derisive and annoying
      words and names.

... Chaplinsky was distributing the literature of his sect on the streets of Rochester on a busy Saturday afternoon.
Members of the local citizenry complained to the City Marshal, Bowering, that Chaplinsky was denouncing all
religion as a "racket." Bowering told them that Chaplinsky was lawfully engaged, and then warned Chaplinsky
that the crowd was getting restless. Some time later, a disturbance occurred and the traffic officer on duty at the
busy intersection started with Chaplinsky for the police station, but did not inform him that he was under arrest
or that he was going to be arrested. On the way, they encountered Marshal Bowering, who had been advised that
a riot was under way and was therefore hurrying to the scene. Bowering repeated his earlier warning to Chaplin-
sky, who then addressed to Bowering the words set forth in the complaint.
336 | TYPES OF SPEECH

Chaplinsky's version of the affair was slightly different. He testified that, when he met Bowering, he asked him
to arrest the ones responsible for the disturbance. In reply, Bowering cursed him and told him to come along.
Appellant admitted that he said the words charged in the complaint, with the exception of the name of the Deity.

...

It is now clear that "Freedom of speech and freedom of the press, which are protected by the First Amendment
from infringement by Congress, are among the fundamental personal rights and liberties which are protected
by the Fourteenth Amendment from invasion by state action ..."

Allowing the broadest scope to the language and purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment, it is well understood
that the right of free speech is not absolute at all times and under all circumstances. There are certain well defined
and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to
raise any Constitutional problem. These include the lewd and obscene, the profane, the libelous, and the insult-
ing or "fighting" words -- those which, by their very utterance, inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate
breach of the peace. It has been well observed that such utterances are no essential part of any exposition of ideas,
and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly out-
weighed by the social interest in order and morality.

"Resort to epithets or personal abuse is not in any proper sense communication of information or opinion safe-
guarded by the Constitution, and its punishment as a criminal act would raise no question under that instru-
ment." Cantwell v. Connecticut (1940).

On the authority of its earlier decisions, the state court declared that the statute's purpose was to preserve the
public peace, no words being "forbidden except such as have a direct tendency to cause acts of violence by the
persons to whom, individually, the remark is addressed." It was further said:

"The word `offensive' is not to be defined in terms of what a particular addressee thinks. ... The test is what men
of common intelligence would understand would be words likely to cause an average addressee to fight. ... The
English language has a number of words and expressions which, by general consent, are `fighting words' when
said without a disarming smile. ... The statute, as construed, does no more than prohibit the face-to-face words
plainly likely to cause a breach of the peace by the addressee, words whose speaking constitutes a breach of the
peace by the speaker -- including `classical fighting words,' words in current use less `classical' but equally likely
to cause violence, and other disorderly words, including profanity, obscenity and threats."

We are unable to say that the limited scope of the statute as thus construed [by the New Hampshire Supreme
Court] contravenes the Constitutional right of free expression. It is a statute narrowly drawn and limited to
define and punish specific conduct lying within the domain of state power, the use in a public place of words
likely to cause a breach of the peace. This conclusion necessarily disposes of appellant's contention that the
statute is so vague and indefinite as to render a conviction thereunder a violation of due process. A statute pun-
ishing verbal acts, carefully drawn so as not unduly to impair liberty of expression, is not too vague for a criminal
law.
§                                                                                                                       TYPES OF SPEECH | 337

Nor can we say that the application of the statute to the facts disclosed by the record substantially or unreason-
ably impinges upon the privilege of free speech. Argument is unnecessary to demonstrate that the appellations
"damned racketeer" and "damned Fascist" are epithets likely to provoke the average person to retaliation, and
thereby cause a breach of the peace.

The refusal of the state court to admit evidence of provocation and evidence bearing on the truth or falsity of
the utterances is open to no Constitutional objection. Whether the facts sought to be proved by such evidence
constitute a defense to the charge, or may be shown in mitigation, are questions for the state court to determine.
Our function is fulfilled by a determination that the challenged statute, on its face and as applied, does not con-
travene the Fourteenth Amendment.

Affirmed.

Cohen v. California

403 U.S. 15 (1971)

    Vote: 5-4
    Decision: Reversed
    Majority: Harlan, joined by Douglas, Brennan, Stewart, and Marshall
    Dissent: Blackmun, joined by Burger, Black, and White (in part)

Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case may seem at first blush too inconsequential to find its way into our books, but the issue it presents is
of no small constitutional significance.

Appellant Paul Robert Cohen was convicted in the Los Angeles Municipal Court of violating that part of Cali-
fornia Penal Code § 415 which prohibits "maliciously and willfully disturb[ing] the peace or quiet of any neigh-
borhood or person ... by ... offensive conduct. ..." He was given 30 days' imprisonment. The facts upon which
his conviction rests are detailed in the opinion of the Court of Appeal of California, Second Appellate District,
as follows:

      "On April 26, 1968, the defendant was observed in the Los Angeles County Courthouse in the corridor outside
      of division 20 of the municipal court wearing a jacket bearing the words `Fuck the Draft' which were plainly visi-
      ble. There were women and children present in the corridor. The defendant was arrested. The defendant testified
      that he wore the jacket knowing that the words were on the jacket as a means of informing the public of the depth
      of his feelings against the Vietnam War and the draft.
338 | TYPES OF SPEECH

      "The defendant did not engage in, nor threaten to engage in, nor did anyone as the result of his conduct in fact
      commit or threaten to commit any act of violence. The defendant did not make any loud or unusual noise, nor
      was there any evidence that he uttered any sound prior to his arrest."

In affirming the conviction the Court of Appeal held that "offensive conduct" means "behavior which has a ten-
dency to provoke others to acts of violence or to in turn disturb the peace," and that the State had proved this ele-
ment because, on the facts of this case, "[i]t was certainly reasonably foreseeable that such conduct might cause
others to rise up to commit a violent act against the person of the defendant or attempt to forcibly remove his
jacket." The California Supreme Court declined review by a divided vote ... We now reverse ...

In order to lay hands on the precise issue which this case involves, it is useful first to canvass various matters
which this record does not present.

The conviction quite clearly rests upon the asserted offensiveness of the words Cohen used to convey his message
to the public. The only "conduct" which the State sought to punish is the fact of communication. Thus, we
deal here with a conviction resting solely upon "speech," not upon any separately identifiable conduct which
allegedly was intended by Cohen to be perceived by others as expressive of particular views but which, on its
face, does not necessarily convey any message and hence arguably could be regulated without effectively repress-
ing Cohen's ability to express himself. Further, the State certainly lacks power to punish Cohen for the under-
lying content of the message the inscription conveyed. At least so long as there is no showing of an intent to
incite disobedience to or disruption of the draft, Cohen could not, consistently with the First and Fourteenth
Amendments, be punished for asserting the evident position on the inutility or immorality of the draft his jacket
reflected.

Appellant's conviction, then, rests squarely upon his exercise of the "freedom of speech" protected from arbi-
trary governmental interference by the Constitution and can be justified, if at all, only as a valid regulation of
the manner in which he exercised that freedom, not as a permissible prohibition on the substantive message it
conveys. This does not end the inquiry, of course, for the First and Fourteenth Amendments have never been
thought to give absolute protection to every individual to speak whenever or wherever he pleases, or to use any
form of address in any circumstances that he chooses. In this vein, too, however, we think it important to note
that several issues typically associated with such problems are not presented here.

In the first place, Cohen was tried under a statute applicable throughout the entire State. Any attempt to support
this conviction on the ground that the statute seeks to preserve an appropriately decorous atmosphere in the
courthouse where Cohen was arrested must fail in the absence of any language in the statute that would have
put appellant on notice that certain kinds of otherwise permissible speech or conduct would nevertheless, under
California law, not be tolerated in certain places. No fair reading of the phrase "offensive conduct" can be said
sufficiently to inform the ordinary person that distinctions between certain locations are thereby created.

In the second place, as it comes to us, this case cannot be said to fall within those relatively few categories of
instances where prior decisions have established the power of government to deal more comprehensively with
certain forms of individual expression simply upon a showing that such a form was employed. This is not, for
example, an obscenity case. Whatever else may be necessary to give rise to the States' broader power to prohibit
                                                                                                                        TYPES OF SPEECH | 339

obscene expression, such expression must be, in some significant way, erotic. It cannot plausibly be maintained
that this vulgar allusion to the Selective Service System would conjure up such psychic stimulation in anyone
likely to be confronted with Cohen's crudely defaced jacket.

This Court has also held that the States are free to ban the simple use, without a demonstration of additional jus-
tifying circumstances, of so-called "fighting words," those personally abusive epithets which, when addressed to
the ordinary citizen, are, as a matter of common knowledge, inherently likely to provoke violent reaction. Chap­
linsky v. New Hampshire, (1942). While the four-letter word displayed by Cohen in relation to the draft is not
uncommonly employed in a personally provocative fashion, in this instance it was clearly not "directed to the
person of the hearer." Cantwell v. Connecticut, (1940). No individual actually or likely to be present could rea-
sonably have regarded the words on appellant's jacket as a direct personal insult. Nor do we have here an instance
of the exercise of the State's police power to prevent a speaker from intentionally provoking a given group to
hostile reaction. There is, as noted above, no showing that anyone who saw Cohen was in fact violently aroused
or that appellant intended such a result.

Finally, in arguments before this Court much has been made of the claim that Cohen's distasteful mode of
expression was thrust upon unwilling or unsuspecting viewers, and that the State might therefore legitimately
act as it did in order to protect the sensitive from otherwise unavoidable exposure to appellant's crude form of
protest. Of course, the mere presumed presence of unwitting listeners or viewers does not serve automatically
to justify curtailing all speech capable of giving offense. While this Court has recognized that government may
properly act in many situations to prohibit intrusion into the privacy of the home of unwelcome views and ideas
which cannot be totally banned from the public dialogue, we have at the same time consistently stressed that
"we are often `captives' outside the sanctuary of the home and subject to objectionable speech." The ability of
government, consonant with the Constitution, to shut off discourse solely to protect others from hearing it is,
in other words, dependent upon a showing that substantial privacy interests are being invaded in an essentially
intolerable manner. Any broader view of this authority would effectively empower a majority to silence dissi-
dents simply as a matter of personal predilections.

In this regard, persons confronted with Cohen's jacket were in a quite different posture than, say, those subjected
to the raucous emissions of sound trucks blaring outside their residences. Those in the Los Angeles courthouse
could effectively avoid further bombardment of their sensibilities simply by averting their eyes ... Given the sub-
tlety and complexity of the factors involved, if Cohen's "speech" was otherwise entitled to constitutional protec-
tion, we do not think the fact that some unwilling "listeners" in a public building may have been briefly exposed
to it can serve to justify this breach of the peace conviction where, as here, there was no evidence that persons
powerless to avoid appellant's conduct did in fact object to it, and where that portion of the statute upon which
Cohen's conviction rests evinces no concern, either on its face or as construed by the California courts, with the
special plight of the captive auditor, but, instead, indiscriminately sweeps within its prohibitions all "offensive
conduct" that disturbs "any neighborhood or person."

Against this background, the issue flushed by this case stands out in bold relief. It is whether California can
excise, as "offensive conduct," one particular scurrilous epithet from the public discourse, either upon the the-
340 | TYPES OF SPEECH

ory of the court below that its use is inherently likely to cause violent reaction or upon a more general assertion
that the States, acting as guardians of public morality, may properly remove this offensive word from the public
vocabulary.

The rationale of the California court is plainly untenable ... We have been shown no evidence that substantial
numbers of citizens are standing ready to strike out physically at whoever may assault their sensibilities with exe-
crations like that uttered by Cohen. There may be some persons about with such lawless and violent proclivi-
ties, but that is an insufficient base upon which to erect, consistently with constitutional values, a governmental
power to force persons who wish to ventilate their dissident views into avoiding particular forms of expression.
The argument amounts to little more than the self-defeating proposition that to avoid physical censorship of
one who has not sought to provoke such a response by a hypothetical coterie of the violent and lawless, the States
may more appropriately effectuate that censorship themselves.

...

At the outset, we cannot overemphasize that, in our judgment, most situations where the State has a justifiable
interest in regulating speech will fall within one or more of the various established exceptions, discussed above
but not applicable here, to the usual rule that governmental bodies may not prescribe the form or content of
individual expression. Equally important to our conclusion is the constitutional backdrop against which our
decision must be made. The constitutional right of free expression is powerful medicine in a society as diverse
and populous a ours. It is designed and intended to remove governmental restraints from the arena of public
discussion, putting the decision as to what views shall be voiced largely into the hands of each of us, in the hope
that use of such freedom will ultimately produce a more capable citizenry and more perfect polity and in the
belief that no other approach would comport with the premise of individual dignity and choice upon which our
political system rests.

Against this perception of the constitutional policies involved, we discern certain more particularized consid-
erations that peculiarly call for reversal of this conviction. First, the principle contended for by the State seems
inherently boundless. How is one to distinguish this from any other offensive word? ... For, while the particular
four-letter word being litigated here is perhaps more distasteful than most others of its genre, it is nevertheless
often true that one man's vulgarity is another's lyric. Indeed, we think it is largely because governmental officials
cannot make principled distinctions in this area that the Constitution leaves matters of taste and style so largely
to the individual.

Additionally, we cannot overlook the fact, because it is well illustrated by the episode involved here, that much
linguistic expression serves a dual communicative function: it conveys not only ideas capable of relatively pre-
cise, detached explication, but otherwise inexpressible emotions as well. In fact, words are often chosen as much
for their emotive as their cognitive force. We cannot sanction the view that the Constitution, while solicitous of
the cognitive content of individual speech, has little or no regard for that emotive function which, practically
speaking, may often be the more important element of the overall message sought to be communicated.

...
§                                                                                                                        TYPES OF SPEECH | 341

It is, in sum, our judgment that, absent a more particularized and compelling reason for its actions, the State
may not, consistently with the First and Fourteenth Amendments, make the simple public display here involved
of this single four-letter expletive a criminal offense. Because that is the only arguably sustainable rationale for
the conviction here at issue, the judgment below must be

Reversed.

Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.

The question presented in this case is whether the First Amendment permits the Minnesota Supreme Court to
prohibit candidates for judicial election in that State from announcing their views on disputed legal and political
issues.

Since Minnesota's admission to the Union in 1858, the State's Constitution has provided for the selection of all
state judges by popular election. Minn. Const., Art. VI, §7. Since 1912, those elections have been nonpartisan.
Since 1974, they have been subject to a legal restriction which states that a "candidate for a judicial office, includ-
ing an incumbent judge," shall not "announce his or her views on disputed legal or political issues." Minn. Code
of Judicial Conduct, Canon 5(A)(3)(d)(i) (2000). This prohibition, promulgated by the Minnesota Supreme
Court and based on Canon 7(B) of the 1972 American Bar Association (ABA) Model Code of Judicial Con-
duct, is known as the "announce clause." Incumbent judges who violate it are subject to discipline, including
removal, censure, civil penalties, and suspension without pay. Lawyers who run for judicial office also must com-
ply with the announce clause. Minn. Rule of Professional Conduct 8.2(b) (2002) ... Those who violate it are
subject to ... disbarment, suspension, and probation.
342 | TYPES OF SPEECH

In 1996, one of the petitioners, Gregory Wersal, ran for associate justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court. In
the course of the campaign, he distributed literature criticizing several Minnesota Supreme Court decisions on
issues such as crime, welfare, and abortion. A complaint against Wersal challenging, among other things, the pro-
priety of this literature was filed with the Office of Lawyers Professional Responsibility, the agency which, under
the direction of the Minnesota Lawyers Professional Responsibility Board, investigates and prosecutes ethical
violations of lawyer candidates for judicial office. The Lawyers Board dismissed the complaint; with regard to the
charges that his campaign materials violated the announce clause, it expressed doubt whether the clause could
constitutionally be enforced. Nonetheless, fearing that further ethical complaints would jeopardize his ability
to practice law, Wersal withdrew from the election. In 1998, Wersal ran again for the same office. Early in that
race, he sought an advisory opinion from the Lawyers Board with regard to whether it planned to enforce the
announce clause. The Lawyers Board responded equivocally, stating that, although it had significant doubts
about the constitutionality of the provision, it was unable to answer his question because he had not submitted
a list of the announcements he wished to make.

Shortly thereafter, Wersal filed this lawsuit in Federal District Court against respondents, seeking, inter alia, a
declaration that the announce clause violates the First Amendment and an injunction against its enforcement.
Wersal alleged that he was forced to refrain from announcing his views on disputed issues during the 1998 cam-
paign, to the point where he declined response to questions put to him by the press and public, out of concern
that he might run afoul of the announce clause. Other plaintiffs in the suit, including the Minnesota Republican
Party, alleged that, because the clause kept Wersal from announcing his views, they were unable to learn those
views and support or oppose his candidacy accordingly. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment,
and the District Court found in favor of respondents, holding that the announce clause did not violate the First
Amendment. Over a dissent by Judge Beam, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed.
We granted certiorari.

Before considering the constitutionality of the announce clause, we must be clear about its meaning. Its text
says that a candidate for judicial office shall not "announce his or her views on disputed legal or political issues."
Minn. Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 5(A)(3)(d)(i) (2002).

We know that "announc[ing] ... views" on an issue covers much more than promising to decide an issue a partic-
ular way. The prohibition extends to the candidate's mere statement of his current position, even if he does not
bind himself to maintain that position after election. All the parties agree this is the case, because the Minnesota
Code contains a so-called "pledges or promises" clause, which separately prohibits judicial candidates from mak-
ing "pledges or promises of conduct in office other than the faithful and impartial performance of the duties of
the office," ibid.-a prohibition that is not challenged here and on which we express no view.

... In any event, it is clear that the announce clause prohibits a judicial candidate from stating his views on any
specific nonfanciful legal question within the province of the court for which he is running, except in the con-
text of discussing past decisions-and in the latter context as well, if he expresses the view that he is not bound by
stare decisis.
                                                                                                                        TYPES OF SPEECH | 343

Respondents contend that this still leaves plenty of topics for discussion on the campaign trail. These include
a candidate's "character," "education," "work habits," and "how [he] would handle administrative duties if
elected." Indeed, the Judicial Board has printed a list of preapproved questions which judicial candidates are
allowed to answer ... Whether this list of preapproved subjects, and other topics not prohibited by the announce
clause, adequately fulfill the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech is the question to which we
now turn.

... The Court of Appeals concluded that the proper test to be applied to determine the constitutionality of such
a restriction is what our cases have called strict scrutiny; the parties do not dispute that this is correct. Under the
strict-scrutiny test, respondents have the burden to prove that the announce clause is (1) narrowly tailored, to
serve (2) a compelling state interest. In order for respondents to show that the announce clause is narrowly tai-
lored, they must demonstrate that it does not "unnecessarily circumscrib[e] protected expression."

The Court of Appeals concluded that respondents had established two interests as sufficiently compelling to
justify the announce clause: preserving the impartiality of the state judiciary and preserving the appearance of
impartiality of the state judiciary ... the first is compelling because it protects the due process rights of litigants,
and that the second is compelling because it preserves public confidence in the judiciary. Respondents are rather
vague, however, about what they mean by "impartiality." Indeed, although the term is used throughout the
Eighth Circuit's opinion, the briefs, the Minnesota Code of Judicial Conduct, and the ABA Codes of Judi-
cial Conduct, none of these sources bothers to define it. Clarity on this point is essential before we can decide
whether impartiality is indeed a compelling state interest, and, if so, whether the announce clause is narrowly
tailored to achieve it.

One meaning of "impartiality" in the judicial context-and of course its root meaning-is the lack of bias for or
against either party to the proceeding. Impartiality in this sense assures equal application of the law. That is, it
guarantees a party that the judge who hears his case will apply the law to him in the same way he applies it to any
other party ...

We think it plain that the announce clause is not narrowly tailored to serve impartiality (or the appearance of
impartiality) in this sense. Indeed, the clause is barely tailored to serve that interest at all, inasmuch as it does not
restrict speech for or against particular parties, but rather speech for or against particular issues. To be sure, when
a case arises that turns on a legal issue on which the judge (as a candidate) had taken a particular stand, the party
taking the opposite stand is likely to lose. But not because of any bias against that party, or favoritism toward the
other party. Any party taking that position is just as likely to lose. The judge is applying the law (as he sees it)
evenhandedly.

... Respondents argue that the announce clause serves the interest in openmindedness, or at least in the appear-
ance of openmindedness, because it relieves a judge from pressure to rule a certain way in order to maintain con-
sistency with statements the judge has previously made. The problem is, however, that statements in election
campaigns are such an infinitesimal portion of the public commitments to legal positions that judges (or judges-
to-be) undertake, that this object of the prohibition is implausible ...
§344 | TYPES OF SPEECH

The short of the matter is this: In Minnesota, a candidate for judicial office may not say "I think it is consti-
tutional for the legislature to prohibit same-sex marriages." He may say the very same thing, however, up until
the very day before he declares himself a candidate, and may say it repeatedly (until litigation is pending) after
he is elected. As a means of pursuing the objective of open-mindedness that respondents now articulate, the
announce clause is so woefully underinclusive as to render belief in that purpose a challenge to the credulous ...

... The Minnesota Supreme Court's canon of judicial conduct prohibiting candidates for judicial election from
announcing their views on disputed legal and political issues violates the First Amendment. Accordingly, we
reverse the grant of summary judgment to respondents and remand the case for proceedings consistent with this
opinion.

It is so ordered.

United States v. Alvarez

567 U.S. 709 (2012)

    Vote: 6-3
    Decision: Affirmed
    Plurality: Kennedy, joined by Roberts, Ginsburg, and Sotomayor
    Concurrence: Breyer (in judgment), joined by Kagan
    Dissent: Alito, joined by Scalia and Thomas

Justice Kennedy announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which The Chief Justice,
Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Sotomayor join.

Lying was his habit. Xavier Alvarez, the respondent here, lied when he said that he played hockey for the Detroit
Red Wings and that he once married a starlet from Mexico. But when he lied in announcing he held the Con-
gressional Medal of Honor, respondent ventured onto new ground; for that lie violates a federal criminal statute,
the Stolen Valor Act of 2005. 18 U. S. C. §704.

In 2007, respondent attended his first public meeting as a board member of the Three Valley Water District
Board. The board is a governmental entity with headquarters in Claremont, California. He introduced himself
as follows: "I'm a retired marine of 25 years. I retired in the year 2001. Back in 1987, I was awarded the Congres-
sional Medal of Honor. I got wounded many times by the same guy." None of this was true. For all the record
                                                                                                                        TYPES OF SPEECH | 345

shows, respondent's statements were but a pathetic attempt to gain respect that eluded him. The statements do
not seem to have been made to secure employment or financial benefits or admission to privileges reserved for
those who had earned the Medal.

Respondent was indicted under the Stolen Valor Act for lying about the Congressional Medal of Honor at
the meeting. The United States District Court for the Central District of California rejected his claim that the
statute is invalid under the First Amendment. Respondent pleaded guilty to one count, reserving the right to
appeal on his First Amendment claim. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in a decision
by a divided panel, found the Act invalid under the First Amendment and reversed the conviction. With further
opinions on the issue, and over a dissent by seven judges, rehearing en banc was denied. This Court granted cer-
tiorari.

After certiorari was granted, and in an unrelated case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit,
also in a decision by a divided panel, found the Act constitutional. United States v. Strandlof, (2012). So there is
now a conflict in the Courts of Appeals on the question of the Act's validity.

... It is right and proper that Congress, over a century ago, established an award so the Nation can hold in its
highest respect and esteem those who, in the course of carrying out the "supreme and noble duty of contribut-
ing to the defense of the rights and honor of the nation," have acted with extraordinary honor. And it should
be uncontested that this is a legitimate Government objective, indeed a most valued national aspiration and pur-
pose. This does not end the inquiry, however. Fundamental constitutional principles require that laws enacted
to honor the brave must be consistent with the precepts of the Constitution for which they fought.

... When content-based speech regulation is in question ... exacting scrutiny is required. Statutes suppressing or
restricting speech must be judged by the sometimes inconvenient principles of the First Amendment. By this
measure, the statutory provisions under which respondent was convicted must be held invalid, and his convic-
tion must be set aside.

Respondent's claim to hold the Congressional Medal of Honor was false. There is no room to argue about inter-
pretation or shades of meaning. On this premise, respondent violated §704(b); and, because the lie concerned
the Congressional Medal of Honor, he was subject to an enhanced penalty under subsection (c). Those statu-
tory provisions are as follows:

      "(b) False Claims About Receipt of Military Decorations or Medals.-Whoever falsely represents himself or her-
      self, verbally or in writing, to have been awarded any decoration or medal authorized by Congress for the Armed
      Forces of the United States ... shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than six months, or both.

      "(c) Enhanced Penalty for Offenses Involving Congressional Medal of Honor.-

      "(1) In General.-If a decoration or medal involved in an offense under subsection (a) or (b) is a Congressional
      Medal of Honor, in lieu of the punishment provided in that subsection, the offender shall be fined under this title,
      imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both."

Respondent challenges the statute as a content-based suppression of pure speech, speech not falling within any
of the few categories of expression where content-based regulation is permissible. The Government defends the
346 | TYPES OF SPEECH

statute as necessary to preserve the integrity and purpose of the Medal, an integrity and purpose it contends are
compromised and frustrated by the false statements the statute prohibits. It argues that false statements "have
no First Amendment value in themselves," and thus "are protected only to the extent needed to avoid chilling
fully protected speech." Although the statute covers respondent's speech, the Government argues that it leaves
breathing room for protected speech, for example speech which might criticize the idea of the Medal or the
importance of the military. The Government's arguments cannot suffice to save the statute.

... In light of the substantial and expansive threats to free expression posed by content-based restrictions, this
Court has rejected as "startling and dangerous" a "free-floating test for First Amendment coverage ... Instead,
content-based restrictions on speech have been permitted, as a general matter, only when confined to the few "
`historic and traditional categories [of expression] long familiar to the bar.' ... These categories have a historical
foundation in the Court's free speech tradition ...

Absent from those few categories where the law allows content-based regulation of speech is any general excep-
tion to the First Amendment for false statements. This comports with the common understanding that some
false statements are inevitable if there is to be an open and vigorous expression of views in public and private
conversation, expression the First Amendment seeks to guarantee ...

The Government disagrees with this proposition. It cites language from some of this Court's precedents to sup-
port its contention that false statements have no value and hence no First Amendment protection. These iso-
lated statements in some earlier decisions do not support the Government's submission that false statements, as a
general rule, are beyond constitutional protection. That conclusion would take the quoted language far from its
proper context. For instance, the Court has stated "[f]alse statements of fact are particularly valueless [because]
they interfere with the truth-seeking function of the marketplace of ideas," Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell,
(1988), and that false statements "are not protected by the First Amendment in the same manner as truthful
statements," Brown v. Hartlage, (1982) ...

These quotations all derive from cases discussing defamation, fraud, or some other legally cognizable harm asso-
ciated with a false statement, such as an invasion of privacy or the costs of vexatious litigation. In those decisions
the falsity of the speech at issue was not irrelevant to our analysis, but neither was it determinative. The Court
has never endorsed the categorical rule the Government advances: that false statements receive no First Amend-
ment protection. Our prior decisions have not confronted a measure, like the Stolen Valor Act, that targets fal-
sity and nothing more.

Even when considering some instances of defamation and fraud, moreover, the Court has been careful to
instruct that falsity alone may not suffice to bring the speech outside the First Amendment. The statement must
be a knowing or reckless falsehood.

... The requirements of a knowing falsehood or reckless disregard for the truth as the condition for recovery in
certain defamation cases exists to allow more speech, not less. A rule designed to tolerate certain speech ought
not blossom to become a rationale for a rule restricting it.
                                                                                                                        TYPES OF SPEECH | 347

The Government then gives three examples of regulations on false speech that courts generally have found per-
missible: first, the criminal prohibition of a false statement made to a Government official, 18 U. S. C. §1001;
second, laws punishing perjury; and third, prohibitions on the false representation that one is speaking as a Gov-
ernment official or on behalf of the Government, see, e.g., §912; §709. These restrictions, however, do not estab-
lish a principle that all proscriptions of false statements are exempt from exacting First Amendment scrutiny.

The federal statute prohibiting false statements to Government officials punishes "whoever, in any matter within
the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government ... makes any materially false,
fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation." §1001. Section 1001's prohibition on false statements
made to Government officials, in communications concerning official matters, does not lead to the broader
proposition that false statements are unprotected when made to any person, at any time, in any context.

The same point can be made about what the Court has confirmed is the "unquestioned constitutionality of
perjury statutes," both the federal statute, §1623, and its state-law equivalents. It is not simply because perjured
statements are false that they lack First Amendment protection ... Perjury undermines the function and province
of the law and threatens the integrity of judgments that are the basis of the legal system. Unlike speech in other
contexts, testimony under oath has the formality and gravity necessary to remind the witness that his or her state-
ments will be the basis for official governmental action, action that often affects the rights and liberties of others.
Sworn testimony is quite distinct from lies not spoken under oath and simply intended to puff up oneself.

Statutes that prohibit falsely representing that one is speaking on behalf of the Government, or that prohibit
impersonating a Government officer, also protect the integrity of Government processes, quite apart from
merely restricting false speech ...

As our law and tradition show, then, there are instances in which the falsity of speech bears upon whether it is
protected. Some false speech may be prohibited even if analogous true speech could not be ... But [this opinion]
rejects the notion that false speech should be in a general category that is presumptively unprotected.

... Before exempting a category of speech from the normal prohibition on content-based restrictions, however,
the Court must be presented with "persuasive evidence that a novel restriction on content is part of a long
(if heretofore unrecognized) tradition of proscription," Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Assn., (2011). The
Government has not demonstrated that false statements generally should constitute a new category of unpro-
tected speech on this basis.

The probable, and adverse, effect of the Act on freedom of expression illustrates, in a fundamental way, the rea-
sons for the Law's distrust of content-based speech prohibitions.

The Act by its plain terms applies to a false statement made at any time, in any place, to any person. It can be
assumed that it would not apply to, say, a theatrical performance. Still, the sweeping, quite unprecedented reach
of the statute puts it in conflict with the First Amendment. Here the lie was made in a public meeting, but the
statute would apply with equal force to personal, whispered conversations within a home. The statute seeks to
control and suppress all false statements on this one subject in almost limitless times and settings. And it does so
entirely without regard to whether the lie was made for the purpose of material gain.
348 | TYPES OF SPEECH

Permitting the government to decree this speech to be a criminal offense, whether shouted from the rooftops
or made in a barely audible whisper, would endorse government authority to compile a list of subjects about
which false statements are punishable. That governmental power has no clear limiting principle ... Were this law
to be sustained, there could be an endless list of subjects the National Government or the States could single
out. Where false claims are made to effect a fraud or secure moneys or other valuable considerations, say offers of
employment, it is well established that the Government may restrict speech without affronting the First Amend-
ment ... But the Stolen Valor Act is not so limited in its reach. Were the Court to hold that the interest in truth-
ful discourse alone is sufficient to sustain a ban on speech, absent any evidence that the speech was used to gain
a material advantage, it would give government a broad censorial power unprecedented in this Court's cases or
in our constitutional tradition. The mere potential for the exercise of that power casts a chill, a chill the First
Amendment cannot permit if free speech, thought, and discourse are to remain a foundation of our freedom.

The previous discussion suffices to show that the Act conflicts with free speech principles. But even when exam-
ined within its own narrow sphere of operation, the Act cannot survive. In assessing content-based restrictions
on protected speech, the Court has not adopted a free-wheeling approach, but rather has applied the "most
exacting scrutiny." Although the objectives the Government seeks to further by the statute are not without sig-
nificance, the Court must, and now does, find the Act does not satisfy exacting scrutiny.

The Government is correct when it states military medals "serve the important public function of recognizing
and expressing gratitude for acts of heroism and sacrifice in military service," and also " `foste[r] morale, mission
accomplishment and esprit de corps' among service members." ...

But to recite the Government's compelling interests is not to end the matter. The First Amendment requires
that the Government's chosen restriction on the speech at issue be "actually necessary" to achieve its interest.
There must be a direct causal link between the restriction imposed and the injury to be prevented. The link
between the Government's interest in protecting the integrity of the military honors system and the Act's restric-
tion on the false claims of liars like respondent has not been shown ... It must be acknowledged that when a
pretender claims the Medal to be his own, the lie might harm the Government by demeaning the high purpose
of the award, diminishing the honor it confirms, and creating the appearance that the Medal is awarded more
often than is true. Furthermore, the lie may offend the true holders of the Medal. From one perspective it insults
their bravery and high principles when falsehood puts them in the unworthy company of a pretender.

Yet these interests do not satisfy the Government's heavy burden when it seeks to regulate protected speech. The
Government points to no evidence to support its claim that the public's general perception of military awards is
diluted by false claims such as those made by Alvarez ...

The lack of a causal link between the Government's stated interest and the Act is not the only way in which the
Act is not actually necessary to achieve the Government's stated interest. The Government has not shown, and
cannot show, why counterspeech would not suffice to achieve its interest ...

The remedy for speech that is false is speech that is true. This is the ordinary course in a free society. The response
to the unreasoned is the rational; to the uninformed, the enlightened; to the straight-out lie, the simple truth ...
The First Amendment itself ensures the right to respond to speech we do not like, and for good reason. Freedom
                                                                                                                        TYPES OF SPEECH | 349

of speech and thought flows not from the beneficence of the state but from the inalienable rights of the person.
And suppression of speech by the government can make exposure of falsity more difficult, not less so. Society
has the right and civic duty to engage in open, dynamic, rational discourse. These ends are not well served when
the government seeks to orchestrate public discussion through content-based mandates.

... The American people do not need the assistance of a government prosecution to express their high regard for
the special place that military heroes hold in our tradition. Only a weak society needs government protection or
intervention before it pursues its resolve to preserve the truth. Truth needs neither handcuffs nor a badge for its
vindication.

In addition, when the Government seeks to regulate protected speech, the restriction must be the "least restric-
tive means among available, effective alternatives." There is, however, at least one less speech-restrictive means by
which the Government could likely protect the integrity of the military awards system. A Government-created
database could list Congressional Medal of Honor winners. Were a database accessible through the Internet, it
would be easy to verify and expose false claims. It appears some private individuals have already created databases
similar to this, and at least one database of past winners is online and fully searchable ... The Solicitor General
responds that although Congress and the Department of Defense investigated the feasibility of establishing a
database in 2008, the Government "concluded that such a database would be impracticable and insufficiently
comprehensive." Without more explanation, it is difficult to assess the Government's claim, especially when at
least one database of Congressional Medal of Honor winners already exists.

...

The Nation well knows that one of the costs of the First Amendment is that it protects the speech we detest as
well as the speech we embrace. Though few might find respondent's statements anything but contemptible, his
right to make those statements is protected by the Constitution's guarantee of freedom of speech and expres-
sion. The Stolen Valor Act infringes upon speech protected by the First Amendment.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Elonis v. United States

575 U.S. 723 (2015)

    Vote: 7-2
    Majority: Roberts, joined by Scalia, Kennedy, Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan
    Concur/Dissent: Alito
    Dissent: Thomas
    Note: In the majority's opinion, Elonis is a statutory case involving potentially threatening posts delivered
    over social media. Justice Thomas notes the First Amendment implications in his dissent.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.

Federal law makes it a crime to transmit in interstate commerce "any communication containing any threat ...
to injure the person of another." 18 U. S. C. §875I. Petitioner was convicted of violating this provision under
instructions that required the jury to find that he communicated what a reasonable person would regard as a
threat. The question is whether the statute also requires that the defendant be aware of the threatening nature
of the communication, and--if not--whether the First Amendment requires such a showing.

Anthony Douglas Elonis was an active user of the social networking Web site Facebook. Users of that Web site
may post items on their Facebook page that are accessible to other users, including Facebook "friends" who are
notified when new content is posted. In May 2010, Elonis's wife of nearly seven years left him, taking with her
their two young children. Elonis began "listening to more violent music" and posting self-styled "rap" lyrics
inspired by the music ... Eventually, Elonis changed the user name on his Facebook page from his actual name to
a rap-style nom de plume, "Tone Dougie," to distinguish himself from his "on-line persona." ... The lyrics Elo-
nis posted as "Tone Dougie " included graphically violent language and imagery. This material was often inter-
spersed with disclaimers that the lyrics were "fictitious," with no intentional "resemblance to real persons." ...
Elonis posted an explanation to another Facebook user that "I'm doing this for me. My writing is therapeutic."

Elonis's co-workers and friends viewed the posts in a different light. Around Halloween of 2010, Elonis posted
a photograph of himself and a co-worker at a "Halloween Haunt" event at the amusement park where they
worked. In the photograph, Elonis was holding a toy knife against his co-worker's neck, and in the caption Elonis
wrote, " I wish." ... Elonis was not Facebook friends with the co-worker and did not "tag" her, a Facebook feature
that would have alerted her to the posting ... But the chief of park security was a Facebook "friend" of Elonis,
saw the photograph, and fired him ...

In response, Elonis posted a new entry on his Facebook page:

"Moles! Didn't I tell y'all I had several? Y'all sayin' I had access to keys for all the f***in' gates. That I have sinister
plans for all my friends and must have taken home a couple. Y'all think it's too dark and foggy to secure your
facility from a man as mad as me? You see, even without a paycheck, I'm still the main attraction. Whoever
thought the Halloween Haunt could be so f***in' scary?"
                                                                                                                         TYPES OF SPEECH | 351

This post became the basis for Count One of Elonis's subsequent indictment, threatening park patrons and
employees.

Elonis's posts frequently included crude, degrading, and violent material about his soon-to-be ex-wife. Shortly
after he was fired, Elonis posted an adaptation of a satirical sketch that he and his wife had watched together ...
In the actual sketch, called "It's Illegal to Say ...," a comedian explains that it is illegal for a person to say he wishes
to kill the President, but not illegal to explain that it is illegal for him to say that. When Elonis posted the script
of the sketch, however, he substituted his wife for the President. This posting was part of the basis for Count
Two of the indictment, threatening his wife ...

" ... I also found out that it's incredibly illegal, extremely illegal to go on Facebook and say something like the
best place to fire a mortar launcher at her house would be from the cornfield behind it because of easy access to
a getaway road and you'd have a clear line of sight through the sun room. ...

Yet even more illegal to show an illustrated diagram.

[diagram of the house]. ..."

The details about the home were accurate. At the bottom of the post, Elonis included a link to the video of the
original skit, and wrote, "Art is about pushing limits. I'm willing to go to jail for my Constitutional rights. Are
you?"

After viewing some of Elonis's posts, his wife felt "extremely afraid for [her] life." A state court granted her
a three-year protection-from-abuse order against Elonis (essentially, a restraining order). Elonis referred to the
order in another post on his "Tone Dougie" page, also included in Count Two of the indictment:

"Fold up your [protection-from-abuse order] and put it in your pocket
Is it thick enough to stop a bullet?
Try to enforce an Order
that was improperly granted in the first place
Me thinks the Judge needs an education
on true threat jurisprudence
And prison time'll add zeros to my settlement ...
And if worse comes to worse
I've got enough explosives
to take care of the State Police and the Sheriff 's Department."

At the bottom of this post was a link to the Wikipedia article on "Freedom of speech." Elonis's reference to the
police was the basis for Count Three of his indictment, threatening law enforcement officers.

That same month, interspersed with posts about a movie Elonis liked and observations on a comedian's social
commentary, Elonis posted an entry that gave rise to Count Four of his indictment:

I'm checking out and making a name for myself
Enough elementary schools in a ten mile radius
to initiate the most heinous school shooting ever imagined
And hell hath no fury like a crazy man in a Kindergarten class
The only question is ... which one?"

Meanwhile, park security had informed both local police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation about Elonis's
posts, and FBI Agent Denise Stevens had created a Facebook account to monitor his online activity ... After the
post about a school shooting, Agent Stevens and her partner visited Elonis at his house ... Following their visit,
during which Elonis was polite but uncooperative, Elonis posted another entry on his Face- book page, called
"Little Agent Lady which led to Count Five ...

A grand jury indicted Elonis for making threats to injure patrons and employees of the park, his estranged wife,
police officers, a kindergarten class, and an FBI agent, all in violation of 18 U. S. C. §875(c). In the District
Court, Elonis moved to dismiss the indictment for failing to allege that he had intended to threaten anyone. The
District Court denied the motion, holding that Third Circuit precedent required only that Elonis "intention-
ally made the communication, not that he intended to make a threat." At trial, Elonis testified that his posts
emulated the rap lyrics of the well-known performer Eminem, some of which involve fantasies about killing his
ex-wife ... The Government presented as witnesses Elonis's wife and co-workers, all of whom said they felt afraid
and viewed Elonis's posts as serious threats ...

Elonis requested a jury instruction that "the government must prove that he intended to communicate a true
threat." ... The District Court denied that request. The jury instructions instead informed the jury that

"A statement is a true threat when a defendant intentionally makes a statement in a context or under such cir-
cumstances wherein a reasonable person would foresee that the statement would be interpreted by those to
whom the maker communicates the statement as a serious expression of an intention to inflict bodily injury or
take the life of an individual."

The Government's closing argument emphasized that it was irrelevant whether Elonis intended the postings to
be threats--"it doesn't matter what he thinks." A jury convicted Elonis on four of the five counts against him,
acquitting only on the charge of threatening park patrons and employees ... Elonis was sentenced to three years,
eight months' imprisonment and three years' supervised release.

Elonis renewed his challenge to the jury instructions in the Court of Appeals, contending that the jury should
have been required to find that he intended his posts to be threats. The Court of Appeals disagreed, holding that
the intent required by Section 875(c) is only the intent to communicate words that the defendant understands,
and that a reasonable person would view as a threat ...

We granted certiorari.
                                                                                                                        TYPES OF SPEECH | 353

... This statute requires that a communication be transmitted and that the communication contain a threat. It
does not specify that the defendant must have any mental state with respect to these elements. In particular, it
does not indicate whether the defendant must intend that his communication contain a threat.

Elonis argues that the word "threat" itself in Section 875(c) imposes such a requirement. According to Elonis,
every definition of "threat" or "threaten" conveys the notion of an intent to inflict harm ...

These definitions, however, speak to what the statement conveys--not to the mental state of the author. For
example, an anonymous letter that says "I'm going to kill you" is "an expression of an intention to inflict loss or
harm" regardless of the author's intent. A victim who receives that letter in the mail has received a threat, even if
the author believes (wrongly) that his message will be taken as a joke.

For its part, the Government argues that Section 875(c) should be read in light of its neighboring provisions,
Sections 875(b) and 875(d). Those provisions also prohibit certain types of threats, but expressly include a men-
tal state requirement of an "intent to extort." ... According to the Government, the express "intent to extort"
requirements ... should preclude courts from implying an unexpressed "intent to threaten" requirement in Sec-
tion 875(c).

The Government takes this expressio unius est exclusio alterius [the expression of one thing excludes others]
canon too far. The fact that Congress excluded the requirement of an "intent to extort" from Section 875(c) is
strong evidence that Congress did not mean to confine Section 875(c) to crimes of extortion. But that does not
suggest that Congress, at the same time, also meant to exclude a requirement that a defendant act with a certain
mental state in communicating a threat. The most we can conclude from the language of Section 875(c) and its
neighboring provisions is that Congress meant to proscribe a broad class of threats in Section 875(c), but did
not identify what mental state, if any, a defendant must have to be convicted.

In sum, neither Elonis nor the Government has identified any indication of a particular mental state requirement
in the text of Section 875(c).

The fact that the statute does not specify any required mental state, however, does not mean that none exists
... The "central thought" is that a defendant must be "blameworthy in mind" before he can be found guilty, a
concept courts have expressed over time through various terms such as mens rea, scienter, malice aforethought,
guilty knowledge, and the like ...

This is not to say that a defendant must know that his conduct is illegal before he may be found guilty. The
familiar maxim "ignorance of the law is no excuse" typically holds true. Instead, our cases have explained that
a defendant generally must "know the facts that make his conduct fit the definition of the offense," Staples v.
United States, (1994), even if he does not know that those facts give rise to a crime ...

... in Liparota v. United States, (1985), we considered a statute making it a crime to knowingly possess or use
food stamps in an unauthorized manner. The Government's argument, similar to its position in this case, was
that a defendant's conviction could be upheld if he knowingly possessed or used the food stamps, and in fact his
possession or use was unauthorized. But this Court rejected that interpretation of the statute, because it would
354 | TYPES OF SPEECH

have criminalized "a broad range of apparently innocent conduct" and swept in individuals who had no knowl-
edge of the facts that made their conduct blameworthy. For example, the statute made it illegal to use food
stamps at a store that charged higher prices to food stamp customers. Without a mental state requirement in
the statute, an individual who unwittingly paid higher prices would be guilty under the Government's inter-
pretation. The Court noted that Congress could have intended to cover such a "broad range of conduct," but
declined "to adopt such a sweeping interpretation" in the absence of a clear indication that Congress intended
that result. The Court instead construed the statute to require knowledge of the facts that made the use of the
food stamps unauthorized.

...

When interpreting federal criminal statutes that are silent on the required mental state, we read into the
statute "only that mens rea which is necessary to separate wrongful conduct from `otherwise innocent con-
duct.' " Carter v. United States, (2000).

Section 875(c), as noted, requires proof that a communication was transmitted and that it contained a threat ...
The parties agree that a defendant under Section 875(c) must know that he is transmitting a communication.
But communicating something is not what makes the conduct "wrongful." Here "the crucial element separating
legal innocence from wrongful conduct" is the threatening nature of the communication. The mental state
requirement must therefore apply to the fact that the communication contains a threat.

Elonis's conviction, however, was premised solely on how his posts would be understood by a reasonable person.
Such a "reasonable person" standard is a familiar feature of civil liability in tort law, but is inconsistent with "the
conventional requirement for criminal conduct--awareness of some wrongdoing." Staples, (quoting United
States v. Dotterweich, (1943); emphasis added) ...

... That is precisely the Government's position here: Elonis can be convicted, the Government contends, if he
himself knew the contents and context of his posts, and a reasonable person would have recognized that the
posts would be read as genuine threats. That is a negligence standard.

...

In light of the foregoing, Elonis's conviction cannot stand. The jury was instructed that the Government need
prove only that a reasonable person would regard Elonis's communications as threats, and that was error. Fed-
eral criminal liability generally does not turn solely on the results of an act without considering the defendant's
mental state ...

The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded
for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

JUSTICE THOMAS, dissenting.
                                                                                                                        TYPES OF SPEECH | 355

We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict in the lower courts over the appropriate mental state for threat prosecu-
tions under 18 U. S. C. §875(c). Save two, every Circuit to have considered the issue--11 in total--has held that
this provision demands proof only of general intent, which here requires no more than that a defendant knew
he transmitted a communication, knew the words used in that communication, and understood the ordinary
meaning of those words in the relevant context. The outliers are the Ninth and Tenth Circuits, which have con-
cluded that proof of an intent to threaten was necessary for conviction. Adopting the minority position, Elonis
urges us to hold that §875(c) and the First Amendment require proof of an intent to threaten. The Government
in turn advocates a general-intent approach.

Rather than resolve the conflict, the Court casts aside the approach used in nine Circuits and leaves nothing
in its place. Lower courts are thus left to guess at the appropriate mental state for §875(c). All they know after
today's decision is that a requirement of general intent will not do. But they can safely infer that a majority of
this Court would not adopt an intent-to-threaten requirement, as the opinion carefully leaves open the possibil-
ity that recklessness may be enough ...

This failure to decide throws everyone from appellate judges to everyday Facebook users into a state of uncer-
tainty. This uncertainty could have been avoided had we simply adhered to the background rule of the common
law favoring general intent. Although I am sympathetic to my colleagues' policy concerns about the risks asso-
ciated with threat prosecutions, the answer to such fears is not to discard our traditional approach to state-of-
mind requirements in criminal law. Because the Court of Appeals properly applied the general-intent standard,
and because the communications transmitted by Inis were "true threats" unprotected by the First Amendment,
I would affirm the judgment below ...

I respectfully dissent.

Hate Speech

R.A.V. v. St Paul

505 U.S. 377 (1992)

    Concurrence: Blackmun
    Concurrence: Stevens, joined by White (in part), and Blackmun (in part)

Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.

In the predawn hours of June 21, 1990, petitioner and several other teenagers allegedly assembled a crudely made
cross by taping together broken chair legs. They then allegedly burned the cross inside the fenced yard of a black
family ... Although this conduct could have been punished under any of a number of laws, one of the two pro-
visions under which respondent city of St. Paul chose to charge petitioner (then a juvenile) was the St. Paul Bias-
Motivated Crime Ordinance, St. Paul, Minn., Legis. Code 292.02 (1990), which provides:

      "Whoever places on public or private property a symbol, object, appellation, characterization or graffiti, including,
      but not limited to, a burning cross or Nazi swastika, which one knows or has reasonable grounds to know arouses
      anger, alarm or resentment in others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender commits disorderly con-
      duct and shall be guilty of a misdemeanor."

Petitioner moved to dismiss this count on the ground that the St. Paul ordinance was substantially overbroad
and impermissibly content based, and therefore facially invalid under the First Amendment. The trial court
granted this motion, but the Minnesota Supreme Court reversed. That court rejected petitioner's overbreadth
claim because, as construed in prior Minnesota cases, the modifying phrase "arouses anger, alarm or resentment
in others" limited the reach of the ordinance to conduct that amounts to "fighting words." Chaplinsky v. New
Hampshire, (1942). The court also concluded that the ordinance was not impermissibly content based because,
in its view, "the ordinance is a narrowly tailored means toward accomplishing the compelling governmental
interest in protecting the community against bias-motivated threats to public safety and order." We granted cer-
tiorari.

In construing the St. Paul ordinance, we are bound by the construction given to it by the Minnesota court.
Accordingly, we accept the Minnesota Supreme Court's authoritative statement that the ordinance reaches only
those expressions that constitute "fighting words" within the meaning of Chaplinsky ... Assuming, arguendo,
that all of the expression reached by the ordinance is proscribable under the "fighting words" doctrine, we
nonetheless conclude that the ordinance is facially unconstitutional in that it prohibits otherwise permitted
speech solely on the basis of the subjects the speech addresses.
                                                                                                                               HATE SPEECH | 357

The First Amendment generally prevents government from proscribing speech or even expressive conduct
because of disapproval of the ideas expressed. Content-based regulations are presumptively invalid. From 1791
to the present, however, our society, like other free but civilized societies, has permitted restrictions upon the
content of speech in a few limited areas ... We have recognized that "the freedom of speech" referred to by the
First Amendment does not include a freedom to disregard these traditional limitations [obscenity, defamation,
fighting words] ...

We have sometimes said that these categories of expression are "not within the area of constitutionally protected
speech," or that the "protection of the First Amendment does not extend" to them. Such statements must be
taken in context, however, and are no more literally true than is the occasionally repeated shorthand character-
izing obscenity "as not being speech at all." What they mean is that these areas of speech can, consistently with
the First Amendment, be regulated because of their constitutionally proscribable content (obscenity, defamation,
etc.) - not that they are categories of speech entirely invisible to the Constitution ... Thus, the government may
proscribe libel; but it may not make the further content discrimination of proscribing only libel critical of the
government ...

The proposition that a particular instance of speech can be proscribable on the basis of one feature (e.g., obscen-
ity) but not on the basis of another (e.g., opposition to the city government) is commonplace and has found
application in many contexts. We have long held, for example, that nonverbal expressive activity can be banned
because of the action it entails, but not because of the ideas it expresses - so that burning a flag in violation of an
ordinance against outdoor fires could be punishable, whereas burning a flag in violation of an ordinance against
dishonoring the flag is not ... And just as the power to proscribe particular speech on the basis of a non-content
element (e.g., noise) does not entail the power to proscribe the same speech on the basis of a content element, so
also the power to proscribe it on the basis of one content element (e.g., obscenity) does not entail the power to
proscribe it on the basis of other content elements.

In other words, the exclusion of "fighting words" from the scope of the First Amendment simply means that, for
purposes of that Amendment, the unprotected features of the words are, despite their verbal character, essen-
tially a "nonspeech" element of communication. Fighting words are thus analogous to a noisy sound truck: each
is, as Justice Frankfurter recognized, a "mode of speech," both can be used to convey an idea; but neither has,
in and of itself, a claim upon the First Amendment. As with the sound truck, however, so also with fighting
words: the government may not regulate use based on hostility - or favoritism - towards the underlying message
expressed ...

When the basis for the content discrimination consists entirely of the very reason the entire class of speech at
issue is proscribable, no significant danger of idea or viewpoint discrimination exists. Such a reason, having been
adjudged neutral enough to support exclusion of the entire class of speech from First Amendment protection,
is also neutral enough to form the basis of distinction within the class. To illustrate: a State might choose to pro-
hibit only that obscenity which is the most patently offensive in its prurience - i.e., that which involves the most
lascivious displays of sexual activity. But it may not prohibit, for example, only that obscenity which includes
offensive political messages. And the Federal Government can criminalize only those threats of violence that
are directed against the President, see 18 U.S.C. 871 - since the reasons why threats of violence are outside the
358 | HATE SPEECH

First Amendment (protecting individuals from the fear of violence, from the disruption that fear engenders, and
from the possibility that the threatened violence will occur) have special force when applied to the person of the
President ... But the Federal Government may not criminalize only those threats against the President that men-
tion his policy on aid to inner cities ...

Another valid basis for according differential treatment to even a content-defined subclass of proscribable speech
is that the subclass happens to be associated with particular "secondary effects" of the speech, so that the reg-
ulation is "justified without reference to the content of the ... speech." A State could, for example, permit all
obscene live performances except those involving minors. Moreover, since words can in some circumstances vio-
late laws directed not against speech but against conduct (a law against treason, for example, is violated by telling
the enemy the Nation's defense secrets), a particular content-based subcategory of a proscribable class of speech
can be swept up incidentally within the reach of a statute directed at conduct, rather than speech ... Where the
government does not target conduct on the basis of its expressive content, acts are not shielded from regulation
merely because they express a discriminatory idea or philosophy.

... There may be other such bases as well ... Save for that limitation, the regulation of "fighting words," like the
regulation of noisy speech, may address some offensive instances and leave other, equally offensive, instances
alone.

Applying these principles to the St. Paul ordinance, we conclude that, even as narrowly construed by the
Minnesota Supreme Court, the ordinance is facially unconstitutional. Although the phrase in the ordinance,
"arouses anger, alarm or resentment in others," has been limited by the Minnesota Supreme Court's construc-
tion to reach only those symbols or displays that amount to "fighting words," the remaining, unmodified terms
make clear that the ordinance applies only to "fighting words" that insult, or provoke violence, "on the basis of
race, color, creed, religion or gender." Displays containing abusive invective, no matter how vicious or severe,
are permissible unless they are addressed to one of the specified disfavored topics. Those who wish to use "fight-
ing words" in connection with other ideas - to express hostility, for example, on the basis of political affilia-
tion, union membership, or homosexuality - are not covered. The First Amendment does not permit St. Paul
to impose special prohibitions on those speakers who express views on disfavored subjects.

In its practical operation, moreover, the ordinance goes even beyond mere content discrimination to actual view-
point discrimination. Displays containing some words - odious racial epithets, for example - would be prohib-
ited to proponents of all views. But "fighting words" that do not themselves invoke race, color, creed, religion, or
gender - aspersions upon a person's mother, for example - would seemingly be usable ad libitum in the placards
of those arguing in favor of racial, color, etc., tolerance and equality, but could not be used by those speakers'
opponents. One could hold up a sign saying, for example, that all "anti-Catholic bigots" are misbegotten; but
not that all "papists" are, for that would insult and provoke violence "on the basis of religion." St. Paul has no
such authority to license one side of a debate to fight freestyle, while requiring the other to follow Marquis of
Queensberry rules.

What we have here, it must be emphasized, is not a prohibition of fighting words that are directed at certain
persons or groups (which would be facially valid if it met the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause);
                                                                                                                              HATE SPEECH | 359

but rather, a prohibition of fighting words that contain (as the Minnesota Supreme Court repeatedly empha-
sized) messages of "bias-motivated" hatred and, in particular, as applied to this case, messages "based on virulent
notions of racial supremacy." One must wholeheartedly agree with the Minnesota Supreme Court that "[i]t is
the responsibility, even the obligation, of diverse communities to confront such notions in whatever form they
appear," but the manner of that confrontation cannot consist of selective limitations upon speech ... The point
of the First Amendment is that majority preferences must be expressed in some fashion other than silencing
speech on the basis of its content.

Despite the fact that the Minnesota Supreme Court and St. Paul acknowledge that the ordinance is directed
at expression of group hatred, Justice Stevens suggests that this "fundamentally misreads" the ordinance. It is
directed, he claims, not to speech of a particular content, but to particular "injur[ies]" that are "qualitatively
different" from other injuries. This is wordplay. What makes the anger, fear, sense of dishonor, etc., produced
by violation of this ordinance distinct from the anger, fear, sense of dishonor, etc., produced by other fighting
words is nothing other than the fact that it is caused by a distinctive idea, conveyed by a distinctive message. The
First Amendment cannot be evaded that easily ...

Finally, St. Paul and its amici defend the conclusion of the Minnesota Supreme Court that, even if the ordinance
regulates expression based on hostility towards its protected ideological content, this discrimination is nonethe-
less justified because it is narrowly tailored to serve compelling state interests. Specifically, they assert that the
ordinance helps to ensure the basic human rights of members of groups that have historically been subjected to
discrimination, including the right of such group members to live in peace where they wish. We do not doubt
that these interests are compelling, and that the ordinance can be said to promote them. But the "danger of cen-
sorship" presented by a facially content-based statute, requires that that weapon be employed only where it is
"necessary to serve the asserted [compelling] interest." The existence of adequate content-neutral alternatives
thus "undercut[s] significantly" any defense of such a statute, casting considerable doubt on the government's
protestations that "the asserted justification is in fact an accurate description of the purpose and effect of the
law." The dispositive question in this case, therefore, is whether content discrimination is reasonably necessary
to achieve St. Paul's compelling interests; it plainly is not. An ordinance not limited to the favored topics, for
example, would have precisely the same beneficial effect ...

Let there be no mistake about our belief that burning a cross in someone's front yard is reprehensible. But St.
Paul has sufficient means at its disposal to prevent such behavior without adding the First Amendment to the
fire.

The judgment of the Minnesota Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings not incon-
sistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice White, with whom Justice Blackmun and Justice O'Connor join, and with whom Justice Stevens joins
except as to Part I-A, concurring in the judgment.
360 | HATE SPEECH

I agree with the majority that the judgment of the Minnesota Supreme Court should be reversed. However, our
agreement ends there.

This case could easily be decided within the contours of established First Amendment law by holding, as peti-
tioner argues, that the St. Paul ordinance is fatally overbroad because it criminalizes not only unprotected expres-
sion but expression protected by the First Amendment.

...

Any contribution of this holding to First Amendment jurisprudence is surely a negative one, since it necessarily
signals that expressions of violence, such as the message of intimidation and racial hatred conveyed by burning
a cross on someone's lawn, are of sufficient value to outweigh the social interest in order and morality that has
traditionally placed such fighting words outside the First Amendment. Indeed, by characterizing fighting words
as a form of "debate," the majority legitimates hate speech as a form of public discussion ...

As with its rejection of the Court's categorical analysis, the majority offers no reasoned basis for discarding our
firmly established strict scrutiny analysis at this time. The majority appears to believe that its doctrinal revision-
ism is necessary to prevent our elected lawmakers from prohibiting libel against members of one political party,
but not another, and from enacting similarly preposterous laws. The majority is misguided.

Although the First Amendment does not apply to categories of unprotected speech, such as fighting words,
the Equal Protection Clause requires that the regulation of unprotected speech be rationally related to a legiti-
mate government interest. A defamation statute that drew distinctions on the basis of political affiliation or "an
ordinance prohibiting only those legally obscene works that contain criticism of the city government," would
unquestionably fail rational-basis review. * * *

...

The Court has patched up its argument with an apparently nonexhaustive list of ad hoc exceptions, in what can
be viewed either as an attempt to confine the effects of its decision to the facts of this case, or as an effort to antic-
ipate some of the questions that will arise from its radical revision of First Amendment law ...

The exception swallows the majority's rule. Certainly, it should apply to the St. Paul ordinance, since "the rea-
sons why [fighting words] are outside the First Amendment ... have special force when applied to [groups that
have historically been subjected to discrimination]."

To avoid the result of its own analysis, the Court suggests that fighting words are simply a mode of communi-
cation, rather than a content-based category, and that the St. Paul ordinance has not singled out a particularly
objectionable mode of communication. Again, the majority confuses the issue. A prohibition on fighting words
is not a time, place, or manner restriction; it is a ban on a class of speech that conveys an overriding message of
personal injury and imminent violence, a message that is at its ugliest when directed against groups that have
long been the targets of discrimination. Accordingly, the ordinance falls within the first exception to the major-
ity's theory.
§                                                                                                                              HATE SPEECH | 361

... As I see it, the Court's theory does not work, and will do nothing more than confuse the law. Its selection
of this case to rewrite First Amendment law is particularly inexplicable, because the whole problem could have
been avoided by deciding this case under settled First Amendment principles ...

Wisconsin v. Mitchell

508 U.S. 476 (1993)

    Vote: 9-0
    Majority: Rehnquist, joined by White, Blackmun, Stevens, O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, Souter and Thomas

Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the unanimous Court.

Respondent Todd Mitchell's sentence for aggravated battery was enhanced because he intentionally selected his
victim on account of the victim's race. The question presented in this case is whether this penalty enhancement
is prohibited by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. We hold that it is not.

On the evening of October 7, 1989, a group of young black men and boys, including Mitchell, gathered at an
apartment complex in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Several members of the group discussed a scene from the motion
picture "Mississippi Burning" in which a white man beat a young black boy who was praying. The group moved
outside and Mitchell asked them: "`Do you all feel hyped up to move on some white people?'" Shortly thereafter,
a young white boy approached the group on the opposite side of the street where they were standing. As the boy
walked by, Mitchell said: "`You all want to fuck somebody up? There goes a white boy; go get him.'" Mitchell
counted to three and pointed in the boy's direction. The group ran toward the boy, beat him severely, and stole
his tennis shoes. The boy was rendered unconscious and remained in a coma for four days.

After a jury trial in the Circuit Court for Kenosha County, Mitchell was convicted of aggravated battery ... That
offense ordinarily carries a maximum sentence of two years' imprisonment. But because the jury found that
Mitchell had intentionally selected his victim because of the boy's race, the maximum sentence for Mitchell's
offense was increased to seven years under 939.645. That provision enhances the maximum penalty for an
offense whenever the defendant "[i]ntentionally selects the person against whom the crime ... is committed ...
because of the race, religion, color, disability, sexual orientation, national origin or ancestry of that person. ..."
939.645(1)(b). The Circuit Court sentenced Mitchell to four years' imprisonment for the aggravated battery.

Mitchell unsuccessfully sought postconviction relief in the Circuit Court. Then he appealed his conviction and
sentence, challenging the constitutionality of Wisconsin's penalty-enhancement provision on First Amendment
grounds. The Wisconsin Court of Appeals rejected Mitchell's challenge, but the Wisconsin Supreme Court
362 | HATE SPEECH

reversed. The [WI] Supreme Court held that the statute "violates the First Amendment directly by punishing
what the legislature has deemed to be offensive thought." It rejected the State's contention "that the statute pun-
ishes only the `conduct' of intentional selection of a victim." According to the court, "[t]he statute punishes
the "because of" aspect of the defendant's selection, the reason the defendant selected the victim, the motive
behind the selection." And under R.A.V. v. St. Paul, (1992), "the Wisconsin legislature cannot criminalize big-
oted thought with which it disagrees."

The [WI] Supreme Court also held that the penalty-enhancement statute was unconstitutionally overbroad. It
reasoned that, in order to prove that a defendant intentionally selected his victim because of the victim's pro-
tected status, the State would often have to introduce evidence of the defendant's prior speech, such as racial
epithets he may have uttered before the commission of the offense. This evidentiary use of protected speech, the
court thought, would have a "chilling effect" on those who feared the possibility of prosecution for offenses sub-
ject to penalty enhancement. Finally, the court distinguished antidiscrimination laws, which have long been held
constitutional, on the ground that the Wisconsin statute punishes the "subjective mental process" of selecting
a victim because of his protected status, whereas antidiscrimination laws prohibit "objective acts of discrimina-
tion."

We granted certiorari because of the importance of the question presented and the existence of a conflict of
authority among state high courts on the constitutionality of statutes similar to Wisconsin's penalty-enhance-
ment provision. We reverse.

Mitchell argues that we are bound by the Wisconsin Supreme Court's conclusion that the statute punishes big-
oted thought, and not conduct. There is no doubt that we are bound by a state court's construction of a state
statute ... But here the Wisconsin Supreme Court did not, strictly speaking, construe the Wisconsin statute in
the sense of defining the meaning of a particular statutory word or phrase. Rather, it merely characterized the
"practical effect" of the statute for First Amendment purposes. This assessment does not bind us ...

But the fact remains that, under the Wisconsin statute, the same criminal conduct may be more heavily punished
if the victim is selected because of his race or other protected status than if no such motive obtained. Thus,
although the statute punishes criminal conduct, it enhances the maximum penalty for conduct motivated by a
discriminatory point of view more severely than the same conduct engaged in for some other reason or for no
reason at all. Because the only reason for the enhancement is the defendant's discriminatory motive for selecting
his victim, Mitchell argues (and the Wisconsin Supreme Court held) that the statute violates the First Amend-
ment by punishing offenders' bigoted beliefs.

Traditionally, sentencing judges have considered a wide variety of factors in addition to evidence bearing on guilt
in determining what sentence to impose on a convicted defendant ... Thus, in many States, the commission of a
murder or other capital offense for pecuniary gain is a separate aggravating circumstance under the capital sen-
tencing statute.

But it is equally true that a defendant's abstract beliefs, however obnoxious to most people, may not be taken
into consideration by a sentencing judge ...
                                                                                                                              HATE SPEECH | 363

Mitchell argues that the Wisconsin penalty-enhancement statute is invalid because it punishes the defendant's
discriminatory motive, or reason, for acting. But motive plays the same role under the Wisconsin statute as it
does under federal and state antidiscrimination laws, which we have previously upheld against constitutional
challenge. Title VII, of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, for example, makes it unlawful for an employer to discrim-
inate against an employee "because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." (emphasis
added.) ... And more recently, in R.A.V. v. St. Paul, we cited Title VII ... as an example of a permissible content-
neutral regulation of conduct.

Nothing in our decision last Term in R.A.V. compels a different result here ... But whereas the ordinance struck
down in R.A.V. was explicitly directed at expression, the statute in this case is aimed at conduct unprotected by
the First Amendment.

Moreover, the Wisconsin statute singles out for enhancement bias-inspired conduct because this conduct is
thought to inflict greater individual and societal harm. For example, according to the State and its amici, bias-
motivated crimes are more likely to provoke retaliatory crimes, inflict distinct emotional harms on their victims,
and incite community unrest ... The State's desire to redress these perceived harms provides an adequate explana-
tion for its penalty-enhancement provision over and above mere disagreement with offenders' beliefs or biases.
As Blackstone said long ago, "it is but reasonable that, among crimes of different natures, those should be most
severely punished which are the most destructive of the public safety and happiness."

Finally, there remains to be considered Mitchell's argument that the Wisconsin statute is unconstitutionally
overbroad because of its "chilling effect" on free speech. Mitchell argues (and the Wisconsin Supreme Court
agreed) that the statute is "overbroad" because evidence of the defendant's prior speech or associations may be
used to prove that the defendant intentionally selected his victim on account of the victim's protected status.
Consequently, the argument goes, the statute impermissibly chills free expression with respect to such matters
by those concerned about the possibility of enhanced sentences if they should, in the future, commit a criminal
offense covered by the statute. We find no merit in this contention.

The sort of chill envisioned here is far more attenuated and unlikely than that contemplated in traditional "over-
breadth" cases. We must conjure up a vision of a Wisconsin citizen suppressing his unpopular bigoted opin-
ions for fear that, if he later commits an offense covered by the statute, these opinions will be offered at trial to
establish that he selected his victim on account of the victim's protected status, thus qualifying him for penalty-
enhancement. To stay within the realm of rationality, we must surely put to one side minor misdemeanor
offenses covered by the statute, such as negligent operation of a motor vehicle for it is difficult, if not impossible,
to conceive of a situation where such offenses would be racially motivated. We are left, then, with the prospect
of a citizen suppressing his bigoted beliefs for fear that evidence of such beliefs will be introduced against him at
trial if he commits a more serious offense against person or property. This is simply too speculative a hypothesis
to support Mitchell's overbreadth claim ...
§364 | HATE SPEECH

For the foregoing reasons, we hold that Mitchell's First Amendment rights were not violated by the application
of the Wisconsin penalty-enhancement provision in sentencing him. The judgment of the Supreme Court of
Wisconsin is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opin-
ion.

It is so ordered.

Justice O'Connor announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect
to Parts I, II, and III, and an opinion with respect to Parts IV and V, in which The Chief Justice, Justice Stevens,
and Justice Breyer join.

In this case we consider whether the Commonwealth of Virginia's statute banning cross burning with "an intent
to intimidate a person or group of persons" violates the First Amendment ... We conclude that while a State,
consistent with the First Amendment, may ban cross burning carried out with the intent to intimidate, the pro-
vision in the Virginia statute treating any cross burning as prima facie evidence of intent to intimidate renders
the statute unconstitutional in its current form.

Respondents Barry Black, Richard Elliott, and Jonathan O'Mara were convicted separately of violating Vir-
ginia's cross-burning statute, §18.2-423. That statute provides:

      "It shall be unlawful for any person or persons, with the intent of intimidating any person or group of persons, to
      burn, or cause to be burned, a cross on the property of another, a highway or other public place. Any person who
      shall violate any provision of this section shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony.

      "Any such burning of a cross shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to intimidate a person or group of persons."
                                                                                                                              HATE SPEECH | 365

On August 22, 1998, Barry Black led a Ku Klux Klan rally in Carroll County, Virginia. Twenty-five to thirty
people attended this gathering, which occurred on private property with the permission of the owner, who was
in attendance. The property was located on an open field just off Brushy Fork Road (State Highway 690) in
Cana, Virginia.

When the sheriff of Carroll County learned that a Klan rally was occurring in his county, he went to observe it
from the side of the road. During the approximately one hour that the sheriff was present, about 40 to 50 cars
passed the site, a "few" of which stopped to ask the sheriff what was happening on the property. Eight to ten
houses were located in the vicinity of the rally. Rebecca Sechrist, who was related to the owner of the property
where the rally took place, "sat and watched to see wha[t] [was] going on" ...

During the rally, Sechrist heard Klan members speak about "what they were" and "what they believed in." The
speakers "talked real bad about the blacks and the Mexicans. One speaker told the assembled gathering that "he
would love to take a .30/.30 and just random[ly] shoot the blacks." The speakers also talked about "President
Clinton and Hillary Clinton," and about how their tax money "goes to ... the black people." Sechrist testified
that this language made her "very ... scared."

At the conclusion of the rally, the crowd circled around a 25- to 30-foot cross. The cross was between 300 and
350 yards away from the road. According to the sheriff, the cross "then all of a sudden ... went up in a flame." As
the cross burned, the Klan played Amazing Grace over the loudspeakers. Sechrist stated that the cross burning
made her feel "awful" and "terrible."

When the sheriff observed the cross burning, he ... went down the driveway, entered the rally, and asked "who
was responsible for burning the cross." Black responded, "I guess I am because I'm the head of the rally." The
sheriff then told Black, "[T]here's a law in the State of Virginia that you cannot burn a cross and I'll have to place
you under arrest for this."

Black was charged with burning a cross with the intent of intimidating a person or group of persons, in violation
of §18.2-423. At his trial, the jury was instructed that "intent to intimidate means the motivation to intention-
ally put a person or a group of persons in fear of bodily harm. Such fear must arise from the willful conduct of
the accused rather than from some mere temperamental timidity of the victim." The trial court also instructed
the jury that "the burning of a cross by itself is sufficient evidence from which you may infer the required intent."
When Black objected to this last instruction on First Amendment grounds, the prosecutor responded that the
instruction was "taken straight out of the [Virginia] Model Instructions." The jury found Black guilty, and fined
him $2,500. The Court of Appeals of Virginia affirmed Black's conviction.

On May 2, 1998, respondents Richard Elliott and Jonathan O'Mara, as well as a third individual, attempted
to burn a cross on the yard of James Jubilee. Jubilee, an African-American, was Elliott's next-door neighbor in
Virginia Beach, Virginia. Four months prior to the incident, Jubilee and his family had moved from California
to Virginia Beach. Before the cross burning, Jubilee spoke to Elliott's mother to inquire about shots being fired
from behind the Elliott home. Elliott's mother explained to Jubilee that her son shot firearms as a hobby, and
that he used the backyard as a firing range.
366 | HATE SPEECH

On the night of May 2, respondents drove a truck onto Jubilee's property, planted a cross, and set it on fire.
Their apparent motive was to "get back" at Jubilee for complaining about the shooting in the backyard. Respon-
dents were not affiliated with the Klan. The next morning, as Jubilee was pulling his car out of the driveway, he
noticed the partially burned cross approximately 20 feet from his house. After seeing the cross, Jubilee was "very
nervous" because he "didn't know what would be the next phase," and because "a cross burned in your yard ...
tells you that it's just the first round."

Elliott and O'Mara were charged with attempted cross burning and conspiracy to commit cross burning.
O'Mara pleaded guilty to both counts, reserving the right to challenge the constitutionality of the cross-burning
statute. The judge sentenced O'Mara to 90 days in jail and fined him $2,500. The judge also suspended 45 days
of the sentence and $1,000 of the fine.

At Elliott's trial, the judge originally ruled that the jury would be instructed "that the burning of a cross by itself
is sufficient evidence from which you may infer the required intent." At trial, however, the court instructed the
jury that the Commonwealth must prove that "the defendant intended to commit cross burning," that "the
defendant did a direct act toward the commission of the cross burning," and that "the defendant had the intent
of intimidating any person or group of persons." The court did not instruct the jury on the meaning of the word
"intimidate," nor on the prima facie evidence provision of §18.2-423. The jury found Elliott guilty of attempted
cross burning and acquitted him of conspiracy to commit cross burning. It sentenced Elliott to 90 days in jail
and a $2,500 fine. The Court of Appeals of Virginia affirmed the convictions of both Elliott and O'Mara.

Each respondent appealed to the Supreme Court of Virginia, arguing that §18.2-423 is facially unconstitutional.
The Supreme Court of Virginia consolidated all three cases, and held that the statute is unconstitutional on its
face. It held that the Virginia cross-burning statute "is analytically indistinguishable from the ordinance found
unconstitutional in R.A.V. The Virginia statute, the court held, discriminates on the basis of content since it
"selectively chooses only cross burning because of its distinctive message." The court also held that the prima
facie evidence provision renders the statute overbroad because "[t]he enhanced probability of prosecution under
the statute chills the expression of protected speech."

Three justices dissented, concluding that the Virginia cross-burning statute passes constitutional muster because
it proscribes only conduct that constitutes a true threat. The justices noted that unlike the ordinance found
unconstitutional in R.A.V., the Virginia statute does not just target cross burning "on the basis of race, color,
creed, religion or gender." Rather, "the Virginia statute applies to any individual who burns a cross for any rea-
son provided the cross is burned with the intent to intimidate." The dissenters also disagreed with the majority's
analysis of the prima facie provision because the inference alone "is clearly insufficient to establish beyond a rea-
sonable doubt that a defendant burned a cross with the intent to intimidate." The dissent noted that the burden
of proof still remains on the Commonwealth to prove intent to intimidate. We granted certiorari.

... Burning a cross in the United States is inextricably intertwined with the history of the Ku Klux Klan.

The first Ku Klux Klan began in Pulaski, Tennessee, in the spring of 1866 ... The Klan fought Reconstruction
and the corresponding drive to allow freed blacks to participate in the political process.
                                                                                                                              HATE SPEECH | 367

Soon the Klan imposed "a veritable reign of terror" throughout the South ... The Klan employed tactics such as
whipping, threatening to burn people at the stake, and murder ...

The activities of the Ku Klux Klan prompted legislative action at the national level ... Congress passed what is
now known as the Ku Klux Klan Act. President Grant used these new powers to suppress the Klan in South
Carolina, the effect of which severely curtailed the Klan in other States as well. By the end of Reconstruction in
1877, the first Klan non longer existed.

The genesis of the second Klan began in 1905, with the publication of Thomas Dixon's The Clansmen: An His-
torical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan ... Although the first Klan never actually practiced cross burning, Dixon's
book depicted the Klan burning crosses to celebrate the execution of former slaves ... When D.W. Griffith turned
Dixon's book into the movie The Birth of a Nation in 1915, the association between cross burning and the Klan
became indelible.

From the inception of the second Klan, cross burnings have been used to communicate both threats of violence
and messages of shared ideology ... The first known cross burning in the country had occurred a little over
one month before the Klan initiation, when a Georgia mob celebrated the lynching of Leo Frank by burning a
"gigantic cross" on Stone Mountain that was "visible throughout" Atlanta.

...

Often, the Klan used cross burnings as a tool of intimidation and a threat of impending violence ... After one
cross burning at a synagogue, a Klan member noted that if the cross burning did not "shut the Jews up, we'll cut
a few throats and see what happens ..."

The Klan continued to use cross burnings to intimidate after World War II. In one incident, an African-Amer-
ican "school teacher who recently moved his family into a block formerly occupied only by whites asked the
protection of city police ... after the burning of a cross in his front yard." And after a cross burning in Suffolk,
Virginia during the late 1940's, the Virginia Governor stated that he would "not allow any of our people of any
race to be subjected to terrorism or intimidation in any form by the Klan or any other organization." These
incidents of cross burning, among others, helped prompt Virginia to enact its first version of the cross-burning
statute in 1950.

... Throughout the history of the Klan, cross burnings have also remained potent symbols of shared group iden-
tity and ideology. The burning cross became a symbol of the Klan itself and a central feature of Klan gather-
ings. According to the Klan constitution (called the kloran), the "fiery cross" was the "emblem of that sincere,
unselfish devotedness of all klansmen to the sacred purpose and principles we have espoused." And the Klan has
often published its newsletters and magazines under the name The Fiery Cross.

... To this day, regardless of whether the message is a political one or whether the message is also meant to intim-
idate, the burning of a cross is a "symbol of hate." And while cross burning sometimes carries no intimidating
message, at other times the intimidating message is the only message conveyed. For example, when a cross burn-
ing is directed at a particular person not affiliated with the Klan, the burning cross often serves as a message of
368 | HATE SPEECH

intimidation, designed to inspire in the victim a fear of bodily harm. Moreover, the history of violence associ-
ated with the Klan shows that the possibility of injury or death is not just hypothetical. The person who burns a
cross directed at a particular person often is making a serious threat, meant to coerce the victim to comply with
the Klan's wishes unless the victim is willing to risk the wrath of the Klan. Indeed, as the cases of respondents
Elliott and O'Mara indicate, individuals without Klan affiliation who wish to threaten or menace another per-
son sometimes use cross burning because of this association between a burning cross and violence.

In sum, while a burning cross does not inevitably convey a message of intimidation, often the cross burner
intends that the recipients of the message fear for their lives. And when a cross burning is used to intimidate, few
if any messages are more powerful.

... The hallmark of the protection of free speech is to allow "free trade in ideas"--even ideas that the overwhelm-
ing majority of people might find distasteful or discomforting. Thus, the First Amendment "ordinarily" denies
a State "the power to prohibit dissemination of social, economic and political doctrine which a vast majority of
its citizens believes to be false and fraught with evil consequence ...

The protections afforded by the First Amendment, however, are not absolute, and we have long recognized
that the government may regulate certain categories of expression consistent with the Constitution ... The First
Amendment permits "restrictions upon the content of speech in a few limited areas, which are `of such slight
social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social
interest in order and morality.' "

... We have consequently held that fighting words-"those personally abusive epithets which, when addressed to
the ordinary citizen, are, as a matter of common knowledge, inherently likely to provoke violent reaction" -are
generally proscribable under the First Amendment ... And, the First Amendment also permits a State to ban a
"true threat."

"True threats" encompass those statements where the speaker means to communicate a serious expression of an
intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals ... The speaker
need not actually intend to carry out the threat. Rather, a prohibition on true threats "protect[s] individuals
from the fear of violence" and "from the disruption that fear engenders," in addition to protecting people "from
the possibility that the threatened violence will occur." Intimidation in the constitutionally proscribable sense of
the word is a type of true threat, where a speaker directs a threat to a person or group of persons with the intent
of placing the victim in fear of bodily harm or death. Respondents do not contest that some cross burnings fit
within this meaning of intimidating speech, and rightly so. As noted in Part II, supra, the history of cross burn-
ing in this country shows that cross burning is often intimidating, intended to create a pervasive fear in victims
that they are a target of violence.

The Supreme Court of Virginia ruled that in light of R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, even if it is constitutional to
ban cross burning in a content-neutral manner, the Virginia cross-burning statute is unconstitutional because it
discriminates on the basis of content and viewpoint. It is true, as the Supreme Court of Virginia held, that the
burning of a cross is symbolic expression. The reason why the Klan burns a cross at its rallies, or individuals place
                                                                                                                              HATE SPEECH | 369

a burning cross on someone else's lawn, is that the burning cross represents the message that the speaker wishes
to communicate. Individuals burn crosses as opposed to other means of communication because cross burning
carries a message in an effective and dramatic manner.

The fact that cross burning is symbolic expression, however, does not resolve the constitutional question. The
Supreme Court of Virginia relied upon R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul to conclude that once a statute discriminates
on the basis of this type of content, the law is unconstitutional. We disagree.

... We did not hold in R.A.V. that the First Amendment prohibits all forms of content-based discrimination
within a proscribable area of speech. Rather, we specifically stated that some types of content discrimination did
not violate the First Amendment ...

Indeed, we noted that it would be constitutional to ban only a particular type of threat ... Consequently, while
the holding of R.A.V. does not permit a State to ban only obscenity based on "offensive political messages," or
"only those threats against the President that mention his policy on aid to inner cities," the First Amendment
permits content discrimination "based on the very reasons why the particular class of speech at issue ... is pro-
scribable."

Similarly, Virginia's statute does not run afoul of the First Amendment insofar as it bans cross burning with
intent to intimidate. Unlike the statute at issue in R. A. V., the Virginia statute does not single out for oppro-
brium only that speech directed toward "one of the specified disfavored topics." It does not matter whether an
individual burns a cross with intent to intimidate because of the victim's race, gender, or religion, or because of
the victim's "political affiliation, union membership, or homosexuality." ...

The First Amendment permits Virginia to outlaw cross burnings done with the intent to intimidate because
burning a cross is a particularly virulent form of intimidation. Instead of prohibiting all intimidating messages,
Virginia may choose to regulate this subset of intimidating messages in light of cross burning's long and perni-
cious history as a signal of impending violence. Thus, just as a State may regulate only that obscenity which is
the most obscene due to its prurient content, so too may a State choose to prohibit only those forms of intimi-
dation that are most likely to inspire fear of bodily harm. A ban on cross burning carried out with the intent to
intimidate is fully consistent with our holding in R. A. V. and is proscribable under the First Amendment.

... The Supreme Court of Virginia has not ruled on the meaning of the prima facie evidence provision. It has,
however, stated that "the act of burning a cross alone, with no evidence of intent to intimidate, will nonetheless
suffice for arrest and prosecution and will insulate the Commonwealth from a motion to strike the evidence at
the end of its case-in-chief." ...

The prima facie evidence provision, as interpreted by the jury instruction, renders the statute unconstitutional
... As construed by the jury instruction, the prima facie provision strips away the very reason why a State may ban
cross burning with the intent to intimidate ... The provision permits the Commonwealth to arrest, prosecute,
and convict a person based solely on the fact of cross burning itself.
370 | HATE SPEECH

It is apparent that the provision as so interpreted "`would create an unacceptable risk of the suppression of
ideas.'" The act of burning a cross may mean that a person is engaging in constitutionally proscribable intim-
idation. But that same act may mean only that the person is engaged in core political speech. The prima facie
evidence provision in this statute blurs the line between these two meanings of a burning cross. As interpreted
by the jury instruction, the provision chills constitutionally protected political speech because of the possibil-
ity that a State will prosecute-and potentially convict-somebody engaging only in lawful political speech at the
core of what the First Amendment is designed to protect.

As the history of cross burning indicates, a burning cross is not always intended to intimidate. Rather, some-
times the cross burning is a statement of ideology, a symbol of group solidarity. It is a ritual used at Klan gather-
ings, and it is used to represent the Klan itself. Thus, "[b]urning a cross at a political rally would almost certainly
be protected expression." Indeed, occasionally a person who burns a cross does not intend to express either a
statement of ideology or intimidation. Cross burnings have appeared in movies such as Mississippi Burning, and
in plays such as the stage adaptation of Sir Walter Scott's The Lady of the Lake.

... It may be true that a cross burning, even at a political rally, arouses a sense of anger or hatred among the vast
majority of citizens who see a burning cross. But this sense of anger or hatred is not sufficient to ban all cross
burnings ... The prima facie evidence provision in this case ignores all of the contextual factors that are necessary
to decide whether a particular cross burning is intended to intimidate. The First Amendment does not permit
such a shortcut.

... We recognize that the Supreme Court of Virginia has not authoritatively interpreted the meaning of the prima
facie evidence provision. Unlike Justice Scalia, we refuse to speculate on whether any interpretation of the prima
facie evidence provision would satisfy the First Amendment ... We also recognize the theoretical possibility that
the court, on remand, could interpret the provision in a manner different from that so far set forth in order to
avoid the constitutional objections we have described. We leave open that possibility.

With respect to Barry Black, we agree with the Supreme Court of Virginia that his conviction cannot stand, and
we affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of Virginia. With respect to Elliott and O'Mara, we vacate the
judgment of the Supreme Court of Virginia, and remand the case for further proceedings.

It is so ordered.

Justice Thomas, dissenting.

In every culture, certain things acquire meaning well beyond what outsiders can comprehend. That goes for
both the sacred, see Texas v. Johnson, (1989) and the profane. I believe that cross burning is the paradigmatic
example of the latter.

Although I agree with the majority's conclusion that it is constitutionally permissible to "ban ... cross burning
carried out with intent to intimidate," I believe that the majority errs in imputing an expressive component to
the activity in question. In my view, whatever expressive value cross burning has, the legislature simply wrote it
                                                                                                                               HATE SPEECH | 371

out by banning only intimidating conduct undertaken by a particular means. A conclusion that the statute pro-
hibiting cross burning with intent to intimidate sweeps beyond a prohibition on certain conduct into the zone
of expression overlooks not only the words of the statute but also reality.

"In holding [the ban on cross burning with intent to intimidate] unconstitutional, the Court ignores Justice
Holmes' familiar aphorism that `a page of history is worth a volume of logic.'"

...

To me, the majority's brief history of the Ku Klux Klan only reinforces this common understanding of the Klan
as a terrorist organization, which, in its endeavor to intimidate, or even eliminate those its dislikes, uses the most
brutal of methods.

Such methods typically include cross burning--"a tool for intimidation and harassment of racial minorities,
Catholics, Jews, Communists, and any other groups hated by the Klan." ... As the Solicitor General points out,
the association between acts of intimidating cross burning and violence is well documented in recent American
history.

...

In our culture, cross burning has almost invariably meant lawlessness and understandably instills in its victims
well and grounded fear of physical violence.

Virginia's experience is not exception ... Accordingly, this statute prohibits only conduct, not expression. And,
just as one cannot burn down someone's house to make a political point and then seek refuge in the First
Amendment, those who hate cannot terrorize and intimidate to make their point. In light of my conclusion that
the statute here addresses only conduct, there is no need to analyze it under any of our First Amendment tests.

Even assuming that the statute implicates the First Amendment, in my view, the fact that the statute permits a
jury to draw an inference of intent to intimidate from the cross burning itself presents no constitutional prob-
lems. Therein lies my primary disagreement with the plurality.

But even with respect to statutes containing a mandatory irrebuttable presumption as to intent, the Court has
not shown much concern. For instance, there is no scienter requirement for statutory rape. That is, a person can
be arrested, prosecuted, and convicted for having sex with a minor, without the government ever producing any
evidence, let alone proving beyond a reasonable doubt, that a minor did not consent. In fact, "[f]or purposes
of the child molesting statute ... consent is irrelevant. The legislature has determined in such cases that children
under the age of sixteen (16) cannot, as a matter of law, consent to have sexual acts performed upon them, or
consent to engage in a sexual act with someone over the age of sixteen (16)." The legislature finds the behavior
so reprehensible that the intent is satisfied by the mere act committed by a perpetrator. Considering the horrific
effect cross burning has on its victims, it is also reasonable to presume intent to intimidate from the act itself.

... Because the prima facie clause here is an inference, not an irrebuttable presumption, there is all the more basis
under our Due Process precedents to sustain this statute.
372 | HATE SPEECH

The plurality, however, is troubled by the presumption because this is a First Amendment case. The plurality
laments the fate of an innocent cross-burner who burns a cross, but does so without an intent to intimidate. The
plurality fears the chill on expression because, according to the plurality, the inference permits "the Common-
wealth to arrest, prosecute and convict a person based solely on the fact of cross burning itself." First, it is, at the
very least, unclear that the inference comes into play during arrest and initiation of a prosecution, that is, prior
to the instructions stage of an actual trial. Second, as I explained above, the inference is rebuttable and, as the
jury instructions given in this case demonstrate, Virginia law still requires the jury to find the existence of each
element, including intent to intimidate, beyond a reasonable doubt.

Moreover, even in the First Amendment context, the Court has upheld such regulations where conduct that ini-
tially appears culpable, ultimately results in dismissed charges. A regulation of pornography is one such example.
While possession of child pornography is illegal, Ferber v. New York (1982), possession of adult pornography, as
long as it is not obscene, is allowed, Miller v. California (1973). As a result, those pornographers trafficking in
images of adults who look like minors, may be not only deterred but also arrested and prosecuted for possessing
what a jury might find to be legal materials. This "chilling" effect has not, however, been a cause for grave con-
cern with respect to overbreadth of such statutes among the members of this Court.

That the First Amendment gives way to other interests is not a remarkable proposition. What is remarkable is
that, under the plurality's analysis, the determination of whether an interest is sufficiently compelling depends
not on the harm a regulation in question seeks to prevent, but on the area of society at which it aims. For
instance, in Hill v. Colorado (2000), the Court upheld a restriction on protests near abortion clinics, explaining
that the State had a legitimate interest, which was sufficiently narrowly tailored, in protecting those seeking ser-
vices of such establishments "from unwanted advice" and "unwanted communication." In so concluding, the
Court placed heavy reliance on the "vulnerable physical and emotional conditions" of patients. Thus, when
it came to the rights of those seeking abortions, the Court deemed restrictions on "unwanted advice," which,
notably, can be given only from a distance of at least 8 feet from a prospective patient, justified by the counter-
vailing interest in obtaining abortion. Yet, here, the plurality strikes down the statute because one day an indi-
vidual might wish to burn a cross, but might do so without an intent to intimidate anyone. That cross burning
subjects its targets, and, sometimes, an unintended audience to extreme emotional distress, and is virtually never
viewed merely as "unwanted communication," but rather, as a physical threat, is of no concern to the plurality.
Henceforth, under the plurality's view, physical safety will be valued less than the right to be free from unwanted
communications.

Because I would uphold the validity of this statute, I respectfully dissent.

Obscenity and Extreme Violence

Roth v. United States

354 U.S. 476 (1957)

[consolidated with Alberts v. California 354 U.S. 476]

    Majority: Brennan, joined by Frankfurter, Burton, Clark, and Whittaker
    Concurrence: Warren
    Dissent: Harlan
    Dissent: Douglas, joined by Black

Justice Brennan delivered the opinion of the Court.

The constitutionality of a criminal obscenity statute is the question in each of these cases. In Roth, the primary
constitutional question is whether the federal obscenity statute violates the provision of the First Amendment
that "Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press. ..."

Roth conducted a business in New York in the publication and sale of books, photographs and magazines. He
used circulars and advertising matter to solicit sales. He was convicted by a jury in the District Court for the
Southern District of New York upon 4 counts of a 26-count indictment charging him with mailing obscene
circulars and advertising, and an obscene book, in violation of the federal obscenity statute. His conviction was
affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. We granted certiorari.

Alberts conducted a mail-order business from Los Angeles. He was convicted by the Judge of the Municipal
Court of the Beverly Hills Judicial District (having waived a jury trial) under a misdemeanor complaint which
charged him with lewdly keeping for sale obscene and indecent books, and with writing, composing and publish-
ing an obscene advertisement of them, in violation of the California Penal Code. The conviction was affirmed by
the Appellate Department of the Superior Court of the State of California in and for the County of Los Ange-
les. We noted probable jurisdiction.

The dispositive question is whether obscenity is utterance within the area of protected speech and press.
Although this is the first time the question has been squarely presented to this Court, either under the First
Amendment or under the Fourteenth Amendment, expressions found in numerous opinions indicate that this
Court has always assumed that obscenity is not protected by the freedoms of speech and press.

... In light of this history, it is apparent that the unconditional phrasing of the First Amendment was not
intended to protect every utterance. This phrasing did not prevent this Court from concluding that libelous
374 | OBSCENITY AND EXTREME VIOLENCE

utterances are not within the area of constitutionally protected speech. At the time of the adoption of the First
Amendment, obscenity law was not as fully developed as libel law, but there is sufficiently contemporaneous evi-
dence to show that obscenity, too, was outside the protection intended for speech and press.

... All ideas having even the slightest redeeming social importance--unorthodox ideas, controversial ideas, even
ideas hateful to the prevailing climate of opinion--have the full protection of the guaranties, unless excludable
because they encroach upon the limited area of more important interests. But implicit in the history of the First
Amendment is the rejection of obscenity as utterly without redeeming social importance. This rejection for that
reason is mirrored in the universal judgment that obscenity should be restrained, reflected in the international
agreement of over 50 nations, in the obscenity laws of all of the 48 States, and in the 20 obscenity laws enacted
by the Congress from 1842 to 1956. This is the same judgment expressed by this Court in Chaplinsky v. New
Hampshire (1942):

      " ... There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of
      which have never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem. These include the lewd and obscene. ... It has
      been well observed that such utterances are no essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of such slight social
      value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in
      order and morality. ..." (Emphasis added.)

We hold that obscenity is not within the area of constitutionally protected speech or press.

It is strenuously urged that these obscenity statutes offend the constitutional guaranties because they punish
incitation to impure sexual thoughts, not shown to be related to any overt antisocial conduct which is or may
be incited in the persons stimulated to such thoughts. In Roth, the trial judge instructed the jury: "The words
`obscene, lewd and lascivious' as used in the law, signify that form of immorality which has relation to sexual
impurity and has a tendency to excite lustful thoughts." (Emphasis added.) ... It is insisted that the constitutional
guaranties are violated because convictions may be had without proof either that obscene material will percep-
tibly create a clear and present danger of anti-social conduct, or will probably induce its recipients to such con-
duct. But, in light of our holding that obscenity is not protected speech, the complete answer to this argument
is in the holding of this Court in Beauharnais v. Illinois, supra:

"Libelous utterances not being within the area of constitutionally protected speech, it is unnecessary, either for
us or for the State courts, to consider the issues behind the phrase `clear and present danger.' Certainly no one
would contend that obscene speech, for example, may be punished only upon a showing of such circumstances.
Libel, as we have seen, is in the same class."

However, sex and obscenity are not synonymous. Obscene material is material which deals with sex in a manner
appealing to prurient interest. The portrayal of sex, e. g., in art, literature and scientific works, is not itself suffi-
cient reason to deny material the constitutional protection of freedom of speech and press ...

The fundamental freedoms of speech and press have contributed greatly to the development and well-being of
our free society and are indispensable to its continued growth. Ceaseless vigilance is the watchword to prevent
their erosion by Congress or by the States. The door barring federal and state intrusion into this area cannot be
left ajar; it must be kept tightly closed and opened only the slightest crack necessary to prevent encroachment
                                                                                            OBSCENITY AND EXTREME VIOLENCE | 375

upon more important interests. It is therefore vital that the standards for judging obscenity safeguard the pro-
tection of freedom of speech and press for material which does not treat sex in a manner appealing to prurient
interest.

... in Roth, the trial judge instructed the jury as follows:

      " ... The test is not whether it would arouse sexual desires or sexual impure thoughts in those comprising a partic-
      ular segment of the community, the young, the immature or the highly prudish or would leave another segment,
      the scientific or highly educated or the so-called worldly-wise and sophisticated indifferent and unmoved. ..."

      ". ..."

      "The test in each case is the effect of the book, picture or publication considered as a whole, not upon any partic-
      ular class, but upon all those whom it is likely to reach. In other words, you determine its impact upon the average
      person in the community. The books, pictures and circulars must be judged as a whole, in their entire context, and
      you are not to consider detached or separate portions in reaching a conclusion. You judge the circulars, pictures
      and publications which have been put in evidence by present-day standards of the community. You may ask your-
      selves does it offend the common conscience of the community by present-day standards."

      ". ..."

      "In this case, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you and you alone are the exclusive judges of what the common con-
      science of the community is, and in determining that conscience you are to consider the community as a whole,
      young and old, educated and uneducated, the religious and the irreligious--men, women and children."

It is argued that the statutes do not provide reasonably ascertainable standards of guilt and therefore violate the
constitutional requirements of due process ... The thrust of the argument is that these words are not sufficiently
precise because they do not mean the same thing to all people, all the time, everywhere.

Many decisions have recognized that these terms of obscenity statutes are not precise. This Court, however, has
consistently held that lack of precision is not itself offensive to the requirements of due process." ... [T]he Con-
stitution does not require impossible standards"; all that is required is that the language "conveys sufficiently
definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices. ..."

In summary, then, we hold that these statutes, applied according to the proper standard for judging obscenity,
do not offend constitutional safeguards against convictions based upon protected material, or fail to give men in
acting adequate notice of what is prohibited.

...
§376 | OBSCENITY AND EXTREME VIOLENCE

We therefore hold that the federal obscenity statute punishing the use of the mails for obscene material is a
proper exercise of the postal power delegated to Congress by Art. I, § 8, cl. 7 ...

The judgments are

Affirmed.

Jacobellis v. Ohio

378 U.S. 184 (1964)

    Vote: 6-3
    Plurality: Brennan, joined by Goldberg
    Concurrence: Black, joined by Douglas
    Concurrence: Stewart
    Concurrence: White
    Dissent: Warren, joined by Clark
    Dissent: Harlan

Justice Brennan announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion in which Justice Goldberg
joins.

Appellant, Nico Jacobellis, manager of a motion picture theater in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, was convicted on
two counts of possessing and exhibiting an obscene film in violation of Ohio Revised Code (1963 Supp.) §
2905.34.1 He was fined $500 on the first count and $2,000 on the second, and was sentenced to the workhouse if
the fines were not paid. His conviction, by a court of three judges upon waiver of trial by jury, was affirmed by an
intermediate appellate court, and by the Supreme Court of Ohio. We noted probable jurisdiction of the appeal,
and subsequently restored the case to the calendar for reargument. The dispositive question is whether the state
courts properly found that the motion picture involved, a French film called `Les Amants' (`The Lovers'), was
obscene and hence not entitled to the protection for free expression that is guaranteed by the First and Four-
teenth Amendments. We conclude that the film is not obscene and that the judgment must accordingly be
reversed.

Motion pictures are within the ambit of the constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and of the press.
But, in Roth v. United States and Alberts v. California, we held that obscenity is not subject to those guarantees.
Application of an obscenity law to suppress a motion picture thus requires ascertainment of the "dim and uncer-
                                                                                            OBSCENITY AND EXTREME VIOLENCE | 377

tain line" that often separates obscenity from constitutionally protected expression. Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sul­
livan, (1963). It has been suggested that this is a task in which our Court need not involve itself. We are told
that the determination whether a particular motion picture, book, or other work of expression is obscene can
be treated as a purely factual judgment on which a jury's verdict is all but conclusive, or that, in any event, the
decision can be left essentially to state and lower federal courts, with this Court exercising only a limited review
such as that needed to determine whether the ruling below is supported by "sufficient evidence." The sugges-
tion is appealing, since it would lift from our shoulders a difficult, recurring, and unpleasant task. But we cannot
accept it. Such an abnegation of judicial supervision in this field would be inconsistent with our duty to uphold
the constitutional guarantees. Since it is only "obscenity" that is excluded from the constitutional protection,
the question whether a particular work is obscene necessarily implicates an issue of constitutional law. Such an
issue, we think, must ultimately be decided by this Court. Our duty admits of no "substitute for facing up to
the tough individual problems of constitutional judgment involved in every obscenity case."

In other areas involving constitutional rights under the Due Process Clause, the Court has consistently recog-
nized its duty to apply the applicable rules of law upon the basis of an independent review of the facts of each
case ...

We cannot understand why the Court's duty should be any different in the present case, where Jacobellis has
been subjected to a criminal conviction for disseminating a work of expression, and is challenging that convic-
tion as a deprivation of rights guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments ...

The question of the proper standard for making this determination has been the subject of much discussion and
controversy since our decision in Roth seven years ago. Recognizing that the test for obscenity enunciated there
--

"whether, to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the
material, taken as a whole, appeals to prurient interest,"

is not perfect, we think any substitute would raise equally difficult problems, and we therefore adhere to that
standard. We would reiterate, however, our recognition in Roth that obscenity is excluded from the constitu-
tional protection only because it is "utterly without redeeming social importance," and that

"[t]he portrayal of sex, e.g., in art, literature and scientific works, is not itself sufficient reason to deny material
the constitutional protection of freedom of speech and press."

It follows that material dealing with sex in a manner that advocates ideas, Kingsley Int'l Pictures Corp. v. Regents,
(1959) or that has literary or scientific or artistic value or any other form of social importance, may not be
branded as obscenity and denied the constitutional protection ...

It has been suggested that the "contemporary community standards" aspect of the Roth test implies a determina-
tion of the constitutional question of obscenity in each case by the standards of the particular local community
from which the case arises ... to "the community" in the sense of "society at large; ... the public, or people in gen-
eral." ...
378 | OBSCENITY AND EXTREME VIOLENCE

We do not see how any "local" definition of the "community" could properly be employed in delineating the
area of expression that is protected by the Federal Constitution.

We recognize the legitimate and indeed exigent interest of States and localities throughout the Nation in pre-
venting the dissemination of material deemed harmful to children. But that interest does not justify a total sup-
pression of such material, the effect of which would be to "reduce the adult population ... to reading only what is
fit for children." Butler v. Michigan, (1957). State and local authorities might well consider whether their objec-
tives in this area would be better served by laws aimed specifically at preventing distribution of objectionable
material to children, rather than at totally prohibiting its dissemination. Since the present conviction is based
upon exhibition of the film to the public at large, and not upon its exhibition to children, the judgment must be
reviewed under the strict standard applicable in determining the scope of the expression that is protected by the
Constitution.

We have applied that standard to the motion picture in question."The Lovers" involves a woman bored with her
life and marriage who abandons her husband and family for a young archaeologist with whom she has suddenly
fallen in love. There is an explicit love scene in the last reel of the film, and the State's objections are based almost
entirely upon that scene. The film was favorably reviewed in a number of national publications, although dispar-
aged in others, and was rated by at least two critics of national stature among the best films of the year in which it
was produced. It was shown in approximately 100 of the larger cities in the United States, including Columbus
and Toledo, Ohio. We have viewed the film, in the light of the record made in the trial court, and we conclude
that it is not obscene within the standards enunciated in Roth v. United States and Alberts v. California, which
we reaffirm here.

Reversed.

Justice Stewart, concurring.

It is possible to read the Court's opinion in Roth v. United States in a variety of ways. In saying this, I imply no
criticism of the Court, which in those cases was faced with the task of trying to define what may be indefinable. I
have reached the conclusion, which I think is confirmed at least by negative implication in the Court's decisions
since Roth and Alberts that under the First and Fourteenth Amendments criminal laws in this area are consti-
tutionally limited to hard-core pornography. I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of material I
understand to be embraced within that shorthand description; and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly
doing so. But I know it when I see it, and the motion picture involved in this case is not that.

The Chief Justice, with whom Mr. Justice Clark joins, dissenting.

In this and other cases in this area of the law, which are coming to us in ever-increasing numbers, we are faced
with the resolution of rights basic both to individuals and to society as a whole. Specifically, we are called upon to
reconcile the right of the Nation and of the States to maintain a decent society and, on the other hand, the right
of individuals to express themselves freely in accordance with the guarantees of the First and Fourteenth Amend-
ments. Although the Federal Government and virtually every State has had laws proscribing obscenity since the
Union was formed, and although this Court has recently decided that obscenity is not within the protection of
                                                                                            OBSCENITY AND EXTREME VIOLENCE | 379

the First Amendment, neither courts nor legislatures have been able to evolve a truly satisfactory definition of
obscenity. In other areas of the law, terms like "negligence," although in common use for centuries, have been
difficult to define except in the most general manner. Yet the courts have been able to function in such areas with
a reasonable degree of efficiency. The obscenity problem, however, is aggravated by the fact that it involves the
area of public expression, an area in which a broad range of freedom is vital to our society and is constitutionally
protected.

... For all the sound and fury that the Roth test has generated, it has not been proved unsound, and I believe that
we should try to live with it--at least until a more satisfactory definition is evolved. No government--be it fed-
eral, state, or local--should be forced to choose between repressing all material, including that within the realm
of decency, and allowing unrestrained license to publish any material, no matter how vile. There must be a rule
of reason in this as in other areas of the law and we have attempted in the Roth case to provide such a rule.

... We are told that only `hard core pornography' should be denied the protection of the First Amendment. But
who can define `hard core pornography' with any greater clarity than `obscenity'? And even if we were to retreat
to that position, we would soon be faced with the need to define that term just as we now are faced with the
need to define `obscenity.' Meanwhile, those who profit from the commercial exploitation of obscenity would
continue to ply their trade unmolested.

... In light of the foregoing, I would reiterate my acceptance of the rule of the Roth case: Material is obscene and
not constitutionally protected against regulation and proscription if `to the average person, applying contempo-
rary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest.' I
would commit the enforcement of this rule to the appropriate state and federal courts, and I would accept their
judgments made pursuant to the Roth rule, limiting myself to a consideration only of whether there is sufficient
evidence in the record upon which a finding of obscenity could be made. If there is no evidence in the record
upon which such a finding could be made, obviously the material involved cannot be held obscene. But since
a mere modicum of evidence may satisfy a `no evidence' standard, I am unwilling to give the important consti-
tutional right of free expression such limited protection. However, protection of society's right to maintain its
moral fiber and the effective administration of justice require that this Court not establish itself as an ultimate
censor, in each case reading the entire record, viewing the accused material, and making an independent de novo
judgment on the question of obscenity. Therefore, once a finding of obscenity has been made below under a
proper application of the Roth test, I would apply a `sufficient evidence' standard of review--requiring some-
thing more than merely any evidence but something less than `substantial evidence on the record (including the
allegedly obscene material) as a whole.' his is the only reasonable way I can see to obviate the necessity of this
Court's sitting as the Super Censor of all the obscenity purveyed throughout the Nation.

Miller v. California

413 U.S. 15 (1973)

    Vote: 5-4
    Majority: Burger, joined by White, Blackmun, Powell and Rehnquist
    Dissent: Douglas
    Dissent: Brennan, joined by Stewart and Marshall

Chief Justice Burger delivered the opinion of the Court.

This is one of a group of "obscenity-pornography" cases being reviewed by the Court in a re-examination of
standards enunciated in earlier cases involving what Mr. Justice Harlan called "the intractable obscenity prob-
lem."

Appellant conducted a mass mailing campaign to advertise the sale of illustrated books, euphemistically called
"adult" material. After a jury trial, he was convicted of violating California Penal Code § 311.2 (a), a misde-
meanor, by knowingly distributing obscene matter, and the Appellate Department, Superior Court of Cal-
ifornia, County of Orange, summarily affirmed the judgment without opinion. Appellant's conviction was
specifically based on his conduct in causing five unsolicited advertising brochures to be sent through the mail in
an envelope addressed to a restaurant in Newport Beach, California. The envelope was opened by the manager
of the restaurant and his mother. They had not requested the brochures; they complained to the police.

The brochures advertise four books entitled "Intercourse," "Man-Woman," "Sex Orgies Illustrated," and "An
Illustrated History of Pornography," and a film entitled "Marital Intercourse." While the brochures contain
some descriptive printed material, primarily they consist of pictures and drawings very explicitly depicting men
and women in groups of two or more engaging in a variety of sexual activities, with genitals often prominently
displayed.

This case involves the application of a State's criminal obscenity statute to a situation in which sexually explicit
materials have been thrust by aggressive sales action upon unwilling recipients who had in no way indicated any
desire to receive such materials. This Court has recognized that the States have a legitimate interest in prohibit-
ing dissemination or exhibition of obscene material when the mode of dissemination carries with it a significant
danger of offending the sensibilities of unwilling recipients or of exposure to juveniles. It is in this context that
we are called on to define the standards which must be used to identify obscene material that a State may regulate
without infringing on the First Amendment as applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.

The dissent of Justice Brennan reviews the background of the obscenity problem, but since the Court now
undertakes to formulate standards more concrete than those in the past, it is useful for us to focus on two of the
landmark cases in the somewhat tortured history of the Court's obscenity decisions. In Roth v. United States,
(1957), the Court sustained a conviction under a federal statute punishing the mailing of "obscene, lewd, lasciv-
ious or filthy ..." materials. The key to that holding was the Court's rejection of the claim that obscene materials
were protected by the First Amendment ...
                                                                                            OBSCENITY AND EXTREME VIOLENCE | 381

Nine years later, in Memoirs v. Massachusetts, (1966), the Court veered sharply away from the Roth concept
and, with only three Justices in the plurality opinion, articulated a new test of obscenity. The plurality held that
under the Roth definition

      "as elaborated in subsequent cases, three elements must coalesce: it must be established that (a) the dominant
      theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to a prurient interest in sex; (b) the material is patently offensive
      because it affronts contemporary community standards relating to the description or representation of sexual mat-
      ters; and (c) the material is utterly without redeeming social value."

The sharpness of the break with Roth, represented by the third element of the Memoirs test and emphasized by
Justice White's dissent, was further underscored when the Memoirs plurality went on to state:

      "The Supreme Judicial Court erred in holding that a book need not be `unqualifiedly worthless before it can be
      deemed obscene.' A book cannot be proscribed unless it is found to be utterly without redeeming social value."
      (emphasis in original).

While Roth presumed "obscenity" to be "utterly without redeeming social importance," Memoirs required that
to prove obscenity it must be affirmatively established that the material is "utterly without redeeming social
value." Thus, even as they repeated the words of Roth, the Memoirs plurality produced a drastically altered test
that called on the prosecution to prove a negative, i.e., that the material was "utterly without redeeming social
value"--a burden virtually impossible to discharge under our criminal standards of proof. Such considerations
caused Justice Harlan [dissenting] to wonder if the "utterly without redeeming social value" test had any mean-
ing at all.

Apart from the initial formulation in the Roth case, no majority of the Court has at any given time been able to
agree on a standard to determine what constitutes obscene, pornographic material subject to regulation under
the States' police power. This is not remarkable, for in the area of freedom of speech and press the courts must
always remain sensitive to any infringement on genuinely serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific expres-
sion. This is an area in which there are few eternal verities.

The case we now review was tried on the theory that the California Penal Code §311 approximately incorporates
the three-stage Memoirs test. But now the Memoirs test has been abandoned as unworkable by its author, and
no Member of the Court today supports the Memoirs formulation.

This much has been categorically settled by the Court, that obscene material is unprotected by the First Amend-
ment. We acknowledge, however, the inherent dangers of undertaking to regulate any form of expression. State
statutes designed to regulate obscene materials must be carefully limited. As a result, we now confine the permis-
sible scope of such regulation to works which depict or describe sexual conduct. That conduct must be specif-
ically defined by the applicable state law, as written or authoritatively construed. A state offense must also be
limited to works which, taken as a whole, appeal to the prurient interest in sex, which portray sexual conduct in
a patently offensive way, and which, taken as a whole, do not have serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific
value.
382 | OBSCENITY AND EXTREME VIOLENCE

The basic guidelines for the trier of fact must be: (a) whether "the average person, applying contemporary com-
munity standards" would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest; (b) whether the
work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state
law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value ... If
a state law that regulates obscene material is thus limited, as written or construed, the First Amendment values
applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment are adequately protected by the ultimate power of
appellate courts to conduct an independent review of constitutional claims when necessary.

We emphasize that it is not our function to propose regulatory schemes for the States. That must await their
concrete legislative efforts. It is possible, however, to give a few plain examples of what a state statute could define
for regulation under part (b) of the standard announced in this opinion:

(a) Patently offensive representations or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts, normal or perverted, actual or sim-
ulated.

(b) Patently offensive representations or descriptions of masturbation, excretory functions, and lewd exhibition
of the genitals.

Sex and nudity may not be exploited without limit by films or pictures exhibited or sold in places of public
accommodation any more than live sex and nudity can be exhibited or sold without limit in such public places.
At a minimum, prurient, patently offensive depiction or description of sexual conduct must have serious liter-
ary, artistic, political, or scientific value to merit First Amendment protection. For example, medical books for
the education of physicians and related personnel necessarily use graphic illustrations and descriptions of human
anatomy. In resolving the inevitably sensitive questions of fact and law, we must continue to rely on the jury sys-
tem, accompanied by the safeguards that judges, rules of evidence, presumption of innocence, and other protec-
tive features provide, as we do with rape, murder, and a host of other offenses against society and its individual
members.

... Under the holdings announced today, no one will be subject to prosecution for the sale or exposure of obscene
materials unless these materials depict or describe patently offensive "hard core" sexual conduct specifically
defined by the regulating state law, as written or construed. We are satisfied that these specific prerequisites will
provide fair notice to a dealer in such materials that his public and commercial activities may bring prosecution.
If the inability to define regulated materials with ultimate, god-like precision altogether removes the power of
the States or the Congress to regulate, then "hard core" pornography may be exposed without limit to the juve-
nile, the passerby, and the consenting adult alike, as, indeed, Justice Douglas contends. In this belief, however,
Justice Douglas now stands alone.

... It is certainly true that the absence, since Roth, of a single majority view of this Court as to proper standards
for testing obscenity has placed a strain on both state and federal courts. But today, for the first time since Roth
was decided in 1957, a majority of this Court has agreed on concrete guidelines to isolate "hard core" pornogra-
phy from expression protected by the First Amendment ...

This may not be an easy road, free from difficulty. But no amount of "fatigue" should lead us to adopt a con-
venient "institutional" rationale--an absolutist, "anything goes" view of the First Amendment--because it will
lighten our burdens." ... Nor should we remedy "tension between state and federal courts" by arbitrarily depriv-
ing the States of a power reserved to them under the Constitution, a power which they have enjoyed and exer-
cised continuously from before the adoption of the First Amendment to this day ...

Under a National Constitution, fundamental First Amendment limitations on the powers of the States do not
vary from community to community, but this does not mean that there are, or should or can be, fixed, uniform
national standards of precisely what appeals to the "prurient interest" or is "patently offensive." These are essen-
tially questions of fact, and our Nation is simply too big and too diverse for this Court to reasonably expect that
such standards could be articulated for all 50 States in a single formulation, even assuming the prerequisite con-
sensus exists. When triers of fact are asked to decide whether "the average person, applying contemporary com-
munity standards" would consider certain materials "prurient," it would be unrealistic to require that the answer
be based on some abstract formulation. The adversary system, with lay jurors as the usual ultimate factfinders
in criminal prosecutions, has historically permitted triers of fact to draw on the standards of their community,
guided always by limiting instructions on the law. To require a State to structure obscenity proceedings around
evidence of a national "community standard" would be an exercise in futility.

As noted before, this case was tried on the theory that the California obscenity statute sought to incorporate the
tripartite test of Memoirs. This, a "national" standard of First Amendment protection enumerated by a plural-
ity of this Court, was correctly regarded at the time of trial as limiting state prosecution under the controlling
case law. The jury, however, was explicitly instructed that, in determining whether the "dominant theme of the
material as a whole ... appeals to the prurient interest" and in determining whether the material "goes substan-
tially beyond customary limits of candor and affronts contemporary community standards of decency," it was
to apply "contemporary community standards of the State of California."

During the trial, both the prosecution and the defense assumed that the relevant "community standards" in
making the factual determination of obscenity were those of the State of California, not some hypothetical stan-
dard of the entire United States of America ... On appeal to the Appellate Department, Superior Court of Cal-
ifornia, County of Orange, appellant for the first time contended that application of state, rather than national,
standards violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

We conclude that neither the State's alleged failure to offer evidence of "national standards," nor the trial
court's charge that the jury consider state community standards, were constitutional errors. Nothing in the First
Amendment requires that a jury must consider hypothetical and unascertainable "national standards" when
attempting to determine whether certain materials are obscene as a matter of fact ...

It is neither realistic nor constitutionally sound to read the First Amendment as requiring that the people of
Maine or Mississippi accept public depiction of conduct found tolerable in Las Vegas, or New York City. People
in different States vary in their tastes and attitudes, and this diversity is not to be strangled by the absolutism of
imposed uniformity ... We hold that the requirement that the jury evaluate the materials with reference to "con-
temporary standards of the State of California" serves this protective purpose and is constitutionally adequate.
384 | OBSCENITY AND EXTREME VIOLENCE

The dissenting Justices sound the alarm of repression. But, in our view, to equate the free and robust exchange
of ideas and political debate with commercial exploitation of obscene material demeans the grand conception
of the First Amendment and its high purposes in the historic struggle for freedom ... The First Amendment
protects works which, taken as a whole, have serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value, regardless of
whether the government or a majority of the people approve of the ideas these works represent ... But the public
portrayal of hard-core sexual conduct for its own sake, and for the ensuing commercial gain, is a different matter.

There is no evidence, empirical or historical, that the stern 19th century American censorship of public distrib-
ution and display of material relating to sex in any way limited or affected expression of serious literary, artistic,
political, or scientific ideas.

... One can concede that the "sexual revolution" of recent years may have had useful byproducts in striking layers
of prudery from a subject long irrationally kept from needed ventilation. But it does not follow that no regula-
tion of patently offensive "hard core" materials is needed or permissible; civilized people do not allow unregu-
lated access to heroin because it is a derivative of medicinal morphine.

In sum, we (a) reaffirm the Roth holding that obscene material is not protected by the First Amendment; (b)
hold that such material can be regulated by the States, subject to the specific safeguards enunciated above, with-
out a showing that the material is "utterly without redeeming social value"; and (c) hold that obscenity is to
be determined by applying "contemporary community standards," not "national standards." The judgment of
the Appellate Department of the Superior Court, Orange County, California, is vacated and the case remanded
to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with the First Amendment standards established by this
opinion.

Vacated and remanded.

New York v. Ferber

458 U.S. 747 (1982)

Justice White Delivered the Opinion of the Court

At issue in this case is the constitutionality of a New York criminal statute which prohibits persons from know-
ingly promoting sexual performances by children under the age of 16 by distributing material which depicts
such performances.

In recent years, the exploitive use of children in the production of pornography has become a serious national
problem. The Federal Government and 47 States have sought to combat the problem with statutes specifically
directed at the production of child pornography. At least half of such statutes do not require that the materials
produced be legally obscene. Thirty-five States and the United States Congress have also passed legislation pro-
hibiting the distribution of such materials; 20 States prohibit the distribution of material depicting children
engaged in sexual conduct without requiring that the material be legally obscene.

... At issue in this case is § 263.15, defining a class D felony:

"A person is guilty of promoting a sexual performance by a child when, knowing the character and content
thereof, he produces, directs or promotes any performance which includes sexual conduct by a child less than
sixteen years of age."

To "promote" is also defined:

"`Promote' means to procure, manufacture, issue, sell, give, provide, lend, mail, deliver, transfer, transmute,
publish, distribute, circulate, disseminate, present, exhibit or advertise, or to offer or agree to do the same."

§ 263.00(5).

A companion provision bans only the knowing dissemination of obscene material. § 263.10.

This case arose when Paul Ferber, the proprietor of a Manhattan bookstore specializing in sexually oriented
products, sold two films to an undercover police officer. The films are devoted almost exclusively to depicting
young boys masturbating. Ferber was indicted on two counts of violating § 263.10 and two counts of violating
§ 263.15, the two New York laws controlling dissemination of child pornography. After a jury trial, Ferber was
386 | OBSCENITY AND EXTREME VIOLENCE

acquitted of the two counts of promoting an obscene sexual performance, but found guilty of the two counts
under § 263.15, which did not require proof that the films were obscene. Ferber's convictions were affirmed
without opinion by the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court ...

The New York Court of Appeals reversed, holding that § 263.15 violated the First Amendment ... The court
began by noting that, in light of § 263.10's explicit inclusion of an obscenity standard, § 263.15 could not be
construed to include such a standard. Therefore,

"the statute would ... prohibit the promotion of materials which are traditionally entitled to constitutional pro-
tection from government interference under the First Amendment." ... Two judges dissented.

We granted the State's petition for certiorari, 454 U.S. 1052 (1981), presenting the single question:

"To prevent the abuse of children who are made to engage in sexual conduct for commercial purposes, could the
New York State Legislature, consistent with the First Amendment, prohibit the dissemination of material which
shows children engaged in sexual conduct, regardless of whether such material is obscene?"

The Court of Appeals proceeded on the assumption that the standard of obscenity incorporated in § 263.10,
which follows the guidelines enunciated in Miller v. California, (1973), constitutes the appropriate line divid-
ing protected from unprotected expression by which to measure a regulation directed at child pornography ...

The Court of Appeals' assumption was not unreasonable in light of our decisions. This case, however, consti-
tutes our first examination of a statute directed at and limited to depictions of sexual activity involving children.
We believe our inquiry should begin with the question of whether a State has somewhat more freedom in pro-
scribing works which portray sexual acts or lewd exhibitions of genitalia by children.

... Throughout this period, we recognized "the inherent dangers of undertaking to regulate any form of expres-
sion." Miller v. California, supra. Consequently, our difficulty was not only to assure that statutes designed to
regulate obscene materials sufficiently defined what was prohibited, but also to devise substantive limits on what
fell within the permissible scope of regulation.

... Over the past decade, we have adhered to the guidelines expressed in Miller, which subsequently has been fol-
lowed in the regulatory schemes of most States.

The Miller standard, like its predecessors, was an accommodation between the State's interests in protecting
the "sensibilities of unwilling recipients" from exposure to pornographic material and the dangers of censorship
inherent in unabashedly content-based laws. Like obscenity statutes, laws directed at the dissemination of child
pornography run the risk of suppressing protected expression by allowing the hand of the censor to become
unduly heavy. For the following reasons, however, we are persuaded that the States are entitled to greater leeway
in the regulation of pornographic depictions of children.
                                                                                            OBSCENITY AND EXTREME VIOLENCE | 387

First. It is evident beyond the need for elaboration that a State's interest in "safeguarding the physical and psy-
chological wellbeing of a minor" is "compelling." Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court,. (1982) ... Accordingly,
we have sustained legislation aimed at protecting the physical and emotional wellbeing of youth even when the
laws have operated in the sensitive area of constitutionally protected rights ...

The prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse of children constitutes a government objective of surpassing
importance. The legislative findings accompanying passage of the New York laws reflect this concern:

"[T]here has been a proliferation of exploitation of children as subjects in sexual performances. The care of
children is a sacred trust and should not be abused by those who seek to profit through a commercial network
based upon the exploitation of children. The public policy of the state demands the protection of children from
exploitation through sexual performances."

1977 N.Y.Laws, ch. 910, § 1.

We shall not second-guess this legislative judgment ... Suffice it to say that virtually all of the States and the
United States have passed legislation proscribing the production of or otherwise combating "child pornogra-
phy." The legislative judgment, as well as the judgment found in the relevant literature, is that the use of children
as subjects of pornographic materials is harmful to the physiological, emotional, and mental health of the child.
That judgment, we think, easily passes muster under the First Amendment.

Second. The distribution of photographs and films depicting sexual activity by juveniles is intrinsically related
to the sexual abuse of children ... Thirty-five States and Congress have concluded that restraints on the distrib-
ution of pornographic materials are required in order to effectively combat the problem, and there is a body of
literature and testimony to support these legislative conclusions ...

Respondent does not contend that the State is unjustified in pursuing those who distribute child pornography.
Rather, he argues that it is enough for the State to prohibit the distribution of materials that are legally obscene
under the Miller test. While some States may find that this approach properly accommodates its interests, it does
not follow that the First Amendment prohibits a State from going further. The Miller standard, like all general
definitions of what may be banned as obscene, does not reflect the State's particular and more compelling inter-
est in prosecuting those who promote the sexual exploitation of children. Thus, the question under the Miller
test of whether a work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest of the average person bears no con-
nection to the issue of whether a child has been physically or psychologically harmed in the production of the
work. Similarly, a sexually explicit depiction need not be "patently offensive" in order to have required the sexual
exploitation of a child for its production. In addition, a work which, taken on the whole, contains serious liter-
ary, artistic, political, or scientific value may nevertheless embody the hardest core of child pornography ... We
therefore cannot conclude that the Miller standard is a satisfactory solution to the child pornography problem.

Third. The advertising and selling of child pornography provide an economic motive for, and are thus an inte-
gral part of, the production of such materials, an activity illegal throughout the Nation.
388 | OBSCENITY AND EXTREME VIOLENCE

... We note that, were the statutes outlawing the employment of children in these films and photographs fully
effective, and the constitutionality of these laws has not been questioned, the First Amendment implications
would be no greater than that presented by laws against distribution: enforceable production laws would leave
no child pornography to be marketed.

Fourth. The value of permitting live performances and photographic reproductions of children engaged in lewd
sexual conduct is exceedingly modest, if not de minimis. We consider it unlikely that visual depictions of chil-
dren performing sexual acts or lewdly exhibiting their genitals would often constitute an important and neces-
sary part of a literary performance or scientific or educational work ... Nor is there any question here of censoring
a particular literary theme or portrayal of sexual activity. The First Amendment interest is limited to that of ren-
dering the portrayal somewhat more "realistic" by utilizing or photographing children.

Fifth. Recognizing and classifying child pornography as a category of material outside the protection of the First
Amendment is not incompatible with our earlier decisions ...

...

The test for child pornography is separate from the obscenity standard enunciated in Miller, but may be com-
pared to it for the purpose of clarity. The Miller formulation is adjusted in the following respects: a trier of
fact need not find that the material appeals to the prurient interest of the average person; it is not required
that sexual conduct portrayed be done so in a patently offensive manner; and the material at issue need not be
considered as a whole. We note that the distribution of descriptions or other depictions of sexual conduct, not
otherwise obscene, which do not involve live performance or photographic or other visual reproduction of live
performances, retains First Amendment protection. As with obscenity laws, criminal responsibility may not be
imposed without some element of scienter on the part of the defendant ...

Section 263.15's prohibition incorporates a definition of sexual conduct that comports with the above-stated
principles. The forbidden acts to be depicted are listed with sufficient precision and represent the kind of con-
duct that, if it were the theme of a work, could render it legally obscene ...

We hold that § 263.15 sufficiently describes a category of material the production and distribution of which is
not entitled to First Amendment protection. It is therefore clear that there is nothing unconstitutionally "under-
inclusive" about a statute that singles out this category of material for proscription. It also follows that the State
is not barred by the First Amendment from prohibiting the distribution of unprotected materials produced out-
side the State.

It remains to address the claim that the New York statute is unconstitutionally overbroad because it would for-
bid the distribution of material with serious literary, scientific, or educational value or material which does not
threaten the harms sought to be combated by the State. Respondent prevailed on that ground below, and it is to
that issue that we now turn ...

... The scope of the First Amendment overbreadth doctrine, like most exceptions to established principles, must
be carefully tied to the circumstances in which facial invalidation of a statute is truly warranted. Because of the
                                                                                            OBSCENITY AND EXTREME VIOLENCE | 389

wide-reaching effects of striking down a statute on its face at the request of one whose own conduct may be pun-
ished despite the First Amendment, we have recognized that the overbreadth doctrine is "strong medicine," and
have employed it with hesitation, and then "only as a last resort." Broadrick. We have, in consequence, insisted
that the overbreadth involved be "substantial" before the statute involved will be invalidated on its face.

...

The requirement of substantial overbreadth is directly derived from the purpose and nature of the doctrine.
While a sweeping statute, or one incapable of limitation, has the potential to repeatedly chill the exercise of
expressive activity by many individuals, the extent of deterrence of protected speech can be expected to decrease
with the declining reach of the regulation. This observation appears equally applicable to the publication of
books and films as it is to activities, such as picketing or participation in election campaigns, which have previ-
ously been categorized as involving conduct plus speech. We see no appreciable difference between the position
of a publisher or bookseller in doubt as to the reach of New York's child pornography law and the situation faced
by the Oklahoma state employees with respect to that State's restriction on partisan political activity. Indeed, it
could reasonably be argued that the bookseller, with an economic incentive to sell materials that may fall within
the statute's scope, may be less likely to be deterred than the employee who wishes to engage in political cam-
paign activity ...

This requirement of substantial overbreadth may justifiably be applied to statutory challenges which arise in
defense of a criminal prosecution as well as civil enforcement or actions seeking a declaratory judgment ...

Applying these principles, we hold that § 263.15 is not substantially overbroad. We consider this the paradig-
matic case of a state statute whose legitimate reach dwarfs its arguably impermissible applications ...

The judgment of the New York Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded to that court for further
proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

So ordered.

Justice O'Connor, concurring.

Although I join the Court's opinion, I write separately to stress that the Court does not hold that New York
must except "material with serious literary, scientific, or educational value," ante at 458 U. S. 766, from its
statute. The Court merely holds that, even if the First Amendment shelters such material, New York's current
statute is not sufficiently overbroad to support respondent's facial attack. The compelling interests identified in
today's opinion, ... suggest that the Constitution might, in fact, permit New York to ban knowing distribution
of works depicting minors engaged in explicit sexual conduct, regardless of the social value of the depictions. ...

Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.

We consider whether a California law imposing restrictions on violent video games comports with the First
Amendment.

California Assembly Bill 1179 (2005), Cal. Civ. Code Ann. §§1746-1746.5 (West 2009) (Act), prohibits the sale
or rental of "violent video games" to minors, and requires their packaging to be labeled "18." The Act covers
games "in which the range of options available to a player includes killing, maiming, dismembering, or sexually
assaulting an image of a human being, if those acts are depicted" in a manner that "[a] reasonable person, consid-
ering the game as a whole, would find appeals to a deviant or morbid interest of minors," that is "patently offen-
sive to prevailing standards in the community as to what is suitable for minors," and that "causes the game, as a
whole, to lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors." Violation of the Act is punishable
by a civil fine of up to $1,000. Respondents, representing the video-game and software industries, brought a pre
enforcement challenge to the Act in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.
That court concluded that the Act violated the First Amendment and permanently enjoined its enforcement.
The Court of Appeals affirmed and we granted certiorari.

California correctly acknowledges that video games qualify for First Amendment protection. The Free Speech
Clause exists principally to protect discourse on public matters, but we have long recognized that it is difficult
to distinguish politics from entertainment, and dangerous to try ... Like the protected books, plays, and movies
that preceded them, video games communicate ideas--and even social messages--through many familiar literary
devices (such as characters, dialogue, plot, and music) and through features distinctive to the medium (such as
the player's interaction with the virtual world). That suffices to confer First Amendment protection. Under our
Constitution, "esthetic and moral judgments about art and literature ... are for the individual to make, not for
the Government to decree, even with the mandate or approval of a majority." United States v. Playboy Entertain­
ment Group, Inc. (2000) ...

The most basic of those principles is this: "[A]s a general matter, ... government has no power to restrict expres-
sion because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content." Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union
(2002). There are of course exceptions ...

Last Term, in US v. Stevens, (2010), we held that new categories of unprotected speech may not be added to the
list by a legislature that concludes certain speech is too harmful to be tolerated ...
                                                                                            OBSCENITY AND EXTREME VIOLENCE | 391

That holding controls this case. As in Stevens, California has tried to make violent-speech regulation look like
obscenity regulation by appending a saving clause required for the latter. That does not suffice. Our cases have
been clear that the obscenity exception to the First Amendment does not cover whatever a legislature finds
shocking, but only depictions of "sexual conduct," Miller.

Stevens was not the first time we have encountered and rejected a State's attempt to shoehorn speech about
violence into obscenity ... Our opinion in Winters v NY (1948) ... made clear that violence is not part of the
obscenity that the Constitution permits to be regulated ... Because speech about violence is not obscene, it is of
no consequence that California's statute mimics the New York statute regulating obscenity-for-minors that we
upheld in Ginsberg v. New York (1968). That case approved a prohibition on the sale to minors of sexual material
that would be obscene from the perspective of a child. We held that the legislature could "adjus[t] the definition
of obscenity `to social realities by permitting the appeal of this type of material to be assessed in terms of the sex-
ual interests ... ' of ... minors." And because "obscenity is not protected expression," the New York statute could
be sustained so long as the legislature's judgment that the proscribed materials were harmful to children "was
not irrational."

The California Act is something else entirely. It does not adjust the boundaries of an existing category of unpro-
tected speech to ensure that a definition designed for adults is not uncritically applied to children. California
does not argue that it is empowered to prohibit selling offensively violent works to adults--and it is wise not to,
since that is but a hair's breadth from the argument rejected in Stevens. Instead, it wishes to create a wholly new
category of content-based regulation that is permissible only for speech directed at children.

... California's argument would fare better if there were a longstanding tradition in this country of specially
restricting children's access to depictions of violence, but there is none. Certainly the books we give children to
read--or read to them when they are younger--contain no shortage of gore. Grimm's Fairy Tales, for example,
are grim indeed. As her just deserts for trying to poison Snow White, the wicked queen is made to dance in red
hot slippers "till she fell dead on the floor, a sad example of envy and jealousy." Cinderella's evil stepsisters have
their eyes pecked out by doves. And Hansel and Gretel (children!) kill their captor by baking her in an oven.

High-school reading lists are full of similar fare. Homer's Odysseus blinds Polyphemus the Cyclops by grinding
out his eye with a heated stake. In the Inferno, Dante and Virgil watch corrupt politicians struggle to stay sub-
merged beneath a lake of boiling pitch, lest they be skewered by devils above the surface. And Golding's Lord of
the Flies recounts how a schoolboy called Piggy is savagely murdered by other children while marooned on an
island.

This is not to say that minors' consumption of violent entertainment has never encountered resistance. In the
1800's, dime novels depicting crime and "penny dreadfuls" (named for their price and content) were blamed in
some quarters for juvenile delinquency. When motion pictures came along, they became the villains instead ...
Many in the late 1940's and early 1950's blamed comic books for fostering a "preoccupation with violence and
horror" among the young, leading to a rising juvenile crime rate. But efforts to convince Congress to restrict
comic books failed. And, of course, after comic books came television and music lyrics.
392 | OBSCENITY AND EXTREME VIOLENCE

California claims that video games present special problems because they are "interactive," in that the player par-
ticipates in the violent action on screen and determines its outcome. The latter feature is nothing new: Since
at least the publication of The Adventures of You: Sugarcane Island in 1969, young readers of choose-your-
own adventure stories have been able to make decisions that determine the plot by following instructions about
which page to turn to. As for the argument that video games enable participation in the violent action, that
seems to us more a matter of degree than of kind ...

Justice Alito [concurring] has done considerable independent research to identify video games in which "the
violence is astounding." "Victims are dismembered, decapitated, disemboweled, set on fire, and chopped into lit-
tle pieces. ... Blood gushes, splatters, and pools." Justice Alito recounts all these disgusting video games in order
to disgust us--but disgust is not a valid basis for restricting expression. And the same is true of Justice Alito's
description of those video games he has discovered that have a racial or ethnic motive for their violence--" `eth-
nic cleansing' [of] ... African Americans, Latinos, or Jews." To what end does he relate this? Does it somehow
increase the "aggressiveness" that California wishes to suppress? Who knows? But it does arouse the reader's ire,
and the reader's desire to put an end to this horrible message. Thus, ironically, Justice Alito's argument high-
lights the precise danger posed by the California Act: that the ideas expressed by speech--whether it be violence,
or gore, or racism--and not its objective effects, may be the real reason for governmental proscription.

Because the Act imposes a restriction on the content of protected speech, it is invalid unless California can
demonstrate that it passes strict scrutiny--that is, unless it is justified by a compelling government interest and is
narrowly drawn to serve that interest. The State must specifically identify an "actual problem" in need of solving
and the curtailment of free speech must be actually necessary to the solution. That is a demanding standard."It
is rare that a regulation restricting speech because of its content will ever be permissible."

California cannot meet that standard ...

The State's evidence is not compelling ...

The Act is also seriously underinclusive in another respect--and a respect that renders irrelevant the contentions
of the concurrence and the dissents that video games are qualitatively different from other portrayals of violence.
The California Legislature is perfectly willing to leave this dangerous, mind-altering material in the hands of chil-
dren so long as one parent (or even an aunt or uncle) says it's OK. And there are not even any requirements as
to how this parental or avuncular relationship is to be verified; apparently the child's or putative parent's, aunt's,
or uncle's say-so suffices. That is not how one addresses a serious social problem ...

But leaving that aside, California cannot show that the Act's restrictions meet a substantial need of parents who
wish to restrict their children's access to violent video games but cannot do so ...

And finally, the Act's purported aid to parental authority is vastly overinclusive. Not all of the children who
are forbidden to purchase violent video games on their own have parents who care whether they purchase
violent video games. While some of the legislation's effect may indeed be in support of what some parents of
the restricted children actually want, its entire effect is only in support of what the State thinks parents ought to
want. This is not the narrow tailoring to "assisting parents" that restriction of First Amendment rights requires.
                                                                                            OBSCENITY AND EXTREME VIOLENCE | 393

California's effort to regulate violent video games is the latest episode in a long series of failed attempts to censor
violent entertainment for minors. While we have pointed out above that some of the evidence brought forward
to support the harmfulness of video games is unpersuasive, we do not mean to demean or disparage the concerns
that underlie the attempt to regulate them--concerns that may and doubtless do prompt a good deal of parental
oversight. We have no business passing judgment on the view of the California Legislature that violent video
games (or, for that matter, any other forms of speech) corrupt the young or harm their moral development. Our
task is only to say whether or not such works constitute a "well-defined and narrowly limited clas[s] of speech,
the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem," Chap­
linsky (the answer plainly is no); and if not, whether the regulation of such works is justified by that high degree
of necessity we have described as a compelling state interest (it is not). Even where the protection of children is
the object, the constitutional limits on governmental action apply.

California's legislation straddles the fence between (1) addressing a serious social problem and (2) helping con-
cerned parents control their children. Both ends are legitimate, but when they affect First Amendment rights
they must be pursued by means that are neither seriously underinclusive nor seriously overinclusive ... As a
means of protecting children from portrayals of violence, the legislation is seriously underinclusive, not only
because it excludes portrayals other than video games, but also because it permits a parental or avuncular veto.
And as a means of assisting concerned parents it is seriously overinclusive because it abridges the First Amend-
ment rights of young people whose parents (and aunts and uncles) think violent video games are a harmless
pastime. And the overbreadth in achieving one goal is not cured by the underbreadth in achieving the other.
Legislation such as this, which is neither fish nor fowl, cannot survive strict scrutiny.

We affirm the judgment below. It is so ordered.

Justice Breyer, dissenting.

... [T]he special First Amendment category I find relevant is ... the category of "protection of children." This
Court has held that the "power of the state to control the conduct of children reaches beyond the scope of its
authority over adults." Prince v. Massachusetts (1944). And the "`regulatio[n] of communication addressed to
[children] need not conform to the requirements of the [F]irst [A]mendment in the same way as those applica-
ble to adults.' " Ginsberg v. New York (1968) ...

In my view, California's statute provides "fair notice of what is prohibited," and consequently it is not impermis-
sibly vague. Ginsberg explains why that is so. The Court there considered a New York law that forbade the sale
to minors of a "picture, photograph, drawing, sculpture, motion picture film, or similar visual representation or
image of a person or portion of the human body which depicts nudity ...," that "predominately appeals to the
prurient, shameful or morbid interest of minors," and "is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult
community as a whole with respect to what is suitable material for minors," and "is utterly without redeeming
social importance for minors." This Court upheld the New York statute in Ginsberg ...

Comparing the language of California's statute with the language of New York's statute it is difficult to find any
vagueness-related difference. Why are the words "kill," "maim," and "dismember" any more difficult to under-
stand than the word "nudity?" ...
394 | OBSCENITY AND EXTREME VIOLENCE

The remainder of California's definition copies, almost word for word, the language this Court used in Miller v.
California (1973), in permitting a total ban on material that satisfied its definition (one enforced with criminal
penalties) ...

Both the Miller standard and the law upheld in Ginsberg lack perfect clarity. But that fact reflects the difficulty
of the Court's long search for words capable of protecting expression without depriving the State of a legitimate
constitutional power to regulate. As is well known, at one point Justice Stewart thought he could do no better
in defining obscenity than, "I know it when I see it." Jacobellis v. Ohio (1964) (concurring opinion). And Justice
Douglas dissented from Miller's standard, which he thought was still too vague. Ultimately, however, this Court
accepted the "community standards" tests used in Miller and Ginsberg. They reflect the fact that sometimes,
even when a precise standard proves elusive, it is easy enough to identify instances that fall within a legitimate
regulation. And they seek to draw a line, which, while favoring free expression, will nonetheless permit a legisla-
ture to find the words necessary to accomplish a legitimate constitutional objective ...

...

The upshot is that California's statute, as applied to its heartland of applications (i.e., buyers under 17; extremely
violent, realistic video games), imposes a restriction on speech that is modest at most. That restriction is justified
by a compelling interest (supplementing parents' efforts to prevent their children from purchasing potentially
harmful violent, interactive material). And there is no equally effective, less restrictive alternative. California's
statute is consequently constitutional on its face--though litigants remain free to challenge the statute as applied
in particular instances, including any effort by the State to apply it to minors aged 17.

I add that the majority's different conclusion creates a serious anomaly in First Amendment law. Ginsberg makes
clear that a State can prohibit the sale to minors of depictions of nudity; today the Court makes clear that a State
cannot prohibit the sale to minors of the most violent interactive video games. But what sense does it make to
forbid selling to a 13-year-old boy a magazine with an image of a nude woman, while protecting a sale to that
13-year-old of an interactive video game in which he actively, but virtually, binds and gags the woman, then tor-
tures and kills her? What kind of First Amendment would permit the government to protect children by restrict-
ing sales of that extremely violent video game only when the woman--bound, gagged, tortured, and killed--is
also topless?

This anomaly is not compelled by the First Amendment. It disappears once one recognizes that extreme vio-
lence, where interactive, and without literary, artistic, or similar justification, can prove at least as, if not more,
harmful to children as photographs of nudity. And the record here is more than adequate to support such a
view. That is why I believe that Ginsberg controls the outcome here a fortiori. And it is why I believe California's
law is constitutional on its face ...

For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.

Whitney v. California

274 U.S. 357 (1925)

    Vote: 9-0
    Opinion: Sanford
    Decision: Affirmed
    Majority: Sanford, joined by Taft, Van Devanter, McReynolds, Sutherland, Butler, Stone
    Concurrence: Brandeis, joined by Holmes

MR. JUSTICE SANFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.

By a criminal information filed in the Superior Court of Alameda County, California, the plaintiff in error was
charged, in five counts, with violations of the Criminal Syndicalism Act of that State. Statutes, 1919, c. 188, p.
281. She was tried, convicted on the first count, and sentenced to imprisonment. The judgment was affirmed by
the District Court of Appeal. 57 Cal. App. 449. Her petition to have the case heard by the Supreme Court was
denied. Ib., 453. And the case was brought here on a writ of error which was allowed by the Presiding Justice of
the Court of Appeal, the highest court of the State in which a decision could be had.

The pertinent provisions of the Criminal Syndicalism Act are:

"Section 1. The term `criminal syndicalism' as used in this act is hereby defined as any doctrine or precept advo-
cating, teaching or aiding and abetting the commission of crime, sabotage (which word is hereby defined as
meaning willful and malicious physical damage or injury to physical property), or unlawful acts of force and vio-
lence or unlawful methods of terrorism as a means of accomplishing a change in industrial ownership or control,
or effecting any political change."

...

And here, since it appears [...] that the question whether the Syndicalism Act and its application in this case was
repugnant to the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment was considered and
passed upon by [the Court of Appeals] -- this being a federal question constituting an appropriate ground for
a review of the judgment -- we conclude that this Court has acquired jurisdiction under the writ of error. The
order dismissing the writ for want of jurisdiction will accordingly be set aside.

...

... [T]he defendant, a resident of Oakland, in Alameda County, California, had been a member of the Local
Oakland branch of the Socialist Party. This Local sent delegates to the national convention of the Socialist Party
                                                                                                           SPEECH AND ASSOCIATION | 397

held in Chicago in 1919, which resulted in a split between the "radical" group and the old-wing Socialists. The
"radicals" -- to whom the Oakland delegates adhered -- being ejected, went to another hall, and formed the
Communist Labor Party of America. Its Constitution provided for the membership of persons subscribing to
the principles of the Party and pledging themselves to be guided by its Platform, and for the formation of state
organizations conforming to its Platform as the supreme declaration of the Party.

... [T]he Party declared that it was in full harmony with "the revolutionary working class parties of all countries,"
and adhered to the principles of Communism laid down in the Manifesto of the Third International at Moscow,
and that its purpose was "to create a unified revolutionary working class movement in America," organizing the
workers as a class in a revolutionary class struggle to conquer the capitalist state for the overthrow of capitalist
rule, the conquest of political power and the establishment of a working class government, the Dictatorship of
the Proletariat, in place of the state machinery of the capitalists, which should make and enforce the laws, reor-
ganize society on the basis of Communism, and bring about the Communist Commonwealth[...].

... [I]t is urged that the Act, as here construed and applied, deprived the defendant of her liberty without due
process of law in that it has made her action in attending the Oakland convention unlawful by reason of "a
subsequent event brought about against her will by the agency of others," with no showing of a specific intent
on her part to join in the forbidden purpose of the association, and merely because, by reason of a lack of
"prophetic" understanding, she failed to foresee the quality that others would give to the convention. The argu-
ment is, in effect, that the character of the state organization could not be forecast when she attended the con-
vention; that she had no purpose of helping to create an instrument of terrorism and violence; ... that it was
not until after the majority of the convention turned out to be "contrary-minded, and other less temperate poli-
cies prevailed," that the convention could have taken on the character of criminal syndicalism, and that, as this
was done over her protest, her mere presence in the convention, however violent the opinions expressed therein,
could not thereby become a crime.

[This] argument entirely disregards the facts: that the defendant had previously taken out a membership card in
the National Party, that the resolution which she supported did not advocate the use of the ballot to the exclu-
sion of violent and unlawful means of bringing about the desired changes in industrial and political conditions,
and that, after the constitution of the California Party had been adopted, and this resolution had been voted
down and the National Program accepted, she not only remained in the convention, without protest, until its
close, but subsequently manifested her acquiescence by attending as an alternate member of the State Executive
Committee and continuing as member of the Communist Labor Party.

...

The Act, plainly, meets the essential requirement of due process that a penal statute be "sufficiently explicit to
inform those who are subject to it, what conduct on their part will render them liable to its penalties," and be
couched in terms that are not "so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning
and differ as to its application." Connally v. General Construction Co., (1926).
398 | SPEECH AND ASSOCIATION

... Neither is the Syndicalism Act repugnant to the equal protection clause on the ground that, as its penalties
are confined to those who advocate a resort to violent and unlawful methods as a means of changing industrial
and political conditions, it arbitrarily discriminates between such persons and those who may advocate a resort
to these methods as a means of maintaining such conditions.

... [T]here is no substantial basis for the contention that the legislature has arbitrarily or unreasonably limited
its application to those advocating the use of violent and unlawful methods to effect changes in industrial and
political conditions, there being nothing indicating any ground to apprehend that those desiring to maintain
existing industrial and political conditions did or would advocate such methods.

...

Nor is the Syndicalism Act, as applied in this case, repugnant to the due process clause as a restraint of the rights
of free speech, assembly, and association.

...

By enacting the provisions of the Syndicalism Act, the State has declared, through its legislative body, that to
knowingly be or become a member of or assist in organizing an association to advocate, teach or aid and abet the
commission of crimes or unlawful acts of force, violence or terrorism as a means of accomplishing industrial or
political changes involves such danger to the public peace and the security of the State, that these acts should be
penalized in the exercise of its police power. That determination must be given great weight ...

We cannot hold that, as here applied, the Act is an unreasonable or arbitrary exercise of the police power of the
State, unwarrantably infringing any right of free speech, assembly or association, or that those persons are pro-
tected from punishment by the due process clause who abuse such rights by joining and furthering an organiza-
tion thus menacing the peace and welfare of the State.

We find no repugnancy in the Syndicalism Act as applied in this case to either the due process or equal protection
clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment on any of the grounds upon which its validity has been here challenged.

The order dismissing the writ of error will be vacated and set aside, and the judgment of the Court of Appeal
affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Justice Brandeis, concurring.

[T]he accused is to be punished not for contempt, incitement, or conspiracy, but for a step in preparation,
which, if it threatens the public order at all, does so only remotely. The novelty in the prohibition introduced is
that the statute aims not at the practice of criminal syndicalism, nor even directly at the preaching of it, but at
association with those who propose to preach it.

... [A]lthough the rights of free speech and assembly are fundamental, they are not, in their nature, absolute.
Their exercise is subject to restriction if the particular restriction proposed is required in order to protect the
                                                                                                           SPEECH AND ASSOCIATION | 399

State from destruction or from serious injury, political, economic, or moral. That the necessity which is essential
to a valid restriction does not exist unless speech would produce, or is intended to produce, a clear and immi-
nent danger of some substantive evil which the State constitutionally may seek to prevent has been settled. See
Schenck v. United States, (1919).

...

This Court has not yet fixed the standard by which to determine when a danger shall be deemed clear; how
remote the danger may be and yet be deemed present, and what degree of evil shall be deemed sufficiently sub-
stantial to justify resort to abridgement of free speech and assembly as the means of protection. To reach sound
conclusions on these matters, we must bear in mind why a State is, ordinarily, denied the power to prohibit dis-
semination of social, economic and political doctrine which a vast majority of its citizens believes to be false and
fraught with evil consequence.

...

Fear of serious injury cannot alone justify suppression of free speech and assembly. Men feared witches and
burnt women. It is the function of speech to free men from the bondage of irrational fears. To justify suppres-
sion of free speech, there must be reasonable ground to fear that serious evil will result if free speech is practiced.
There must be reasonable ground to believe that the danger apprehended is imminent. There must be reason-
able ground to believe that the evil to be prevented is a serious one. Every denunciation of existing law tends in
some measure to increase the probability that there will be violation of it ...

... [E]ven imminent danger cannot justify resort to prohibition of these functions essential to effective democ-
racy unless the evil apprehended is relatively serious. Prohibition of free speech and assembly is a measure so
stringent that it would be inappropriate as the means for averting a relatively trivial harm to society. A police
measure may be unconstitutional merely because the remedy, although effective as means of protection, is
unduly harsh or oppressive ...

I am unable to assent to the suggestion in the opinion of the Court that assembling with a political party, formed
to advocate the desirability of a proletarian revolution by mass action at some date necessarily far in the future, is
not a right within the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment. In the present case, however, there was other
testimony which tended to establish the existence of a conspiracy, on the part of members of the International
Workers of the World, to commit present serious crimes, and likewise to show that such a conspiracy would be
furthered by the activity of the society of which Miss Whitney was a member. Under these circumstances, the
judgment of the state court cannot be disturbed.

... Because we may not enquire into the errors now alleged, I concur in affirming the judgment of the state court.

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES joins in this opinion.

NAACP v. Alabama

357 U.S. 449 (1958)

    Vote: 9-0
    Opinion: Harlan
    Decision: Reversed

Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the Court.

We review from the standpoint of its validity under the Federal Constitution a judgment of civil contempt
entered against petitioner, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, in the courts of
Alabama. The question presented is whether Alabama, consistently with the Due Process Clause of the Four-
teenth Amendment, can compel petitioner to reveal to the State's Attorney General the names and addresses of
all its Alabama members and agents, without regard to their positions or functions in the Association. The judg-
ment of contempt was based upon petitioner's refusal to comply fully with a court order requiring in part the
production of membership lists. Petitioner's claim is that the order, in the circumstances shown by this record,
violated rights assured to petitioner and its members under the Constitution.

Alabama has a statute, similar to those of many other States, which requires a foreign corporation, except as
exempted, to qualify before doing business by filing its corporate charter with the Secretary of State and desig-
nating a place of business and an agent to receive service of process. The statute imposes a fine on a corpora-
tion transacting intrastate business before qualifying, and provides for criminal prosecution of officers of such a
corporation. Ala. Code, 1940, Tit. 10, §§ 192-198. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People is a nonprofit membership corporation organized under the laws of New York. Its purposes, fostered on
a nationwide basis, are those indicated by its name, and it operates through chartered affiliates which are inde-
pendent unincorporated associations, with membership therein equivalent to membership in petitioner. The
first Alabama affiliates were chartered in 1918. Since that time, the aims of the Association have been advanced
through activities of its affiliates, and, in 1951, the Association itself opened a regional office in Alabama, at
which it employed two supervisory persons and one clerical worker. The Association has never complied with
the qualification statute, from which it considered itself exempt.

In 1956, the Attorney General of Alabama brought an equity suit in the State Circuit Court, Montgomery
County, to enjoin the Association from conducting further activities within, and to oust it from, the State.

...

Petitioner ... contended that its activities did not subject it to the qualification requirements of the statute and
that, in any event, what the State sought to accomplish by its suit would violate rights to freedom of speech and
assembly guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States ... Over peti-
tioner's objections, the court ordered the production of a substantial part of the requested records, including
the membership lists, and postponed the hearing on the restraining order to a date later than the time ordered
for production.
                                                                                                           SPEECH AND ASSOCIATION | 401

... [P]etitioner produced substantially all the data called for by the production order except its membership lists,
as to which it contended that Alabama could not constitutionally compel disclosure ... The Circuit Court made
a further order adjudging petitioner in ... contempt. Under Alabama law, effect of the contempt adjudication
was to foreclose petitioner from obtaining a hearing on the merits of the underlying ouster action, or from tak-
ing any steps to dissolve the temporary restraining order which had been issued ex parte, until it purged itself of
contempt.

... We granted certiorari because of the importance of the constitutional questions presented.

...

... We think that petitioner argues more appropriately the rights of its members, and that its nexus with them is
sufficient to permit that it act as their representative before this Court. In so concluding, we reject respondent's
argument that the Association lacks standing to assert here constitutional rights pertaining to the members, who
are not, of course, parties to the litigation ...

If petitioner's rank-and-file members are constitutionally entitled to withhold their connection with the Asso-
ciation despite the production order, it is manifest that this right is properly assertable by the Association.
To require that it be claimed by the members themselves would result in nullification of the right at the very
moment of its assertion. Petitioner is the appropriate party to assert these rights, because it and its members are,
in every practical sense, identical.

We thus reach petitioner's claim that the production order in the state litigation trespasses upon fundamental
freedoms protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Petitioner argues that, in view of
the facts and circumstances shown in the record, the effect of compelled disclosure of the membership lists will
be to abridge the rights of its rank-and-file members to engage in lawful association in support of their common
beliefs. It contends that governmental action which, although not directly suppressing association, nevertheless
carries this consequence, can be justified only upon some overriding valid interest of the State.

...

In the domain of these indispensable liberties, whether of speech, press, or association, the decisions of this
Court recognize that abridgment of such rights, even though unintended, may inevitably follow from varied
forms of governmental action.

...

It is hardly a novel perception that compelled disclosure of affiliation with groups engaged in advocacy may con-
stitute as effective a restraint on freedom of association as the forms of governmental action in the cases above
were thought likely to produce upon the particular constitutional rights there involved. This Court has recog-
nized the vital relationship between freedom to associate and privacy in one's associations. When referring to the
varied forms of governmental action which might interfere with freedom of assembly, it said in American Com­
munications Assn. v. Douds, (1950):
402 | SPEECH AND ASSOCIATION

"A requirement that adherents of particular religious faiths or political parties wear identifying armbands, for
example, is obviously of this nature."

Compelled disclosure of membership in an organization engaged in advocacy of particular beliefs is of the same
order. Inviolability of privacy in group association may in many circumstances be indispensable to preservation
of freedom of association, particularly where a group espouses dissident beliefs.

...

It is not sufficient to answer, as the State does here, that whatever repressive effect compulsory disclosure of
names of petitioner's members may have upon participation by Alabama citizens in petitioner's activities follows
not from state action, but from private community pressures. The crucial factor is the interplay of governmental
and private action, for it is only after the initial exertion of state power represented by the production order that
private action takes hold.

...

We hold that the immunity from state scrutiny of membership lists which the Association claims on behalf of
its members is here so related to the right of the members to pursue their lawful private interests privately and
to associate freely with others in so doing as to come within the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment. And
we conclude that Alabama has fallen short of showing a controlling justification for the deterrent effect on the
free enjoyment of the right to associate which disclosure of membership lists is likely to have. Accordingly, the
judgment of civil contempt and the $100,000 fine which resulted from petitioner's refusal to comply with the
production order in this respect must fall.

...

For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alabama must be reversed, and the case remanded
for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

Reversed.

Hurley v. Irish GLB of Boston

515 U.S. 557 (1995)

    Vote: 9-0
    Decision: Reversed

Justice SOUTER delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

The issue in this case is whether Massachusetts may require private citizens who organize a parade to include
among the marchers a group imparting a message the organizers do not wish to convey. We hold that such a
mandate violates the First Amendment.

[...] Mayor James Michael Curley himself granted authority to organize and conduct the St. Patrick's Day-Evac-
uation Day Parade to the petitioner South Boston Allied War Veterans Council, an unincorporated association
of individuals elected from various South Boston veterans groups. Every year since that time, the Council has
applied for and received a permit for the parade, which at times has included as many as 20,000 marchers and
drawn up to 1 million watchers. No other applicant has ever applied for that permit. Through 1992, the city
allowed the Council to use the city's official seal, and provided printing services as well as direct funding.

In 1992, a number of gay, lesbian, and bisexual descendants of the Irish immigrants joined together with other
supporters to form the respondent organization, GLIB, to march in the parade [...]. Although the Council
denied GLIB's application to take part in the 1992 parade, GLIB obtained a state-court order to include its con-
tingent, which marched "uneventfully" among that year's 10,000 participants and 750,000 spectators.

In 1993, after the Council had again refused to admit GLIB to the upcoming parade, the organization and some
of its members filed this suit against the Council, the individual petitioner John J."Wacko" Hurley, and the city
of Boston, alleging violations of the State and Federal Constitutions and of the state public accommodations
law, which prohibits "any distinction, discrimination or restriction on account of ... sexual orientation ... relative
to the admission of any person to, or treatment in any place of public accommodation, resort or amusement."

...

We granted certiorari to determine whether the requirement to admit a parade contingent expressing a message
not of the private organizers' own choosing violates the First Amendment. We hold that it does and reverse.

...

... [W]e use the word "parade" to indicate marchers who are making some sort of collective point, not just to
each other but to bystanders along the way. Indeed, a parade's dependence on watchers is so extreme that nowa-
days, as with Bishop Berkeley's celebrated tree, "if a parade or demonstration receives no media coverage, it may
as well not have happened." Parades are thus a form of expression, not just motion, and the inherent expressive-
ness of marching to make a point explains our cases involving protest marches ...
404 | SPEECH AND ASSOCIATION

The protected expression that inheres in a parade is not limited to its banners and songs, however, for the Consti-
tution looks beyond written or spoken words as mediums of expression. Noting that "[s]ymbolism is a primitive
but effective way of communicating ideas," West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, (1943), our cases have recog-
nized that the First Amendment shields such acts as saluting a flag (and refusing to do so) [other examples omit-
ted], and even "[m]arching, walking or parading" in uniforms displaying the swastika, National Socialist Party
of America v. Skokie, (1977).

...

Respondents' participation as a unit in the parade was equally expressive. GLIB was formed for the very purpose
of marching in it, as the trial court found, in order to celebrate its members' identity as openly gay, lesbian, and
bisexual descendants of the Irish immigrants, to show that there are such individuals in the community, and to
support the like men and women who sought to march in the New York parade. [...] In 1993, members of GLIB
marched behind a shamrock-strewn banner with the simple inscription "Irish American Gay, Lesbian and Bisex-
ual Group of Boston." GLIB understandably seeks to communicate its ideas as part of the existing parade, rather
than staging one of its own.

...

[T]he disagreement goes to the admission of GLIB as its own parade unit carrying its own banner. Since
every participating unit affects the message conveyed by the private organizers, the state courts' application of
the statute produced an order essentially requiring petitioners to alter the expressive content of their parade.
Although the state courts spoke of the parade as a place of public accommodation, once the expressive character
of both the parade and the marching GLIB contingent is understood, it becomes apparent that the state courts'
application of the statute had the effect of declaring the sponsors' speech itself to be the public accommodation.
Under this approach any contingent of protected individuals with a message would have the right to participate
in petitioners' speech, so that the communication produced by the private organizers would be shaped by all
those protected by the law who wished to join in with some expressive demonstration of their own. But this use
of the State's power violates the fundamental rule of protection under the First Amendment, that a speaker has
the autonomy to choose the content of his own message.

...

Petitioners' claim to the benefit of this principle of autonomy to control one's own speech is as sound as the
South Boston parade is expressive. Rather like a composer, the Council selects the expressive units of the parade
from potential participants, and though the score may not produce a particularized message, each contingent's
expression in the Council's eyes comports with what merits celebration on that day. Even if this view gives the
Council credit for a more considered judgment than it actively made, the Council clearly decided to exclude a
message it did not like from the communication it chose to make, and that is enough to invoke its right as a pri-
vate speaker to shape its expression by speaking on one subject while remaining silent on another.

...
                                                                                                           SPEECH AND ASSOCIATION | 405

Respondents argue that any tension between this rule and the Massachusetts law falls short of unconstitutional-
ity, citing the most recent of our cases on the general subject of compelled access for expressive purposes, Turner
Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, (1994). There we reviewed regulations requiring cable operators to set aside
channels for designated broadcast signals, and applied only intermediate scrutiny. Respondents contend on this
authority that admission of GLIB to the parade would not threaten the core principle of speaker's autonomy
because the Council, like a cable operator, is merely "a conduit" for the speech of participants in the parade
"rather than itself a speaker." But this metaphor is not apt here, because GLIB's participation would likely be
perceived as having resulted from the Council's customary determination about a unit admitted to the parade,
that its message was worthy of presentation and quite possibly of support as well. A newspaper, similarly, "is
more than a passive receptacle or conduit for news, comment, and advertising," and we have held that "[t]he
choice of material ... and the decisions made as to limitations on the size and content ... and treatment of pub-
lic issues ... -whether fair or unfair-constitute the exercise of editorial control and judgment" upon which the
State can not intrude ... Thus, when dissemination of a view contrary to one's own is forced upon a speaker
intimately connected with the communication advanced, the speaker's right to autonomy over the message is
compromised.

...

Parades and demonstrations, in contrast, are not understood to be so neutrally presented or selectively viewed.
Unlike the programming offered on various channels by a cable network, the parade does not consist of indi-
vidual, unrelated segments that happen to be transmitted together for individual selection by members of the
audience. Although each parade unit generally identifies itself, each is understood to contribute something to a
common theme, and accordingly there is no customary practice whereby private sponsors disavow "any identity
of viewpoint" between themselves and the selected participants.

... Considering that GLIB presumably would have had a fair shot (under neutral criteria developed by the city)
at obtaining a parade permit of its own, respondents have not shown that petitioners enjoy the capacity to
"silence the voice of competing speakers," as cable operators do with respect to program providers who wish to
reach subscribers, Turner Broadcasting, supra. Nor has any other legitimate interest been identified in support
of applying the Massachusetts statute in this way to expressive activity like the parade.

... When the law is applied to expressive activity in the way it was done here, its apparent object is simply to
require speakers to modify the content of their expression to whatever extent beneficiaries of the law choose to
alter it with messages of their own. But in the absence of some further, legitimate end, this object is merely to
allow exactly what the general rule of speaker's autonomy forbids.

... Assuming the parade to be large enough and a source of benefits (apart from its expression) that would gen-
erally justify a mandated access provision, GLIB could nonetheless be refused admission as an expressive contin-
gent with its own message just as readily as a private club could exclude an applicant whose manifest views were
at odds with a position taken by the club's existing members.

Our holding today rests not on any particular view about the Council's message but on the Nation's commit-
ment to protect freedom of speech. Disapproval of a private speaker's statement does not legitimize use of the
§406 | SPEECH AND ASSOCIATION

Commonwealth's power to compel the speaker to alter the message by including one more acceptable to others.
Accordingly, the judgment of the Supreme Judicial Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings
not inconsistent with this opinion.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.

... The Boy Scouts is a private, not-forprofit organization engaged in instilling its system of values in young peo-
ple. The Boy Scouts asserts that homosexual conduct is inconsistent with the values it seeks to instill. Respon-
dent is James Dale, a former Eagle Scout whose adult membership in the Boy Scouts was revoked when the Boy
Scouts learned that he is an avowed homosexual and gay rights activist. The New Jersey Supreme Court held
that New Jersey's public accommodations law requires that the Boy Scouts readmit Dale. This case presents the
question whether applying New Jersey's public accommodations law in this way violates the Boy Scouts' First
Amendment right of expressive association. We hold that it does.

James Dale entered Scouting in 1978 at the age of eight by joining Monmouth Council's Cub Scout Pack 142.
Dale became a Boy Scout in 1981 and remained a Scout until he turned 18. By all accounts, Dale was an exem-
plary Scout. In 1988, he achieved the rank of Eagle Scout, one of Scouting's highest honors.

Dale applied for adult membership in the Boy Scouts in 1989. The Boy Scouts approved his application for the
position of assistant scoutmaster of Troop 73. Around the same time, Dale left home to attend Rutgers Univer-
sity. After arriving at Rutgers, Dale first acknowledged to himself and others that he is gay. He quickly became
involved with, and eventually became the copresident of, the Rutgers University Lesbian/Gay Alliance. In 1990,
Dale attended a seminar addressing the psychological and health needs of lesbian and gay teenagers. A newspa-
per covering the event interviewed Dale about his advocacy of homosexual teenagers' need for gay role models.
In early July 1990, the newspaper published the interview and Dale's photograph over a caption identifying him
as the copresident of the Lesbian/ Gay Alliance.
                                                                                                           SPEECH AND ASSOCIATION | 407

Later that month, Dale received a letter from Monmouth Council Executive James Kay revoking his adult mem-
bership. Dale wrote to Kay requesting the reason for Monmouth Council's decision. Kay responded by letter
that the Boy Scouts "specifically forbid membership to homosexuals."

In 1992, Dale filed a complaint against the Boy Scouts in the New Jersey Superior Court. The complaint alleged
that the Boy Scouts had violated New Jersey's public accommodations statute and its common law by revok-
ing Dale's membership based solely on his sexual orientation. New Jersey's public accommodations statute pro-
hibits, among other things, discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in places of public accommodation
...

We granted the Boy Scouts' petition for certiorari to determine whether the application of New Jersey's public
accommodations law violated the First Amendment.

...

The forced inclusion of an unwanted person in a group infringes the group's freedom of expressive association
if the presence of that person affects in a significant way the group's ability to advocate public or private view-
points. New York State Club Assn., Inc. v. City of New York, (1988). But the freedom of expressive association,
like many freedoms, is not absolute. We have held that the freedom could be overridden "by regulations adopted
to serve compelling state interests, unrelated to the suppression of ideas, that cannot be achieved through means
significantly less restrictive of associational freedoms." Roberts v. US Jaycees, (1984), supra.

To determine whether a group is protected by the First Amendment's expressive associational right, we must
determine whether the group engages in "expressive association." The First Amendment's protection of expres-
sive association is not reserved for advocacy groups. But to come within its ambit, a group must engage in some
form of expression, whether it be public or private.

... [T] he general mission of the Boy Scouts is clear: "[T]o instill values in young people." Ibid. The Boy Scouts
seeks to instill these values by having its adult leaders spend time with the youth members, instructing and engag-
ing them in activities like camping, archery, and fishing. During the time spent with the youth members, the
scoutmasters and assistant scoutmasters inculcate them with the Boy Scouts' values-both expressly and by exam-
ple. It seems indisputable that an association that seeks to transmit such a system of values engages in expressive
activity.

... The Boy Scouts asserts that it "teach[es] that homosexual conduct is not morally straight," Brief for Petition-
ers 39, and that it does "not want to promote homosexual conduct as a legitimate form of behavior." We accept
the Boy Scouts' assertion. We need not inquire further to determine the nature of the Boy Scouts' expression
with respect to homosexuality ...

We must then determine whether Dale's presence as an assistant scoutmaster would significantly burden the Boy
Scouts' desire to not "promote homosexual conduct as a legitimate form of behavior." As we give deference to
an association's assertions regarding the nature of its expression, we must also give deference to an association's
view of what would impair its expression ... Dale, by his own admission, is one of a group of gay Scouts who
408 | SPEECH AND ASSOCIATION

have "become leaders in their community and are open and honest about their sexual orientation." Dale was the
copresident of a gay and lesbian organization at college and remains a gay rights activist. Dale's presence in the
Boy Scouts would, at the very least, force the organization to send a message, both to the youth members and
the world, that the Boy Scouts accepts homosexual conduct as a legitimate form of behavior.

...

Having determined that the Boy Scouts is an expressive association and that the forced inclusion of Dale would
significantly affect its expression, we inquire whether the application of New Jersey's public accommodations
law to require that the Boy Scouts accept Dale as an assistant scoutmaster runs afoul of the Scouts' freedom of
expressive association. We conclude that it does.

State public accommodations laws were originally enacted to prevent discrimination in traditional places of pub-
lic accommodation-like inns and trains. Romer v. Evans, (1996). Over time, the public accommodations laws
have expanded to cover more places. New Jersey's statutory definition of" `[a] place of public accommodation'"
is extremely broad. [...] As the definition of "public accommodation" has expanded from clearly commercial
entities, such as restaurants, bars, and hotels, to membership organizations such as the Boy Scouts, the poten-
tial for conflict between state public accommodations laws and the First Amendment rights of organizations has
increased.

... [A]fter finding a compelling state interest, the Court went on to examine whether or not the application of
the state law would impose any "serious burden" on the organization's rights of expressive association ... [T]he
associational interest in freedom of expression has been set on one side of the scale, and the State's interest on
the other.

Dale contends that we should apply the intermediate standard of review enunciated in United States v. O'Brien,
(1968), to evaluate the competing interests. There the Court enunciated a four-part test for review of a govern-
mental regulation that has only an incidental effect on protected speech-in that case the symbolic burning of
a draft card. A law prohibiting the destruction of draft cards only incidentally affects the free speech rights of
those who happen to use a violation of that law as a symbol of protest. But New Jersey's public accommodations
law directly and immediately affects associational rights, in this case associational rights that enjoy First Amend-
ment protection. Thus, O'Brien is inapplicable.

...

We are not, as we must not be, guided by our views of whether the Boy Scouts' teachings with respect to homo-
sexual conduct are right or wrong; public or judicial disapproval of a tenet of an organization's expression does
not justify the State's effort to compel the organization to accept members where such acceptance would dero-
gate from the organization's expressive message."While the law is free to promote all sorts of conduct in place of
harmful behavior, it is not free to interfere with speech for no better reason than promoting an approved mes-
sage or discouraging a disfavored one, however enlightened either purpose may strike the government." Hurley
v. GLIB of Boston, (1995).

    Decision: Reversed

JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.

Section 28.04 of the Los Angeles Municipal Code prohibits the posting of signs on public property. The ques-
tion presented is whether that prohibition abridges appellees' freedom of speech within the meaning of the First
Amendment. In March, 1979, Roland Vincent was a candidate for election to the Los Angeles City Council.
A group of his supporters known as Taxpayers for Vincent (Taxpayers) entered into a contract with a political
sign service company known as Candidates' Outdoor Graphics Service (COGS) to fabricate and post signs with
Vincent's name on them. COGS produced 15- by-44-inch cardboard signs and attached them to utility poles at
various locations by draping them over crosswires which support the poles and stapling the cardboard together
at the bottom. The signs' message was: "Roland Vincent -- City Council."

Acting under the authority of § 28.04 of the Municipal Code, employees of the city's Bureau of Street Mainte-
nance routinely removed all posters attached to utility poles and similar objects covered by the ordinance, includ-
ing the COGS signs. The weekly sign removal report covering the period March 1-March 7, 1979, indicated that
among the 1,207 signs removed from public property during that week, 48 were identified as "Roland Vincent"
signs. Most of the other signs identified in that report were apparently commercial in character.

...

In its appeal to this Court, the City challenges the Court of Appeals' holding that § 28.04 is unconstitutional
on its face. Taxpayers and COGS defend that holding, and also contend that the ordinance is unconstitutional
as applied to their posting of political campaign signs on the crosswires of utility poles. There are two quite
different ways in which a statute or ordinance may be considered invalid "on its face" -- either because it is
unconstitutional in every conceivable application or because it seeks to prohibit such a broad range of protected
conduct that it is unconstitutionally "overbroad." We shall analyze the "facial" challenges to the ordinance, and
then address its specific application to appellees.

...
                                                                                                            TIME, PLACE AND MANNER | 411

[T]he Court did recognize an exception to this general rule for laws that are written so broadly that they
may inhibit the constitutionally protected speech of third parties. This "overbreadth" doctrine has its source
in Thornhill v. Alabama, (1940). In that case, the Court concluded that the very existence of some broadly writ-
ten statutes may have such a deterrent effect on free expression that they should be subject to challenge even by
a party whose own conduct may be unprotected. The Court has repeatedly held that such a statute may be chal-
lenged on its face even though a more narrowly drawn statute would be valid as applied to the party in the case
before it ...

In the development of the overbreadth doctrine, the Court has been sensitive to the risk that the doctrine itself
might sweep so broadly that the exception to ordinary standing requirements would swallow the general rule. In
order to decide whether the overbreadth exception is applicable in a particular case, we have weighed the likeli-
hood that the statute's very existence will inhibit free expression.

...

Taxpayers and COGS apparently would agree that the prohibition against posting signs on most of the publicly
owned objects mentioned in the ordinance is perfectly reasonable. Thus, they do not dispute the City's power
to proscribe the attachment of any handbill or sign to any sidewalk, crosswalk, curb, lamppost, hydrant, or life-
saving equipment. Their position with respect to utility poles is not entirely clear, but they do contend that it
is unconstitutional to prohibit the attachment of their cardboard signs to the horizontal crosswires supporting
utility poles during a political campaign. They have, in short, failed to identify any significant difference between
their claim that the ordinance is invalid on overbreadth grounds and their claim that it is unconstitutional when
applied to their political signs. Specifically, Taxpayers and COGS have not attempted to demonstrate that the
ordinance applies to any conduct more likely to be protected by the First Amendment than their own crosswire
signs ... It would therefore be inappropriate in this case to entertain an overbreadth challenge to the ordinance.

...

In this case, taxpayers and COGS do not dispute that it is within the constitutional power of the City to attempt
to improve its appearance, or that this interest is basically unrelated to the suppression of ideas. Therefore the
critical inquiries are whether that interest is sufficiently substantial to justify the effect of the ordinance on
appellees' expression, and whether that effect is no greater than necessary to accomplish the City's purpose.

...

We turn to the question whether the scope of the restriction on appellees' expressive activity is substantially
broader than necessary to protect the City's interest in eliminating visual clutter. The incidental restriction on
expression which results from the City's attempt to accomplish such a purpose is considered justified as a rea-
sonable regulation of the time, place, or manner of expression if it is narrowly tailored to serve that interest ...

Appellees suggest that the public property covered by the ordinance either is itself a "public forum" for First
Amendment purposes or at least should be treated in the same respect as the "public forum" in which the prop-
erty is located.
412 | TIME, PLACE AND MANNER

...

Appellees' reliance on the public forum doctrine is misplaced. They fail to demonstrate the existence of a tradi-
tional right of access respecting such items as utility poles for purposes of their communication comparable to
that recognized for public streets and parks, and it is clear that

      "the First Amendment does not guarantee access to government property simply because it is owned or controlled
      by the government." United States Postal Service v. Greenburgh Civic Assns., (1981). Rather, the existence of a right
      of access to public property and the standard by which limitations upon such a right must be evaluated differ
      depending on the character of the property at issue ... Given our analysis of the legitimate interest served by the
      ordinance, its viewpoint neutrality, and the availability of alternative channels of communication, the ordinance
      is certainly constitutional as applied to appellees under this standard.

Finally, Taxpayers and COGS argue that Los Angeles could have written an ordinance that would have had a
less severe effect on expressive activity such as theirs by permitting the posting of any kind of sign at any time
on some types of public property, or by making a variety of other more specific exceptions to the ordinance: for
signs carrying certain types of messages (such as political campaign signs), for signs posted during specific time
periods (perhaps during political campaigns), for particular locations (perhaps for areas already cluttered by an
excessive number of signs on adjacent private property), or for signs meeting design specifications (such as size
or color). Plausible public policy arguments might well be made in support of any such exception, but it by no
means follows that it is therefore constitutionally mandated, cf. Singer v. United States, (1965), nor is it clear that
some of the suggested exceptions would even be constitutionally permissible ...

Any constitutionally mandated exception to the City's total prohibition against temporary signs on public prop-
erty would necessarily rest on a judicial determination that the City's traffic control and safety interests had lit-
tle or no applicability within the excepted category, and that the City's interests in esthetics are not sufficiently
important to justify the prohibition in that category ... [W]e accept the City's position that it may decide that
the esthetic interest in avoiding "visual clutter" justifies a removal of signs creating or increasing that clutter. The
findings of the District Court that COGS signs add to the problems addressed by the ordinance and, if permit-
ted to remain, would encourage others to post additional signs, are sufficient to justify application of the ordi-
nance to these appellees ...

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded to that Court.

It is so ordered.

JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.

In the southeast portion of New York City's Central Park, about 10 blocks upward from the park's beginning
point at 59th Street, there is an amphitheater and stage structure known as the Naumberg Acoustic Bandshell.
The bandshell faces west across the remaining width of the park. In close proximity to the bandshell, and lying
within the directional path of its sound, is a grassy open area called the Sheep Meadow. The city has designated
the Sheep Meadow as a quiet area for passive recreations like reclining, walking, and reading. Just beyond the
park, and also within the potential sound range of the bandshell, are the apartments and residences of Central
Park West.

This case arises from the city's attempt to regulate the volume of amplified music at the bandshell so the per-
formances are satisfactory to the audience without intruding upon those who use the Sheep Meadow or live on
Central Park West and in its vicinity.

The city's regulation requires bandshell performers to use sound amplification equipment and a sound tech-
nician provided by the city. The challenge to this volume control technique comes from the sponsor of a rock
concert. The trial court sustained the noise control measures, but the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
reversed. We granted certiorari to resolve the important First Amendment issues presented by the case.

...

The principal inquiry in determining content-neutrality, in speech cases generally and in time, place, or manner
cases in particular, is whether the government has adopted a regulation of speech because of disagreement with
the message it conveys. The government's purpose is the controlling consideration. A regulation that serves pur-
poses unrelated to the content of expression is deemed neutral, even if it has an incidental effect on some speakers
or messages, but not others. See Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., (1986). Government regulation of expressive
activity is content-neutral so long as it is "justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech."
Clark v Comm. For Creative Non-Violence, (1984).

The principal justification for the sound amplification guideline is the city's desire to control noise levels at band-
shell events, in order to retain the character of the Sheep Meadow and its more sedate activities, and to avoid
undue intrusion into residential areas and other areas of the park. This justification for the guideline "ha[s] noth-
ing to do with content," Boos v. Barry, supra, (1988), and it satisfies the requirement that time, place, or manner
regulations be content-neutral.
414 | TIME, PLACE AND MANNER

While respondent's arguments that the government may not interfere with artistic judgment may have much
force in other contexts, they are inapplicable to the facts of this case. The city has disclaimed in express terms any
interest in imposing its own view of appropriate sound mix on performers. To the contrary, as the District Court
found, the city requires its sound technician to defer to the wishes of event sponsors concerning sound mix. On
this record, the city's concern with sound quality extends only to the clearly content-neutral goals of ensuring
adequate sound amplification and avoiding the volume problems associated with inadequate sound mix. Any
governmental attempt to serve purely aesthetic goals by imposing subjective standards of acceptable sound mix
on performers would raise serious First Amendment concerns, but this case provides us with no opportunity
to address those questions. As related above, the District Court found that the city's equipment and its sound
technician could meet all of the standards requested by the performers, including RAR.

...

The court squarely rejected respondent's claim that the city's "technician is not able properly to implement a
sponsor's instructions as to sound quality or mix," finding that "[n]o evidence to that effect was offered at trial;
as noted, the evidence is to the contrary." In view of these findings, which were not disturbed by the Court of
Appeals, we must conclude that the city's guideline has no material impact on any performer's ability to exer-
cise complete artistic control over sound quality. Since the guideline allows the city to control volume without
interfering with the performer's desired sound mix, it is not "substantially broader than necessary" to achieve the
city's legitimate ends, City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent (1984), and thus it satisfies the require-
ment of narrow tailoring.

The final requirement, that the guideline leave open ample alternative channels of communication, is easily met.
Indeed, in this respect the guideline is far less restrictive than regulations we have upheld in other cases, for it
does not attempt to ban any particular manner or type of expression at a given place or time. Rather, the guide-
line continues to permit expressive activity in the bandshell, and has no effect on the quantity or content of that
expression beyond regulating the extent of amplification. That the city's limitations on volume may reduce to
some degree the potential audience for respondent's speech is of no consequence, for there has been no showing
that the remaining avenues of communication are inadequate.

...

The city's sound amplification guideline is narrowly tailored to serve the substantial and content-neutral govern-
mental interests of avoiding excessive sound volume and providing sufficient amplification within the bandshell
concert-ground, and the guideline leaves open ample channels of communication.
§                                                                                                           TIME, PLACE AND MANNER | 415

Accordingly, it is valid under the First Amendment as a reasonable regulation of the place and manner of expres-
sion. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Reversed.

JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.

At issue is the constitutionality of a 1993 Colorado statute that regulates speech-related conduct within 100 feet
of the entrance to any health care facility. The specific section of the statute that is challenged makes it unlawful
within the regulated areas for any person to "knowingly approach" within eight feet of another person, without
that person's consent, "for the purpose of passing a leaflet or handbill to, displaying a sign to, or engaging in
oral protest, education, or counseling with such other person. ..." Although the statute prohibits speakers from
approaching unwilling listeners, it does not require a standing speaker to move away from anyone passing by.
Nor does it place any restriction on the content of any message that anyone may wish to communicate to anyone
else, either inside or outside the regulated areas. It does, however, make it more difficult to give unwanted advice,
particularly in the form of a handbill or leaflet, to persons entering or leaving medical facilities.

The question is whether the First Amendment rights of the speaker are abridged by the protection the statute
provides for the unwilling listener.

JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.

Petitioners contend that a village ordinance making it a misdemeanor to engage in door-to-door advocacy with-
out first registering with the mayor and receiving a permit violates the First Amendment. Through this facial
challenge, we consider the door-to-door canvassing regulation not only as it applies to religious proselytizing,
but also to anonymous political speech and the distribution of handbills.

Petitioner ... coordinates the preaching activities of Jehovah's Witnesses throughout the United States and pub-
lishes Bibles and religious periodicals that are widely distributed. Petitioner ... supervises the activities of approx-
imately 59 members in a part of Ohio that includes the Village of Stratton (Village). Petitioners offer religious
literature without cost to anyone interested in reading it. They allege that they do not solicit contributions or
orders for the sale of merchandise or services, but they do accept donations.

...

District of Ohio, seeking an injunction against the enforcement of several sections of Ordinance No. 1998-5 reg-
ulating uninvited peddling and solicitation on private property in the Village. Petitioners' complaint alleged that
the ordinance violated several constitutional rights, including the free exercise of religion, free speech, and the
freedom of the press.

...

We granted certiorari to decide the following question:

"Does a municipal ordinance that requires one to obtain a permit prior to engaging in the door-to-door advo-
cacy of a political cause and to display upon demand the permit, which contains one's name, violate the First
Amendment protection accorded to anonymous pamphleteering or discourse 7[?]"

...

The Village argues that three interests are served by its ordinance: the prevention of fraud, the prevention of
crime, and the protection of residents' privacy. We have no difficulty concluding, in light of our precedent, that
these are important interests that the Village may seek to safeguard through some form of regulation of solicita-
                                                                                                            TIME, PLACE AND MANNER | 417

tion activity. We must also look, however, to the amount of speech covered by the ordinance and whether there is
an appropriate balance between the affected speech and the governmental interests that the ordinance purports
to serve.

... [T]he Village's administration of its ordinance unquestionably demonstrates that the provisions apply to a
significant number of noncommercial "canvassers" promoting a wide variety of "causes." Indeed, on the "No
Solicitation Forms" provided to the residents, the canvassers include "Camp Fire Girls," "Jehovah's Witnesses,"
"Political Candidates," "Trick or Treaters during Halloween Season," and "Persons Affiliated with Stratton
Church." The ordinance unquestionably applies, not only to religious causes, but to political activity as well. ...

The mere fact that the ordinance covers so much speech raises constitutional concerns. It is offensive-not only
to the values protected by the First Amendment, but to the very notion of a free society-that in the context of
everyday public discourse a citizen must first inform the government of her desire to speak to her neighbors and
then obtain a permit to do so. Even if the issuance of permits by the mayor's office is a ministerial task that is per-
formed promptly and at no cost to the applicant, a law requiring a permit to engage in such speech constitutes
a dramatic departure from our national heritage and constitutional tradition. Three obvious examples illustrate
the pernicious effect of such a permit requirement.

First, as our cases involving distribution of unsigned handbills demonstrate, there are a significant number of
persons who support causes anonymously ... The requirement that a canvasser must be identified in a permit
application filed in the mayor's office and available for public inspection necessarily results in a surrender of that
anonymity ... In the Village, strangers to the resident certainly maintain their anonymity, and the ordinance may
preclude such persons from canvassing for unpopular causes. Such preclusion may well be justified in some sit-
uations-for example, by the special state interest in protecting the integrity of a ballot-initiative process, or by
the interest in preventing fraudulent commercial transactions. The Village ordinance, however, sweeps more
broadly, covering unpopular causes unrelated to commercial transactions or to any special interest in protecting
the electoral process.

Second, requiring a permit as a prior condition on the exercise of the right to speak imposes an objective burden
on some speech of citizens holding religious or patriotic views. As our World War II-era cases dramatically
demonstrate, there are a significant number of persons whose religious scruples will prevent them from applying
for such a license. There are no doubt other patriotic citizens, who have such firm convictions about their con-
stitutional right to engage in uninhibited debate in the context of door-to-door advocacy, that they would prefer
silence to speech licensed by a petty official.

Third, there is a significant amount of spontaneous speech that is effectively banned by the ordinance. A person
who made a decision on a holiday or a weekend to take an active part in a political campaign could not begin to
pass out handbills until after he or she obtained the required permit. Even a spontaneous decision to go across
the street and urge a neighbor to vote against the mayor could not lawfully be implemented without first obtain-
ing the mayor's permission.

...
§418 | TIME, PLACE AND MANNER

The rhetoric used in the World War II-era opinions that repeatedly saved petitioners' coreligionists from petty
prosecutions reflected the Court's evaluation of the First Amendment freedoms that are implicated in this case.
The value judgment that then motivated a united democratic people fighting to defend those very freedoms
from totalitarian attack is unchanged. It motivates our decision today.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

A jury held members of the Westboro Baptist Church liable for millions of dollars in damages for picketing near
a soldier's funeral service. The picket signs reflected the church's view that the United States is overly tolerant
of sin and that God kills American soldiers as punishment. The question presented is whether the First Amend-
ment shields the church members from tort liability for their speech in this case.

...

The church had notified the authorities in advance of its intent to picket at the time of the funeral, and the
picketers complied with police instructions in staging their demonstration. The picketing took place within a
10- by 25-foot plot of public land adjacent to a public street, behind a temporary fence. That plot was approx-
imately 1,000 feet from the church where the funeral was held. Several buildings separated the picket site from
the church. The Westboro picketers displayed their signs for about 30 minutes before the funeral began and sang
hymns and recited Bible verses. None of the picketers entered church property or went to the cemetery. They
did not yell or use profanity, and there was no violence associated with the picketing.

...
                                                                                                            TIME, PLACE AND MANNER | 419

Westboro's primary argument was that the church was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the First
Amendment fully protected Westboro's speech. The Court of Appeals agreed. The court reviewed the picket
signs and concluded that Westboro's statements were entitled to First Amendment protection because those
statements were on matters of public concern, were not provably false, and were expressed solely through hyper-
bolic rhetoric.

We granted certiorari.

...

Whether the First Amendment prohibits holding Westboro liable for its speech in this case turns largely on
whether that speech is of public or private concern, as determined by all the circumstances of the case."[S]peech
on `matters of public concern' ... is `at the heart of the First Amendment's protection.' " Dun & Bradstreet,
Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc., (1985) (opinion of Powell, J.) (quoting First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti,
(1978)). The First Amendment reflects "a profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public
issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open." New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, (1964).

...

The "content" of Westboro's signs plainly relates to broad issues of interest to society at large, rather than matters
of "purely private concern." Dun & Bradstreet, supra. The placards read "God Hates the USA/Thank God for
9/11," "America is Doomed," "Don't Pray for the USA," "Thank God for IEDs," [and] "Fag Troops ..." [other
examples omitted]. While these messages may fall short of refined social or political commentary, the issues they
highlight--the political and moral conduct of the United States and its citizens, the fate of our Nation, homo-
sexuality in the military, and scandals involving the Catholic clergy--are matters of public import. The signs
certainly convey Westboro's position on those issues, in a manner designed, unlike the private speech in Dun &
Bradstreet, to reach as broad a public audience as possible. And even if a few of the signs--such as "You're Going
to Hell" and "God Hates You"--were viewed as containing messages related to Matthew Snyder or the Snyders
specifically, that would not change the fact that the overall thrust and dominant theme of Westboro's demon-
stration spoke to broader public issues.

...

We have identified a few limited situations where the location of targeted picketing can be regulated under pro-
visions that the Court has determined to be content neutral.

...

Simply put, the church members had the right to be where they were. Westboro alerted local authorities to its
funeral protest and fully complied with police guidance on where the picketing could be staged. The picketing
was conducted under police supervision some 1,000 feet from the church, out of the sight of those at the church.
The protest was not unruly; there was no shouting, profanity, or violence.
420 | TIME, PLACE AND MANNER

The record confirms that any distress occasioned by Westboro's picketing turned on the content and viewpoint
of the message conveyed, rather than any interference with the funeral itself. A group of parishioners standing at
the very spot where Westboro stood, holding signs that said "God Bless America" and "God Loves You," would
not have been subjected to liability. It was what Westboro said that exposed it to tort damages.

Given that Westboro's speech was at a public place on a matter of public concern, that speech is entitled to "spe-
cial protection" under the First Amendment. Such speech cannot be restricted simply because it is upsetting or
arouses contempt."If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the government
may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagree-
able." Texas v. Johnson, (1989). Indeed, "the point of all speech protection ... is to shield just those choices of con-
tent that in someone's eyes are misguided, or even hurtful." Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual
Group of Boston, Inc., (1995).

...

Westboro believes that America is morally flawed; many Americans might feel the same about Westboro. West-
boro's funeral picketing is certainly hurtful and its contribution to public discourse may be negligible. But West-
boro addressed matters of public import on public property, in a peaceful manner, in full compliance with the
guidance of local officials. The speech was indeed planned to coincide with Matthew Snyder's funeral, but did
not itself disrupt that funeral, and Westboro's choice to conduct its picketing at that time and place did not alter
the nature of its speech.

Speech is powerful. It can stir people to action, move them to tears of both joy and sorrow, and--as it did
here--inflict great pain. On the facts before us, we cannot react to that pain by punishing the speaker. As a
Nation we have chosen a different course--to protect even hurtful speech on public issues to ensure that we do
not stifle public debate. That choice requires that we shield Westboro from tort liability for its picketing in this
case.

The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

McCullen v. Coakley

573 U.S. 464 (2014)

    Vote: 9-0
    Decision: Reversed
    Majority: Roberts, joined by Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, Kagan
    Concurrence: Scalia (in judgment), joined by Kennedy, Thomas
    Concurrence: Alito (in judgment)

Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court.

A Massachusetts statute makes it a crime to knowingly stand on a "public way or sidewalk" within 35 feet of an
entrance or driveway to any place, other than a hospital, where abortions are performed. Petitioners are individu-
als who approach and talk to women outside such facilities, attempting to dissuade them from having abortions.
The statute prevents petitioners from doing so near the facilities' entrances. The question presented is whether
the statute violates the First Amendment.

...

In January 2008, petitioners sued Attorney General Coakley and other Commonwealth officials. They sought
to enjoin enforcement of the Act, alleging that it violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments, both on its
face and as applied to them. The District Court denied petitioners' facial challenge after a bench trial based on a
stipulated record.

...

We granted certiorari.

By its very terms, the Massachusetts Act regulates access to "public way[s]" and "sidewalk[s]." Such areas occupy
a "special position in terms of First Amendment protection" because of their historic role as sites for dis-
cussion and debate. United States v. Grace, (1983). These places--which we have labeled "traditional public
fora"--" `have immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public and, time out of mind, have been used
for purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing public questions.' " Pleas­
ant Grove City v. Summum, (2009) (quoting Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., (1983) ).

...

[T]raditional public fora are areas that have historically been open to the public for speech activities. Thus, even
though the Act says nothing about speech on its face, there is no doubt--and respondents do not dispute--that
it restricts access to traditional public fora and is therefore subject to First Amendment scrutiny.
422 | TIME, PLACE AND MANNER

Consistent with the traditionally open character of public streets and sidewalks, we have held that the govern-
ment's ability to restrict speech in such locations is "very limited." Grace, supra, at 177. In particular, the guid-
ing First Amendment principle that the "government has no power to restrict expression because of its message,
its ideas, its subject matter, or its content" applies with full force in a traditional public forum. Police Dept. of
Chicago v. Mosley, (1972). As a general rule, in such a forum the government may not "selectively ... shield the
public from some kinds of speech on the ground that they are more offensive than others." Erznoznik v. Jack­
sonville, (1975).

We have, however, afforded the government somewhat wider leeway to regulate features of speech unrelated to
its content."[E]ven in a public forum the government may impose reasonable restrictions on the time, place, or
manner of protected speech, provided the restrictions `are justified without reference to the content of the regu-
lated speech, that they are narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, and that they leave open
ample alternative channels for communication of the information.'" Ward, (quoting Clark v. Community for
Creative Non-Violence, (1984)).

While the parties agree that this test supplies the proper framework for assessing the constitutionality of the
Massachusetts Act, they disagree about whether the Act satisfies the test's three requirements.

Petitioners contend that the Act is not content neutral for two independent reasons: First, they argue that
it discriminates against abortion-related speech because it establishes buffer zones only at clinics that perform
abortions. Second, petitioners contend that the Act, by exempting clinic employees and agents, favors one view-
point about abortion over the other. If either of these arguments is correct, then the Act must satisfy strict
scrutiny--that is, it must be the least restrictive means of achieving a compelling state interest. See United States
v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., (2000). Respondents do not argue that the Act can survive this exacting
standard.

...

It is true, of course, that by limiting the buffer zones to abortion clinics, the Act has the "inevitable effect"
of restricting abortion-related speech more than speech on other subjects. But a facially neutral law does not
become content based simply because it may disproportionately affect speech on certain topics. On the contrary,
"[a] regulation that serves purposes unrelated to the content of expression is deemed neutral, even if it has an
incidental effect on some speakers or messages but not others." Ward, supra.

... [T]he Act would not be content neutral if it were concerned with undesirable effects that arise from "the
direct impact of speech on its audience" or "[l]isteners' reactions to speech." If, for example, the speech outside
Massachusetts abortion clinics caused offense or made listeners uncomfortable, such offense or discomfort
would not give the Commonwealth a content-neutral justification to restrict the speech. All of the problems
identified by the Commonwealth here, however, arise irrespective of any listener's reactions. Whether or not a
single person reacts to abortion protestors' chants or petitioners' counseling, large crowds outside abortion clin-
ics can still compromise public safety, impede access, and obstruct sidewalks.

...
                                                                                                           TIME, PLACE AND MANNER | 423

We thus conclude that the Act is neither content nor viewpoint based and therefore need not be analyzed under
strict scrutiny.

...

The buffer zones have ... made it substantially more difficult for petitioners to distribute literature to arriving
patients. As explained, because petitioners in Boston cannot readily identify patients before they enter the zone,
they often cannot approach them in time to place literature near their hands--the most effective means of get-
ting the patients to accept it. In Worcester and Springfield, the zones have pushed petitioners so far back from
the clinics' driveways that they can no longer even attempt to offer literature as drivers turn into the parking lots.
In short, the Act operates to deprive petitioners of their two primary methods of communicating with patients.

...

[R]espondents suggest that, at the Worcester and Springfield clinics, petitioners are prevented from communi-
cating with patients not by the buffer zones but by the fact that most patients arrive by car and park in the clinics'
private lots. It is true that the layout of the two clinics would prevent petitioners from approaching the clinics'
doorways, even without the buffer zones. But petitioners do not claim a right to trespass on the clinics' prop-
erty. They instead claim a right to stand on the public sidewalks by the driveway as cars turn into the parking
lot. Before the buffer zones, they could do so. Now they must stand a substantial distance away. The Act alone
is responsible for that restriction on their ability to convey their message.

...

Petitioners wish to converse with their fellow citizens about an important subject on the public streets and side-
walks--sites that have hosted discussions about the issues of the day throughout history. Respondents assert
undeniably significant interests in maintaining public safety on those same streets and sidewalks, as well as in pre-
serving access to adjacent healthcare facilities. But here the Commonwealth has pursued those interests by the
extreme step of closing a substantial portion of a traditional public forum to all speakers. It has done so without
seriously addressing the problem through alternatives that leave the forum open for its time-honored purposes.
The Commonwealth may not do that consistent with the First Amendment.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further pro-
ceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Reed v. Town of Gilbert

576 U.S. 155 (2015)

    Vote: 9-0
    Decision: Reversed
    Majority: Thomas, joined by Roberts, Scalia, Kennedy, Alito, Sotomayor
    Concurrence: Alito, joined by Kennedy, Sotomayor
    Concurrence: Breyer (in judgment)
    Concurrence: Kagan (in judgment), joined by Ginsburg, Breyer

Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.

The town of Gilbert, Arizona (or Town), has adopted a comprehensive code governing the manner in which
people may display outdoor signs. The Sign Code identifies various categories of signs based on the type of infor-
mation they convey, then subjects each category to different restrictions. One of the categories is "Temporary
Directional Signs Relating to a Qualifying Event," loosely defined as signs directing the public to a meeting of a
nonprofit group. The Code imposes more stringent restrictions on these signs than it does on signs conveying
other messages. We hold that these provisions are content-based regulations of speech that cannot survive strict
scrutiny.

...

Petitioners Good News Community Church (Church) and its pastor, Clyde Reed, wish to advertise the time
and location of their Sunday church services. The Church is a small, cash-strapped entity that owns no building,
so it holds its services at elementary schools or other locations in or near the Town. In order to inform the public
about its services, which are held in a variety of different locations, the Church began placing 15 to 20 temporary
signs around the Town, frequently in the public right-of-way abutting the street. The signs typically displayed
the Church's name, along with the time and location of the upcoming service. Church members would post the
signs early in the day on Saturday and then remove them around midday on Sunday. The display of these signs
requires little money and manpower, and thus has proved to be an economical and effective way for the Church
to let the community know where its services are being held each week.

This practice caught the attention of the Town's Sign Code compliance manager, who twice cited the Church
for violating the Code. The first citation noted that the Church exceeded the time limits for displaying its tem-
porary directional signs. The second citation referred to the same problem, along with the Church's failure to
include the date of the event on the signs. Town officials even confiscated one of the Church's signs, which Reed
had to retrieve from the municipal offices.

Reed contacted the Sign Code Compliance Department in an attempt to reach an accommodation. His efforts
proved unsuccessful. The Town's Code compliance manager informed the Church that there would be "no
leniency under the Code" and promised to punish any future violations ...
                                                                                                           TIME, PLACE AND MANNER | 425

On remand, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the Town. The Court of Appeals again
affirmed, holding that the Code's sign categories were content neutral ...

We granted certiorari, and now reverse.

...

Content-based laws--those that target speech based on its communicative content--are presumptively uncon-
stitutional and may be justified only if the government proves that they are narrowly tailored to serve compelling
state interests. R. A. V. v. St. Paul, (1992) [other citations omitted] ...

The Town's Sign Code is content based on its face. It defines "Temporary Directional Signs" on the basis of
whether a sign conveys the message of directing the public to church or some other "qualifying event." It defines
"Political Signs" on the basis of whether a sign's message is "designed to influence the outcome of an election."
And it defines "Ideological Signs" on the basis of whether a sign "communicat[es] a message or ideas" that do
not fit within the Code's other categories. It then subjects each of these categories to different restrictions ...

A law that is content based on its face is subject to strict scrutiny regardless of the government's benign motive,
content-neutral justification, or lack of "animus toward the ideas contained" in the regulated speech. Cincin­
nati v. Discovery Network, Inc., (1993) ...

... [A] speech regulation targeted at specific subject matter is content based even if it does not discriminate
among viewpoints within that subject matter. For example, a law banning the use of sound trucks for political
speech--and only political speech--would be a content-based regulation, even if it imposed no limits on the
political viewpoints that could be expressed. See Discovery Network, supra. The Town's Sign Code likewise sin-
gles out specific subject matter for differential treatment, even if it does not target viewpoints within that subject
matter. Ideological messages are given more favorable treatment than messages concerning a political candidate,
which are themselves given more favorable treatment than messages announcing an assembly of like-minded
individuals. That is a paradigmatic example of content-based discrimination.

Our decision today will not prevent governments from enacting effective sign laws ... Not "all distinctions" are
subject to strict scrutiny, only content-based ones are. Laws that are content neutral are instead subject to lesser
scrutiny.

The Town has ample content-neutral options available to resolve problems with safety and aesthetics. For exam-
ple, its current Code regulates many aspects of signs that have nothing to do with a sign's message: size, building
materials, lighting, moving parts, and portability. And on public property, the Town may go a long way toward
entirely forbidding the posting of signs, so long as it does so in an evenhanded, content-neutral manner ...

We acknowledge that a city might reasonably view the general regulation of signs as necessary because signs "take
up space and may obstruct views, distract motorists, displace alternative uses for land, and pose other problems
that legitimately call for regulation." City of Ladue v. Gilleo, (1994). At the same time, the presence of certain
signs may be essential, both for vehicles and pedestrians, to guide traffic or to identify hazards and ensure safety.
A sign ordinance narrowly tailored to the challenges of protecting the safety of pedestrians, drivers, and pas-
§426 | TIME, PLACE AND MANNER

sengers--such as warning signs marking hazards on private property, signs directing traffic, or street numbers
associated with private houses--well might survive strict scrutiny. The signs at issue in this case, including polit-
ical and ideological signs and signs for events, are far removed from those purposes. As discussed above, they are
facially content based and are neither justified by traditional safety concerns nor narrowly tailored.

We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for proceedings consistent with this opin-
ion.

It is so ordered.

Minnesota Voters Alliance v. Mansky

585 U.S. ___ (2018)

    Vote: 7-2
    Decision: Reversed
    Majority: Roberts, joined by Kennedy, Thomas, Ginsburg, Alito, Kagan, Gorsuch
    Dissent: Sotomayor, joined by Breyer

Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court.

Under Minnesota law, voters may not wear a political badge, political button, or anything bearing political
insignia inside a polling place on Election Day. The question presented is whether this ban violates the Free
Speech Clause of the First Amendment.

...

Petitioner Minnesota Voters Alliance (MVA) is a nonprofit organization that "seeks better government through
election reforms." Petitioner Andrew Cilek is a registered voter in Hennepin County and the executive director
of MVA; petitioner Susan Jeffers served in 2010 as a Ramsey County election judge. Five days before the Novem-
ber 2010 election, MVA, Jeffers, and other likeminded groups and individuals filed a lawsuit in Federal Dis-
trict Court challenging the political apparel ban on First Amendment grounds. The groups--calling themselves
"Election Integrity Watch" (EIW)--planned to have supporters wear buttons to the polls printed with the
words "Please I. D. Me," a picture of an eye, and a telephone number and web address for EIW.

...
                                                                                                           TIME, PLACE AND MANNER | 427

The First Amendment prohibits laws "abridging the freedom of speech." Minnesota's ban on wearing any
"political badge, political button, or other political insignia" plainly restricts a form of expression within the pro-
tection of the First Amendment.

But the ban applies only in a specific location: the interior of a polling place. It therefore implicates our " `forum
based' approach for assessing restrictions that the government seeks to place on the use of its property." Interna­
tional Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee, (1992) (ISKCON) ...

This Court employs a distinct standard of review to assess speech restrictions in nonpublic forums because the
government, "no less than a private owner of property," retains the "power to preserve the property under its
control for the use to which it is lawfully dedicated." Adderley v. Florida, (1966)."Nothing in the Constitution
requires the Government freely to grant access to all who wish to exercise their right to free speech on every type
of Government property without regard to the nature of the property or to the disruption that might be caused
by the speaker's activities." Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., (1985). Accordingly, our deci-
sions have long recognized that the government may impose some content-based restrictions on speech in non-
public forums, including restrictions that exclude political advocates and forms of political advocacy. See Greer
v. Spock, (1976) [other citations omitted].

A polling place in Minnesota qualifies as a nonpublic forum. It is, at least on Election Day, government-con-
trolled property set aside for the sole purpose of voting. The space is "a special enclave, subject to greater restric-
tion." ISKCON ...

We therefore evaluate MVA's First Amendment challenge under the nonpublic forum standard. The text of the
apparel ban makes no distinction based on the speaker's political persuasion, so MVA does not claim that the
ban discriminates on the basis of viewpoint on its face. The question accordingly is whether Minnesota's ban on
political apparel is "reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum": voting.

... [W]e see no basis for rejecting Minnesota's determination that some forms of advocacy should be excluded
from the polling place, to set it aside as "an island of calm in which voters can peacefully contemplate their
choices." Casting a vote is a weighty civic act, akin to a jury's return of a verdict, or a representative's vote on a
piece of legislation. It is a time for choosing, not campaigning. The State may reasonably decide that the interior
of the polling place should reflect that distinction.

...

Thus, in light of the special purpose of the polling place itself, Minnesota may choose to prohibit certain apparel
there because of the message it conveys, so that voters may focus on the important decisions immediately at
hand.

But the State must draw a reasonable line. Although there is no requirement of narrow tailoring in a nonpublic
forum, the State must be able to articulate some sensible basis for distinguishing what may come in from what
428 | TIME, PLACE AND MANNER

must stay out. See Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense Fund, (1985). Here, the unmoored use of the term "polit-
ical" in the Minnesota law, combined with haphazard interpretations the State has provided in official guidance
and representations to this Court, cause Minnesota's restriction to fail even this forgiving test.

[The statute] does not define the term "political." And the word can be expansive. It can encompass anything
"of or relating to government, a government, or the conduct of governmental affairs," Webster's Third New
International Dictionary 1755 (2002), or anything "[o]f, relating to, or dealing with the structure or affairs of
government, politics, or the state," American Heritage Dictionary 1401 (3d ed. 1996). Under a literal reading of
those definitions, a button or T-shirt merely imploring others to "Vote!" could qualify.

The State argues that the apparel ban should not be read so broadly. According to the State, the statute does
not prohibit "any conceivably `political' message" or cover "all `political' speech, broadly construed." Instead,
the State interprets the ban to proscribe "only words and symbols that an objectively reasonable observer would
perceive as conveying a message about the electoral choices at issue in [the] polling place."

A rule whose fair enforcement requires an election judge to maintain a mental index of the platforms and posi-
tions of every candidate and party on the ballot is not reasonable. Candidates for statewide and federal office and
major political parties can be expected to take positions on a wide array of subjects of local and national import
... Would a "Support Our Troops" shirt be banned, if one of the candidates or parties had expressed a view on
military funding or aid for veterans? What about a "#MeToo" shirt, referencing the movement to increase aware-
ness of sexual harassment and assault? At oral argument, the State indicated that the ban would cover such an
item if a candidate had "brought up" the topic.

...

Cases like this "present[ ] us with a particularly difficult reconciliation: the accommodation of the right to
engage in political discourse with the right to vote." Burson v. Freeman, (1992) (plurality opinion). Minnesota,
like other States, has sought to strike the balance in a way that affords the voter the opportunity to exercise his
civic duty in a setting removed from the clamor and din of electioneering. While that choice is generally worthy
of our respect, Minnesota has not supported its good intentions with a law capable of reasoned application.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

National Endowment for the Arts v. Finley

524 U.S. 569 (1998)

    Vote: 8-1
    Decision: Reversed
    Majority: O'Connor, joined by Rehnquist, Stevens, Kennedy, Breyer and Ginsburg (all but Part I-B)
    Concurrence: Scalia (in judgment), joined by Thomas
    Dissent: Souter

Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.

The National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act, as amended in 1990, requires the Chairperson of
the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) to ensure that "artistic excellence and artistic merit are the criteria
by which [grant] applications are judged, taking into consideration general standards of decency and respect for
the diverse beliefs and values of the American public." In this case, we review the Court of Appeals' determina-
tion that [the statute], on its face, impermissibly discriminates on the basis of viewpoint and is void for vagueness
under the First and Fifth Amendments. We conclude that [the statute] is facially valid, as it neither inherently
interferes with First Amendment rights nor violates constitutional vagueness principles.

With the establishment of the NEA in 1965, Congress embarked on a "broadly conceived national policy of
support for the ... arts in the United States," pledging federal funds to "help create and sustain not only a cli-
mate encouraging freedom of thought, imagination, and inquiry but also the material conditions facilitating the
release of ... creative talent." ...

Applications for NEA funding are initially reviewed by advisory panels composed of experts in the relevant field
of the arts. Under the 1990 Amendments to the enabling statute, those panels must reflect "diverse artistic and
cultural points of view" and include "wide geographic, ethnic, and minority representation," as well as "lay indi-
viduals who are knowledgeable about the arts." The panels report to the 26-member National Council on the
Arts (Council), which, in turn, advises the NEA Chairperson. The Chairperson has the ultimate authority to
award grants but may not approve an application as to which the Council has made a negative recommendation.

... Throughout the NEA's history, only a handful of the agency's roughly 100,000 awards have generated formal
complaints about misapplied funds or abuse of the public's trust. Two provocative works, however, prompted
public controversy in 1989 and led to congressional revaluation of the NEA's funding priorities and efforts to
increase oversight of its grant-making procedures ...
430 | GOVERNMENT SPEECH

When considering the NEA's appropriations for fiscal year 1990, Congress reacted to the controversy surround-
ing the Mapplethorpe and Serrano photographs by eliminating $45,000 from the agency's budget, the precise
amount contributed to the two exhibits by NEA grant recipients. Congress also enacted an amendment provid-
ing that no NEA funds "may be used to promote, disseminate, or produce materials which in the judgment of
[the NEA] may be considered obscene, including but not limited to, depictions of sadomasochism, homoeroti-
cism, the sexual exploitation of children, or individuals engaged in sex acts and which, when taken as a whole,
do not have serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value." ...

The four individual respondents in this case, Karen Finley, John Fleck, Holly Hughes, and Tim Miller, are per-
formance artists who applied for NEA grants before [the 1990 amendment] was enacted. An advisory panel
recommended approval of respondents' projects, both initially and after receiving Frohnmayer's request to
reconsider three of the applications. A majority of the Council subsequently recommended disapproval, and in
June 1990, the NEA informed respondents that they had been denied funding. Respondents filed suit, alleg-
ing that the NEA had violated their First Amendment rights by rejecting the applications on political grounds,
had failed to follow statutory procedures by basing the denial on criteria other than those set forth in the NEA's
enabling statute, and had breached the confidentiality of their grant applications through the release of quo-
tations to the press ... sought restoration of the recommended grants or reconsideration of their applications
... When Congress enacted [the amendment], respondents, now joined by the National Association of Artists'
Organizations (NAAO), amended their complaint to challenge the provision as void for vagueness and imper-
missibly viewpoint based ...

We granted certiorari, (1997), and now reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

Respondents raise a facial challenge ... and consequently they confront "a heavy burden" in advancing their
claim ... Respondents argue that the provision is a paradigmatic example of viewpoint discrimination because
it rejects any artistic speech that either fails to respect mainstream values or offends standards of decency. The
premise of respondents' claim is that [the statute] constrains the agency's ability to fund certain categories of
artistic expression ...

... Respondents' claim that the provision is facially unconstitutional may be reduced to the argument that the
criteria in [the statute] are sufficiently subjective that the agency could utilize them to engage in viewpoint
discrimination. Given the varied interpretations of the criteria and the vague exhortation to "take them into
consideration," it seems unlikely that this provision will introduce any greater element of selectivity than the
determination of "artistic excellence" itself ...

The NEA's enabling statute contemplates a number of indisputably constitutional applications for both the
"decency" prong ... and its reference to "respect for the diverse beliefs and values of the American public." Edu-
cational programs are central to the NEA's mission ... And it is well established that "decency" is a permissible
factor where "educational suitability" motivates its consideration. Bd. Of Ed v. Pico (1982).

... we note that the Government may allocate competitive funding according to criteria that would be imper-
missible were direct regulation of speech or a criminal penalty at stake. So long as legislation does not infringe
on other constitutionally protected rights, Congress has wide latitude to set spending priorities ... In the 1990
                                                                                                                 GOVERNMENT SPEECH | 431

Amendments ... Congress modified the declaration of purpose in the NEA's enabling act to provide that arts
funding should "contribute to public support and confidence in the use of taxpayer funds," and that "[p]ublic
funds ... must ultimately serve public purposes the Congress defines." And as we held in Rust, Congress may
"selectively fund a program to encourage certain activities it believes to be in the public interest, without at the
same time funding an alternative program which seeks to deal with the problem in another way." 500 U.S., at
193. In doing so, "the Government has not discriminated on the basis of viewpoint; it has merely chosen to fund
one activity to the exclusion of the other." Maher v. Roe (1977).

The lower courts also erred in invalidating [the statute] as unconstitutionally vague. Under the First and Fifth
Amendments, speakers are protected from arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of vague standards.
NAACP v. Button (1963). The terms of the provision are undeniably opaque, and if they appeared in a criminal
statute or regulatory scheme, they could raise substantial vagueness concerns ... But when the Government is
acting as patron rather than as sovereign, the consequences of imprecision are not constitutionally severe.

In the context of selective subsidies, it is not always feasible for Congress to legislate with clarity. Indeed, if this
statute is unconstitutionally vague, then so too are all Government programs awarding scholarships and grants
on the basis of subjective criteria such as "excellence." [...] To accept respondents' vagueness argument would
be to call into question the constitutionality of these valuable Government programs and countless others like
them. [The statute] merely adds some imprecise considerations to an already subjective selection process. It does
not, on its face, impermissibly infringe on First or Fifth Amendment rights. Accordingly, the judgment of the
Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Pleasant Grove City v. Summum

555 U.S. 460 (2009)

    Vote: 9-0
    Decision: Reversed
    Majority: Alito, joined by Roberts, Stevens, Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, Ginsburg and Breyer
    Concurrence: Stevens, joined by Ginsburg
    Concurrence: Scalia, joined by Thomas
    Concurrence: Breyer
    Concurrence: Souter (in judgment)

Justice Alito delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case presents the question whether the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment entitles a private group
to insist that a municipality permit it to place a permanent monument in a city park in which other donated
monuments were previously erected. The Court of Appeals held that the municipality was required to accept
the monument because a public park is a traditional public forum. We conclude, however, that although a park
is a traditional public forum for speeches and other transitory expressive acts, the display of a permanent mon-
ument in a public park is not a form of expression to which forum analysis applies. Instead, the placement of a
permanent monument in a public park is best viewed as a form of government speech and is therefore not sub-
ject to scrutiny under the Free Speech Clause.

Pioneer Park (or Park) is a 2.5 acre public park located in the Historic District of Pleasant Grove City (or City) in
Utah. The Park currently contains 15 permanent displays, at least 11 of which were donated by private groups
or individuals. These include an historic granary, a wishing well, the City's first fire station, a September 11 mon-
ument, and a Ten Commandments monument donated by the Fraternal Order of Eagles in 1971.

Respondent Summum is a religious organization founded in 1975 and headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah.
On two separate occasions in 2003, Summum's president wrote a letter to the City's mayor requesting permis-
sion to erect a "stone monument," which would contain "the Seven Aphorisms of SUMMUM" and be similar
in size and nature to the Ten Commandments monument. The City denied the requests and explained that its
practice was to limit monuments in the Park to those that "either (1) directly relate to the history of Pleasant
Grove, or (2) were donated by groups with longstanding ties to the Pleasant Grove community." The following
year, the City passed a resolution putting this policy into writing. The resolution also mentioned other criteria,
such as safety and esthetics.

In May 2005, respondent's president again wrote to the mayor asking to erect a monument, but the letter did
not describe the monument, its historical significance, or Summum's connection to the community. The city
council rejected this request.
                                                                                                                 GOVERNMENT SPEECH | 433

In 2005, respondent filed this action against the City and various local officials (petitioners), asserting, among
other claims, that petitioners had violated the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment by accepting the Ten
Commandments monument but rejecting the proposed Seven Aphorisms monument. Respondent sought a
preliminary injunction directing the City to permit Summum to erect its monument in Pioneer Park. After the
District Court denied Summum's preliminary injunction request, respondent appealed, pressing solely its free
speech claim.

A panel of the Tenth Circuit reversed ...

We granted certiorari and now reverse.

...

... The Free Speech Clause restricts government regulation of private speech; it does not regulate government
speech. A government entity has the right to "speak for itself." Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System v. South­
worth (2000) ...

This does not mean that there are no restraints on government speech. For example, government speech must
comport with the Establishment Clause ...

There may be situations in which it is difficult to tell whether a government entity is speaking on its own behalf
or is providing a forum for private speech, but this case does not present such a situation. Permanent monu-
ments displayed on public property typically represent government speech.

... Just as government-commissioned and government-financed monuments speak for the government, so do pri-
vately financed and donated monuments that the government accepts and displays to the public on government
land. It certainly is not common for property owners to open up their property for the installation of permanent
monuments that convey a message with which they do not wish to be associated. And because property owners
typically do not permit the construction of such monuments on their land, persons who observe donated mon-
uments routinely-and reasonably-interpret them as conveying some message on the property owner's behalf.
In this context, there is little chance that observers will fail to appreciate the identity of the speaker. This is true
whether the monument is located on private property or on public property, such as national, state, or city park
land ...

In this case, it is clear that the monuments in Pleasant Grove's Pioneer Park represent government speech ... The
City has selected those monuments that it wants to display for the purpose of presenting the image of the City
that it wishes to project to all who frequent the Park; it has taken ownership of most of the monuments in the
Park, including the Ten Commandments monument that is the focus of respondent's concern; and the City has
now expressly set forth the criteria it will use in making future selections.

... Contrary to respondent's apparent belief, it frequently is not possible to identify a single "message" that is
conveyed by an object or structure, and consequently, the thoughts or sentiments expressed by a government
entity that accepts and displays such an object may be quite different from those of either its creator or its donor.
By accepting a privately donated monument and placing it on city property, a city engages in expressive conduct,
434 | GOVERNMENT SPEECH

but the intended and perceived significance of that conduct may not coincide with the thinking of the monu-
ment's donor or creator. Indeed, when a privately donated memorial is funded by many small donations, the
donors themselves may differ in their interpretation of the monument's significance ...

... Speakers, no matter how long-winded, eventually come to the end of their remarks; persons distributing
leaflets and carrying signs at some point tire and go home; monuments, however, endure. They monopolize the
use of the land on which they stand and interfere permanently with other uses of public space. A public park,
over the years, can provide a soapbox for a very large number of orators-often, for all who want to speak-but it
is hard to imagine how a public park could be opened up for the installation of permanent monuments by every
person or group wishing to engage in that form of expression.

... To be sure, there are limited circumstances in which the forum doctrine might properly be applied to a per-
manent monument-for example, if a town created a monument on which all of its residents (or all those meet-
ing some other criterion) could place the name of a person to be honored or some other private message. But as
a general matter, forum analysis simply does not apply to the installation of permanent monuments on public
property.

In sum, we hold that the City's decision to accept certain privately donated monuments while rejecting respon-
dent's is best viewed as a form of government speech. As a result, the City's decision is not subject to the Free
Speech Clause, and the Court of Appeals erred in holding otherwise. We therefore reverse.

It is so ordered.

Walker v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans

576 U. S. 200 (2015)

    Vote: 5-4
    Decision: Reversed
    Majority: Breyer, joined by Thomas, Ginsburg, Sotomayor and Kagan
    Dissent: Alito, joined by Roberts, Scalia and Kennedy

Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.

Texas offers automobile owners a choice between ordinary and specialty license plates. Those who want the State
to issue a particular specialty plate may propose a plate design, comprising a slogan, a graphic, or (most com-
monly) both. If the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles Board approves the design, the State will make it avail-
able for display on vehicles registered in Texas.

In this case, the Texas Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans proposed a specialty license plate design
featuring a Confederate battle flag. The Board rejected the proposal. We must decide whether that rejection vio-
lated the Constitution's free speech guarantees. We conclude that it did not.

... Here we are concerned only with the second category of plates, namely specialty license plates, not with the
personalization program. Texas offers vehicle owners a variety of specialty plates, generally for an annual fee. And
Texas selects the designs for specialty plates through three distinct processes.

First, the state legislature may specifically call for the development of a specialty license plate ...

Second, the Board may approve a specialty plate design proposal that a state-designated private vendor has cre-
ated at the request of an individual or organization ...

Third, the Board "may create new specialty license plates on its own initiative or on receipt of an application
from a" nonprofit entity seeking to sponsor a specialty plate. A nonprofit must include in its application "a draft
design of the specialty license plate." And Texas law vests in the Board authority to approve or to disapprove an
application. The relevant statute says that the Board "may refuse to create a new specialty license plate" for a
number of reasons, for example "if the design might be offensive to any member of the public ... or for any other
reason established by rule." Specialty plates that the Board has sanctioned through this process include plates
featuring the words "The Gator Nation," together with the Florida Gators logo, and plates featuring the logo of
Rotary International and the words "SERVICE ABOVE SELF."

In 2009, the Sons of Confederate Veterans, Texas Division (a nonprofit entity), applied to sponsor a specialty
license plate through this last-mentioned process. SCV's application included a draft plate design. At the bottom
of the proposed plate were the words "SONS OF CONFEDERATE VETERANS." At the side was the orga-
nization's logo, a square Confederate battle flag framed by the words "Sons of Confederate Veterans 1896." A
436 | GOVERNMENT SPEECH

faint Confederate battle flag appeared in the background on the lower portion of the plate. Additionally, in the
middle of the plate was the license plate number, and at the top was the State's name and silhouette. The Board's
predecessor denied this application.

In 2010, SCV renewed its application before the Board. The Board invited public comment on its website and
at an open meeting. After considering the responses, including a number of letters sent by elected officials who
opposed the proposal, the Board voted unanimously against issuing the plate. The Board explained that it had
found "it necessary to deny th[e] plate design application, specifically the confederate flag portion of the design,
because public comments ha[d] shown that many members of the general public find the design offensive, and
because such comments are reasonable." The Board added "that a significant portion of the public associate
the confederate flag with organizations advocating expressions of hate directed toward people or groups that is
demeaning to those people or groups."

In 2012, SCV and two of its officers (collectively SCV) brought this lawsuit against the chairman and members
of the Board (collectively Board). SCV argued that the Board's decision violated the Free Speech Clause of the
First Amendment, and it sought an injunction requiring the Board to approve the proposed plate design. The
District Court entered judgment for the Board. A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit
reversed ...

We granted the Board's petition for certiorari, and we now reverse.

...

When government speaks, it is not barred by the Free Speech Clause from determining the content of what it
says. That freedom in part reflects the fact that it is the democratic electoral process that first and foremost pro-
vides a check on government speech ... Thus, government statements (and government actions and programs
that take the form of speech) do not normally trigger the First Amendment rules designed to protect the mar-
ketplace of ideas. Johanns v. Livestock Marketing Assn., (2005).

That is not to say that a government's ability to express itself is without restriction. Constitutional and statutory
provisions outside of the Free Speech Clause may limit government speech. And the Free Speech Clause itself
may constrain the government's speech if, for example, the government seeks to compel private persons to con-
vey the government's speech ...

In our view, specialty license plates issued pursuant to Texas's statutory scheme convey government speech. Our
reasoning rests primarily on our analysis in Summum, a recent case that presented a similar problem. Pleas­
ant Grove City v. Summum (2008). We conclude here, as we did there, that our precedents regarding govern-
ment speech (and not our precedents regarding forums for private speech) provide the appropriate framework
through which to approach the case.

In Summum, we considered a religious organization's request to erect in a 2.5-acre city park a monument setting
forth the organization's religious tenets ... The speech at issue, this Court decided, was "best viewed as a form of
government speech" and "therefore [was] not subject to scrutiny under the Free Speech Clause."
                                                                                                                 GOVERNMENT SPEECH | 437

... In light of these and a few other relevant considerations, the Court concluded that the expression at issue was
government speech. And, in reaching that conclusion, the Court rejected the premise that the involvement of
private parties in designing the monuments was sufficient to prevent the government from controlling which
monuments it placed in its own public park.

... First, the history of license plates shows that, insofar as license plates have conveyed more than state names and
vehicle identification numbers, they long have communicated messages from the States ...

Texas, too, has selected various messages to communicate through its license plate designs ... In 1977, Texas
replaced the Lone Star with a small silhouette of the State. And in 1995, Texas plates celebrated "150 Years of
Statehood." Additionally, the Texas Legislature has specifically authorized specialty plate designs stating, among
other things, "Read to Succeed," "Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo," "Texans Conquer Cancer," and "Girl
Scouts." This kind of state speech has appeared on Texas plates for decades.

Second, Texas license plate designs "are often closely identified in the public mind with the [State]." Each Texas
license plate is a government article serving the governmental purposes of vehicle registration and identification.
The governmental nature of the plates is clear from their faces: The State places the name "TEXAS" in large let-
ters at the top of every plate. Moreover, the State requires Texas vehicle owners to display license plates, and every
Texas license plate is issued by the State. Texas also owns the designs on its license plates, including the designs
that Texas adopts on the basis of proposals made by private individuals and organizations. And Texas dictates
the manner in which drivers may dispose of unused plates.

Texas license plates are, essentially, government IDs. And issuers of ID "typically do not permit" the placement
on their IDs of "message[s] with which they do not wish to be associated." Summum. Consequently, "persons
who observe" designs on IDs "routinely-and reasonably-interpret them as conveying some message on the
[issuer's] behalf."

Indeed, a person who displays a message on a Texas license plate likely intends to convey to the public that the
State has endorsed that message. If not, the individual could simply display the message in question in larger
letters on a bumper sticker right next to the plate. But the individual prefers a license plate design to the purely
private speech expressed through bumper stickers. That may well be because Texas's license plate designs convey
government agreement with the message displayed.

Third, Texas maintains direct control over the messages conveyed on its specialty plates. Texas law provides that
the State "has sole control over the design, typeface, color, and alphanumeric pattern for all license plates." The
Board must approve every specialty plate design proposal before the design can appear on a Texas plate. And
the Board and its predecessor have actively exercised this authority. Texas asserts, and SCV concedes, that the
State has rejected at least a dozen proposed designs. Accordingly, like the city government in Summum, Texas
"has `effectively controlled' the messages [conveyed] by exercising `final approval authority' over their selection."
(quoting Johanns).
438 | GOVERNMENT SPEECH

This final approval authority allows Texas to choose how to present itself and its constituency. Thus, Texas offers
plates celebrating the many educational institutions attended by its citizens. But it need not issue plates deriding
schooling ...

... Texas's policies and the nature of its license plates indicate that the State did not intend its specialty license
plates to serve as either a designated public forum or a limited public forum. First, the State exercises final author-
ity over each specialty license plate design. This authority militates against a determination that Texas has created
a public forum. Second, Texas takes ownership of each specialty plate design, making it particularly untenable
that the State intended specialty plates to serve as a forum for public discourse. Finally, Texas license plates have
traditionally been used for government speech, are primarily used as a form of government ID, and bear the
State's name. These features of Texas license plates indicate that Texas explicitly associates itself with the speech
on its plates.

For similar reasons, we conclude that Texas's specialty license plates are not a "nonpublic for[um]," which exists
"[w]here the government is acting as a proprietor, managing its internal operations." Int'l Soc. For Krishna
Consc. Inc. v. Lee, (1992).

The fact that private parties take part in the design and propagation of a message does not extinguish the govern-
mental nature of the message or transform the government's role into that of a mere forum-provider ...

Of course, Texas allows many more license plate designs than the city in Summum allowed monuments. But our
holding in Summum was not dependent on the precise number of monuments found within the park ...

Additionally, the fact that Texas vehicle owners pay annual fees in order to display specialty license plates does
not imply that the plate designs are merely a forum for private speech. While some nonpublic forums provide
governments the opportunity to profit from speech, the existence of government profit alone is insufficient to
trigger forum analysis ...

Our determination that Texas's specialty license plate designs are government speech does not mean that the
designs do not also implicate the free speech rights of private persons. We have acknowledged that drivers who
display a State's selected license plate designs convey the messages communicated through those designs. Wooley
v. Maynard (1977). But here, compelled private speech is not at issue. And just as Texas cannot require SCV to
convey "the State's ideological message," Wooley, SCV cannot force Texas to include a Confederate battle flag on
its specialty license plates.

...

For the reasons stated, we hold that Texas's specialty license plate designs constitute government speech and that
Texas was consequently entitled to refuse to issue plates featuring SCV's proposed design. Accordingly, the judg-
ment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is

Reversed.

Justice Alito, with whom the Chief Justice, Justice Scalia, and Justice Kennedy join, dissenting.
§                                                                                                                GOVERNMENT SPEECH | 439

... This capacious understanding of government speech takes a large and painful bite out of the First Amend-
ment. Specialty plates may seem innocuous. They make motorists happy, and they put money in a State's coffers.
But the precedent this case sets is dangerous. While all license plates unquestionably contain some government
speech (e.g., the name of the State and the numbers and/or letters identifying the vehicle), the State of Texas has
converted the remaining space on its specialty plates into little mobile billboards on which motorists can display
their own messages. And what Texas did here was to reject one of the messages that members of a private group
wanted to post on some of these little billboards because the State thought that many of its citizens would find
the message offensive. That is blatant viewpoint discrimination ...

Messages that are proposed by private parties and placed on Texas specialty plates are private speech, not govern-
ment speech. Texas cannot forbid private speech based on its viewpoint. That is what it did here. Because the
Court approves this violation of the First Amendment, I respectfully dissent.

Matal v. Tam

582 U.S. ___ (2017)

    Vote: 8-0 (Justice Gorsuch took no part in the consideration or decision of the case)
    Decision: Affirmed
    Majority: Alito, joined by Roberts, Kennedy, Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, Kagan (Parts I, II & III-A),
    Thomas (except Part II), Roberts, Thomas, Breyer (Parts III-A, III-C, and IV)
    Concurrence: Kennedy (in part), joined by Ginsburg, Sotomayor and Kagan
    Concurrence: Thomas (in part)

Justice Alito announced the judgment of the court and delivered the opinion of the court with respect to parts
I, II, and III-A, and an opinion with respect to parts III-B, III-C, and IV, in which the Chief Justice, Justice
Thomas, and Justice Breyer join.

This case concerns a dance-rock band's application for federal trademark registration of the band's name, "The
Slants." "Slants" is a derogatory term for persons of Asian descent, and members of the band are Asian-Amer-
icans. But the band members believe that by taking that slur as the name of their group, they will help to
"reclaim" the term and drain its denigrating force.

The Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) denied the application based on a provision of federal law prohibiting
the registration of trademarks that may "disparage ... or bring ... into contemp[t] or disrepute" any "persons, liv-
440 | GOVERNMENT SPEECH

ing or dead." 15 U. S. C. §1052(a). We now hold that this provision violates the Free Speech Clause of the First
Amendment. It offends a bedrock First Amendment principle: Speech may not be banned on the ground that it
expresses ideas that offend.

... Under the Lanham Act, trademarks that are "used in commerce" may be placed on the "principal register,"
that is, they may be federally registered. 15 U. S. C. §1051(a)(1). And some marks "capable of distinguishing [an]
applicant's goods or services and not registrable on the principal register ... which are in lawful use in commerce
by the owner thereof" may instead be placed on a different federal register: the supplemental register. §1091(a).
There are now more than two million marks that have active federal certificates of registration. This system of
federal registration helps to ensure that trademarks are fully protected and supports the free flow of commerce
...

... At issue in this case is one such provision, which we will call "the disparagement clause." This provision pro-
hibits the registration of a trademark "which may disparage ... persons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs, or
national symbols, or bring them into contempt, or disrepute." §1052(a). This clause appeared in the original
Lanham Act and has remained the same to this day ...

Simon Tam is the lead singer of "The Slants." He chose this moniker in order to "reclaim" and "take ownership"
of stereotypes about people of Asian ethnicity. The group "draws inspiration for its lyrics from childhood slurs
and mocking nursery rhymes" and has given its albums names such as "The Yellow Album" and "Slanted Eyes,
Slanted Hearts."

Tam sought federal registration of "THE SLANTS," on the principal register, but an examining attorney at the
PTO rejected the request, applying the PTO's two part framework and finding that "there is ... a substantial
composite of persons who find the term in the applied for mark offensive." The examining attorney relied in
part on the fact that "numerous dictionaries define `slants' or `slant-eyes' as a derogatory or offensive term." The
examining attorney also relied on a finding that "the band's name has been found offensive numerous times" ...

Tam contested the denial of registration before the examining attorney and before the PTO's Trademark Trial
and Appeal Board (TTAB) but to no avail. Eventually, he took the case to federal court, where the en banc Fed-
eral Circuit ultimately found the disparagement clause facially unconstitutional under the First Amendment's
Free Speech Clause ...

The Government filed a petition for certiorari, which we granted in order to decide whether the disparagement
clause "is facially invalid under the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment."

Because the disparagement clause applies to marks that disparage the members of a racial or ethnic group, we
must decide whether the clause violates the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. And at the outset,
we must consider three arguments that would either eliminate any First Amendment protection or result in
highly permissive rational-basis review. Specifically, the Government contends (1) that trademarks are govern-
ment speech, not private speech, (2) that trademarks are a form of government subsidy, and (3) that the constitu-
tionality of the disparagement clause should be tested under a new "government-program" doctrine. We address
each of these arguments below.
                                                                                                                 GOVERNMENT SPEECH | 441

... At issue here is the content of trademarks that are registered by the PTO, an arm of the Federal Government.
The Federal Government does not dream up these marks, and it does not edit marks submitted for registration
... In light of all this, it is far-fetched to suggest that the content of a registered mark is government speech.
If the federal registration of a trademark makes the mark government speech, the Federal Government is bab-
bling prodigiously and incoherently. It is saying many unseemly things. It is expressing contradictory views. It is
unashamedly endorsing a vast array of commercial products and services. And it is providing Delphic advice to
the consuming public.

... The PTO has made it clear that registration does not constitute approval of a mark. In re Old Glory Condom
Corp., (1993). And it is unlikely that more than a tiny fraction of the public has any idea what federal registration
of a trademark means. Application of National Dist. And Chem. Corp., (1962) (Rich, concurring).

... This brings us to the case on which the Government relies most heavily, Walker, which likely marks the outer
bounds of the government-speech doctrine. Holding that the messages on Texas specialty license plates are gov-
ernment speech, the Walker Court cited three factors distilled from Summum. First, license plates have long
been used by the States to convey state messages. Second, license plates "are often closely identified in the public
mind" with the State, since they are manufactured and owned by the State, generally designed by the State, and
serve as a form of "government ID." Third, Texas "maintain[ed] direct control over the messages conveyed on its
specialty plates." As explained above, none of these factors are present in this case.

... Trademarks are private, not government, speech.

We next address the Government's argument that this case is governed by cases in which this Court has upheld
the constitutionality of government programs that subsidized speech expressing a particular viewpoint. These
cases implicate a notoriously tricky question of constitutional law ...

Unlike the present case, the decisions on which the Government relies all involved cash subsidies or their equiv-
alent ... In other cases, we have regarded tax benefits as comparable to cash subsidies. Regan v. Taxation With
Representation of Wash., (1983) [other citations omitted]. The federal registration of a trademark is nothing like
the programs at issue in these cases ... The PTO does not pay money to parties seeking registration of a mark.
Quite the contrary is true: An applicant for registration must pay the PTO a filing fee of $225-$600 ...

...

Finally, the Government urges us to sustain the disparagement clause under a new doctrine that would apply
to "government-program" cases. For the most part, this argument simply merges our government-speech cases
and the previously discussed subsidy cases in an attempt to construct a broader doctrine that can be applied to
the registration of trademarks. The only new element in this construct consists of two cases involving a public
employer's collection of union dues from its employees. But those cases occupy a special area of First Amend-
ment case law, and they are far removed from the registration of trademarks.

... Our cases use the term "viewpoint" discrimination in a broad sense, and in that sense, the disparagement
clause discriminates on the bases of "viewpoint." To be sure, the clause evenhandedly prohibits disparagement
442 | GOVERNMENT SPEECH

of all groups. It applies equally to marks that damn Democrats and Republicans, capitalists and socialists, and
those arrayed on both sides of every possible issue. It denies registration to any mark that is offensive to a sub-
stantial percentage of the members of any group. But in the sense relevant here, that is viewpoint discrimina-
tion: Giving offense is a viewpoint.

... For this reason, the disparagement clause cannot be saved by analyzing it as a type of government program in
which some content- and speaker-based restrictions are permitted.

Having concluded that the disparagement clause cannot be sustained under our government-speech or subsidy
cases or under the Government's proposed "government program" doctrine, we must confront a dispute
between the parties on the question whether trademarks are commercial speech and are thus subject to the
relaxed scrutiny outlined in Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., (1980) ...

We need not resolve this debate between the parties because the disparagement clause cannot withstand even
Central Hudson review.

Under Central Hudson, a restriction of speech must serve "a substantial interest," and it must be "narrowly
drawn." This means, among other things, that "[t]he regulatory technique may extend only as far as the interest
it serves." The disparagement clause fails this requirement.

It is claimed that the disparagement clause serves two interests. The first is phrased in a variety of ways in the
briefs. Echoing language in one of the opinions below, the Government asserts an interest in preventing "`under-
represented groups'" from being "`bombarded with demeaning messages in commercial advertising.'" ... Speech
that demeans on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, age, disability, or any other similar ground is hate-
ful; but the proudest boast of our free speech jurisprudence is that we protect the freedom to express "the
thought that we hate." United States v. Schwimmer (1929) (Holmes, dissenting).

The second interest asserted is protecting the orderly flow of commerce ...

A simple answer to this argument is that the disparagement clause is not "narrowly drawn" to drive out trade-
marks that support invidious discrimination ... It is not an anti-discrimination clause; it is a happy-talk clause. In
this way, it goes much further than is necessary to serve the interest asserted. The clause is far too broad in other
ways as well. The clause protects every person living or dead as well as every institution ...

For these reasons, we hold that the disparagement clause violates the Free Speech Clause of the First Amend-
ment. The judgment of the Federal Circuit is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Iancu v. Brunetti

588 U.S. ___ (2019)

JUSTICE KAGAN DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.

... Today we consider a First Amendment challenge to a neighboring provision of the Act, prohibiting the reg-
istration of "immoral[] or scandalous" trademarks. We hold that this provision infringes the First Amendment
for the same reason: It too disfavors certain ideas.

Respondent Erik Brunetti is an artist and entrepreneur who founded a clothing line that uses the trademark
FUCT ... But you might read it differently and, if so, you would hardly be alone ... That common perception
caused difficulties for Brunetti when he tried to register his mark with the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office
(PTO).

... This case involves another of the Lanham Act's prohibitions on registration--one applying to marks that
"[c]onsist[] of or comprise[] immoral[] or scandalous matter." §1052(a). The PTO applies that bar as a "unitary
provision," rather than treating the two adjectives in it separately. To determine whether a mark fits in the cate-
gory, the PTO asks whether a "substantial composite of the general public" would find the mark "shocking to
the sense of truth, decency, or propriety"; "giving offense to the conscience or moral feelings"; "calling out for
condemnation"; "disgraceful"; "offensive"; "disreputable"; or "vulgar."

Both a PTO examining attorney and the PTO's Trademark Trial and Appeal Board decided that Brunetti's mark
flunked that test ...

Brunetti then brought a facial challenge to the "immoral or scandalous" bar in the Court of Appeals for the Fed-
eral Circuit. That court found the prohibition to violate the First Amendment. As usual when a lower court has
invalidated a federal statute, we granted certiorari.

... If the "immoral or scandalous" bar similarly discriminates on the basis of viewpoint, it must also collide with
our First Amendment doctrine ... So the key question becomes: Is the "immoral or scandalous" criterion in the
Lanham Act viewpoint-neutral or viewpoint-based?

It is viewpoint-based ... So the Lanham Act allows registration of marks when their messages accord with, but
not when their messages defy, society's sense of decency or propriety. Put the pair of overlapping terms together
444 | GOVERNMENT SPEECH

and the statute, on its face, distinguishes between two opposed sets of ideas: those aligned with conventional
moral standards and those hostile to them; those inducing societal nods of approval and those provoking offense
and condemnation. The statute favors the former, and disfavors the latter ...

The facial viewpoint bias in the law results in viewpoint-discriminatory application ...

... But in any event, the "immoral or scandalous" bar is substantially overbroad. There are a great many immoral
and scandalous ideas in the world (even more than there are swearwords), and the Lanham Act covers them all.
It therefore violates the First Amendment.

We accordingly affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

It is so ordered.

Student Speech

Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District

393 U.S. 503 (1969)

    Vote: 7-2
    Decision: Reversed
    Majority: Fortas, joined by Warren, Douglas, Brennan, White and Marshall
    Concurrence: Stewart
    Concurrence: White
    Dissent: Black
    Dissent: Harlan

Justice Fortas delivered the opinion of the Court.

Petitioner John F. Tinker, 15 years old, and petitioner Christopher Eckhardt, 16 years old, attended high schools
in Des Moines, Iowa. Petitioner Mary Beth Tinker, John's sister, was a 13-year-old student in junior high school.

In December, 1965, a group of adults and students in Des Moines held a meeting at the Eckhardt home. The
group determined to publicize their objections to the hostilities in Vietnam and their support for a truce by
wearing black armbands during the holiday season and by fasting on December 16 and New Year's Eve. Petition-
ers and their parents had previously engaged in similar activities, and they decided to participate in the program.

The principals of the Des Moines schools became aware of the plan to wear armbands. On December 14, 1965,
they met and adopted a policy that any student wearing an armband to school would be asked to remove it, and,
if he refused, he would be suspended until he returned without the armband. Petitioners were aware of the reg-
ulation that the school authorities adopted.

On December 16, Mary Beth and Christopher wore black armbands to their schools. John Tinker wore his arm-
band the next day. They were all sent home and suspended from school until they would come back without
their armbands. They did not return to school until after the planned period for wearing armbands had expired
-- that is, until after New Year's Day.

This complaint was filed in the United States District Court by petitioners, through their fathers ... It prayed
for an injunction restraining the respondent school officials and the respondent members of the board of direc-
tors of the school district from disciplining the petitioners, and it sought nominal damages. After an evidentiary
hearing, the District Court dismissed the complaint. It upheld the constitutionality of the school authorities'
action on the ground that it was reasonable in order to prevent disturbance of school discipline. The court
446 | STUDENT SPEECH

referred to, but expressly declined to follow, the Fifth Circuit's holding in a similar case that the wearing of sym-
bols like the armbands cannot be prohibited unless it "materially and substantially interfere[s] with the require-
ments of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school." Burnside v. Byars, (1966).

On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit considered the case en banc. The court was equally
divided, and the District Court's decision was accordingly affirmed without opinion. We granted certiorari.

The District Court recognized that the wearing of an armband for the purpose of expressing certain views is
the type of symbolic act that is within the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. As we shall discuss, the
wearing of armbands in the circumstances of this case was entirely divorced from actually or potentially disrup-
tive conduct by those participating in it. It was closely akin to "pure speech" which, we have repeatedly held, is
entitled to comprehensive protection under the First Amendment.

First Amendment rights, applied in light of the special characteristics of the school environment, are available to
teachers and students. It can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to
freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate. This has been the unmistakable holding of this Court
for almost 50 years ...

In West Virginia v. Barnette (1943) ... this Court held that, under the First Amendment, the student in public
school may not be compelled to salute the flag ... On the other hand, the Court has repeatedly emphasized the
need for affirming the comprehensive authority of the States and of school officials, consistent with fundamen-
tal constitutional safeguards, to prescribe and control conduct in the schools. Our problem lies in the area where
students in the exercise of First Amendment rights collide with the rules of the school authorities.

The problem posed by the present case does not relate to regulation of the length of skirts or the type of clothing,
to hair style, or deportment. It does not concern aggressive, disruptive action or even group demonstrations.
Our problem involves direct, primary First Amendment rights akin to "pure speech."

The school officials banned and sought to punish petitioners for a silent, passive expression of opinion, unac-
companied by any disorder or disturbance on the part of petitioners. There is here no evidence whatever of peti-
tioners' interference, actual or nascent, with the schools' work or of collision with the rights of other students
to be secure and to be let alone. Accordingly, this case does not concern speech or action that intrudes upon the
work of the schools or the rights of other students.

Only a few of the 18,000 students in the school system wore the black armbands. Only five students were sus-
pended for wearing them. There is no indication that the work of the schools or any class was disrupted. Outside
the classrooms, a few students made hostile remarks to the children wearing armbands, but there were no threats
or acts of violence on school premises.

The District Court concluded that the action of the school authorities was reasonable because it was based
upon their fear of a disturbance from the wearing of the armbands. But, in our system, undifferentiated fear
or apprehension of disturbance is not enough to overcome the right to freedom of expression. Any departure
from absolute regimentation may cause trouble. Any variation from the majority's opinion may inspire fear.
                                                                                                                        STUDENT SPEECH | 447

Any word spoken, in class, in the lunchroom, or on the campus, that deviates from the views of another person
may start an argument or cause a disturbance. But our Constitution says we must take this risk and our history
says that it is this sort of hazardous freedom -- this kind of openness -- that is the basis of our national strength
and of the independence and vigor of Americans who grow up and live in this relatively permissive, often dispu-
tatious, society.

In order for the State in the person of school officials to justify prohibition of a particular expression of opinion,
it must be able to show that its action was caused by something more than a mere desire to avoid the discomfort
and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint. Certainly where there is no finding and no
showing that engaging in the forbidden conduct would "materially and substantially interfere with the require-
ments of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school," the prohibition cannot be sustained.

In the present case, the District Court made no such finding, and our independent examination of the record
fails to yield evidence that the school authorities had reason to anticipate that the wearing of the armbands
would substantially interfere with the work of the school or impinge upon the rights of other students. Even an
official memorandum prepared after the suspension that listed the reasons for the ban on wearing the armbands
made no reference to the anticipation of such disruption.

On the contrary, the action of the school authorities appears to have been based upon an urgent wish to avoid
the controversy which might result from the expression, even by the silent symbol of armbands, of opposition
to this Nation's part in the conflagration in Vietnam ...

It is also relevant that the school authorities did not purport to prohibit the wearing of all symbols of political
or controversial significance. The record shows that students in some of the schools wore buttons relating to
national political campaigns, and some even wore the Iron Cross, traditionally a symbol of Nazism. The order
prohibiting the wearing of armbands did not extend to these. Instead, a particular symbol -- black armbands
worn to exhibit opposition to this Nation's involvement in Vietnam -- was singled out for prohibition. Clearly,
the prohibition of expression of one particular opinion, at least without evidence that it is necessary to avoid
material and substantial interference with schoolwork or discipline, is not constitutionally permissible.

In our system, state-operated schools may not be enclaves of totalitarianism. School officials do not possess
absolute authority over their students. Students in school, as well as out of school, are "persons" under our Con-
stitution. They are possessed of fundamental rights which the State must respect, just as they themselves must
respect their obligations to the State. In our system, students may not be regarded as closed-circuit recipients of
only that which the State chooses to communicate. They may not be confined to the expression of those senti-
ments that are officially approved. In the absence of a specific showing of constitutionally valid reasons to regu-
late their speech, students are entitled to freedom of expression of their views ...

...

The principle of these cases is not confined to the supervised and ordained discussion which takes place in
the classroom. The principal use to which the schools are dedicated is to accommodate students during pre-
scribed hours for the purpose of certain types of activities. Among those activities is personal intercommuni-
448 | STUDENT SPEECH

cation among the students. This is not only an inevitable part of the process of attending school; it is also an
important part of the educational process. A student's rights, therefore, do not embrace merely the classroom
hours. When he is in the cafeteria, or on the playing field, or on the campus during the authorized hours, he may
express his opinions, even on controversial subjects like the conflict in Vietnam, if he does so without "materially
and substantially interfer[ing] with the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school"
and without colliding with the rights of others. But conduct by the student, in class or out of it, which for any
reason -- whether it stems from time, place, or type of behavior -- materially disrupts classwork or involves sub-
stantial disorder or invasion of the rights of others is, of course, not immunized by the constitutional guarantee
of freedom of speech.

Under our Constitution, free speech is not a right that is given only to be so circumscribed that it exists in prin-
ciple, but not in fact. Freedom of expression would not truly exist if the right could be exercised only in an area
that a benevolent government has provided as a safe haven for crackpots. The Constitution says that Congress
(and the States) may not abridge the right to free speech. This provision means what it says. We properly read
it to permit reasonable regulation of speech-connected activities in carefully restricted circumstances. But we do
not confine the permissible exercise of First Amendment rights to a telephone booth or the four corners of a
pamphlet, or to supervised and ordained discussion in a school classroom.

... We express no opinion as to the form of relief which should be granted, this being a matter for the lower courts
to determine. We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

Reversed and remanded.

Mr. Justice Stewart, concurring.

Although I agree with much of what is said in the Court's opinion, and with its judgment in this case, I cannot
share the Court's uncritical assumption that, school discipline aside, the First Amendment rights of children are
coextensive with those of adults. Indeed, I had thought the Court decided otherwise just last Term in Ginsberg
v. New York (1968). I continue to hold the view I expressed in that case:

"[A] State may permissibly determine that, at least in some precisely delineated areas, a child -- like someone in
a captive audience -- is not possessed of that full capacity for individual choice which is the presupposition of
First Amendment guarantees."

MR. JUSTICE BLACK, dissenting.

The Court's holding in this case ushers in what I deem to be an entirely new era in which the power to control
pupils by the elected "officials of state supported public schools ..." in the United States is in ultimate effect trans-
ferred to the Supreme Court. The Court brought this particular case here on a petition for certiorari urging that
the First and Fourteenth Amendments protect the right of school pupils to express their political views all the
way "from kindergarten through high school." Here, the constitutional right to "political expression" asserted
was a right to wear black armbands during school hours and at classes in order to demonstrate to the other
students that the petitioners were mourning because of the death of United States soldiers in Vietnam and to
                                                                                                                        STUDENT SPEECH | 449

protest that war which they were against. Ordered to refrain from wearing the armbands in school by the elected
school officials and the teachers vested with state authority to do so, apparently only seven out of the school sys-
tem's 18,000 pupils deliberately refused to obey the order ...

As I read the Court's opinion, it relies upon the following grounds for holding unconstitutional the judgment
of the Des Moines school officials and the two courts below. First, the Court concludes that the wearing of
armbands is "symbolic speech," which is "akin to pure speech,'" and therefore protected by the First and Four­
teenth Amendments. Secondly, the Court decides that the public schools are an appropriate place to exercise "symbolic
speech" as long as normal school functions are not "unreasonably" disrupted. Finally, the Court arrogates to itself,
rather than to the State's elected officials charged with running the schools, the decision as to which school disciplinary
regulations are "reasonable."

Assuming that the Court is correct in holding that the conduct of wearing armbands for the purpose of convey-
ing political ideas is protected by the First Amendment, cf., e.g., Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co., (1949), the
crucial remaining questions are whether students and teachers may use the schools at their whim as a platform
for the exercise of free speech -- "symbolic" or "pure" -- and whether the courts will allocate to themselves
the function of deciding how the pupils' school day will be spent. While I have always believed that, under the
First and Fourteenth Amendments, neither the State nor the Federal Government has any authority to regulate
or censor the content of speech, I have never believed that any person has a right to give speeches or engage in
demonstrations where he pleases and when he pleases ...

Even a casual reading of the record shows that this armband did divert students' minds from their regular lessons,
and that talk, comments, etc., made John Tinker "self-conscious" in attending school with his armband. While
the absence of obscene remarks or boisterous and loud disorder perhaps justifies the Court's statement that the
few armband students did not actually "disrupt" the classwork, I think the record overwhelmingly shows that
the armbands did exactly what the elected school officials and principals foresaw they would, that is, took the
students' minds off their classwork and diverted them to thoughts about the highly emotional subject of the
Vietnam war ...

I deny, therefore, that it has been the "unmistakable holding of this Court for almost 50 years" that "students"
and "teachers" take with them into the "schoolhouse gate" constitutional rights to "freedom of speech or expres-
sion." ... The truth is that a teacher of kindergarten, grammar school, or high school pupils no more carries into
a school with him a complete right to freedom of speech and expression than an anti-Catholic or anti-Semite
carries with him a complete freedom of speech and religion into a Catholic church or Jewish synagogue. Nor
does a person carry with him into the United States Senate or House, or into the Supreme Court, or any other
court, a complete constitutional right to go into those places contrary to their rules and speak his mind on any
subject he pleases ...

... This case, therefore, wholly without constitutional reasons, in my judgment, subjects all the public schools in
the country to the whims and caprices of their loudest-mouthed, but maybe not their brightest, students. I, for
one, am not fully persuaded that school pupils are wise enough, even with this Court's expert help from Wash-
§450 | STUDENT SPEECH

ington, to run the 23,390 public school systems in our 50 States. I wish, therefore, wholly to disclaim any pur-
pose on my part to hold that the Federal Constitution compels the teachers, parents, and elected school officials
to surrender control of the American public school system to public school students. I dissent.

JUSTICE BRENNAN announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which JUSTICE
MARSHALL and JUSTICE STEVENS joined, and in which JUSTICE BLACKMUN joined except for Part
II-A-(1).

The principal question presented is whether the First Amendment imposes limitations upon the exercise by a
local school board of its discretion to remove library books from high school and junior high school libraries.

Petitioners are the Board of Education of the Island Trees Union Free School District No. 26, in New York, and
Richard Ahrens, Frank Martin, Christina Fasulo, Patrick Hughes, Richard Melchers, Richard Michaels, and
Louis Nessim. When this suit was brought, Ahrens was the President of the Board, Martin was the Vice Presi-
dent, and the remaining petitioners were Board members. The Board is a state agency charged with responsibil-
ity for the operation and administration of the public schools within the Island Trees School District, including
the Island Trees High School and Island Trees Memorial Junior High School. Respondents are Steven Pico,
Jacqueline Gold, Glenn Yarris, Russell Rieger, and Paul Sochinski. When this suit was brought, Pico, Gold,
Yarris, and Rieger were students at the High School, and Sochinski was a student at the Junior High School.

In September, 1975, petitioners Ahrens, Martin, and Hughes attended a conference sponsored by Parents of
New York United (PONYU), a politically conservative organization of parents concerned about education legis-
lation in the State of New York. At the conference, these petitioners obtained lists of books described by Ahrens
                                                                                                                         STUDENT SPEECH | 451

as "objectionable," and by Martin as "improper fare for school students," ... It was later determined that the
High School library contained nine of the listed books, and that another listed book was in the Junior High
School library. In February, 1976, at a meeting with the Superintendent of Schools and the Principals of the
High School and Junior High School, the Board gave an "unofficial direction" that the listed books be removed
from the library shelves and delivered to the Board's offices so that Board members could read them. When this
directive was carried out, it became publicized, and the Board issued a press release justifying its action. It char-
acterized the removed books as "anti-American, anti-Christian, anti-Sem[i]tic, and just plain filthy," and con-
cluded that "[i]t is our duty, our moral obligation, to protect the children in our schools from this moral danger
as surely as from physical and medical dangers." 474 F. Supp. 387, 390 (EDNY 1979).

A short time later, the Board appointed a "Book Review Committee," consisting of four Island Trees parents
and four members of the Island Trees schools staff, to read the listed books and to recommend to the Board
whether the books should be retained, taking into account the books' "educational suitability," "good taste,"
"relevance," and "appropriateness to age and grade level." In July, the Committee made its final report to the
Board, recommending that five of the listed books be retained and that two others be removed from the school
libraries. As for the remaining four books, the Committee could not agree on two, took no position on one, and
recommended that the last book be made available to students only with parental approval. The Board substan-
tially rejected the Committee's report later that month, deciding that only one book should be returned to the
High School library without restriction, that another should be made available subject to parental approval but
that the remaining nine books should "be removed from elementary and secondary libraries and [from] use in
the curriculum." The Board gave no reasons for rejecting the recommendations of the Committee that it had
appointed.

Respondents reacted to the Board's decision by bringing the present action ... They alleged that petitioners had
"ordered the removal of the books from school libraries and proscribed their use in the curriculum because par-
ticular passages in the books offended their social, political and moral tastes, and not because the books, taken as
a whole, were lacking in educational value."

Respondents claimed that the Board's actions denied them their rights under the First Amendment. They asked
the court for a declaration that the Board's actions were unconstitutional, and for preliminary and permanent
injunctive relief ordering the Board to return the nine books to the school libraries and to refrain from interfer-
ing with the use of those books in the schools' curricula.

The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of petitioners ... In the court's view, "the parties sub-
stantially agree[d] about the motivation behind the board's actions," -- namely, that

"the board acted not on religious principles, but on its conservative educational philosophy, and on its belief that
the nine books removed from the school library and curriculum were irrelevant, vulgar, immoral, and in bad
taste, making them educationally unsuitable for the district's junior and senior high school students."

With this factual premise as its background, the court rejected respondents' contention that their First Amend-
ment rights had been infringed by the Board's actions ...
452 | STUDENT SPEECH

A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the judgment of the
District Court, and remanded the action for a trial on respondents' allegations. Each judge on the panel filed a
separate opinion. Delivering the judgment of the court, Judge Sifton treated the case as involving "an unusual
and irregular intervention in the school libraries' operations by persons not routinely concerned with such mat-
ters," and concluded that petitioners were obliged to demonstrate a reasonable basis for interfering with respon-
dents' First Amendment rights. He then determined that, at least at the summary judgment stage, petitioners
had not offered sufficient justification for their action, and concluded that respondents

"should have ... been offered an opportunity to persuade a finder of fact that the ostensible justifications for
[petitioners'] actions ... were simply pretexts for the suppression of free speech."

... We granted certiorari.

We emphasize at the outset the limited nature of the substantive question presented by the case before us. Our
precedents have long recognized certain constitutional limits upon the power of the State to control even the
curriculum and classroom ... Respondents do not seek in this Court to impose limitations upon their school
Board's discretion to prescribe the curricula of the Island Trees schools. On the contrary, the only books at issue
in this case are library books, books that, by their nature, are optional, rather than required, reading. Our adjudi-
cation of the present case thus does not intrude into the classroom, or into the compulsory courses taught there.
Furthermore, even as to library books, the action before us does not involve the acquisition of books. Respon-
dents have not sought to compel their school Board to add to the school library shelves any books that students
desire to read. Rather, the only action challenged in this case is the removal from school libraries of books origi-
nally placed there by the school authorities, or without objection from them.

... In sum, the issue before us in this case is a narrow one, both substantively and procedurally. It may best be
restated as two distinct questions. First, does the First Amendment impose any limitations upon the discretion
of petitioners to remove library books from the Island Trees High School and Junior High School? Second, if so,
do the affidavits and other evidentiary materials before the District Court, construed most favorably to respon-
dents, raise a genuine issue of fact whether petitioners might have exceeded those limitations? If we answer either
of these questions in the negative, then we must reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate
the District Court's summary judgment for petitioners. If we answer both questions in the affirmative, then we
must affirm the judgment below. We examine these questions in turn.

The Court has long recognized that local school boards have broad discretion in the management of school
affairs. Meyer v. Nebraska (1923) [other citations omitted]. We have also acknowledged that public schools are
vitally important "in the preparation of individuals for participation as citizens," and as vehicles for "inculcating
fundamental values necessary to the maintenance of a democratic political system." Ambach v. Norwick, (1979).
We are therefore in full agreement with petitioners that local school boards must be permitted "to establish and
apply their curriculum in such a way as to transmit community values," and that "there is a legitimate and sub-
stantial community interest in promoting respect for authority and traditional values be they social, moral, or
political." ...
                                                                                                                        STUDENT SPEECH | 453

At the same time, however, we have necessarily recognized that the discretion of the States and local school
boards in matters of education must be exercised in a manner that comports with the transcendent imperatives
of the First Amendment ...

... In sum, students do not "shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the school-
house gate," ... and therefore local school boards must discharge their "important, delicate, and highly discre-
tionary functions" within the limits and constraints of the First Amendment.

The nature of students' First Amendment rights in the context of this case requires further examination. West
Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette, (1943) is instructive. There the Court held that students' liberty of
conscience could not be infringed in the name of "national unity" or "patriotism." ... Similarly, Tinker ... held
that students' rights to freedom of expression of their political views could not be abridged by reliance upon an
"undifferentiated fear or apprehension of disturbance" arising from such expression ...

Of course, courts should not "intervene in the resolution of conflicts which arise in the daily operation of school
systems" unless "basic constitutional values" are "directly and sharply implicate[d]" in those conflicts ... But we
think that the First Amendment rights of students may be directly and sharply implicated by the removal of
books from the shelves of a school library ...

This right is an inherent corollary of the rights of free speech and press that are explicitly guaranteed by the Con-
stitution ... the right to receive ideas follows ineluctably from the sender's First Amendment right to send them
... In sum, just as access to ideas makes it possible for citizens generally to exercise their rights of free speech and
press in a meaningful manner, such access prepares students for active and effective participation in the pluralis-
tic, often contentious society in which they will soon be adult members. Of course all First Amendment rights
accorded to students must be construed "in light of the special characteristics of the school environment." ... But
the special characteristics of the school library make that environment especially appropriate for the recognition
of the First Amendment rights of students ...

Petitioners emphasize the inculcative function of secondary education, and argue that they must be allowed
unfettered discretion to "transmit community values" through the Island Trees schools. But that sweeping claim
overlooks the unique role of the school library. It appears from the record that use of the Island Trees school
libraries is completely voluntary on the part of students. Their selection of books from these libraries is entirely a
matter of free choice; the libraries afford them an opportunity at self-education and individual enrichment that
is wholly optional. Petitioners might well defend their claim of absolute discretion in matters of curriculum by
reliance upon their duty to inculcate community values. But we think that petitioners' reliance upon that duty
is misplaced where, as here, they attempt to extend their claim of absolute discretion beyond the compulsory
environment of the classroom, into the school library and the regime of voluntary inquiry that there holds sway.

In rejecting petitioners' claim of absolute discretion to remove books from their school libraries, we do not deny
that local school boards have a substantial legitimate role to play in the determination of school library content.
We thus must turn to the question of the extent to which the First Amendment places limitations upon the
discretion of petitioners to remove books from their libraries. In this inquiry, we enjoy the guidance of several
precedents. West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette, (1943) stated:
454 | STUDENT SPEECH

"If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what
shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion. ... If there are any circumstances
which permit an exception, they do not now occur to us." ...

Petitioners rightly possess significant discretion to determine the content of their school libraries. But that dis-
cretion may not be exercised in a narrowly partisan or political manner. If a Democratic school board, motivated
by party affiliation, ordered the removal of all books written by or in favor of Republicans, few would doubt
that the order violated the constitutional rights of the students denied access to those books. The same conclu-
sion would surely apply if an all-white school board, motivated by racial animus, decided to remove all books
authored by blacks or advocating racial equality and integration. Our Constitution does not permit the official
suppression of ideas. Thus, whether petitioners' removal of books from their school libraries denied respondents
their First Amendment rights depends upon the motivation behind petitioners' actions. If petitioners intended
by their removal decision to deny respondents access to ideas with which petitioners disagreed, and if this intent
was the decisive factor in petitioners' decision, then petitioners have exercised their discretion in violation of the
Constitution ... On the other hand, respondents implicitly concede that an unconstitutional motivation would
not be demonstrated if it were shown that petitioners had decided to remove the books at issue because those
books were pervasively vulgar ... And again, respondents concede that, if it were demonstrated that the removal
decision was based solely upon the "educational suitability" of the books in question, then their removal would
be "perfectly permissible." In other words, in respondents' view, such motivations, if decisive of petitioners'
actions, would not carry the danger of an official suppression of ideas, and thus would not violate respondents'
First Amendment rights ...

We now turn to the remaining question presented by this case: do the evidentiary materials that were before the
District Court, when construed most favorably to respondents, raise a genuine issue of material fact whether
petitioners exceeded constitutional limitations in exercising their discretion to remove the books from the school
libraries? We conclude that the materials do raise such a question, which foreclose summary judgment in favor
of petitioners.

Before the District Court, respondents claimed that petitioners' decision to remove the books "was based on
[their] personal values, morals and tastes." ... Respondents also claimed that petitioners objected to the books
in part because excerpts from them were "anti-American." The accuracy of these claims was partially conceded
by petitioners, and petitioners' own affidavits lent further support to respondents' claims ... Furthermore, while
the Book Review Committee appointed by petitioners was instructed to make its recommendations based upon
criteria that appear on their face to be permissible -- the books' "educational suitability," "good taste," "rele-
vance," and "appropriateness to age and grade level," ... -- the Committee's recommendations that five of the
books be retained and that only two be removed were essentially rejected by petitioners, without any statement
of reasons for doing so. Finally, while petitioners originally defended their removal decision with the explanation
that "these books contain obscenities, blasphemies, brutality, and perversion beyond description," ... one of the
books, A Reader for Writers, was removed even though it contained no such language ...

Standing alone, this evidence respecting the substantive motivations behind petitioners' removal decision would
not be decisive. This would be a very different case if the record demonstrated that petitioners had employed
                                                                                                                        STUDENT SPEECH | 455

established, regular, and facially unbiased procedures for the review of controversial materials. But the actual
record in the case before us suggests the exact opposite. Petitioners' removal procedures were vigorously chal-
lenged below by respondents, and the evidence on this issue sheds further light on the issue of petitioners' moti-
vations ... The record shows that, immediately after petitioners first ordered the books removed from the library
shelves, the Superintendent of Schools reminded them that "we already have a policy ... designed expressly to
handle such problems," and recommended that the removal decision be approached through this established
channel ... But the Board disregarded the Superintendent's advice ... In sum, respondents' allegations and some
of the evidentiary materials presented below do not rule out the possibility that petitioners' removal procedures
were highly irregular and ad hoc -- the antithesis of those procedures that might tend to allay suspicions regard-
ing petitioners' motivations.

... Of course, some of the evidence before the District Court might lead a finder of fact to accept petitioners'
claim that their removal decision was based upon constitutionally valid concerns. But that evidence, at most,
creates a genuine issue of material fact on the critical question of the credibility of petitioners' justifications for
their decision: on that issue, it simply cannot be said that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.

The mandate shall issue forthwith.

Affirmed.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR, dissenting.

If the school board can set the curriculum, select teachers, and determine initially what books to purchase for
the school library, it surely can decide which books to discontinue or remove from the school library, so long as
it does not also interfere with the right of students to read the material and to discuss it. As JUSTICE REHN-
QUIST persuasively argues, the plurality's analysis overlooks the fact that, in this case, the government is acting
in its special role as educator.

I do not personally agree with the Board's action with respect to some of the books in question here, but it is
not the function of the courts to make the decisions that have been properly relegated to the elected members of
school boards. It is the school board that must determine educational suitability, and it has done so in this case.
I therefore join THE CHIEF JUSTICE's dissent.

Chief Justice Burger delivered the opinion of the Court.

We granted certiorari to decide whether the First Amendment prevents a school district from disciplining a high
school student for giving a lewd speech at a school assembly.

On April 26, 1983, respondent Matthew N. Fraser, a student at Bethel High School in Pierce County, Washing-
ton, delivered a speech nominating a fellow student for student elective office. Approximately 600 high school
students, many of whom were 14-year-olds, attended the assembly. Students were required to attend the assem-
bly or to report to the study hall. The assembly was part of a school-sponsored educational program in self-
government ... During the entire speech, Fraser referred to his candidate in terms of an elaborate, graphic, and
explicit sexual metaphor.

Two of Fraser's teachers, with whom he discussed the contents of his speech in advance, informed him that the
speech was "inappropriate and that he probably should not deliver it," and that his delivery of the speech might
have "severe consequences."

During Fraser's delivery of the speech, a school counselor observed the reaction of students to the speech. Some
students hooted and yelled; some by gestures graphically simulated the sexual activities pointedly alluded to in
respondent's speech. Other students appeared to be bewildered and embarrassed by the speech. One teacher
reported that, on the day following the speech, she found it necessary to forgo a portion of the scheduled class
lesson in order to discuss the speech with the class. A Bethel High School disciplinary rule prohibiting the use of
obscene language in the school provides:

"Conduct which materially and substantially interferes with the educational process is prohibited, including the
use of obscene, profane language or gestures."

The morning after the assembly, the Assistant Principal called Fraser into her office and notified him that the
school considered his speech to have been a violation of this rule. Fraser was presented with copies of five letters
submitted by teachers, describing his conduct at the assembly; he was given a chance to explain his conduct and
                                                                                                                        STUDENT SPEECH | 457

he admitted to having given the speech described and that he deliberately used sexual innuendo in the speech.
Fraser was then informed that he would be suspended for three days, and that his name would be removed from
the list of candidates for graduation speaker at the school's commencement exercises.

Fraser sought review of this disciplinary action through the School District's grievance procedures. The hearing
officer determined that the speech given by respondent was "indecent, lewd, and offensive to the modesty and
decency of many of the students and faculty in attendance at the assembly." The examiner determined that the
speech fell within the ordinary meaning of "obscene," as used in the disruptive conduct rule, and affirmed the
discipline in its entirety. Fraser served two days of his suspension, and was allowed to return to school on the
third day.

Respondent, by his father as guardian ad litem, then brought this action in the United States District Court
for the Western District of Washington. Respondent alleged a violation of his First Amendment right to free-
dom of speech, and sought both injunctive relief and monetary damages ... The District Court held that the
school's sanctions violated respondent's right to freedom of speech under the First Amendment to the United
States Constitution, that the school's disruptive conduct rule is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, and
that the removal of respondent's name from the graduation speaker's list violated the Due Process Clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment because the disciplinary rule makes no mention of such removal as a possible sanc-
tion. The District Court awarded respondent $278 in damages, $12,750 in litigation costs and attorney's fees,
and enjoined the School District from preventing respondent from speaking at the commencement ceremonies.
Respondent, who had been elected graduation speaker by a write-in vote of his classmates, delivered a speech at
the commencement ceremonies on June 8, 1983.

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the judgment of the District Court, holding that respon-
dent's speech was indistinguishable from the protest armband in Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community
School Dist. (1969) ...

We granted certiorari. We reverse.

This Court acknowledged in Tinker that students do not "shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech
or expression at the schoolhouse gate." The Court of Appeals read that case as precluding any discipline of Fraser
for indecent speech and lewd conduct in the school assembly. That court appears to have proceeded on the the-
ory that the use of lewd and obscene speech in order to make what the speaker considered to be a point in a
nominating speech for a fellow student was essentially the same as the wearing of an armband in Tinker as a form
of protest or the expression of a political position.

The marked distinction between the political "message" of the armbands in Tinker and the sexual content of
respondent's speech in this case seems to have been given little weight by the Court of Appeals. In upholding the
students' right to engage in a nondisruptive, passive expression of a political viewpoint in Tinker, this Court was
careful to note that the case did "not concern speech or action that intrudes upon the work of the schools or the
rights of other students." ...

The role and purpose of the American public school system were well described by two historians, who stated:
458 | STUDENT SPEECH

"[P]ublic education must prepare pupils for citizenship in the Republic. ... It must inculcate the habits and man-
ners of civility as values in themselves conducive to happiness and as indispensable to the practice of self-govern-
ment in the community and the nation."

C. Beard & M. Beard, New Basic History of the United States 228 (1968). ...

These fundamental values of "habits and manners of civility" essential to a democratic society must, of course,
include tolerance of divergent political and religious views, even when the views expressed may be unpopular.
But these "fundamental values" must also take into account consideration of the sensibilities of others, and, in
the case of a school, the sensibilities of fellow students. The undoubted freedom to advocate unpopular and
controversial views in schools and classrooms must be balanced against the society's countervailing interest in
teaching students the boundaries of socially appropriate behavior. Even the most heated political discourse in a
democratic society requires consideration for the personal sensibilities of the other participants and audiences ...

The First Amendment guarantees wide freedom in matters of adult public discourse ... It does not follow, how-
ever, that, simply because the use of an offensive form of expression may not be prohibited to adults making
what the speaker considers a political point, the same latitude must be permitted to children in a public school ...
As cogently expressed by Judge Newman, "the First Amendment gives a high school student the classroom right
to wear Tinker's armband, but not Cohen's jacket." Thomas v. Board of Education, Granville Central School
Dist., (1979) (opinion concurring in result).

... The determination of what manner of speech in the classroom or in school assembly is inappropriate properly
rests with the school board.

The process of educating our youth for citizenship in public schools is not confined to books, the curriculum,
and the civics class; schools must teach by example the shared values of a civilized social order. Consciously or
otherwise, teachers -- and indeed the older students -- demonstrate the appropriate form of civil discourse and
political expression by their conduct and deportment in and out of class. Inescapably, like parents, they are role
models. The schools, as instruments of the state, may determine that the essential lessons of civil, mature con-
duct cannot be conveyed in a school that tolerates lewd, indecent, or offensive speech and conduct such as that
indulged in by this confused boy.

The pervasive sexual innuendo in Fraser's speech was plainly offensive to both teachers and students -- indeed,
to any mature person. By glorifying male sexuality, and in its verbal content, the speech was acutely insulting to
teenage girl students. The speech could well be seriously damaging to its less mature audience, many of whom
were only 14 years old and on the threshold of awareness of human sexuality. Some students were reported as
bewildered by the speech and the reaction of mimicry it provoked.

This Court's First Amendment jurisprudence has acknowledged limitations on the otherwise absolute interest
of the speaker in reaching an unlimited audience where the speech is sexually explicit and the audience may
include children. Ginsberg v. New York, (1968).
                                                                                                                        STUDENT SPEECH | 459

We have also recognized an interest in protecting minors from exposure to vulgar and offensive spoken language
...

We hold that petitioner School District acted entirely within its permissible authority in imposing sanctions
upon Fraser in response to his offensively lewd and indecent speech. Unlike the sanctions imposed on the stu-
dents wearing armbands in Tinker, the penalties imposed in this case were unrelated to any political viewpoint.
The First Amendment does not prevent the school officials from determining that to permit a vulgar and lewd
speech such as respondent's would undermine the school's basic educational mission. A high school assembly
or classroom is no place for a sexually explicit monologue directed towards an unsuspecting audience of teenage
students. Accordingly, it was perfectly appropriate for the school to disassociate itself to make the point to the
pupils that vulgar speech and lewd conduct is wholly inconsistent with the "fundamental values" of public
school education ...

Respondent contends that the circumstances of his suspension violated due process because he had no way of
knowing that the delivery of the speech in question would subject him to disciplinary sanctions. This argument
is wholly without merit ...

The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is

Reversed.

Justice Brennan, concurring in the judgment.

... Having read the full text of respondent's remarks, I find it difficult to believe that it is the same speech the
Court describes. To my mind, the most that can be said about respondent's speech -- and all that need be said
-- is that, in light of the discretion school officials have to teach high school students how to conduct civil and
effective public discourse, and to prevent disruption of school educational activities, it was not unconstitutional
for school officials to conclude, under the circumstances of this case, that respondent's remarks exceeded permis-
sible limits. Thus, while I concur in the Court's judgment, I write separately to express my understanding of the
breadth of the Court's holding.

... If respondent had given the same speech outside of the school environment, he could not have been penalized
simply because government officials considered his language to be inappropriate. Moreover, despite the Court's
characterizations, the language respondent used is far removed from the very narrow class of "obscene" speech
which the Court has held is not protected by the First Amendment. It is true, however, that the State has inter-
ests in teaching high school students how to conduct civil and effective public discourse and in avoiding dis-
ruption of educational school activities. Thus, the Court holds that, under certain circumstances, high school
students may properly be reprimanded for giving a speech at a high school assembly which school officials con-
clude disrupted the school's educational mission. Respondent's speech may well have been protected had he
given it in school but under different circumstances, where the school's legitimate interests in teaching and main-
taining civil public discourse were less weighty.
§460 | STUDENT SPEECH

In the present case, school officials sought only to ensure that a high school assembly proceed in an orderly man-
ner. There is no suggestion that school officials attempted to regulate respondent's speech because they disagreed
with the views he sought to express ...

... Thus, I concur in the judgment reversing the decision of the Court of Appeals.

Justice Marshall, dissenting.

I agree with the principles that Justice Brennan sets out in his opinion concurring in the judgment. I dissent
from the Court's decision, however, because, in my view, the School District failed to demonstrate that respon-
dent's remarks were indeed disruptive. The District Court and Court of Appeals conscientiously applied Tinker
v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist., (1969) and concluded that the School District had not
demonstrated any disruption of the educational process. I recognize that the school administration must be
given wide latitude to determine what forms of conduct are inconsistent with the school's educational mission;
nevertheless, where speech is involved, we may not unquestioningly accept a teacher's or administrator's asser-
tion that certain pure speech interfered with education. Here the School District, despite a clear opportunity to
do so, failed to bring in evidence sufficient to convince either of the two lower courts that education at Bethel
School was disrupted by respondent's speech. I therefore see no reason to disturb the Court of Appeals' judg-
ment.

... I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

Justice White delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case concerns the extent to which educators may exercise editorial control over the contents of a high school
newspaper produced as part of the school's journalism curriculum.
                                                                                                                        STUDENT SPEECH | 461

Petitioners are the Hazelwood School District in St. Louis County, Missouri; various school officials; Robert
Eugene Reynolds, the principal of Hazelwood East High School; and Howard Emerson, a teacher in the school
district. Respondents are three former Hazelwood East students who were staff members of Spectrum, the
school newspaper. They contend that school officials violated their First Amendment rights by deleting two
pages of articles from the May 13, 1983, issue of Spectrum.

Spectrum was written and edited by the Journalism II class at Hazelwood East. The newspaper was published
every three weeks or so during the 1982-1983 school year. More than 4,500 copies of the newspaper were dis-
tributed during that year to students, school personnel, and members of the community.

... The Journalism II course was taught by Robert Stergos for most of the 1982-1983 academic year. Stergos left
Hazelwood East to take a job in private industry on April 29, 1983, when the May 13 edition of Spectrum was
nearing completion, and petitioner Emerson took his place as newspaper adviser for the remaining weeks of the
term.

The practice at Hazelwood East during the spring 1983 semester was for the journalism teacher to submit page
proofs of each Spectrum issue to Principal Reynolds for his review prior to publication. On May 10, Emerson
delivered the proofs of the May 13 edition to Reynolds, who objected to two of the articles scheduled to appear
in that edition. One of the stories described three Hazelwood East students' experiences with pregnancy; the
other discussed the impact of divorce on students at the school.

Reynolds was concerned that, although the pregnancy story used false names "to keep the identity of these girls
a secret," the pregnant students still might be identifiable from the text. He also believed that the article's refer-
ences to sexual activity and birth control were inappropriate for some of the younger students at the school. In
addition, Reynolds was concerned that a student identified by name in the divorce story had complained that
her father "wasn't spending enough time with my mom, my sister and I" prior to the divorce, "was always out
of town on business or out late playing cards with the guys," and "always argued about everything" with her
mother. Reynolds believed that the student's parents should have been given an opportunity to respond to these
remarks or to consent to their publication. He was unaware that Emerson had deleted the student's name from
the final version of the article.

Reynolds believed that there was no time to make the necessary changes in the stories before the scheduled press
run and that the newspaper would not appear before the end of the school year if printing were delayed to
any significant extent. He concluded that his only options under the circumstances were to publish a four-page
newspaper instead of the planned six-page newspaper, eliminating the two pages on which the offending stories
appeared, or to publish no newspaper at all. Accordingly, he directed Emerson to withhold from publication the
two pages containing the stories on pregnancy and divorce. He informed his superiors of the decision, and they
concurred.

Respondents subsequently commenced this action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District
of Missouri seeking a declaration that their First Amendment rights had been violated, injunctive relief, and
monetary damages. After a bench trial, the District Court denied an injunction, holding that no First Amend-
ment violation had occurred ... The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed ...
462 | STUDENT SPEECH

We granted certiorari and we now reverse.

... We have nonetheless recognized that the First Amendment rights of students in the public schools "are not
automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings," Bethel School District No. 403 v. Fraser
(1986) and must be "applied in light of the special characteristics of the school environment." Tinker. A school
need not tolerate student speech that is inconsistent with its "basic educational mission," Fraser, even though
the government could not censor similar speech outside the school ... It is in this context that respondents' First
Amendment claims must be considered.

We deal first with the question whether Spectrum may appropriately be characterized as a forum for public
expression. The public schools do not possess all of the attributes of streets, parks, and other traditional public
forums that "time out of mind, have been used for purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between citi-
zens, and discussing public questions." Hague v. CIO (1939). Hence, school facilities may be deemed to be pub-
lic forums only if school authorities have "by policy or by practice" opened those facilities "for indiscriminate
use by the general public," Perry Education Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn. (1983), or by some segment of
the public, such as student organizations. Id ... School officials did not evince either "by policy or by practice"
any intent to open the pages of Spectrum to "indiscriminate use," by its student reporters and editors, or by the
student body generally. Instead, they "reserve[d] the forum for its intended purpos[e]," as a supervised learning
experience for journalism students. Accordingly, school officials were entitled to regulate the contents of Spec-
trum in any reasonable manner. It is this standard, rather than our decision in Tinker, that governs this case.

The question whether the First Amendment requires a school to tolerate particular student speech - the ques-
tion that we addressed in Tinker- is different from the question whether the First Amendment requires a school
affirmatively to promote particular student speech ... The latter question concerns educators' authority over
school-sponsored publications, theatrical productions, and other expressive activities that students, parents, and
members of the public might reasonably perceive to bear the imprimatur of the school. These activities may
fairly be characterized as part of the school curriculum, whether or not they occur in a traditional classroom set-
ting, so long as they are supervised by faculty members and designed to impart particular knowledge or skills to
student participants and audiences.

Educators are entitled to exercise greater control over this second form of student expression to assure that par-
ticipants learn whatever lessons the activity is designed to teach, that readers or listeners are not exposed to mate-
rial that may be inappropriate for their level of maturity, and that the views of the individual speaker are not
erroneously attributed to the school ... A school must be able to set high standards for the student speech that is
disseminated under its auspices - standards that may be higher than those demanded by some newspaper pub-
lishers or theatrical producers in the "real" world - and may refuse to disseminate student speech that does not
meet those standards. In addition, a school must be able to take into account the emotional maturity of the
intended audience in determining whether to disseminate student speech on potentially sensitive topics, which
might range from the existence of Santa Claus in an elementary school setting to the particulars of teenage sexual
activity in a high school setting. A school must also retain the authority to refuse to sponsor student speech that
might reasonably be perceived to advocate drug or alcohol use, irresponsible sex, or conduct otherwise inconsis-
tent with "the shared values of a civilized social order," Fraser, or to associate the school with any position other
                                                                                                                        STUDENT SPEECH | 463

than neutrality on matters of political controversy. Otherwise, the schools would be unduly constrained from
fulfilling their role as "a principal instrument in awakening the child to cultural values, in preparing him for later
professional training, and in helping him to adjust normally to his environment." Brown v. Board of Education
(1954).

... [W]e hold that educators do not offend the First Amendment by exercising editorial control over the style and
content of student speech in school-sponsored expressive activities so long as their actions are reasonably related
to legitimate pedagogical concerns.

This standard is consistent with our oft-expressed view that the education of the Nation's youth is primarily
the responsibility of parents, teachers, and state and local school officials, and not of federal judges. It is only
when the decision to censor a school-sponsored publication, theatrical production, or other vehicle of student
expression has no valid educational purpose that the First Amendment is so "directly and sharply implicate as to
require judicial intervention to protect students' constitutional rights.

We also conclude that Principal Reynolds acted reasonably in requiring the deletion from the May 13 issue of
Spectrum of the pregnancy article, the divorce article, and the remaining articles that were to appear on the same
pages of the newspaper.

The initial paragraph of the pregnancy article declared that "[a]ll names have been changed to keep the identity
of these girls a secret." ... Indeed, a teacher at the school credibly testified that she could positively identify at least
one of the girls and possibly all three. It is likely that many students at Hazelwood East would have been at least
as successful in identifying the girls. Reynolds therefore could reasonably have feared that the article violated
whatever pledge of anonymity had been given to the pregnant students. In addition, he could reasonably have
been concerned that the article was not sufficiently sensitive to the privacy interests of the students' boyfriends
and parents, who were discussed in the article but who were given no opportunity to consent to its publication
or to offer a response. The article did not contain graphic accounts of sexual activity. The girls did comment in
the article, however, concerning their sexual histories and their use or nonuse of birth control. It was not unrea-
sonable for the principal to have concluded that such frank talk was inappropriate in a school-sponsored pub-
lication distributed to 14-year-old freshmen and presumably taken home to be read by students' even younger
brothers and sisters.

The student who was quoted by name in the version of the divorce article seen by Principal Reynolds made com-
ments sharply critical of her father. The principal could reasonably have concluded that an individual publicly
identified as an inattentive parent - indeed, as one who chose "playing cards with the guys" over home and fam-
ily - was entitled to an opportunity to defend himself as a matter of journalistic fairness. These concerns were
shared by both of Spectrum's faculty advisers for the 1982-1983 school year, who testified that they would not
have allowed the article to be printed without deletion of the student's name.

... It is true that Reynolds did not verify whether the necessary modifications could still have been made in the
articles, and that Emerson did not volunteer the information that printing could be delayed until the changes
were made. We nonetheless agree with the District Court that the decision to excise the two pages containing the
problematic articles was reasonable given the particular circumstances of this case. These circumstances included
464 | STUDENT SPEECH

the very recent replacement of Stergos by Emerson, who may not have been entirely familiar with Spectrum edi-
torial and production procedures, and the pressure felt by Reynolds to make an immediate decision so that stu-
dents would not be deprived of the newspaper altogether.

... Finally, we conclude that the principal's decision to delete two pages of Spectrum, rather than to delete only
the offending articles or to require that they be modified, was reasonable under the circumstances as he under-
stood them. Accordingly, no violation of First Amendment rights occurred.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit is therefore

Reversed.

Justice Brennan, with whom Justice Marshall and Justice Blackmun join, dissenting.

When the young men and women of Hazelwood East High School registered for Journalism II, they expected
a civics lesson. Spectrum, the newspaper they were to publish, "was not just a class exercise in which students
learned to prepare papers and hone writing skills, it was a ... forum established to give students an opportunity
to express their views while gaining an appreciation of their rights and responsibilities under the First Amend-
ment to the United States Constitution. ..." "[A]t the beginning of each school year," the student journalists
published a Statement of Policy - tacitly approved each year by school authorities - announcing their expecta-
tion that "Spectrum, as a student-press publication, accepts all rights implied by the First Amendment. ... Only
speech that `materially and substantially interferes with the requirements of appropriate discipline' can be found
unacceptable and therefore prohibited." The school board itself affirmatively guaranteed the students of Jour-
nalism II an atmosphere conducive to fostering such an appreciation and exercising the full panoply of rights
associated with a free student press. "School sponsored student publications," it vowed, "will not restrict free
expression or diverse viewpoints within the rules of responsible journalism."

... In my view the principal broke more than just a promise. He violated the First Amendment's prohibitions
against censorship of any student expression that neither disrupts classwork nor invades the rights of others, and
against any censorship that is not narrowly tailored to serve its purpose.

... [The Court has never suggested] the distinction, which the Court today finds dispositive, between school-
sponsored and incidental student expression.

Even if we were writing on a clean slate, I would reject the Court's rationale for abandoning Tinker in this
case. The Court offers no more than an obscure tangle of three excuses to afford educators "greater control"
over school-sponsored speech than the Tinker test would permit: the public educator's prerogative to control
curriculum; the pedagogical interest in shielding the high school audience from objectionable viewpoints and
sensitive topics; and the school's need to dissociate itself from student expression. None of the excuses, once dis-
entangled, supports the distinction that the Court draws. Tinker fully addresses the first concern; the second is
illegitimate; and the third is readily achievable through less oppressive means ...

Since the censorship served no legitimate pedagogical purpose, it cannot by any stretch of the imagination have
been designed to prevent "materia[l] disrup[tion of] classwork," Tinker. Nor did the censorship fall within the
                                                                                                                        STUDENT SPEECH | 465

category that Tinker described as necessary to prevent student expression from "inva[ding] the rights of others."
If that term is to have any content, it must be limited to rights that are protected by law."Any yardstick less exact-
ing than [that] could result in school officials curtailing speech at the slightest fear of disturbance," a prospect
that would be completely at odds with this Court's pronouncement that the "undifferentiated fear or appre-
hension of disturbance is not enough [even in the public school context] to overcome the right to freedom of
expression." Tinker. And, as the Court of Appeals correctly reasoned, whatever journalistic impropriety these
articles may have contained, they could not conceivably be tortious, much less criminal.

Finally, even if the majority were correct that the principal could constitutionally have censored the objection-
able material, I would emphatically object to the brutal manner in which he did so. Where "[t]he separation
of legitimate from illegitimate speech calls for more sensitive tools," the principal used a paper shredder. He
objected to some material in two articles, but excised six entire articles. He did not so much as inquire into obvi-
ous alternatives, such as precise deletions or additions (one of which had already been made), rearranging the
layout, or delaying publication. Such unthinking contempt for individual rights is intolerable from any state
official. It is particularly insidious from one to whom the public entrusts the task of inculcating in its youth an
appreciation for the cherished democratic liberties that our Constitution guarantees.

... Instead of "teach[ing] children to respect the diversity of ideas that is fundamental to the American system,"
and "that our Constitution is a living reality, not parchment preserved under glass," the Court today "teach[es]
youth to discount important principles of our government as mere platitudes." West Virginia Board of Educa­
tion v. Barnette (1943). The young men and women of Hazelwood East expected a civics lesson, but not the one
the Court teaches them today.

I dissent.

466 | STUDENT SPEECH

Morse v. Frederick

551 U.S. 393 (2007)

    Vote: 5-4
    Decision: Reversed

Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court.

At a school-sanctioned and school-supervised event, a high school principal saw some of her students unfurl a
large banner conveying a message she reasonably regarded as promoting illegal drug use. Consistent with estab-
lished school policy prohibiting such messages at school events, the principal directed the students to take down
the banner. One student-among those who had brought the banner to the event-refused to do so. The princi-
pal confiscated the banner and later suspended the student. The Ninth Circuit held that the principal's actions
violated the First Amendment, and that the student could sue the principal for damages.

... We conclude that the school officials in this case did not violate the First Amendment by confiscating the pro-
drug banner and suspending the student responsible for it.

On January 24, 2002, the Olympic Torch Relay passed through Juneau, Alaska, on its way to the winter games
in Salt Lake City, Utah. The torchbearers were to proceed along a street in front of Juneau-Douglas High School
(JDHS) while school was in session. Petitioner Deborah Morse, the school principal, decided to permit staff and
students to participate in the Torch Relay as an approved social event or class trip. Students were allowed to leave
class to observe the relay from either side of the street. Teachers and administrative officials monitored the stu-
dents' actions.

Respondent Joseph Frederick, a JDHS senior, was late to school that day. When he arrived, he joined his friends
(all but one of whom were JDHS students) across the street from the school to watch the event. Not all the
students waited patiently. Some became rambunctious, throwing plastic cola bottles and snowballs and scuf-
fling with their classmates. As the torchbearers and camera crews passed by, Frederick and his friends unfurled
a 14-foot banner bearing the phrase: "BONG HiTS 4 JESUS." The large banner was easily readable by the stu-
dents on the other side of the street.

Principal Morse immediately crossed the street and demanded that the banner be taken down. Everyone but
Frederick complied. Morse confiscated the banner and told Frederick to report to her office, where she sus-
pended him for 10 days. Morse later explained that she told Frederick to take the banner down because she
thought it encouraged illegal drug use, in violation of established school policy. Juneau School Board Policy No.
                                                                                                                        STUDENT SPEECH | 467

5520 states: "The Board specifically prohibits any assembly or public expression that ... advocates the use of sub-
stances that are illegal to minors. ..." In addition, Juneau School Board Policy No. 5850 subjects "[p]upils who
participate in approved social events and class trips" to the same student conduct rules that apply during the reg-
ular school program.

Frederick administratively appealed his suspension, but the Juneau School District Superintendent upheld it,
limiting it to time served (8 days). In a memorandum setting forth his reasons, the superintendent determined
that Frederick had displayed his banner "in the midst of his fellow students, during school hours, at a school-
sanctioned activity." He further explained that Frederick "was not disciplined because the principal of the school
`disagreed' with his message, but because his speech appeared to advocate the use of illegal drugs." The superin-
tendent continued:

"The common-sense understanding of the phrase `bong hits' is that it is a reference to a means of smoking mar-
ijuana. Given [Frederick's] inability or unwillingness to express any other credible meaning for the phrase, I can
only agree with the principal and countless others who saw the banner as advocating the use of illegal drugs.
[Frederick's] speech was not political. He was not advocating the legalization of marijuana or promoting a reli-
gious belief. He was displaying a fairly silly message promoting illegal drug usage in the midst of a school activity,
for the benefit of television cameras covering the Torch Relay. [Frederick's] speech was potentially disruptive to
the event and clearly disruptive of and inconsistent with the school's educational mission to educate students
about the dangers of illegal drugs and to discourage their use."

Relying on our decision in Fraser, the superintendent concluded that the principal's actions were permissible
because Frederick's banner was "speech or action that intrudes upon the work of the schools." The Juneau
School District Board of Education upheld the suspension.

Frederick then filed suit ... alleging that the school board and Morse had violated his First Amendment rights.
He sought declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified compensatory damages, punitive damages, and attor-
ney's fees. The District Court granted summary judgment for the school board and Morse, ruling that they were
entitled to qualified immunity and that they had not infringed Frederick's First Amendment rights ...

The Ninth Circuit reversed. Deciding that Frederick acted during a "school-authorized activit[y]," and "pro-
ceed[ing] on the basis that the banner expressed a positive sentiment about marijuana use," the court nonetheless
found a violation of Frederick's First Amendment rights because the school punished Frederick without demon-
strating that his speech gave rise to a "risk of substantial disruption." ...

We granted certiorari on two questions: whether Frederick had a First Amendment right to wield his banner,
and, if so, whether that right was so clearly established that the principal may be held liable for damages. We
resolve the first question against Frederick, and therefore have no occasion to reach the second.

At the outset, we reject Frederick's argument that this is not a school speech case-as has every other authority to
address the question. The event occurred during normal school hours. It was sanctioned by Principal Morse "as
an approved social event or class trip," and the school district's rules expressly provide that pupils in "approved
social events and class trips are subject to district rules for student conduct." Teachers and administrators were
468 | STUDENT SPEECH

interspersed among the students and charged with supervising them. The high school band and cheerleaders per-
formed. Frederick, standing among other JDHS students across the street from the school, directed his banner
toward the school, making it plainly visible to most students ... There is some uncertainty at the outer bound-
aries as to when courts should apply school-speech precedents, but not on these facts.

The message on Frederick's banner is cryptic. It is no doubt offensive to some, perhaps amusing to others. To
still others, it probably means nothing at all. Frederick himself claimed "that the words were just nonsense meant
to attract television cameras." But Principal Morse thought the banner would be interpreted by those viewing it
as promoting illegal drug use, and that interpretation is plainly a reasonable one.

... We agree with Morse. At least two interpretations of the words on the banner demonstrate that the sign advo-
cated the use of illegal drugs. First, the phrase could be interpreted as an imperative: "[Take] bong hits ..."-a
message equivalent, as Morse explained in her declaration, to "smoke marijuana" or "use an illegal drug." Alter-
natively, the phrase could be viewed as celebrating drug use-"bong hits [are a good thing]," or "[we take] bong
hits"-and we discern no meaningful distinction between celebrating illegal drug use in the midst of fellow stu-
dents and outright advocacy or promotion.

The pro-drug interpretation of the banner gains further plausibility given the paucity of alternative meanings
the banner might bear. The best Frederick can come up with is that the banner is "meaningless and funny." The
dissent similarly refers to the sign's message as "curious," "ambiguous," "nonsense," "ridiculous," "obscure,"
"silly," "quixotic," and "stupid." Gibberish is surely a possible interpretation of the words on the banner, but it
is not the only one, and dismissing the banner as meaningless ignores its undeniable reference to illegal drugs.

... Elsewhere in its opinion, the dissent emphasizes the importance of political speech and the need to foster
"national debate about a serious issue," as if to suggest that the banner is political speech. But not even Frederick
argues that the banner conveys any sort of political or religious message. Contrary to the dissent's suggestion,
this is plainly not a case about political debate over the criminalization of drug use or possession.

The question thus becomes whether a principal may, consistent with the First Amendment, restrict student
speech at a school event, when that speech is reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use. We hold that she
may.

...

... The essential facts of Tinker are quite stark, implicating concerns at the heart of the First Amendment. The
students sought to engage in political speech, using the armbands to express their "disapproval of the Vietnam
hostilities and their advocacy of a truce, to make their views known, and, by their example, to influence oth-
ers to adopt them." Political speech, of course, is "at the core of what the First Amendment is designed to pro-
tect." Virginia v. Black (2003). The only interest the Court discerned underlying the school's actions was the
"mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint," or
"an urgent wish to avoid the controversy which might result from the expression." Tinker.
                                                                                                                        STUDENT SPEECH | 469

... For present purposes, it is enough to distill from Fraser two basic principles. First, Fraser's holding demon-
strates that "the constitutional rights of students in public school are not automatically coextensive with the
rights of adults in other settings." Had Fraser delivered the same speech in a public forum outside the school
context, it would have been protected. Cohen v. California, (1971). Second, Fraser established that the mode of
analysis set forth in Tinker is not absolute. Whatever approach Fraser employed, it certainly did not conduct the
"substantial disruption" analysis prescribed by Tinker ...

...

... The "special characteristics of the school environment," and the governmental interest in stopping student
drug abuse-reflected in the policies of Congress and myriad school boards, including JDHS-allow schools to
restrict student expression that they reasonably regard as promoting illegal drug use. Tinker warned that schools
may not prohibit student speech because of "undifferentiated fear or apprehension of disturbance" ... The dan-
ger here is far more serious and palpable. The particular concern to prevent student drug abuse at issue here,
embodied in established school policy, extends well beyond an abstract desire to avoid controversy.

Petitioners urge us to adopt the broader rule that Frederick's speech is proscribable because it is plainly "offen-
sive" ... We think this stretches Fraser too far; that case should not be read to encompass any speech that could fit
under some definition of "offensive." After all, much political and religious speech might be perceived as offen-
sive to some. The concern here is not that Frederick's speech was offensive, but that it was reasonably viewed as
promoting illegal drug use.

Although accusing this decision of doing "serious violence to the First Amendment" by authorizing "viewpoint
discrimination," the dissent concludes that "it might well be appropriate to tolerate some targeted viewpoint
discrimination in this unique setting." Nor do we understand the dissent to take the position that schools are
required to tolerate student advocacy of illegal drug use at school events, even if that advocacy falls short of invit-
ing "imminent" lawless action. And even the dissent recognizes that the issues here are close enough that the
principal should not be held liable in damages, but should instead enjoy qualified immunity for her actions.
Stripped of rhetorical flourishes, then, the debate between the dissent and this opinion is less about constitu-
tional first principles than about whether Frederick's banner constitutes promotion of illegal drug use. We have
explained our view that it does. The dissent's contrary view on that relatively narrow question hardly justifies
sounding the First Amendment bugle.

School principals have a difficult job, and a vitally important one. When Frederick suddenly and unexpectedly
unfurled his banner, Morse had to decide to act-or not act-on the spot. It was reasonable for her to conclude
that the banner promoted illegal drug use-in violation of established school policy-and that failing to act would
send a powerful message to the students in her charge, including Frederick, about how serious the school was
about the dangers of illegal drug use. The First Amendment does not require schools to tolerate at school events
student expression that contributes to those dangers.

The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded
for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
470 | STUDENT SPEECH

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

... I agree with the Court that the principal should not be held liable for pulling down Frederick's banner. I
would hold, however, that the school's interest in protecting its students from exposure to speech "reasonably
regarded as promoting illegal drug use," cannot justify disciplining Frederick for his attempt to make an ambigu-
ous statement to a television audience simply because it contained an oblique reference to drugs. The First
Amendment demands more, indeed, much more.

The Court holds otherwise only after laboring to establish two uncontroversial propositions: first, that the con-
stitutional rights of students in school settings are not coextensive with the rights of adults, and second, that
deterring drug use by schoolchildren is a valid and terribly important interest. As to the first, I take the Court's
point that the message on Frederick's banner is not necessarily protected speech, even though it unquestionably
would have been had the banner been unfurled elsewhere. As to the second, I am willing to assume that the
Court is correct that the pressing need to deter drug use supports JDHS's rule prohibiting willful conduct that
expressly "advocates the use of substances that are illegal to minors." But it is a gross non sequitur to draw from
these two unremarkable propositions the remarkable conclusion that the school may suppress student speech
that was never meant to persuade anyone to do anything.

In my judgment, the First Amendment protects student speech if the message itself neither violates a permissible
rule nor expressly advocates conduct that is illegal and harmful to students. This nonsense banner does neither,
and the Court does serious violence to the First Amendment in upholding-indeed, lauding-a school's decision
to punish Frederick for expressing a view with which it disagreed.

...

... Even if advocacy could somehow be wedged into Frederick's obtuse reference to marijuana, that advocacy was
at best subtle and ambiguous ...

Among other things, the Court's ham-handed, categorical approach is deaf to the constitutional imperative to
permit unfettered debate, even among high-school students, about the wisdom of the war on drugs or of legaliz-
ing marijuana for medicinal use ...

Consider, too, that the school district's rule draws no distinction between alcohol and marijuana, but applies
evenhandedly to all "substances that are illegal to minors." Given the tragic consequences of teenage alcohol con-
sumption-drinking causes far more fatal accidents than the misuse of marijuana-the school district's interest in
deterring teenage alcohol use is at least comparable to its interest in preventing marijuana use. Under the Court's
reasoning, must the First Amendment give way whenever a school seeks to punish a student for any speech men-
tioning beer, or indeed anything else that might be deemed risky to teenagers? While I find it hard to believe the
Court would support punishing Frederick for flying a "WINE SiPS 4 JESUS" banner-which could quite rea-
sonably be construed either as a protected religious message or as a pro-alcohol message-the breathtaking sweep
of its opinion suggests it would.
§                                                                                                                        STUDENT SPEECH | 471

Although this case began with a silly, nonsensical banner, it ends with the Court inventing out of whole cloth
a special First Amendment rule permitting the censorship of any student speech that mentions drugs, at least
so long as someone could perceive that speech to contain a latent pro-drug message ... In the national debate
about a serious issue, it is the expression of the minority's viewpoint that most demands the protection of the
First Amendment. Whatever the better policy may be, a full and frank discussion of the costs and benefits of the
attempt to prohibit the use of marijuana is far wiser than suppression of speech because it is unpopular.

I respectfully dissent.

Mahanoy Area School District v. B.L.

594 U.S. ___ (2021)

    Vote: 8-1
    Decision: Affirmed
    Majority: Breyer, joined by Roberts, Alito, Sotomayor, Kagan, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Barrett
    Concurrence: Alito, joined by Gorsuch
    Dissent: Thomas

Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.

A public high school student used, and transmitted to her Snapchat friends, vulgar language and gestures crit-
icizing both the school and the school's cheerleading team. The student's speech took place outside of school
hours and away from the school's campus. In response, the school suspended the student for a year from the
cheerleading team. We must decide whether the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit correctly held that the
school's decision violated the First Amendment. Although we do not agree with the reasoning of the Third
Circuit panel's majority, we do agree with its conclusion that the school's disciplinary action violated the First
Amendment.

B. L. (who, together with her parents, is a respondent in this case) was a student at Mahanoy Area High School,
a public school in Mahanoy City, Pennsylvania. At the end of her freshman year, B. L. tried out for a position
on the school's varsity cheerleading squad and for right fielder on a private softball team. She did not make the
varsity cheerleading team or get her preferred softball position, but she was offered a spot on the cheerleading
squad's junior varsity team. B. L. did not accept the coach's decision with good grace, particularly because the
squad coaches had placed an entering freshman on the varsity team.
472 | STUDENT SPEECH

That weekend, B. L. and a friend visited the Cocoa Hut, a local convenience store. There, B. L. used her smart-
phone to post two photos on Snapchat, a social media application that allows users to post photos and videos
that disappear after a set period of time. B. L. posted the images to her Snapchat "story," a feature of the appli-
cation that allows any person in the user's "friend" group (B. L. had about 250 "friends") to view the images for
a 24 hour period.

The first image B. L. posted showed B. L. and a friend with middle fingers raised; it bore the caption: "Fuck
school fuck softball fuck cheer fuck everything." ... The second image was blank but for a caption, which read:
"Love how me and [another student] get told we need a year of jv before we make varsity but tha[t] doesn't mat-
ter to anyone else?" The caption also contained an upside-down smiley-face emoji.

B.L.'s Snapchat "friends" included other Mahanoy Area High School students, some of whom also belonged to
the cheerleading squad. At least one of them, using a separate cellphone, took pictures of B. L.'s posts and shared
them with other members of the cheerleading squad. One of the students who received these photos showed
them to her mother (who was a cheerleading squad coach), and the images spread. That week, several cheerlead-
ers and other students approached the cheerleading coaches "visibly upset" about B. L.'s posts. Questions about
the posts persisted during an Algebra class taught by one of the two coaches.

After discussing the matter with the school principal, the coaches decided that because the posts used profanity
in connection with a school extracurricular activity, they violated team and school rules. As a result, the coaches
suspended B. L. from the junior varsity cheerleading squad for the upcoming year. B. L.'s subsequent apolo-
gies did not move school officials. The school's athletic director, principal, superintendent, and school board,
all affirmed B. L.'s suspension from the team. In response, B. L., together with her parents, filed this lawsuit in
Federal District Court.

The District Court found in B. L.'s favor. It first granted a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunc-
tion ordering the school to reinstate B. L. to the cheerleading team. In granting B. L.'s subsequent motion for
summary judgment, the District Court found that B. L.'s Snapchats had not caused substantial disruption at
the school ... Consequently, the District Court declared that B. L.'s punishment violated the First Amendment,
and it awarded B. L. nominal damages and attorneys' fees and ordered the school to expunge her disciplinary
record.

On appeal, a panel of the Third Circuit affirmed the District Court's conclusion ... In so doing, the majority
noted that this Court had previously held in Tinker that a public high school could not constitutionally prohibit
a peaceful student political demonstration consisting of " `pure speech'" on school property during the school
day ... In reaching its conclusion in Tinker, this Court emphasized that there was no evidence the student protest
would "substantially interfere with the work of the school or impinge upon the rights of other students." But
the Court also said that: "[C]onduct by [a] student, in class or out of it, which for any reason--whether it stems
from time, place, or type of behavior--materially disrupts classwork or involves substantial disorder or invasion
of the rights of others is ... not immunized by the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech."

Many courts have taken this statement as setting a standard--a standard that allows schools considerable free-
dom on campus to discipline students for conduct that the First Amendment might otherwise protect. But here,
                                                                                                                        STUDENT SPEECH | 473

the panel majority held that this additional freedom did "not apply to off-campus speech," which it defined as
"speech that is outside school-owned, -operated, or -supervised channels and that is not reasonably interpreted
as bearing the school's imprimatur." ... Because B. L.'s speech took place off campus, the panel concluded that
the Tinker standard did not apply and the school consequently could not discipline B. L. for engaging in a form
of pure speech.

...

The school district filed a petition for certiorari in this Court, asking us to decide "[w]hether [Tinker], which
holds that public school officials may regulate speech that would materially and substantially disrupt the work
and discipline of the school, applies to student speech that occurs off campus." ... We granted the petition.

We have made clear that students do not "shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression,"
even "at the school house gate." Tinker. But we have also made clear that courts must apply the First Amend-
ment "in light of the special characteristics of the school environment." Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier, (1988). One
such characteristic, which we have stressed, is the fact that schools at times stand in loco parentis, i.e., in the place
of parents. Bethel School Dist. v. Fraser, (1986).

... Unlike the Third Circuit, we do not believe the special characteristics that give schools additional license
to regulate student speech always disappear when a school regulates speech that takes place off campus. The
school's regulatory interests remain significant in some off-campus circumstances. The parties' briefs, and those
of amici, list several types of off-campus behavior that may call for school regulation. These include serious or
severe bullying or harassment targeting particular individuals; threats aimed at teachers or other students; the
failure to follow rules concerning lessons, the writing of papers, the use of computers, or participation in other
online school activities; and breaches of school security devices, including material maintained within school
computers.

Even B. L. herself and the amici supporting her would redefine the Third Circuit's off-campus/on-campus dis-
tinction, treating as on campus: all times when the school is responsible for the student; the school's immediate
surroundings; travel en route to and from the school; all speech taking place over school laptops or on a school's
website; speech taking place during remote learning; activities taken for school credit; and communications to
school e-mail accounts or phones ... And it may be that speech related to extracurricular activities, such as team
sports, would also receive special treatment under B. L.'s proposed rule ...

We are uncertain as to the length or content of any such list of appropriate exceptions or carveouts to the Third
Circuit majority's rule. That rule, basically, if not entirely, would deny the off-campus applicability of Tin­
ker's highly general statement about the nature of a school's special interests. Particularly given the advent of
computer-based learning, we hesitate to determine precisely which of many school-related off-campus activities
belong on such a list. Neither do we now know how such a list might vary, depending upon a student's age, the
nature of the school's off-campus activity, or the impact upon the school itself. Thus, we do not now set forth
a broad, highly general First Amendment rule stating just what counts as "off campus" speech and whether or
how ordinary First Amendment standards must give way off campus to a school's special need to prevent, e.g.,
substantial disruption of learning-related activities or the protection of those who make up a school community.
474 | STUDENT SPEECH

We can, however, mention three features of off-campus speech that often, even if not always, distinguish schools'
efforts to regulate that speech from their efforts to regulate on-campus speech. Those features diminish the
strength of the unique educational characteristics that might call for special First Amendment leeway.

First, a school, in relation to off-campus speech, will rarely stand in loco parentis. The doctrine of in loco parentis
treats school administrators as standing in the place of students' parents under circumstances where the chil-
dren's actual parents cannot protect, guide, and discipline them. Geographically speaking, off-campus speech
will normally fall within the zone of parental, rather than school-related, responsibility.

Second, from the student speaker's perspective, regulations of off-campus speech, when coupled with regula-
tions of on-campus speech, include all the speech a student utters during the full 24-hour day. That means courts
must be more skeptical of a school's efforts to regulate off-campus speech, for doing so may mean the student
cannot engage in that kind of speech at all. When it comes to political or religious speech that occurs outside
school or a school program or activity, the school will have a heavy burden to justify intervention.

Third, the school itself has an interest in protecting a student's unpopular expression, especially when the
expression takes place off campus. America's public schools are the nurseries of democracy. Our representative
democracy only works if we protect the "marketplace of ideas."

... Given the many different kinds of off-campus speech, the different potential school-related and circumstance-
specific justifications, and the differing extent to which those justifications may call for First Amendment leeway,
we can, as a general matter, say little more than this: Taken together, these three features of much off-campus
speech mean that the leeway the First Amendment grants to schools in light of their special characteristics is
diminished. We leave for future cases to decide where, when, and how these features mean the speaker's off-cam-
pus location will make the critical difference. This case can, however, provide one example.

Consider B. L.'s speech. Putting aside the vulgar language, the listener would hear criticism, of the team, the
team's coaches, and the school--in a word or two, criticism of the rules of a community of which B. L. forms a
part. This criticism did not involve features that would place it outside the First Amendment's ordinary protec-
tion ... To the contrary, B. L. uttered the kind of pure speech to which, were she an adult, the First Amendment
would provide strong protection. Snyder v. Phelps, (2011).

Consider too when, where, and how B. L. spoke. Her posts appeared outside of school hours from a location
outside the school. She did not identify the school in her posts or target any member of the school community
with vulgar or abusive language. B. L. also transmitted her speech through a personal cellphone, to an audience
consisting of her private circle of Snapchat friends. These features of her speech, while risking transmission to
the school itself, nonetheless ... diminish the school's interest in punishing B. L.'s utterance.

But what about the school's interest, here primarily an interest in prohibiting students from using vulgar lan-
guage to criticize a school team or its coaches--at least when that criticism might well be transmitted to other
students, team members, coaches, and faculty? We can break that general interest into three parts.
                                                                                                                        STUDENT SPEECH | 475

First, we consider the school's interest in teaching good manners and consequently in punishing the use of vul-
gar language aimed at part of the school community ... The strength of this anti-vulgarity interest is weakened
considerably by the fact that B. L. spoke outside the school on her own time ...

Second, the school argues that it was trying to prevent disruption, if not within the classroom, then within the
bounds of a school-sponsored extracurricular activity. But we can find no evidence in the record of the sort of
"substantial disruption" of a school activity or a threatened harm to the rights of others that might justify the
school's action ... The alleged disturbance here does not meet Tinker's demanding standard.

Third, the school presented some evidence that expresses (at least indirectly) a concern for team morale. One of
the coaches testified that the school decided to suspend B. L., not because of any specific negative impact upon
a particular member of the school community, but "based on the fact that there was negativity put out there
that could impact students in the school." There is little else, however, that suggests any serious decline in team
morale--to the point where it could create a substantial interference in, or disruption of, the school's efforts
to maintain team cohesion. As we have previously said, simple "undifferentiated fear or apprehension ... is not
enough to overcome the right to freedom of expression." Tinker. It might be tempting to dismiss B. L.'s words
as unworthy of the robust First Amendment protections discussed herein. But sometimes it is necessary to pro-
tect the superfluous in order to preserve the necessary ...

...

... The judgment of the Third Circuit is therefore affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Healy v. James

408 U.S. 169 (1972)

    Vote: 9-0
    Decision: Reversed
    Majority: Powell, joined by Burger, Douglas, Brennan, Stewart, White, Marshall, Blackmun, Rehnquist

MR. JUSTICE POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case, arising out of a denial by a state college of official recognition to a group of students who desired to
form a local chapter of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), presents this Court with questions requiring
the application of well established First Amendment principles ...

We mention briefly at the outset the setting in 1969-1970. A climate of unrest prevailed on many college cam-
puses in this country. There had been widespread civil disobedience on some campuses, accompanied by the
seizure of buildings, vandalism, and arson. Some colleges had been shut down altogether, while, at others, files
were looted and manuscripts destroyed. SDS chapters on some of those campuses had been a catalytic force
during this period. Although the causes of campus disruption were many and complex, one of the prime con-
sequences of such activities was the denial of the lawful exercise of First Amendment rights to the majority
of students by the few. Indeed, many of the most cherished characteristics long associated with institutions
of higher learning appeared to be endangered. Fortunately, with the passage of time, a calmer atmosphere and
greater maturity now pervade our campuses. Yet it was in this climate of earlier unrest that this case arose.

Petitioners are students attending Central Connecticut State College (CCSC), a state-supported institution of
higher learning. In September, 1969, they undertook to organize what they then referred to as a "local chapter"
of SDS. Pursuant to procedures established by the College, petitioners filed a request for official recognition as
a campus organization with the Student Affairs Committee, ... The Committee, while satisfied that the state-
ment of purposes was clear and unobjectionable on its face, exhibited concern over the relationship between
the proposed local group and the National SDS organization. In response to inquiries, representatives of the
proposed organization stated that they would not affiliate with any national organization and that their group
would remain "completely independent."

... By a vote of six to two, the Committee ultimately approved the application and recommended to the Presi-
dent of the College, Dr. James, that the organization be accorded official recognition ...

Several days later, the President rejected the Committee's recommendation and issued a statement indicating
that petitioners' organization was not to be accorded the benefits of official campus recognition ... He found
                                                                                                                     SPEECH IN COLLEGE | 477

that the organization's philosophy was antithetical to the school's policies, and that the group's independence
was doubtful. He concluded that approval should not be granted to any group that "openly repudiates" the Col-
lege's dedication to academic freedom.

Denial of official recognition posed serious problems for the organization's existence and growth. Its members
were deprived of the opportunity to place announcements regarding meetings, rallies, or other activities in the
student newspaper; they were precluded from using various campus bulletin boards; and -- most importantly
-- nonrecognition barred them from using campus facilities for holding meetings ...

Their efforts to gain recognition having proved ultimately unsuccessful and having been made to feel the burden
of nonrecognition, petitioners resorted to the courts. They filed a suit in the United States District Court for
the District of Connecticut, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the President of the College, other
administrators, and the State Board of Trustees. Petitioners' primary complaint centered on the denial of First
Amendment rights of expression and association arising from denial of campus recognition ... the judge ruled
that petitioners had been denied procedural due process because the President had based his decision on conclu-
sions regarding the applicant's affiliation which were outside the record before him ...

Upon reviewing the hearing transcript and exhibits, the President reaffirmed his prior decision to deny petition-
ers recognition as a campus organization ...

After the President's second statement issued, the case then returned to the District Court, where it was ordered
dismissed ...

Petitioners appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit where, by a two-to-one vote, the District
Court's judgment was affirmed ... This Court granted certiorari and, for the reasons that follow, we conclude
that the judgments of the courts below must be reversed, and the case remanded for reconsideration.

At the outset, we note that state colleges and universities are not enclave immune from the sweep of the First
Amendment.

... And, where state-operated educational institutions are involved, this Court has long recognized "the need for
affirming the comprehensive authority of the States and of school officials, consistent with fundamental consti-
tutional safeguards, to prescribe and control conduct in the schools." ... because of the acknowledged need for
order, First Amendment protections should apply with less force on college campuses than in the community at
large ...

... Among the rights protected by the First Amendment is the right of individuals to associate to further their
personal beliefs. While the freedom of association is not explicitly set out in the Amendment, it has long been
held to be implicit in the freedoms of speech, assembly, and petition. Baird v. State Bar of AZ, (1971) [other
citations omitted]. There can be no doubt that denial of official recognition, without justification, to college
organizations burdens or abridges that associational right. The primary impediment to free association flowing
from nonrecognition is the denial of use of campus facilities for meetings and other appropriate purpose.
478 | SPEECH IN COLLEGE

... Moreover, the organization's ability to participate in the intellectual give and take of campus debate, and to
pursue its stated purposes, is limited by denial of access to the customary media for communicating with the
administration, faculty members, and other students. Such impediments cannot be viewed as insubstantial.

... The opinions below also assumed that petitioners had the burden of showing entitlement to recognition by
the College. While petitioners have not challenged the procedural requirement that they file an application in
conformity with the rules of the College, they do question the view of the courts below that final rejection could
rest on their failure to convince the administration that their organization was unaffiliated with the National
SDS ... But, apart from any particular issue, once petitioners had filed an application in conformity with the
requirements, the burden was upon the College administration to justify its decision of rejection. Law Students
Civil Rights Research Council v. Wadmond, (1971) [other citations omitted]. It is to be remembered that the
effect of the College's denial of recognition was a form of prior restraint, denying to petitioners' organization
the range of associational activities described above. While a college has a legitimate interest in preventing dis-
ruption on the campus, which, under circumstances requiring the safeguarding of that interest, may justify such
restraint, a "heavy burden" rests on the college to demonstrate the appropriateness of that action ...

These fundamental errors -- discounting the existence of a cognizable First Amendment interest and misplac-
ing the burden of proof -- require that the judgments below be reversed. But we are unable to conclude that
no basis exists upon which nonrecognition might be appropriate. Indeed, based on a reasonable reading of the
ambiguous facts of this case, there appears to be at least one potentially acceptable ground for a denial of recog-
nition. Because of this ambiguous state of the record, we conclude that the case should be remanded, and, in an
effort to provide guidance to the lower courts upon reconsideration, it is appropriate to discuss the several bases
of President James' decision. Four possible justifications for nonrecognition, all closely related, might be derived
from the record and his statements. Three of those grounds are inadequate to substantiate his decision: a fourth,
however, has merit.

...

... Although this precise issue has not come before the Court heretofore, the Court has consistently disap-
proved governmental action imposing criminal sanctions or denying rights and privileges solely because of a
citizen's association with an unpopular organization ... In these cases, it has been established that "guilt by asso-
ciation alone, without [establishing] that an individual's association poses the threat feared by the Government,"
is an impermissible basis upon which to deny First Amendment rights. US v. Robel, (1967). The government has
the burden of establishing a knowing affiliation with an organization possessing unlawful aims and goals, and a
specific intent to further those illegal aims.

... Not only did petitioners proclaim their complete independence from this organization, but they also indi-
cated that they shared only some of the beliefs its leaders have expressed. On this record, it is clear that the rela-
tionship was not an adequate ground for the denial of recognition ...

Having concluded that petitioners were affiliated with, or at least retained an affinity for, National SDS, Presi-
dent James attributed what he believed to be the philosophy of that organization to the local group ...
                                                                                                                     SPEECH IN COLLEGE | 479

... The mere disagreement of the President with the group's philosophy affords no reason to deny it recognition.

As the litigation progressed in the District Court, a third rationale for President James' decision ... began to
emerge ... that he based rejection on a conclusion that this particular group would be a "disruptive influence at
CCSC." ...

... The "Student Bill of Rights" at CCSC, upon which great emphasis was placed by the President, draws pre-
cisely this distinction between advocacy and action. It purports to impose no limitations on the right of college
student organizations "to examine and discuss all questions of interest to them." (Emphasis supplied.) But it
also states that students have no right (1) "to deprive others of the opportunity to speak or be heard," (2) "to
invade the privacy of others," (3) "to damage the property of others," (4) "to disrupt the regular and essential
operation of the college," or (5) "to interfere with the rights of others." The line between permissible speech and
impermissible conduct tracks the constitutional requirement, and if there were an evidential basis to support the
conclusion that CCSC-SDS posed a substantial threat of material disruption in violation of that command, the
President's decision should be affirmed.

The record, however, offers no substantial basis for that conclusion ...

These same references in the record to the group's equivocation regarding how it might respond to "issues of
violence" and whether it could ever "envision ... interrupting a class" suggest a fourth possible reason why recog-
nition might have been denied to these petitioners. These remarks might well have been read as announcing
petitioners' unwillingness to be bound by reasonable school rules governing conduct ... The regulation, carefully
differentiating between advocacy and action, is a reasonable one, and petitioners have not questioned it directly.
Yet their statements raise considerable question whether they intend to abide by the prohibitions contained
therein.

... Just as in the community at large, reasonable regulations with respect to the time, the place, and the manner
in which student groups conduct their speech-related activities must be respected. A college administration may
impose a requirement, such as may have been imposed in this case, that a group seeking official recognition
affirm in advance its willingness to adhere to reasonable campus law. Such a requirement does not impose an
impermissible condition on the students' associational rights ...

We think the above discussion establishes the appropriate framework for consideration of petitioners' request
for campus recognition. Because respondents failed to accord due recognition to First Amendment principles,
the judgments below approving respondents' denial of recognition must be reversed. Since we cannot conclude
from this record that petitioners were willing to abide by reasonable campus rules and regulations, we order the
case remanded for reconsideration. We note, in so holding, that the wide latitude accorded by the Constitution
to the freedoms of expression and association is not without its costs in terms of the risk to the maintenance
of civility and an ordered society. Indeed, this latitude often has resulted, on the campus and elsewhere, in the
infringement of the rights of others.
§480 | SPEECH IN COLLEGE

Though we deplore the tendency of some to abuse the very constitutional privileges they invoke, and although
the infringement of rights of others certainly should not be tolerated, we reaffirm this Court's dedication to the
principles of the Bill of Rights upon which our vigorous and free society is founded.

Reversed and remanded.

Per Curiam

Petitioner, a graduate student in the University of Missouri School of Journalism, was expelled for distributing
on campus a newspaper "containing forms of indecent speech" in violation of a bylaw of the Board of Curators
... The particular newspaper issue in question was found to be unacceptable for two reasons. First, on the front
cover, the publishers had reproduced a political cartoon previously printed in another newspaper depicting
policemen raping the Statue of Liberty and the Goddess of Justice. The caption under the cartoon read: " ...
With Liberty and Justice for All." Secondly, the issue contained an article entitled "M___f___ Acquitted,"
which discussed the trial and acquittal on an assault charge of a New York City youth who was a member of an
organization known as "Up Against the Wall, M___f___."

Following a hearing, the Student Conduct Committee found that petitioner had violated ... the General Stan-
dards of Student Conduct, which requires students "to observe generally accepted standards of conduct," and
specifically prohibits "indecent conduct or speech." Her expulsion, after affirmance first by the Chancellor of
the University and then by its Board of Curators, was made effective in the middle of the spring semester ...

After exhausting her administrative review alternatives within the University, petitioner brought an action for
declaratory and injunctive relief ... She claimed that her expulsion was improperly premised on activities pro-
tected by the First Amendment. The District Court denied relief ... and the Court of Appeals affirmed, one
judge dissenting ... Rehearing en banc was denied by an equally divided vote of all the judges in the Eighth Cir-
cuit.
§                                                                                                                    SPEECH IN COLLEGE | 481

... This case was decided several days before we handed down Healy v. James, 408 U. S. 169 (1972), in which,
while recognizing a state university's undoubted prerogative to enforce reasonable rules governing student con-
duct, we reaffirmed that "state colleges and universities are not enclaves immune from the sweep of the First
Amendment." Tinker v. Des Moines Independent School Dist., (1969). We think Healy makes it clear that the
mere dissemination of ideas -- no matter how offensive to good taste -- on a state university campus may not
be shut off in the name alone of "conventions of decency." Other recent precedents of this Court make it equally
clear that neither the political cartoon nor the headline story involved in this case can be labeled as constitution-
ally obscene or otherwise unprotected. Kois v. Wisconsin, (1972) [other citations omitted].

Since the First Amendment leaves no room for the operation of a dual standard in the academic community
with respect to the content of speech, and because the state University's action here cannot be justified as a
nondiscriminatory application of reasonable rules governing conduct, the judgments of the courts below must
be reversed. Accordingly, the petition for a writ of certiorari is granted, the case is remanded to the District
Court, and that court is instructed to order the University to restore to petitioner any course credits she earned
for the semester in question and, unless she is barred from reinstatement for valid academic reasons, to reinstate
her as a student in the graduate program.

Reversed and remanded.

    Vote: 5-4
    Decision: Reversed
    Majority: Kennedy, joined by Rehnquist, O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas
    Dissent: Souter, joined by Ginsburg, Breyer, Stevens

JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.

The University of Virginia, an instrumentality of the Commonwealth for which it is named and thus bound
by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, authorizes the payment of outside contractors for the printing costs
of a variety of student publications. It withheld any authorization for payments on behalf of petitioners for the
sole reason that their student paper "primarily promotes or manifests a particular belie[f] in or about a deity
or an ultimate reality." That the paper did promote or manifest views within the defined exclusion seems plain
enough. The challenge is to the University's regulation and its denial of authorization, the case raising issues
under the Speech and Establishment Clauses of the First Amendment.
482 | SPEECH IN COLLEGE

... Before a student group is eligible to submit bills from its outside contractors for payment by the fund
described below, it must become a "Contracted Independent Organization" (CIO). CIO status is available to
any group the majority of whose members are students, whose managing officers are full-time students, and that
complies with certain procedural requirements ... A CIO must file its constitution with the University; must
pledge not to discriminate in its membership; and must include in dealings with third parties and in all writ-
ten materials a disclaimer, stating that the CIO is independent of the University and that the University is not
responsible for the CIO ... CIO's enjoy access to University facilities, including meeting rooms and computer
terminals.

A standard agreement signed between each CIO and the University provides that the benefits and opportunities
afforded to CIO's "should not be misinterpreted as meaning that those organizations are part of or controlled
by the University, that the University is responsible for the organizations' contracts or other acts or omissions,
or that the University approves of the organizations' goals or activities."

All CIO's may exist and operate at the University, but some are also entitled to apply for funds from the Student
Activities Fund (SAF). Established and governed by University Guidelines, the purpose of the SAF is to support
a broad range of extracurricular student activities ... The Guidelines require that it be administered "in a manner
consistent with the educational purpose of the University as well as with state and federal law." ... The Student
Council, elected by the students, has the initial authority to disburse the funds, but its actions are subject to
review by a faculty body chaired by a designee of the Vice President for Student Affairs ...

... The student activities that are excluded from SAF support are religious activities, philanthropic contributions
and activities, political activities, activities that would jeopardize the University's tax-exempt status, those which
involve payment of honoraria or similar fees, or social entertainment or related expenses ...

Petitioners' organization, Wide Awake Productions (WAP) ... Formed by petitioner Ronald Rosenberger and
other undergraduates in 1990, WAP was established "[t]o publish a magazine of philosophical and religious
expression," "[t]o facilitate discussion which fosters an atmosphere of sensitivity to and tolerance of Christian
viewpoints," and "[t]o provide a unifying focus for Christians of multicultural backgrounds." ... WAP publishes
Wide Awake: A Christian Perspective at the University of Virginia. The paper's Christian viewpoint was evident
from the first issue, in which its editors wrote that the journal "offers a Christian perspective on both personal
and community issues, especially those relevant to college students at the University of Virginia." ...

WAP had acquired CIO status soon after it was organized.

This is an important consideration in this case, for had it been a "religious organization," WAP would not have
been accorded CIO status ... At no stage in this controversy has the University contended that WAP is such an
organization.

A few months after being given CIO status, WAP requested the SAF to pay its printer $5,862 for the costs of
printing its newspaper. The Appropriations Committee of the Student Council denied WAP's request on the
ground that Wide Awake was a "religious activity" within the meaning of the Guidelines ...
                                                                                                                     SPEECH IN COLLEGE | 483

Having no further recourse within the University structure, WAP, Wide Awake, and three of its editors and
members filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia, challenging the SAF's
action ... They alleged that refusal to authorize payment of the printing costs of the publication, solely on the
basis of its religious editorial viewpoint, violated their rights to freedom of speech and press, to the free exercise
of religion, and to equal protection of the law ...

On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court ruled for the University, holding that denial of
SAF support was not an impermissible content or viewpoint discrimination against petitioners' speech, and that
the University's Establishment Clause concern over its "religious activities" was a sufficient justification for deny-
ing payment to third-party contractors ...

The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in disagreement with the District Court, held that
the Guidelines did discriminate on the basis of content ... The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the
District Court nonetheless, concluding that the discrimination by the University was justified by the "com-
pelling interest in maintaining strict separation of church and state." ... We granted certiorari.

... The necessities of confining a forum to the limited and legitimate purposes for which it was created may
justify the State in reserving it for certain groups or for the discussion of certain topics. Cornelius v. NAACP
Legal Defense Fund, (1985) [other citations omitted]. Once it has opened a limited forum, however, the State
must respect the lawful boundaries it has itself set. The State may not exclude speech where its distinction is
not "reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum," Cornelius, supra [other citations omitted].Thus, in
determining whether the State is acting to preserve the limits of the forum it has created so that the exclusion of
a class of speech is legitimate, we have observed a distinction between, on the one hand, content discrimination,
which may be permissible if it preserves the purposes of that limited forum, and, on the other hand, viewpoint
discrimination, which is presumed impermissible when directed against speech otherwise within the forum's
limitations. Perry Ed Assn. v. Perry Local Educators Assn., (1983).

... We conclude, nonetheless, that here, as in Lamb's Chape. V. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., (1993),
viewpoint discrimination is the proper way to interpret the University's objections to Wide Awake. By the very
terms of the SAF prohibition, the University does not exclude religion as a subject matter but selects for disfa-
vored treatment those student journalistic efforts with religious editorial viewpoints. Religion may be a vast area
of inquiry, but it also provides, as it did here, a specific premise, a perspective, a standpoint from which a variety
of subjects may be discussed and considered. The prohibited perspective, not the general subject matter, resulted
in the refusal to make third-party payments, for the subjects discussed were otherwise within the approved cate-
gory of publications.

The dissent's assertion that no viewpoint discrimination occurs because the Guidelines discriminate against an
entire class of viewpoints reflects an insupportable assumption that all debate is bipolar and that antireligious
speech is the only response to religious speech. Our understanding of the complex and multifaceted nature of
public discourse has not embraced such a contrived description of the marketplace of ideas ...
484 | SPEECH IN COLLEGE

... The distinction between the University's own favored message and the private speech of students is evident
in the case before us. The University itself has taken steps to ensure the distinction in the agreement each CIO
must sign ... Having offered to pay the third-party contractors on behalf of private speakers who convey their
own messages, the University may not silence the expression of selected viewpoints.

The University urges that, from a constitutional standpoint, funding of speech differs from provision of access
to facilities because money is scarce and physical facilities are not. Beyond the fact that in any given case this
proposition might not be true as an empirical matter, the underlying premise that the University could discrim-
inate based on viewpoint if demand for space exceeded its availability is wrong as well. The government cannot
justify viewpoint discrimination among private speakers on the economic fact of scarcity ...

... Based on the principles we have discussed, we hold that the regulation invoked to deny SAF support, both in
its terms and in its application to these petitioners, is a denial of their right of free speech guaranteed by the First
Amendment ...

... The neutrality commanded of the State by the separate Clauses of the First Amendment was compromised by
the University's course of action. The viewpoint discrimination inherent in the University's regulation required
public officials to scan and interpret student publications to discern their underlying philosophic assumptions
respecting religious theory and belief. That course of action was a denial of the right of free speech and would
risk fostering a pervasive bias or hostility to religion, which could undermine the very neutrality the Establish-
ment Clause requires. There is no Establishment Clause violation in the University's honoring its duties under
the Free Speech Clause.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals must be, and is, reversed.

It is so ordered.

Southworth

    Majority: Kennedy, joined by Rehnquist, Stevens, O'Connor, Scalia, Souter, Thomas, Ginsburg, Breyer

JUSTICE KENNEDY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.

For the second time in recent years we consider constitutional questions arising from a program designed to
facilitate extracurricular student speech at a public university. Respondents are a group of students at the Uni-
versity of Wisconsin. They brought a First Amendment challenge to a mandatory student activity fee imposed
by petitioner Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin and used in part by the University to support stu-
dent organizations engaging in political or ideological speech. Respondents object to the speech and expression
of some of the student organizations. Relying upon our precedents which protect members of unions and bar
associations from being required to pay fees used for speech the members find objectionable, both the District
Court and the Court of Appeals invalidated the University's student fee program. The University contends that
its mandatory student activity fee and the speech which it supports are appropriate to further its educational
mission.

We reverse. The First Amendment permits a public university to charge its students an activity fee used to fund
a program to facilitate extracurricular student speech if the program is viewpoint neutral. We do not sustain,
however, the student referendum mechanism of the University's program, which appears to permit the exaction
of fees in violation of the viewpoint neutrality principle. As to that aspect of the program, we remand for further
proceedings.

It seems that since its founding the University has required full-time students enrolled at its Madison campus to
pay a nonrefundable activity fee ... For the 19951996 academic year, when this suit was commenced, the activity
fee amounted to $331.50 per year. The fee is segregated from the University's tuition charge. Once collected, the
activity fees are deposited by the University into the accounts of the State of Wisconsin ... The fees are drawn
upon by the University to support various campus services and extracurricular student activities.

...

The allocable portion of the fee supports extracurricular endeavors pursued by the University's registered stu-
dent organizations or RSO's. To qualify for RSO status students must organize as a not-for-profit group, limit
membership primarily to students, and agree to undertake activities related to student life on campus.

...
486 | SPEECH IN COLLEGE

RSO's may obtain a portion of the allocable fees in one of three ways. Most do so by seeking funding from the
Student Government Activity Fund (SGAF), administered by the ASM [Associated Students of Madison] ... an
RSO can apply for funding from the General Student Services Fund (GSSF), administered through the ASM's
finance committee ...

A student referendum provides a third means for an RSO to obtain funding ... While the record is sparse on this
feature of the University's program, the parties inform us that the student body can vote either to approve or to
disapprove an assessment for a particular RSO.

With respect to [the first two methods], the ASM or its finance committee makes the initial funding decisions ...
Approval appears pro forma ... the student government "voluntarily views the referendum as binding." ...

...

The University's policy establishes purposes for which fees may not be expended ...

The University's Student Organization Handbook has guidelines for regulating the conduct and activities of
RSO's. In addition to obligating RSO's to adhere to the fee program's rules and regulations, the guidelines estab-
lish procedures authorizing any student to complain to the University that an RSO is in noncompliance. An
extensive investigative process is in place to evaluate and remedy violations. The University's policy includes a
range of sanctions for noncompliance, including probation, suspension, or termination of RSO status.

...

In March 1996, respondents, each of whom attended or still attend the University's Madison campus, filed suit
... that imposition of the segregated fee violated their rights of free speech, free association, and free exercise
under the First Amendment. They contended the University must grant them the choice not to fund those
RSO's that engage in political and ideological expression offensive to their personal beliefs.

It is inevitable that government will adopt and pursue programs and policies within its constitutional powers
but which nevertheless are contrary to the profound beliefs and sincere convictions of some of its citizens. The
government, as a general rule, may support valid programs and policies by taxes or other exactions binding on
protesting parties. Within this broader principle it seems inevitable that funds raised by the government will be
spent for speech and other expression to advocate and defend its own policies. Rust v. Sullivan, (1991) [other
citations omitted]. The case we decide here, however, does not raise the issue of the government's right, or, to be
more specific, the state-controlled University's right, to use its own funds to advance a particular message. The
University's whole justification for fostering the challenged expression is that it springs from the initiative of the
students, who alone give it purpose and content in the course of their extracurricular endeavors.

alone give it purpose and content in the course of their extracurricular endeavors ... This is true even though the
student activities fund is not a public forum in the traditional sense of the term and despite the circumstance
that those cases most often involve a demand for access, not a claim to be exempt from supporting speech.

... If the University conditions the opportunity to receive a college education, an opportunity comparable in
importance to joining a labor union or bar association, on an agreement to support objectionable, extracurric-
ular expression by other students, the rights acknowledged ... become implicated. It infringes on the speech and
beliefs of the individual to be required, by this mandatory student activity fee program, to pay subsidies for
the objectionable speech of others without any recognition of the State's corresponding duty to him or her. Yet
recognition must be given as well to the important and substantial purposes of the University, which seeks to
facilitate a wide range of speech ...

...

Just as the vast extent of permitted expression makes the test of germane speech inappropriate for intervention,
so too does it underscore the high potential for intrusion on the First Amendment rights of the objecting stu-
dents. It is all but inevitable that the fees will result in subsidies to speech which some students find objection-
able and offensive to their personal beliefs ...

The University may determine that its mission is well served if students have the means to engage in dynamic
discussions of philosophical, religious, scientific, social, and political subjects in their extracurricular campus life
outside the lecture hall. If the University reaches this conclusion, it is entitled to impose a mandatory fee to sus-
tain an open dialogue to these ends.

The University must provide some protection to its students' First Amendment interests, however. The proper
measure, and the principal standard of protection for objecting students, we conclude, is the requirement of
viewpoint neutrality in the allocation of funding support. Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of U of VA., (1995).
When a university requires its students to pay fees to support the extracurricular speech of other students, all in
the interest of open discussion, it may not prefer some viewpoints to others ...

... The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed ...

488 | SPEECH IN COLLEGE

Christian Legal Society Chapter of the University of
California, Hastings College of the Law v. Martinez

561 U.S. 661 (2010)

    Vote: 5-4
    Decision: Affirmed
    Majority: Ginsburg, joined by Stevens, Kennedy, Breyer, Sotomayor
    Concurrence: Stevens
    Concurrence: Kennedy
    Dissent: Alito, joined by Roberts, Scalia, Thomas

Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.

In a series of decisions, this Court has emphasized that the First Amendment generally precludes public univer-
sities from denying student organizations access to school-sponsored forums because of the groups' viewpoints.
This case concerns a novel question regarding student activities at public universities: May a public law school
condition its official recognition of a student group-and the attendant use of school funds and facilities-on the
organization's agreement to open eligibility for membership and leadership to all students?

In the view of petitioner Christian Legal Society (CLS), an accept-all-comers policy impairs its First Amendment
rights to free speech, expressive association, and free exercise of religion by prompting it, on pain of relinquishing
the advantages of recognition, to accept members who do not share the organization's core beliefs about religion
and sexual orientation. From the perspective of respondent Hastings College of the Law (Hastings or the Law
School), CLS seeks special dispensation from an across-the-board open-access requirement designed to further
the reasonable educational purposes underpinning the school's student-organization program ...

... Through its "Registered Student Organization" (RSO) program, Hastings extends official recognition to stu-
dent groups. Several benefits attend this school-approved status.

... Critical here, all RSOs must undertake to comply with Hastings' "Policies and Regulations Applying to Col-
lege Activities, Organizations and Students."

... Hastings interprets the Nondiscrimination Policy, as it relates to the RSO program, to mandate acceptance of
all comers: School-approved groups must "allow any student to participate, become a member, or seek leader-
ship positions in the organization, regardless of [her] status or beliefs." ...

... CLS chapters must adopt bylaws that, inter alia, require members and officers to sign a "Statement of Faith"
and to conduct their lives in accord with prescribed principles. Among those tenets is the belief that sexual activ-
ity should not occur outside of marriage between a man and a woman; CLS thus interprets its bylaws to exclude
from affiliation anyone who engages in "unrepentant homosexual conduct." CLS also excludes students who
hold religious convictions different from those in the Statement of Faith.
                                                                                                                    SPEECH IN COLLEGE | 489

On September 17, 2004, CLS submitted to Hastings an application for RSO status, accompanied by all required
documents, including the set of bylaws mandated by CLS-National. Several days later, the Law School rejected
the application; CLS's bylaws, Hastings explained, did not comply with the Nondiscrimination Policy because
CLS barred students based on religion and sexual orientation.

... If CLS instead chose to operate outside the RSO program, Hastings stated, the school "would be pleased to
provide [CLS] the use of Hastings facilities for its meetings and activities." CLS would also have access to chalk-
boards and generally available campus bulletin boards to announce its events ...

Refusing to alter its bylaws, CLS did not obtain RSO status. It did, however, operate independently during the
2004-2005 academic year ...

On October 22, 2004, CLS filed suit against various Hastings officers and ... Its complaint alleged that Hastings'
refusal to grant the organization RSO status violated CLS's First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to free
speech, expressive association, and free exercise of religion. The suit sought injunctive and declaratory relief.

On cross-motions for summary judgment, the U. S. District Court for the Northern District of California ruled
in favor of Hastings. The Law School's all-comers condition on access to a limited public forum, the court held,
was both reasonable and viewpoint neutral, and therefore did not violate CLS's right to free speech.

Nor, in the District Court's view, did the Law School impermissibly impair CLS's right to expressive association
...

The court also rejected CLS's Free Exercise Clause argument ...

On appeal, the Ninth Circuit affirmed [in a brief opinion]. We granted certiorari and now affirm the Ninth Cir-
cuit's judgment ...

In support of the argument that Hastings' all-comers policy treads on its First Amendment rights to free speech
and expressive association, CLS draws on two lines of decisions. First, in a progression of cases, this Court has
employed forum analysis to determine when a governmental entity, in regulating property in its charge, may
place limitations on speech. Recognizing a State's right "to preserve the property under its control for the use to
which it is lawfully dedicated," Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. Fund, (1985), the Court has permitted restric-
tions on access to a limited public forum, like the RSO program here, with this key caveat: Any access barrier
must be reasonable and viewpoint neutral.

Second, as evidenced by another set of decisions, this Court has rigorously reviewed laws and regulations that
constrain associational freedom. In the context of public accommodations, we have subjected restrictions on
that freedom to close scrutiny; such restrictions are permitted only if they serve "compelling state interests"
that are "unrelated to the suppression of ideas"-interests that cannot be advanced "through ... significantly less
restrictive [means]." Roberts v. US Jaycees, (1984)."Freedom of association," we have recognized, "plainly pre-
supposes a freedom not to associate." ... Insisting that an organization embrace unwelcome members, we have
therefore concluded, "directly and immediately affects associational rights." ...
490 | SPEECH IN COLLEGE

... First, the same considerations that have led us to apply a less restrictive level of scrutiny to speech in limited
public forums as compared to other environments, apply with equal force to expressive association occurring in
limited public forums. As just noted, speech and expressive-association rights are closely linked ... When these
intertwined rights arise in exactly the same context, it would be anomalous for a restriction on speech to survive
constitutional review under our limited-public-forum test only to be invalidated as an impermissible infringe-
ment of expressive association. That result would be all the more anomalous in this case, for CLS suggests that
its expressive-association claim plays a part auxiliary to speech's starring role.

Second, and closely related, the strict scrutiny we have applied in some settings to laws that burden expressive
association would, in practical effect, invalidate a defining characteristic of limited public forums-the State may
"reserv[e] [them] for certain groups." Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, (1995)

An example sharpens the tip of this point: Schools, including Hastings, ordinarily, and without controversy,
limit official student-group recognition to organizations comprising only students-even if those groups wish
to associate with nonstudents. The same ground rules must govern both speech and association challenges in
the limited-public-forum context, lest strict scrutiny trump a public university's ability to "confin[e] a [speech]
forum to the limited and legitimate purposes for which it was created."

Third, this case fits comfortably within the limited-public-forum category, for CLS, in seeking what is effectively
a state subsidy, faces only indirect pressure to modify its membership policies; CLS may exclude any person for
any reason if it forgoes the benefits of official recognition. The expressive-association precedents on which CLS
relies, in contrast, involved regulations that compelled a group to include unwanted members, with no choice to
opt out ...

In diverse contexts, our decisions have distinguished between policies that require action and those that with-
hold benefits. Application of the less-restrictive limited-public-forum analysis better accounts for the fact that
Hastings, through its RSO program, is dangling the carrot of subsidy, not wielding the stick of prohibition ...

... Our inquiry is shaped by the educational context in which it arises: "First Amendment rights," we have
observed, "must be analyzed in light of the special characteristics of the school environment." Widmar v. Vin­
cent, (1981).

A college's commission-and its concomitant license to choose among pedagogical approaches-is not confined
to the classroom, for extracurricular programs are, today, essential parts of the educational process. Board of Ed.
of Independent School Dist. No. 92 of Pottawatomie Cty. v. Earls, (2002).

With appropriate regard for school administrators' judgment, we review the justifications Hastings offers in
defense of its all-comers requirement. First, the open-access policy "ensures that the leadership, educational, and
social opportunities afforded by [RSOs] are available to all students." ... RSOs, we count it significant, are eli-
gible for financial assistance drawn from mandatory student-activity fees; the all-comers policy ensures that no
Hastings student is forced to fund a group that would reject her as a member.
                                                                                                                     SPEECH IN COLLEGE | 491

Second, the all-comers requirement helps Hastings police the written terms of its Nondiscrimination Policy
without inquiring into an RSO's motivation for membership restrictions. To bring the RSO program within
CLS's view of the Constitution's limits, CLS proposes that Hastings permit exclusion because of belief but for-
bid discrimination due to status ... But that proposal would impose on Hastings a daunting labor. How should
the Law School go about determining whether a student organization cloaked prohibited status exclusion in
belief-based garb? ...

In sum, the several justifications Hastings asserts in support of its all-comers requirement are surely reasonable
in light of the RSO forum's purposes.

The Law School's policy is all the more creditworthy in view of the "substantial alternative channels that remain
open for [CLS-student] communication to take place." ...

... Finally, CLS asserts (and the dissent repeats) that the Law School lacks any legitimate interest-let alone one
reasonably related to the RSO forum's purposes-in urging "religious groups not to favor co-religionists for pur-
poses of their religious activities." CLS's analytical error lies in focusing on the benefits it must forgo while ignor-
ing the interests of those it seeks to fence out: Exclusion, after all, has two sides. Hastings, caught in the crossfire
between a group's desire to exclude and students' demand for equal access, may reasonably draw a line in the
sand permitting all organizations to express what they wish but no group to discriminate in membership.

We next consider whether Hastings' all-comers policy is viewpoint neutral.

... It is, after all, hard to imagine a more viewpoint-neutral policy than one requiring all student groups to accept
all comers ...

... Finding Hastings' open-access condition on RSO status reasonable and viewpoint neutral, we reject CLS'
free-speech and expressive-association claims.

... For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Court of Appeals' ruling that the all-comers policy is constitutional
and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

PER CURIAM.

These appeals present constitutional challenges to the key provisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act of
1971 (Act), and related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, all as amended in 1974 ... The com-
plaint sought both a declaratory judgment that the major provisions of the Act were unconstitutional and an
injunction against enforcement of those provisions ...

In this Court, appellants argue that the Court of Appeals failed to give this legislation the critical scrutiny
demanded under accepted First Amendment and equal protection principles. In appellants' view, limiting the
use of money for political purposes constitutes a restriction on communication violative of the First Amend-
ment, since virtually all meaningful political communications in the modern setting involve the expenditure of
money. Further, they argue that the reporting and disclosure provisions of the Act unconstitutionally impinge
on their right to freedom of association ...

At the outset, we must determine whether the case before us presents a "case or controversy" within the meaning
of Art. III of the Constitution. Congress may not, of course, require this Court to render opinions in matters
which are not "cases or controversies." Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, (1937) ...

The constitutional power of Congress to regulate federal elections is well established and is not questioned by
any of the parties in this case. Thus, the critical constitutional questions presented here go not to the basic power
                                                                                                 CAMPAIGN FINANCE AND SPEECH | 493

of Congress to legislate in this area, but to whether the specific legislation that Congress has enacted interferes
with First Amendment freedoms or invidiously discriminates against nonincumbent candidates and minor par-
ties in contravention of the Fifth Amendment ...

The Act's contribution and expenditure limitations operate in an area of the most fundamental First Amend-
ment activities. Discussion of public issues and debate on the qualifications of candidates are integral to the
operation of the system of government established by our Constitution. The First Amendment affords the
broadest protection to such political expression in order "to assure [the] unfettered interchange of ideas for the
bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people." Roth v. United States, (1957) ...

In upholding the constitutional validity of the Act's contribution and expenditure provisions on the ground
that those provisions should be viewed as regulating conduct, not speech, the Court of Appeals relied
upon United States v. O'Brien, (1968) ... We cannot share the view that the present Act's contribution and
expenditure limitations are comparable to the restrictions on conduct upheld in O'Brien. The expenditure of
money simply cannot be equated with such conduct as destruction of a draft card. Some forms of communica-
tion made possible by the giving and spending of money involve speech alone, some involve conduct primarily,
and some involve a combination of the two. Yet this Court has never suggested that the dependence of a commu-
nication on the expenditure of money operates itself to introduce a nonspeech element or to reduce the exacting
scrutiny required by the First Amendment. See Bigelow v. Virginia, (1975) ...

Nor can the Act's contribution and expenditure limitations be sustained, as some of the parties suggest, by
reference to the constitutional principles reflected in such decisions as Cox v. Louisiana, supra; Adderley v.
Florida, (1966); and Kovacs v. Cooper, (1949). Those cases stand for the proposition that the government may
adopt reasonable time, place, and manner regulations, which do not discriminate among speakers or ideas, in
order to further an important governmental interest unrelated to the restriction of communication ... The crit-
ical difference between this case and those time, place, and manner cases is that the present Act's contribution
and expenditure limitations impose direct quantity restrictions on political communication and association by
persons, groups, candidates, and political parties in addition to any reasonable time, place, and manner regula-
tions otherwise imposed ...

A limitation on the amount of money a person may give to a candidate or campaign organization thus involves
little direct restraint on his political communication, for it permits the symbolic expression of support evidenced
by a contribution but does not in any way infringe the contributor's freedom to discuss candidates and issues.
While contributions may result in political expression if spent by a candidate or an association to present views
to the voters, the transformation of contributions into political debate involves speech by someone other than
the contributor ...

The over-all effect of the Act's contribution ceilings is merely to require candidates and political committees to
raise funds from a greater number of persons and to compel people who would otherwise contribute amounts
greater than the statutory limits to expend such funds on direct political expression, rather than to reduce the
total amount of money potentially available to promote political expression ...
494 | CAMPAIGN FINANCE AND SPEECH

In sum, although the Act's contribution and expenditure limitations both implicate fundamental First Amend-
ment interests, its expenditure ceilings impose significantly more severe restrictions on protected freedoms of
political expression and association than do its limitations on financial contributions. ...

Appellants contend that the $1,000 contribution ceiling unjustifiably burdens First Amendment freedoms,
employs overbroad dollar limits, and discriminates against candidates opposing incumbent officeholders and
against minor party candidates in violation of the Fifth Amendment. We address each of these claims of invalid-
ity in turn ...

Appellees argue that the Act's restrictions on large campaign contributions are justified by three governmental
interests. According to the parties and amici, the primary interest served by the limitations and, indeed, by the
Act as a whole, is the prevention of corruption and the appearance of corruption spawned by the real or imag-
ined coercive influence of large financial contributions on candidates' positions and on their actions if elected to
office ...

It is unnecessary to look beyond the Act's primary purpose -- to limit the actuality and appearance of corrup-
tion resulting from large individual financial contributions -- in order to find a constitutionally sufficient jus-
tification for the $1,000 contribution limitation ... To the extent that large contributions are given to secure
a political quid pro quo from current and potential office holders, the integrity of our system of representative
democracy is undermined. Although the scope of such pernicious practices can never be reliably ascertained, the
deeply disturbing examples surfacing after the 1972 election demonstrate that the problem is not an illusory one
...

Appellants contend that the contribution limitations must be invalidated because bribery laws and narrowly
drawn disclosure requirements constitute a less restrictive means of dealing with "proven and suspected quid pro
quo arrangements." But laws making criminal the giving and taking of bribes deal with only the most blatant
and specific attempts of those with money to influence governmental action ...

The Act's $1,000 contribution limitation focuses precisely on the problem of large campaign contributions --
the narrow aspect of political association where the actuality and potential for corruption have been identified
-- while leaving persons free to engage in independent political expression, to associate actively through volun-
teering their services, and to assist to a limited but nonetheless substantial extent in supporting candidates and
committees with financial resources ...

We find that, under the rigorous standard of review established by our prior decisions, the weighty interests
served by restricting the size of financial contributions to political candidates are sufficient to justify the limited
effect upon First Amendment freedoms caused by the $1,000 contribution ceiling ...

[Another] claim is that the $1,000 restriction is unrealistically low because much more than that amount would
still not be enough to enable an unscrupulous contributor to exercise improper influence over a candidate or
officeholder, especially in campaigns for state-wide or national office. While the contribution limitation provi-
sions might well have been structured to take account of the graduated expenditure limitations for congressional
and Presidential campaigns, Congress' failure to engage in such fine tuning does not invalidate the legislation ...
                                                                                                 CAMPAIGN FINANCE AND SPEECH | 495

Apart from these First Amendment concerns, appellants argue that the contribution limitations work such an
invidious discrimination between incumbents and challengers that the statutory provisions must be declared
unconstitutional on their face ...

There is no such evidence to support the claim that the contribution limitations in themselves discriminate
against major party challengers to incumbents ...

In view of these considerations, we conclude that the impact of the Act's $1,000 contribution limitation on
major party challengers and on minor party candidates does not render the provision unconstitutional on its
face.

Section 608(b)(2) permits certain committees, designated as "political committees," to contribute up to $5,000
to any candidate with respect to any election for federal office. In order to qualify for the higher contribution
ceiling, a group must have been registered with the Commission as a political committee ... for not less than six
months, have received contributions from more than 50 persons, and, except for state political party organiza-
tions, have contributed to five or more candidates for federal office. Appellants argue that these qualifications
unconstitutionally discriminate against ad hoc organizations in favor of established interest groups and imper-
missibly burden free association. The argument is without merit. Rather than undermining freedom of associa-
tion, the basic provision enhances the opportunity of bona fide groups to participate in the election process, and
the registration, contribution, and candidate conditions serve the permissible purpose of preventing individuals
from evading the applicable contribution limitations by labeling themselves committees.

The Act excludes from the definition of contribution "the value of services provided without compensation by
individuals who volunteer a portion or all of their time on behalf of a candidate or political committee ..."

If, as we have held, the basic contribution limitations are constitutionally valid, then surely these provisions are
a constitutionally acceptable accommodation of Congress' valid interest in encouraging citizen participation in
political campaigns while continuing to guard against the corrupting potential of large financial contributions
to candidates ...

...

We find that the governmental interest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption is inadequate
to justify § 608(e)(1)'s ceiling on independent expenditures. First, assuming, arguendo, that large independent
expenditures pose the same dangers of actual or apparent quid pro quo arrangements as do large contributions,
§ 608(e)(1) does not provide an answer that sufficiently relates to the elimination of those dangers. Unlike the
contribution limitations' total ban on the giving of large amounts of money to candidates, § 608(e)(1) prevents
only some large expenditures. So long as persons and groups eschew expenditures that, in express terms advo-
cate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate, they are free to spend as much as they want to pro-
mote the candidate and his views ... It would naively underestimate the ingenuity and resourcefulness of persons
and groups desiring to buy influence to believe that they would have much difficulty devising expenditures that
skirted the restriction on express advocacy of election or defeat, but nevertheless benefited the candidate's cam-
paign.
496 | CAMPAIGN FINANCE AND SPEECH

Second, quite apart from the shortcomings of § 608(e)(1) in preventing any abuses generated by large indepen-
dent expenditures, the independent advocacy restricted by the provision does not presently appear to pose dan-
gers of real or apparent corruption comparable to those identified with large campaign contributions ... Rather
than preventing circumvention of the contribution limitations, § 608(e)(1) severely restricts all independent
advocacy despite its substantially diminished potential for abuse.

While the independent expenditure ceiling thus fails to serve any substantial governmental interest in stemming
the reality or appearance of corruption in the electoral process, it heavily burdens core First Amendment expres-
sion ...

For the reasons stated, we conclude that § 608(e)(1)'s independent expenditure limitation is unconstitutional
under the First Amendment ...

The Act also sets limits on expenditures by a candidate "from his personal funds, or the personal funds of his
immediate family, in connection with his campaigns during any calendar year." § 608(a)(1) ...

The ceiling on personal expenditures by candidates on their own behalf, like the limitations on independent
expenditures contained in § 608(e)(1), imposes a substantial restraint on the ability of persons to engage in pro-
tected First Amendment expression. The candidate, no less than any other person, has a First Amendment right
to engage in the discussion of public issues and vigorously and tirelessly to advocate his own election and the
election of other candidates. Indeed, it is of particular importance that candidates have the unfettered opportu-
nity to make their views known so that the electorate may intelligently evaluate the candidates' personal qualities
and their positions on vital public issues before choosing among them on election day ...

The primary governmental interest served by the Act -- the prevention of actual and apparent corruption of the
political process -- does not support the limitation on the candidate's expenditure of his own personal funds
... Indeed, the use of personal funds reduces the candidate's dependence on outside contributions, and thereby
counteracts the coercive pressures and attendant risks of abuse to which the Act's contribution limitations are
directed.

...

The campaign expenditure ceilings appear to be designed primarily to serve the governmental interests in reduc-
ing the allegedly skyrocketing costs of political campaigns ... [T]he mere growth in the cost of federal election
campaigns, in and of itself, provides no basis for governmental restrictions on the quantity of campaign spend-
ing and the resulting limitation on the scope of federal campaigns. The First Amendment denies government
the power to determine that spending to promote one's political views is wasteful, excessive, or unwise. In the
free society ordained by our Constitution, it is not the government, but the people -- individually, as citizens
and candidates, and collectively, as associations and political committees -- who must retain control over the
quantity and range of debate on public issues in a political campaign.

For these reasons, we hold that § 608(c) is constitutionally invalid ...
                                                                                                 CAMPAIGN FINANCE AND SPEECH | 497

Unlike the limitations on contributions and expenditures ... the disclosure requirements of the Act ... are not
challenged by appellants as per se unconstitutional restrictions on the exercise of First Amendment freedoms of
speech and association ...

Unlike the over-all limitations on contributions and expenditures, the disclosure requirements impose no ceiling
on campaign-related activities. But we have repeatedly found that compelled disclosure, in itself, can seriously
infringe on privacy of association and belief guaranteed by the First Amendment. E.g., Gibson v. Florida Legisla­
tive Comm., (1963) ...

We long have recognized that significant encroachments on First Amendment rights of the sort that compelled
disclosure imposes cannot be justified by a mere showing of some legitimate governmental interest.
Since NAACP v. Alabama, we have required that the subordinating interests of the State must survive exacting
scrutiny ...

The governmental interests sought to be vindicated by the disclosure requirements are of this magnitude. They
fall into three categories. First, disclosure provides the electorate with information "as to where political cam-
paign money comes from and how it is spent by the candidate" in order to aid the voters in evaluating those who
seek federal office ...

Second, disclosure requirements deter actual corruption and avoid the appearance of corruption by exposing
large contributions and expenditures to the light of publicity. This exposure may discourage those who would
use money for improper purposes either before or after the election. A public armed with information about a
candidate's most generous supporters is better able to detect any post-election special favors that may be given
in return ...

Third, and not least significant, recordkeeping, reporting, and disclosure requirements are an essential means of
gathering the data necessary to detect violations of the contribution limitations described above.

The disclosure requirements, as a general matter, directly serve substantial governmental interests. In determin-
ing whether these interests are sufficient to justify the requirements, we must look to the extent of the burden
that they place on individual rights.

It is undoubtedly true that public disclosure of contributions to candidates and political parties will deter some
individuals who otherwise might contribute ... [W]e note and agree with appellants' concession that disclosure
requirements -- certainly in most applications -- appear to be the least restrictive means of curbing the evils of
campaign ignorance and corruption that Congress found to exist. Appellants argue, however, that the balance
tips against disclosure when it is required of contributors to certain parties and candidates. We turn now to this
contention ...

Appellants contend that the Act's requirements are overbroad insofar as they apply to contributions to minor
parties and independent candidates because the governmental interest in this information is minimal, and the
danger of significant infringement on First Amendment rights is greatly increased ...
498 | CAMPAIGN FINANCE AND SPEECH

It is true that the governmental interest in disclosure is diminished when the contribution in question is made
to a minor party with little chance of winning an election. As minor parties usually represent definite and pub-
licized viewpoints, there may be less need to inform the voters of the interests that specific candidates represent.
Major parties encompass candidates of greater diversity. In many situations, the label "Republican" or "Democ-
rat" tells a voter little ...

The Government's interest in deterring the "buying" of elections and the undue influence of large contributors
on officeholders also may be reduced where contributions to a minor party or an independent candidate are con-
cerned, for it is less likely that the candidate will be victorious. But a minor party sometimes can play a significant
role in an election. Even when a minor party candidate has little or no chance of winning, he may be encouraged
by major party interests in order to divert votes from other major party contenders ...

There could well be a case ... where the threat to the exercise of First Amendment rights is so serious, and the
state interest furthered by disclosure so insubstantial, that the Act's requirements cannot be constitutionally
applied. But no appellant in this case has tendered record evidence of the sort ... At best they offer the testimony
of several minor party officials that one or two persons refused to make contributions because of the possibility
of disclosure. On this record, the substantial public interest in disclosure identified by the legislative history of
this Act outweighs the harm generally alleged ...

...

We recognize that unduly strict requirements of proof could impose a heavy burden, but it does not follow that a
blanket exemption for minor parties is necessary. Minor parties must be allowed sufficient flexibility in the proof
of injury to assure a fair consideration of their claim ...

Where it exists, the type of chill and harassment identified in NAACP v. Alabama can be shown. We cannot
assume that courts will be insensitive to similar showings when made in future cases. We therefore conclude that
a blanket exemption is not required ...

Section 434(e) requires "[e]very person (other than a political committee or candidate) who makes contribu-
tions or expenditures" aggregating over $100 in a calendar year "other than by contribution to a political com-
mittee or candidate" to file a statement with the Commission ... Unlike the other disclosure provisions, this
section does not seek the contribution list of any association. Instead, it requires direct disclosure of what an
individual or group contributes or spends.

In considering this provision, we must apply the same strict standard of scrutiny, for the right of associational
privacy developed in NAACP v. Alabama derives from the rights of the organization's members to advocate
their personal points of view in the most effective way.

...

We have found that § 608(e)(1) unconstitutionally infringes upon First Amendment rights. If the sole function
of § 434(e) were to aid in the enforcement of that provision, it would no longer serve any governmental purpose.
                                                                                                 CAMPAIGN FINANCE AND SPEECH | 499

But the two provisions are not so intimately tied. The legislative history on the function of § 434(e) is bare, but
it was clearly intended to stand independently of § 608(e)(1) ... The provision is responsive to the legitimate fear
that efforts would be made, as they had been in the past, to avoid the disclosure requirements by routing finan-
cial support of candidates through avenues not explicitly covered by the general provisions of the Act ...

In its effort to be all-inclusive, however, the provision raises serious problems of vagueness, particularly treacher-
ous where, as here, the violation of its terms carries criminal penalties and fear of incurring these sanctions may
deter those who seek to exercise protected First Amendment rights ...

...

§ 434(e), as construed, imposes independent reporting requirements on individuals and groups that are not
candidates or political committees only in the following circumstances: (1) when they make contributions ear-
marked for political purposes or authorized or requested by a candidate or his agent, to some person other than a
candidate or political committee, and (2) when they make expenditures for communications that expressly advo-
cate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate ...

Here, as we have seen, the disclosure requirement is narrowly limited to those situations where the information
sought has a substantial connection with the governmental interests sought to be advanced ...

The Court found the State's interest insufficient to justify the restrictive effect of the statute. The burden
imposed by § 434(e) is no prior restraint, but a reasonable and minimally restrictive method of furthering First
Amendment values by opening the basic processes of our federal election system to public view ...

Appellants' third contention, based on alleged overbreadth, is that the monetary thresholds in the recordkeeping
and reporting provisions lack a substantial nexus with the claimed governmental interests, for the amounts
involved are too low even to attract the attention of the candidate, much less have a corrupting influence ...

In summary, we find no constitutional infirmities in the recordkeeping, reporting, and disclosure provisions of
the Act ...

...

In summary, we sustain the individual contribution limits, the disclosure and reporting provisions, and the pub-
lic financing scheme. We conclude, however, that the limitations on campaign expenditures, on independent
expenditures by individuals and groups, and on expenditures by a candidate from his personal funds are con-
stitutionally infirm. Finally, we hold that most of the powers conferred by the Act upon the Federal Election
Commission can be exercised only by "Officers of the United States," appointed in conformity with Art. II, § 2,
cl. 2, of the Constitution, and therefore cannot be exercised by the Commission as presently constituted.

MR. JUSTICE POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court.

In sustaining a state criminal statute that forbids certain expenditures by banks and business corporations for the
purpose of influencing the vote on referendum proposals, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held that
the First Amendment rights of a corporation are limited to issues that materially affect its business, property, or
assets. The court rejected appellants' claim that the statute abridges freedom of speech in violation of the First
and Fourteenth Amendments. The issue presented in this context is one of first impression in this Court. We
postponed the question of jurisdiction to our consideration of the merits ... We now reverse ...

Appellants wanted to spend money to publicize their views on a proposed constitutional amendment that was
to be submitted to the voters as a ballot question at a general election on November 2, 1976. The amendment
would have permitted the legislature to impose a graduated tax on the income of individuals. After appellee,
the Attorney General of Massachusetts, informed appellants that he intended to enforce § 8 against them, they
brought this action seeking to have the statute declared unconstitutional ...

Appellants argued that § 8 violates the First Amendment, the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of
the Fourteenth Amendment, and similar provisions of the Massachusetts Constitution. They prayed that the
statute be declared unconstitutional on its face and as it would be applied to their proposed expenditures ...
                                                                                                 CAMPAIGN FINANCE AND SPEECH | 501

The court below framed the principal question in this case as whether and to what extent corporations have
First Amendment rights. We believe that the court posed the wrong question. The Constitution often protects
interests broader than those of the party seeking their vindication. The First Amendment, in particular, serves
significant societal interests. The proper question therefore is not whether corporations "have" First Amend-
ment rights and, if so, whether they are coextensive with those of natural persons. Instead, the question must be
whether § 8 abridges expression that the First Amendment was meant to protect. We hold that it does ...

If the speakers here were not corporations, no one would suggest that the State could silence their proposed
speech. It is the type of speech indispensable to decisionmaking in a democracy, and this is no less true because
the speech comes from a corporation, rather than an individual. The inherent worth of the speech in terms of its
capacity for informing the public does not depend upon the identity of its source, whether corporation, associ-
ation, union, or individual ...

The question in this case, simply put, is whether the corporate identity of the speaker deprives this proposed
speech of what otherwise would be its clear entitlement to protection. We turn now to that question ...

[A]ppellee suggests that First Amendment rights generally have been afforded only to corporations engaged in
the communications business or through which individuals express themselves, and the court below apparently
accepted the "materially affecting" theory as the conceptual common denominator between appellee's position
and the precedents of this Court. It is true that the "materially affecting" requirement would have been satisfied
in the Court's decisions affording protection to the speech of media corporations and corporations otherwise in
the business of communication or entertainment, and to the commercial speech of business corporations ... But
the effect on the business of the corporation was not the governing rationale in any of these decisions. None of
them mentions, let alone attributes significance to, the fact that the subject of the challenged communication
materially affected the corporation's business ...

We thus find no support in the First or Fourteenth Amendment, or in the decisions of this Court, for the propo-
sition that speech that otherwise would be within the protection of the First Amendment loses that protection
simply because its source is a corporation that cannot prove, to the satisfaction of a court, a material effect on its
business or property. The "materially affecting" requirement is not an identification of the boundaries of corpo-
rate speech etched by the Constitution itself. Rather, it amounts to an impermissible legislative prohibition of
speech based on the identity of the interests that spokesmen may represent in public debate over controversial
issues and a requirement that the speaker have a sufficiently great interest in the subject to justify communica-
tion ...

In the realm of protected speech, the legislature is constitutionally disqualified from dictating the subjects
about which persons may speak and the speakers who may address a public issue. Police Dept. of Chicago v.
Mosley, (1972). If a legislature may direct business corporations to "stick to business," it also may limit other
corporations -- religious, charitable, or civic -- to their respective "business" when addressing the public. Such
power in government to channel the expression of views is unacceptable under the First Amendment ... Yet the
State contends that its action is necessitated by governmental interests of the highest order. We next consider
these asserted interests ...
502 | CAMPAIGN FINANCE AND SPEECH

The constitutionality of § 8's prohibition of the "exposition of ideas" by corporations turns on whether it can
survive the exacting scrutiny necessitated by a state-imposed restriction of freedom of speech. Especially where,
as here, a prohibition is directed at speech itself, and the speech is intimately related to the process of governing
...

... Appellee ... advances two principal justifications for the prohibition of corporate speech. The first is the State's
interest in sustaining the active role of the individual citizen in the electoral process, and thereby preventing
diminution of the citizen's confidence in government. The second is the interest in protecting the rights of share-
holders whose views differ from those expressed by management on behalf of the corporation.

Appellee advances a number of arguments in support of his view that these interests are endangered by corporate
participation in discussion of a referendum issue. They hinge upon the assumption that such participation
would exert an undue influence on the outcome of a referendum vote, and -- in the end -- destroy the confi-
dence of the people in the democratic process and the integrity of government. According to appellee, corpo-
rations are wealthy and powerful, and their views may drown out other points of view. If appellee's arguments
were supported by record or legislative findings that corporate advocacy threatened imminently to undermine
democratic processes, thereby denigrating, rather than serving, First Amendment interests, these arguments
would merit our consideration. Cf. Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, (1969). But there has been no show-
ing that the relative voice of corporations has been overwhelming, or even significant in influencing referenda
in Massachusetts, or that there has been any threat to the confidence of the citizenry in government. Cf. Wood
v. Georgia, (1962). Nor are appellee's arguments inherently persuasive or supported by the precedents of this
Court. Referenda are held on issues, not candidates for public office. The risk of corruption perceived in cases
involving candidate elections ... simply is not present in a popular vote on a public issue. To be sure, corporate
advertising may influence the outcome of the vote; this would be its purpose. But the fact that advocacy may
persuade the electorate is hardly a reason to suppress it: the Constitution "protects expression which is eloquent
no less than that which is unconvincing." Kingsley Int'l Pictures Corp. v. Regents, (1959) ...

Because that portion of § 8 challenged by appellants prohibits protected speech in a manner unjustified by a
compelling state interest, it must be invalidated. The judgment of the Supreme Judicial Court is

Reversed.

Citizens Against Rent Control v. Berkeley

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER delivered the opinion of the Court.

Appellant Citizens Against Rent Control is an unincorporated association formed to oppose a ballot measure
at issue in the April 19, 1977, election ... To make its views on the ballot measure known, Citizens Against Rent
Control raised more than $108,000 from approximately 1,300 contributors. It accepted nine contributions over
the $250 limit. Those nine contributions totaled $20,850, or $18,600 more than if none of the contributions
exceeded $250. Pursuant to § 604 of the ordinance, appellee Berkeley Fair Campaign Practices Commission, 20
days before the election, ordered appellant Citizens Against Rent Control to pay $18,600 into the city treasury.

Two weeks before the election, Citizens Against Rent Control sought and obtained a temporary restraining
order prohibiting enforcement of §§ 602 and 604 ...

The California Supreme Court majority announced that it would strictly scrutinize § 602. It concluded that the
section furthered compelling governmental interests because it ensured that special interest groups could not
"corrupt" the initiative process by spending large amounts to support or oppose a ballot measure. Such corrup-
tion, the court found, could produce apathetic voters; these governmental interests were held to outweigh the
First Amendment interests infringed upon. Finally, it concluded that § 602 accomplished its goal by the least
restrictive means available ...

We noted probable jurisdiction ... and we reverse ...

Buckley identified a single narrow exception to the rule that limits on political activity were contrary to the First
Amendment. The exception relates to the perception of undue influence of large contributors to a candidate ...

Federal Courts of Appeals have recognized that Buckley does not support limitations on contributions to com-
mittees formed to favor or oppose ballot measures ...

Contributions by individuals to support concerted action by a committee advocating a position on a ballot mea-
sure is, beyond question, a very significant form of political expression. As we have noted, regulation of First
Amendment rights is always subject to exacting judicial scrutiny ... In addition, the record in this case does not
504 | CAMPAIGN FINANCE AND SPEECH

support the California Supreme Court's conclusion that § 602 is needed to preserve voters' confidence in the
ballot measure process. It is clear, therefore, that § 602 does not advance a legitimate governmental interest sig-
nificant enough to justify its infringement of First Amendment rights.

Apart from the impermissible restraint on freedom of association, but virtually inseparable from it in this con-
text, § 602 imposes a significant restraint on the freedom of expression of groups and those individuals who wish
to express their views through committees. As we have noted, an individual may make expenditures without
limit under § 602 on a ballot measure, but may not contribute beyond the $250 limit when joining with oth-
ers to advocate common views. The contribution limit thus automatically affects expenditures, and limits on
expenditures operate as a direct restraint on freedom of expression of a group or committee desiring to engage
in political dialogue concerning a ballot measure.

Whatever may be the state interest or degree of that interest in regulating and limiting contributions to or expen-
ditures of a candidate or a candidate's committees, there is no significant state or public interest in curtailing
debate and discussion of a ballot measure. Placing limits on contributions, which, in turn, limits expenditures,
plainly impairs freedom of expression. The integrity of the political system will be adequately protected if con-
tributors are identified in a public filing revealing the amounts contributed; if it is thought wise, legislation can
outlaw anonymous contributions.

A limit on contributions in this setting need not be analyzed exclusively in terms of the right of association or
the right of expression. The two rights overlap and blend; to limit the right of association places an impermissi-
ble restraint on the right of expression. The restraint imposed by the Berkeley ordinance on rights of association
and, in turn, on individual and collective rights of expression plainly contravenes both the right of association
and the speech guarantees of the First Amendment. Accordingly, the judgment of the California Supreme Court
is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

Reversed and remanded.

JUSTICE SOUTER delivered the opinion of the Court.

Since 1907, federal law has barred corporations from contributing directly to candidates for federal office. We
hold that applying the prohibition to nonprofit advocacy corporations is consistent with the First Amendment
...

Respondents are a corporation known as North Carolina Right to Life, Inc., three of its officers, and a North
Carolina voter (here, together, NCRL), who have sued the Federal Election Commission, the independent
agency set up to "administer, seek to obtain compliance with, and formulate policy with respect to" the federal
electoral laws. NCRL challenges the constitutionality of § 441b and the FEC's regulations implementing that
section, 11 CFR §§ 114.2(b), 114.10 (2003), but only so far as they apply to NCRL ... NCRL has made contri-
butions and expenditures in connection with state elections, but not federal, owing to 2 U. S. C. § 441b. Instead,
it has established a PAC, the North Carolina Right to Life, Inc., Political Action Committee, which has con-
tributed to federal candidates.

Any attack on the federal prohibition of direct corporate political contributions goes against the current of a
century of congressional efforts to curb corporations' potentially "deleterious influences on federal elections,"
which we have canvassed a number of times before. US v. Automobile Workers, (1957) ...

[O]ur cases on campaign finance regulation represent respect for the "legislative judgment that the special char-
acteristics of the corporate structure require particularly careful regulation ..." And we have understood that
such deference to legislative choice is warranted particularly when Congress regulates campaign contributions,
carrying as they do a plain threat to political integrity and a plain warrant to counter the appearance and reality
of corruption and the misuse of corporate advantages. Buckley v. Valeo, (1976) ...

Judicial deference is particularly warranted where, as here, we deal with a congressional judgment that has
remained essentially unchanged throughout a century of "careful legislative adjustment ..."

NCRL cannot prevail, then, simply by arguing that a ban on an advocacy corporation's direct contributions is
bad tailoring. NCRL would have to demonstrate that the law violated the First Amendment in allowing contri-
butions to be made only through its PAC and subject to a PAC's administrative burdens ... There is no reason
to think the burden on advocacy corporations is any greater today, or to reach a different conclusion here.

Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.

Federal law prohibits corporations and unions from using their general treasury funds to make independent
expenditures for speech defined as an "electioneering communication" or for speech expressly advocating the
election or defeat of a candidate. 2 U. S. C. §441b. Limits on electioneering communications were upheld
in McConnell v. Federal Election Comm'n, (2003). The holding of McConnell rested to a large extent on an
earlier case, Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, (1990). Austin had held that political speech may be
banned based on the speaker's corporate identity.

In this case we are asked to reconsider Austin and, in effect, McConnell. It has been noted that "Austin was a sig-
nificant departure from ancient First Amendment principles," Federal Election Comm'n v. Wisconsin Right to
Life, Inc, (2007) (WRTL) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). We agree with that con-
clusion and hold that stare decisis does not compel the continued acceptance of Austin. The Government may
regulate corporate political speech through disclaimer and disclosure requirements, but it may not suppress that
speech altogether. We turn to the case now before us ...

Citizens United is a nonprofit corporation [and] has an annual budget of about $12 million. Most of its funds
are from donations by individuals; but, in addition, it accepts a small portion of its funds from for-profit corpo-
rations.
                                                                                                 CAMPAIGN FINANCE AND SPEECH | 507

In January 2008, Citizens United released a film entitled Hillary: The Movie ... It is a 90-minute documentary
about then-Senator Hillary Clinton, who was a candidate in the Democratic Party's 2008 Presidential primary
elections. Hillary mentions Senator Clinton by name and depicts interviews with political commentators and
other persons, most of them quite critical of Senator Clinton ...

In December 2007, a cable company offered, for a payment of $1.2 million, to make Hillary available on a video-
on-demand channel called "Elections '08." Some video-on-demand services require viewers to pay a small fee to
view a selected program, but here the proposal was to make Hillary available to viewers free of charge.

To implement the proposal, Citizens United was prepared to pay for the video-on-demand; and to promote the
film, it produced two 10-second ads and one 30-second ad for Hillary. Each ad includes a short (and, in our
view, pejorative) statement about Senator Clinton, followed by the name of the movie and the movie's Website
address. Id., at 26a-27a. Citizens United desired to promote the video-on-demand offering by running adver-
tisements on broadcast and cable television.

[F]ederal law [prohibits] corporations and unions from using general treasury funds to make direct contribu-
tions to candidates or independent expenditures that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate,
through any form of media, in connection with certain qualified federal elections. 2 U. S. C. §441b (2000 ed.).
[The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA)] amended §441b to prohibit any "electioneering com-
munication" as well. An electioneering communication is defined as "any broadcast, cable, or satellite communi-
cation" that "refers to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office" and is made within 30 days of a primary or
60 days of a general election ... Corporations and unions are barred from using their general treasury funds for
express advocacy or electioneering communications. They may establish, however, a "separate segregated fund"
(known as a political action committee, or PAC) for these purposes ... The moneys received by the segregated
fund are limited to donations from stockholders and employees of the corporation ...

Citizens United wanted to make Hillary available through video-on-demand within 30 days of the 2008 primary
elections. It feared, however, that both the film and the ads would be covered by §441b's ban on corporate-
funded independent expenditures, thus subjecting the corporation to civil and criminal penalties under §437g.
In December 2007, Citizens United sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the FEC. It argued that (1)
§441b is unconstitutional as applied to Hillary; and (2) BCRA's disclaimer and disclosure requirements, BCRA
§§201 and 311, are unconstitutional as applied to Hillary and to the three ads for the movie ... We noted proba-
ble jurisdiction ...

Citizens United contends that §441b does not cover Hillary, as a matter of statutory interpretation, because the
film does not qualify as an "electioneering communication." Under the definition of electioneering communica-
tion, the video-on-demand showing of Hillary on cable television would have been a "cable ... communication"
that "refer[red] to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office" and that was made within 30 days of a primary
election. Citizens United, however, argues that Hillary was not "publicly distributed," because a single video-
on-demand transmission is sent only to a requesting cable converter box and each separate transmission, in most
instances, will be seen by just one household--not 50,000 or more persons ...
508 | CAMPAIGN FINANCE AND SPEECH

The regulation provides that the number of people who can receive a cable transmission is determined by the
number of cable subscribers in the relevant area ... Here, Citizens United wanted to use a cable video-on-demand
system that had 34.5 million subscribers nationwide ... Thus, Hillary could have been received by 50,000 per-
sons or more ... Section 441b covers Hillary.

Citizens United next argues that §441b may not be applied to Hillary under the approach taken in WRTL.
McConnell decided that §441b(b)(2)'s definition of an "electioneering communication" was facially constitu-
tional insofar as it restricted speech that was "the functional equivalent of express advocacy" for or against a
specific candidate ... WRTL then found an unconstitutional application of §441b where the speech was not
"express advocacy or its functional equivalent." (opinion of Roberts, C. J.) ...

Under this test, Hillary is equivalent to express advocacy. The movie, in essence, is a feature-length negative
advertisement that urges viewers to vote against Senator Clinton for President. In light of historical footage,
interviews with persons critical of her, and voiceover narration, the film would be understood by most viewers
as an extended criticism of Senator Clinton's character and her fitness for the office of the Presidency ...

Citizens United argues that Hillary is just "a documentary film that examines certain historical events ..." We
disagree. The movie's consistent emphasis is on the relevance of these events to Senator Clinton's candidacy for
President ...

As the District Court found, there is no reasonable interpretation of Hillary other than as an appeal to vote
against Senator Clinton. Under the standard stated in McConnell and further elaborated in WRTL, the film
qualifies as the functional equivalent of express advocacy ...

Citizens United has asserted a claim that the FEC has violated its First Amendment right to free speech. All con-
cede that this claim is properly before us ... Citizens United's argument that Austin should be overruled is ..."a
new argument to support what has been [a] consistent claim: that [the FEC] did not accord [Citizens United]
the rights it was obliged to provide by the First Amendment ..."

In the exercise of its judicial responsibility, it is necessary then for the Court to consider the facial validity of
§441b. Any other course of decision would prolong the substantial, nation-wide chilling effect caused by §441b's
prohibitions on corporate expenditures ...

[The statute] may not be a prior restraint on speech in the strict sense of that term, for prospective speakers
are not compelled by law to seek an advisory opinion from the FEC before the speech takes place. Near v. Min­
nesota ex rel. Olson, (1931). As a practical matter, however, given the complexity of the regulations and the def-
erence courts show to administrative determinations, a speaker who wants to avoid threats of criminal liability
and the heavy costs of defending against FEC enforcement must ask a governmental agency for prior permis-
sion to speak. See 2 U. S. C. §437f; 11 CFR §112.1. These onerous restrictions thus function as the equivalent
of prior restraint by giving the FEC power analogous to licensing laws implemented in 16th- and 17th-cen-
tury England, laws and governmental practices of the sort that the First Amendment was drawn to prohibit.
See Thomas v. Chicago Park Dist., (2002) [other citations omitted] ...

[T]he FEC has created a regime that allows it to select what political speech is safe for public consumption by
applying ambiguous tests. If parties want to avoid litigation and the possibility of civil and criminal penalties,
they must either refrain from speaking or ask the FEC to issue an advisory opinion approving of the political
speech in question. Government officials pore over each word of a text to see if, in their judgment, it accords with
the 11-factor test they have promulgated. This is an unprecedented governmental intervention into the realm of
speech.

The ongoing chill upon speech that is beyond all doubt protected makes it necessary in this case to invoke the
earlier precedents that a statute which chills speech can and must be invalidated where its facial invalidity has
been demonstrated. Thornhill v. Alabama, (1940). For these reasons we find it necessary to reconsider Austin ...

Section 441b is a ban on corporate speech notwithstanding the fact that a PAC created by a corporation can still
speak ... A PAC is a separate association from the corporation. So the PAC exemption from §441b's expendi-
ture ban, §441b(b)(2), does not allow corporations to speak. Even if a PAC could somehow allow a corporation
to speak--and it does not--the option to form PACs does not alleviate the First Amendment problems with
§441b. PACs are burdensome alternatives; they are expensive to administer and subject to extensive regulations
...

Section 441b's prohibition on corporate independent expenditures is thus a ban on speech. As a "restriction
on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a campaign," that
statute "necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of
their exploration, and the size of the audience reached." Buckley v. Valeo, (1976) (per curiam). Were the Court to
uphold these restrictions, the Government could repress speech by silencing certain voices at any of the various
points in the speech process ...

[P]olitical speech must prevail against laws that would suppress it, whether by design or inadvertence. Laws
that burden political speech are "subject to strict scrutiny," which requires the Government to prove that the
restriction "furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest." WRTL (opinion of
Roberts, C. J.) ... [T]he quoted language from WRTL provides a sufficient framework for protecting the rele-
vant First Amendment interests in this case. We shall employ it here ...

[T]he Government may commit a constitutional wrong when by law it identifies certain preferred speakers. By
taking the right to speak from some and giving it to others, the Government deprives the disadvantaged person
or class of the right to use speech to strive to establish worth, standing, and respect for the speaker's voice. The
Government may not by these means deprive the public of the right and privilege to determine for itself what
speech and speakers are worthy of consideration. The First Amendment protects speech and speaker, and the
ideas that flow from each ...

We find no basis for the proposition that, in the context of political speech, the Government may impose restric-
tions on certain disfavored speakers. Both history and logic lead us to this conclusion ...
510 | CAMPAIGN FINANCE AND SPEECH

The Court has recognized that First Amendment protection extends to corporations ... This protection has been
extended by explicit holdings to the context of political speech. Grosjean v. American Press Co., (1936). Under
the rationale of these precedents, political speech does not lose First Amendment protection "simply because its
source is a corporation." Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. Public Util. Comm'n of Cal., (1986) (plurality opinion) ...

[T]he Austin Court identified a new governmental interest in limiting political speech: an antidistortion inter-
est. Austin found a compelling governmental interest in preventing "the corrosive and distorting effects of
immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or
no correlation to the public's support for the corporation's political ideas ..."

In its defense of the corporate-speech restrictions in §441b, the Government notes the antidistortion rationale
on which Austin and its progeny rest in part, yet it all but abandons reliance upon it. It argues instead that two
other compelling interests support Austin's holding that corporate expenditure restrictions are constitutional:
an anticorruption interest (Stevens, J., concurring), and a shareholder-protection interest (Brennan, J., concur-
ring). We consider the three points in turn ...

If the First Amendment has any force, it prohibits Congress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of
citizens, for simply engaging in political speech. If the antidistortion rationale were to be accepted, however, it
would permit Government to ban political speech simply because the speaker is an association that has taken on
the corporate form ... This troubling assertion of brooding governmental power cannot be reconciled with the
confidence and stability in civic discourse that the First Amendment must secure ...

The rule that political speech cannot be limited based on a speaker's wealth is a necessary consequence of the
premise that the First Amendment generally prohibits the suppression of political speech based on the speaker's
identity ... Either as support for its antidistortion rationale or as a further argument, the Austin majority under-
took to distinguish wealthy individuals from corporations on the ground that "[s]tate law grants corporations
special advantages--such as limited liability, perpetual life, and favorable treatment of the accumulation and dis-
tribution of assets." This does not suffice, however, to allow laws prohibiting speech."It is rudimentary that the
State cannot exact as the price of those special advantages the forfeiture of First Amendment rights." (Scalia, J.,
dissenting) ...

Austin's antidistortion rationale would produce the dangerous, and unacceptable, consequence that Congress
could ban political speech of media corporations ... Media corporations are now exempt from §441b's ban on
corporate expenditures ... Yet media corporations accumulate wealth with the help of the corporate form, the
largest media corporations have "immense aggregations of wealth," and the views expressed by media corpora-
tions often "have little or no correlation to the public's support" for those views. Thus, under the Government's
reasoning, wealthy media corporations could have their voices diminished to put them on par with other media
entities. There is no precedent for permitting this under the First Amendment.

The media exemption discloses further difficulties with the law now under consideration. There is no precedent
supporting laws that attempt to distinguish between corporations which are deemed to be exempt as media cor-
                                                                                                  CAMPAIGN FINANCE AND SPEECH | 511

porations and those which are not ... With the advent of the Internet and the decline of print and broadcast
media, moreover, the line between the media and others who wish to comment on political and social issues
becomes far more blurred.

The law's exception for media corporations is, on its own terms, all but an admission of the invalidity of the
antidistortion rationale. And the exemption results in a further, separate reason for finding this law invalid:
Again by its own terms, the law exempts some corporations but covers others, even though both have the need or
the motive to communicate their views ... This differential treatment cannot be squared with the First Amend-
ment ...

When Government seeks to use its full power, including the criminal law, to command where a person may get
his or her information or what distrusted source he or she may not hear, it uses censorship to control thought.
This is unlawful. The First Amendment confirms the freedom to think for ourselves ...

For the most part relinquishing the antidistortion rationale, the Government falls back on the argument that
corporate political speech can be banned in order to prevent corruption or its appearance. In Buckley, the Court
found this interest "sufficiently important" to allow limits on contributions but did not extend that reasoning
to expenditure limits ...

With regard to large direct contributions, Buckley reasoned that they could be given "to secure a political quid
pro quo," and that "the scope of such pernicious practices can never be reliably ascertained." The practices Buck­
ley noted would be covered by bribery laws ... if a quid pro quo arrangement were proved ...

The anticorruption interest is not sufficient to displace the speech here in question. Indeed, 26 States do not
restrict independent expenditures by for-profit corporations. The Government does not claim that these expen-
ditures have corrupted the political process in those States ... For the reasons explained above, we now conclude
that independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the
appearance of corruption ...

When Congress finds that a problem exists, we must give that finding due deference; but Congress may not
choose an unconstitutional remedy. If elected officials succumb to improper influences from independent
expenditures; if they surrender their best judgment; and if they put expediency before principle, then surely
there is cause for concern. We must give weight to attempts by Congress to seek to dispel either the appearance
or the reality of these influences. The remedies enacted by law, however, must comply with the First Amend-
ment; and, it is our law and our tradition that more speech, not less, is the governing rule. An outright ban on
corporate political speech during the critical preelection period is not a permissible remedy. Here Congress has
created categorical bans on speech that are asymmetrical to preventing quid pro quo corruption ...

[I]t must be concluded that Austin was not well reasoned. The Government defends Austin, relying almost
entirely on "the quid pro quo interest, the corruption interest or the shareholder interest," and not Austin's
expressed antidistortion rationale ... When neither party defends the reasoning of a precedent, the principle
512 | CAMPAIGN FINANCE AND SPEECH

of adhering to that precedent through stare decisis is diminished. Austin abandoned First Amendment princi-
ples, furthermore, by relying on language in some of our precedents that traces back to the Automobile Work­
ers Court's flawed historical account of campaign finance laws ...

Austin is undermined by experience since its announcement. Political speech is so ingrained in our culture that
speakers find ways to circumvent campaign finance laws ... Our Nation's speech dynamic is changing, and infor-
mative voices should not have to circumvent onerous restrictions to exercise their First Amendment rights.
Speakers have become adept at presenting citizens with sound bites, talking points, and scripted messages that
dominate the 24-hour news cycle. Corporations, like individuals, do not have monolithic views. On certain top-
ics corporations may possess valuable expertise, leaving them the best equipped to point out errors or fallacies in
speech of all sorts, including the speech of candidates and elected officials ...

Due consideration leads to this conclusion: Austin should be and now is overruled. We return to the principle
established in Buckley and Bellotti that the Government may not suppress political speech on the basis of the
speaker's corporate identity. No sufficient governmental interest justifies limits on the political speech of non-
profit or for-profit corporations ...

Given our conclusion we are further required to overrule the part of McConnell that upheld BCRA §203's
extension of §441b's restrictions on corporate independent expenditures ... The McConnell Court relied on the
antidistortion interest recognized in Austin to uphold a greater restriction on speech than the restriction upheld
in Austin ... and we have found this interest unconvincing and insufficient. This part of McConnell is now over-
ruled ...

Some members of the public might consider Hillary to be insightful and instructive; some might find it to be
neither high art nor a fair discussion on how to set the Nation's course; still others simply might suspend judg-
ment on these points but decide to think more about issues and candidates. Those choices and assessments,
however, are not for the Government to make. "The First Amendment underwrites the freedom to experiment
and to create in the realm of thought and speech. Citizens must be free to use new forms, and new forums, for
the expression of ideas. The civic discourse belongs to the people, and the Government may not prescribe the
means used to conduct it." McConnell, (opinion of Kennedy, J.).

The judgment of the District Court is reversed with respect to the constitutionality of 2 U. S. C. §441b's restric-
tions on corporate independent expenditures. The judgment is affirmed with respect to BCRA's disclaimer and
disclosure requirements. The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

McCutcheon v. FEC

572 U.S. 185 (2010)

    Vote: 5-4
    Decision: Reversed
    Plurality: Roberts, joined by Scalia, Kennedy, Alito
    Concurrence: Thomas (in judgment)
    Dissent: Breyer, joined by Ginsburg, Sotomayor, Kagan

Chief Justice Roberts announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which Justice Scalia,
Justice Kennedy, and Justice Alito join.

There is no right more basic in our democracy than the right to participate in electing our political leaders. Cit-
izens can exercise that right in a variety of ways: They can run for office themselves, vote, urge others to vote for
a particular candidate, volunteer to work on a campaign, and contribute to a candidate's campaign. This case is
about the last of those options ...

In a series of cases over the past 40 years, we have spelled out how to draw the constitutional line between the
permissible goal of avoiding corruption in the political process and the impermissible desire simply to limit polit-
ical speech. We have said that government regulation may not target the general gratitude a candidate may feel
toward those who support him or his allies, or the political access such support may afford. "Ingratiation and
access ... are not corruption." Citizens United v. Federal Election Comm'n, (2010). They embody a central fea-
ture of democracy--that constituents support candidates who share their beliefs and interests, and candidates
who are elected can be expected to be responsive to those concerns ...

The statute at issue in this case imposes two types of limits on campaign contributions. The first, called base
limits, restricts how much money a donor may contribute to a particular candidate or committee. 2 U. S. C.
§441a(a)(1). The second, called aggregate limits, restricts how much money a donor may contribute in total to
all candidates or committees. §441a(a)(3).

This case does not involve any challenge to the base limits, which we have previously upheld as serving the per-
missible objective of combatting corruption. The Government contends that the aggregate limits also serve that
objective, by preventing circumvention of the base limits. We conclude, however, that the aggregate limits do lit-
tle, if anything, to address that concern, while seriously restricting participation in the democratic process. The
aggregate limits are therefore invalid under the First Amendment ...

[The amended FECA act contains base contribution limits for various types of donors including individuals and
PACs.]

The base limits apply with equal force to contributions that are "in any way earmarked or otherwise directed
through an intermediary or conduit" to a candidate. §441a(a)(8). If, for example, a donor gives money to a party
committee but directs the party committee to pass the contribution along to a particular candidate, then the
transaction is treated as a contribution from the original donor to the specified candidate ...
514 | CAMPAIGN FINANCE AND SPEECH

The base limits thus restrict how much money a donor may contribute to any particular candidate or committee;
the aggregate limits have the effect of restricting how many candidates or committees the donor may support, to
the extent permitted by the base limits ...

In the 2011-2012 election cycle, appellant Shaun McCutcheon contributed a total of $33,088 to 16 different
federal candidates, in compliance with the base limits applicable to each. He alleges that he wished to contribute
$1,776 to each of 12 additional candidates but was prevented from doing so by the aggregate limit on contri-
butions to candidates. McCutcheon also contributed a total of $27,328 to several noncandidate political com-
mittees, in compliance with the base limits applicable to each. He alleges that he wished to contribute to various
other political committees, including $25,000 to each of the three Republican national party committees, but
was prevented from doing so by the aggregate limit on contributions to political committees. McCutcheon fur-
ther alleges that he plans to make similar contributions in the future ...

In June 2012, McCutcheon and the RNC filed a complaint before a three-judge panel of the U. S. District
Court for the District of Columbia ... The three-judge District Court denied appellants' motion for a prelimi-
nary injunction and granted the Government's motion to dismiss. Assuming that the base limits appropriately
served the Government's anticorruption interest, the District Court concluded that the aggregate limits survived
First Amendment scrutiny because they prevented evasion of the base limits ...

McCutcheon and the RNC appealed directly to this Court, as authorized by law. 28 U. S. C. §1253. In such a
case, "we ha[ve] no discretion to refuse adjudication of the case on its merits," Hicks v. Miranda, (1975), and
accordingly we noted probable jurisdiction ...

The First Amendment "is designed and intended to remove governmental restraints from the arena of public
discussion, putting the decision as to what views shall be voiced largely into the hands of each of us, ... in the
belief that no other approach would comport with the premise of individual dignity and choice upon which our
political system rests." Cohen v. California, (1971). As relevant here, the First Amendment safeguards an indi-
vidual's right to participate in the public debate through political expression and political association ... When
an individual contributes money to a candidate, he exercises both of those rights: The contribution "serves as a
general expression of support for the candidate and his views" and "serves to affiliate a person with a candidate."

Buckley acknowledged that aggregate limits at least diminish an individual's right of political association ... But
the Court characterized that restriction as a "quite modest restraint upon protected political activity ..." We can-
not agree with that characterization. An aggregate limit on how many candidates and committees an individual
may support through contributions is not a "modest restraint" at all. The Government may no more restrict
how many candidates or causes a donor may support than it may tell a newspaper how many candidates it may
endorse.

To put it in the simplest terms, the aggregate limits prohibit an individual from fully contributing to the primary
and general election campaigns of ten or more candidates, even if all contributions fall within the base limits
Congress views as adequate to protect against corruption ... [T]he limits deny the individual all ability to exercise
                                                                                                  CAMPAIGN FINANCE AND SPEECH | 515

his expressive and associational rights by contributing to someone who will advocate for his policy preferences.
A donor must limit the number of candidates he supports, and may have to choose which of several policy con-
cerns he will advance--clear First Amendment harms that the dissent never acknowledges.

It is no answer to say that the individual can simply contribute less money to more people. To require one person
to contribute at lower levels than others because he wants to support more candidates or causes is to impose
a special burden on broader participation in the democratic process. And as we have recently admonished, the
Government may not penalize an individual for "robustly exercis[ing]" his First Amendment rights. Davis v.
Federal Election Comm'n, (2008).

The First Amendment burden is especially great for individuals who do not have ready access to alternative
avenues for supporting their preferred politicians and policies. In the context of base contribution limits, Buckley
observed that a supporter could vindicate his associational interests by personally volunteering his time and
energy on behalf of a candidate ... Such personal volunteering is not a realistic alternative for those who wish to
support a wide variety of candidates or causes. Other effective methods of supporting preferred candidates or
causes without contributing money are reserved for a select few, such as entertainers capable of raising hundreds
of thousands of dollars in a single evening ...

With the significant First Amendment costs for individual citizens in mind, we turn to the governmental inter-
ests asserted in this case. This Court has identified only one legitimate governmental interest for restricting cam-
paign finances: preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption. We have consistently rejected attempts
to suppress campaign speech based on other legislative objectives. No matter how desirable it may seem, it is
not an acceptable governmental objective to "level the playing field," or to "level electoral opportunities," or to
"equaliz[e] the financial resources of candidates ..." The First Amendment prohibits such legislative attempts to
"fine-tun[e]" the electoral process, no matter how well intentioned ...

[W]hile preventing corruption or its appearance is a legitimate objective, Congress may target only a specific
type of corruption--"quid pro quo" corruption. As Buckley explained, Congress may permissibly seek to rein in
"large contributions [that] are given to secure a political quid pro quo from current and potential office holders
..."

Spending large sums of money in connection with elections, but not in connection with an effort to control
the exercise of an officeholder's official duties, does not give rise to such quid pro quo corruption. Nor does the
possibility that an individual who spends large sums may garner "influence over or access to" elected officials or
political parties. McConnell v. Federal Election Comm'n, (2003) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment in part
and dissenting in part). And because the Government's interest in preventing the appearance of corruption is
equally confined to the appearance of quid pro quo corruption, the Government may not seek to limit the
appearance of mere influence or access ...

"When the Government restricts speech, the Government bears the burden of proving the constitutionality of
its actions." United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., (1996). Here, the Government seeks to carry
that burden by arguing that the aggregate limits further the permissible objective of preventing quid pro quo
corruption.
516 | CAMPAIGN FINANCE AND SPEECH

The difficulty is that once the aggregate limits kick in, they ban all contributions of any amount. But Congress's
selection of a $5,200 base limit indicates its belief that contributions of that amount or less do not create a cog-
nizable risk of corruption. If there is no corruption concern in giving nine candidates up to $5,200 each, it is
difficult to understand how a tenth candidate can be regarded as corruptible if given $1,801, and all others cor-
ruptible if given a dime. And if there is no risk that additional candidates will be corrupted by donations of up
to $5,200, then the Government must defend the aggregate limits by demonstrating that they prevent circum-
vention of the base limits ...

[T]he aggregate limits violate the First Amendment because they are not "closely drawn to avoid unnecessary
abridgment of associational freedoms." Buckley. In the First Amendment context, fit matters. Even when the
Court is not applying strict scrutiny, we still require "a fit that is not necessarily perfect, but reasonable; that rep-
resents not necessarily the single best disposition but one whose scope is `in proportion to the interest served,'
... that employs not necessarily the least restrictive means but ... a means narrowly tailored to achieve the desired
objective." Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, (1989) (quoting In re R. M. J., (1982)). Here, because
the statute is poorly tailored to the Government's interest in preventing circumvention of the base limits, it
impermissibly restricts participation in the political process ...

The Government argues that the aggregate limits are justified because they prevent an individual from giving to
too many initial recipients who might subsequently recontribute a donation. After all, only recontributed funds
can conceivably give rise to circumvention of the base limits. Yet all indications are that many types of recipients
have scant interest in regifting donations they receive ...

Based on what we can discern from experience, the indiscriminate ban on all contributions above the aggregate
limits is disproportionate to the Government's interest in preventing circumvention. The Government has not
given us any reason to believe that parties or candidates would dramatically shift their priorities if the aggregate
limits were lifted. Absent such a showing, we cannot conclude that the sweeping aggregate limits are appro-
priately tailored to guard against any contributions that might implicate the Government's anticircumvention
interest.

For the past 40 years, our campaign finance jurisprudence has focused on the need to preserve authority for the
Government to combat corruption, without at the same time compromising the political responsiveness at the
heart of the democratic process, or allowing the Government to favor some participants in that process over
others. As Edmund Burke explained in his famous speech to the electors of Bristol, a representative owes con-
stituents the exercise of his "mature judgment," but judgment informed by "the strictest union, the closest cor-
respondence, and the most unreserved communication with his constituents ..." Constituents have the right to
support candidates who share their views and concerns. Representatives are not to follow constituent orders,
but can be expected to be cognizant of and responsive to those concerns. Such responsiveness is key to the very
concept of self-governance through elected officials.

The Government has a strong interest, no less critical to our democratic system, in combatting corruption and
its appearance. We have, however, held that this interest must be limited to a specific kind of corruption--quid
pro quo corruption--in order to ensure that the Government's efforts do not have the effect of restricting the
                                                                                                  CAMPAIGN FINANCE AND SPEECH | 517

First Amendment right of citizens to choose who shall govern them. For the reasons set forth, we conclude that
the aggregate limits on contributions do not further the only governmental interest this Court accepted as legit-
imate in Buckley. They instead intrude without justification on a citizen's ability to exercise "the most funda-
mental First Amendment activities." Buckley.

The judgment of the District Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.

It is so ordered.

...

When the Fourth and Fifth Amendments were adopted, "the form that evil had theretofore taken," had been
necessarily simple. Force and violence were then the only means known to man by which a Government could
directly effect self-incrimination. It could compel the individual to testify-a compulsion effected, if need be, by
torture. It could secure possession of his papers and other articles incident to his private life-a seizure effected,
if need be, by breaking and entry. Protection against such invasion of "the sanctities of a man's home and the
privacies of life" was provided in the Fourth and Fifth Amendments by specific language.

But "time works changes, brings into existence new conditions and purposes." Subtler and more far-reaching
means of invading privacy have become available to the Government. Discovery and invention have made it pos-
sible for the Government, by means far more effective than stretching upon the rack, to obtain. disclosure in
court of what is whispered in the closet. Moreover, "in the application of a constitution, our contemplation can-
not be only of what has been but of what may be." The progress of science in furnishing the Government with
means of espionage is not likely to stop with wire-tapping. Ways may someday be developed by which the Gov-
ernment, without removing papers from secret drawers, can reproduce them in court, and by which it will be
enabled to expose to a jury the most intimate occurrences of the home. Advances in the psychic and related sci-
ences may bring means of exploring unexpressed beliefs, thoughts and emotions.

The principles laid down in this opinion affect the very essence of constitutional liberty and security. They reach
farther than the concrete form of the case there before the court, with its adventitious circumstances; they apply
to all invasions on the part of the Government and its employees of the sanctities of a man's home and the priva-
cies of life.

It is not the breaking of his doors, and the rummaging of his drawers, that constitutes the essence of the offence;

The authority of the State to enact this statute [compulsory vaccination law] is to be referred to what is com-
monly called the police power-a power which the State did not surrender when becoming a member of the
Union under the Constitution. Although this court has refrained from any attempt to define the limits of that
power, yet it has distinctly recognized the authority of a State to enact quarantine laws and "health laws of every
description;" indeed, all laws that relate to matters completely within its territory and which do not by their,
necessary operation affect the people of other States. According to settled principles the police power of a State
must be held to embrace, at least, such reasonable regulations established directly by legislative enactment as will
protect the public health and the public safety.

It is equally true that the State may invest local bodies called into existence `for purposes of local administration
with authority in some appropriate way to safeguard the public health and the public safety. The mode or man-
ner in which those results are to be accomplished is within the discretion of the State, subject, of course, so far as
Federal power is concerned, only to the condition that no rule prescribed by a State, nor any regulation adopted
by a local governmental, agency acting under the sanction of state legislation, shall contravene the Constitution
... or infringe any right granted or secured by that. instrument. A local enactment or regulation, even if based on
the acknowledged police powers of a State, must always yield in case of conflict with the exercise by the General
Government of any power it possesses under the Constitution, or with any right which that instrument gives or
secures ...
522 | BUILDING A RIGHT

We come, then, to inquire whether any right given, or secured by' the Constitution, is invaded by the statute as
interpreted by the state court. The defendant insists that his liberty is invaded when the State subjects him to
fine or imprisonment for neglecting or refusing to submit to vaccination; that a compulsory vaccination law is
unreasonable, arbitrary and oppressive, and, therefore, hostile to the inherent right of every freeman to care for
his own body and health in such way as to him seems best; and that the' execution of such a law against one
who objects to vaccination, no matter for what reason, is nothing short of an assault upon his person. But the
liberty secured by the Constitution of the United States to every person within its jurisdiction does not import
an absolute right in each person to be, at all times and in all circumstances, wholly freed from restraint. There
are manifold restraints to which every person is necessarily subject for the common good. On any other basis
organized society could not exist with safety to its members. Society based on the rule that each one is a law unto
himself would soon be confronted with disorder and anarchy. Real liberty for all could not exist under the oper-
ation of a principle which recognizes the right of each individual person to use his own, whether in respect of
his person or his property, regardless of the injury that may be done to others. This court has more than once
recognized it as a fundamental principle that "persons and property are subjected to all kinds of restraints and
burdens, in order to secure the general comfort, health, and prosperity of the State; of the perfect right of the
legislature to do which no question ever was, or upon acknowledged general principles ever can be made, so far
as natural persons are concerned. ..."

Applying these principles to the present case, it is to be observed that the legislature of Massachusetts required
the inhabitants of a city or town to be vaccinated only when, in the opinion of the Board of Health, that was
necessary for the public health or the public safety. The authority to determine for all what ought to be done
in such an emergency must have been lodged somewhere or in some body; and surely it was appropriate for the
legislature to refer that question, in the first instance, to a Board of Health, composed of persons residing in
the locality affected and appointed, presumably, because of their fitness to determine such questions. To invest
such a body with authority over such matters was not an unusual nor an unreasonable or arbitrary requirement.
Upon the principle of self-defense, of paramount necessity, a community has the right to protect itself against
an epidemic of disease which threatens the safety of its members. It is to be observed that when the regulation in
question was adopted, smallpox, according to the recitals in the regulation adopted by the Board of Health, was
prevalent to some extent in the city of Cambridge and the disease was increasing ...

We say necessities of the case, because it might be that an acknowledged power of a local community to protect
itself against an epidemic threatening the safety of all, might be exercised in particular circumstances and in ref-
erence to particular persons in such an arbitrary, unreasonable manner, or might go so far beyond what was rea-
sonably required for the safety of the public, as to authorize or compel the courts to interfere for the protection
of such persons. In Railroad Company v. Husen, this court recognized the right of a State to pass sanitary laws,
laws for the protection of life, liberty, health or property within its limits, laws to prevent persons and animals
suffering under contagious or infectious diseases, or convicts, from coming within its borders. But as the laws
there involved went beyond the necessity of the case and under the guise of exerting a police power invaded the
domain of Federal authority and violated rights secured by the Constitution, this court deemed it to be its duty
to hold such laws invalid. If the mode adopted by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for the protection of its
local communities against smallpox proved to be distressing, inconvenient or objectionable to some-if nothing
                                                                                                                        BUILDING A RIGHT | 523

more could be reasonably affirmed of the statute in question-the answer is that it was the duty of the constituted
authorities primarily to keep in view the welfare, comfort and safety of the many, and not permit the interests of
the many to be subordinated to the wishes or convenience of the few. There is, of course, a sphere within which
the individual may assert the supremacy of his own will and rightfully dispute the authority of any human gov-
ernment, especially of any free government existing under a written constitution, to interfere with the exercise of
that will. But it is equally true that in every well-ordered society charged with the duty of conserving the safety
of its members the rights of the individual in respect of his liberty may at times, under the pressure of great, dan-
gers, be subjected to such restraint, to be enforced by reasonable regulations, as the safety of the general public
may demand ... Nearly every State of the Union has statutes to encourage, or directly or indirectly to require,
vaccination, and this is true of most nations of Europe.

If such be the privilege of a minority then a like privilege would belong to each individual of the community,
and the spectacle would be presented of the welfare and safety of an entire population being subordinated to
the notions of a single individual who chooses to remain a part of that population. We are unwilling to hold it
to be an element in the liberty secured by the Constitution of the United States that one person, or a minority
of persons, residing in any community and enjoying the benefits of its local government, should have the power
thus to dominate the majority when supported in their action by the authority of the State. While this court
should guard with firmness every right appertaining to life, liberty or property as secured to the individual by
the Supreme Law of the Land, it is of the last importance that it should not invade the domain of local authority
except when it is plainly necessary to do so in order to enforce that law. The safety and the health of the peo-
ple of Massachusetts are, in the first instance, for that Commonwealth to guard and protect. They are matters
that do not ordinarily concern the National Government. So far as they can be reached by any government, they
depend, primarily, upon such action as the State in its wisdom may take; and we do not perceive that this legis-
lation has invaded any right secured by the Federal Constitution.

The judgment of the court below must be affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Meyer v. Nebraska

262 U.S. 390 (1923)

    Vote: 7-2
    Decision: Reversed
    Majority: McReynolds, Taft, McKenna, Van Devanter, Brandeis, Butler, Sanford
    Dissent: Holmes

Mr. Justice McReynolds delivered the opinion of the Court.

...

Plaintiff in error was tried and convicted in the District Court for Hamilton County, Nebraska, under an infor-
mation which charged that on May 25, 1920, while an instructor in Zion Parochial School, he unlawfully taught
the subject of reading in the German language to Raymond Parpart, a child of ten years, who had not attained
and successfully passed the eighth grade. The information is based upon "An act relating to the teaching of for-
eign languages in the State of Nebraska," approved April 9, 1919, which follows [Laws 1919, c. 249.]:

"Sec. 1. No person, individually or as a teacher, shall, in any private, denominational, parochial or public school,
teach any subject to any person in any language other than the English language."

Sec. 2. Languages, other than the English language, may be taught as languages only after a pupil shall have
attained and successfully passed the eighth grade as evidenced by a certificate of graduation issued by the county
superintendent of the county in which the child resides."

Sec. 3. Any person who violates any of the provisions of this act shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and
upon conviction, shall be subject to a fine of not less than twenty-five dollars ($25), nor more than one hundred
dollars ($100) or be confined in the county jail for any period not exceeding thirty days for each offense."

The Supreme Court of the State affirmed the judgment of conviction. And it held that the statute forbidding
this did not conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment, but was a valid exercise of the police power ...

To allow the children of foreigners, who had emigrated here, to be taught from early childhood the language of
the country of their parents was to rear them with that language as their mother tongue. It was to educate them
so that they must always think in that language, and, as a consequence, naturally inculcate in them the ideas and
sentiments foreign to the best interests of this country. The statute, therefore, was intended not only to require
that the education of all children be conducted in the English language, but that, until they had grown into that
language and until it had become a part of them, they should not in the schools be taught any other language.
The obvious purpose of this statute was that the English language should be and become the mother tongue of
all children reared in this state. The enactment of such a statute comes reasonably within the police power of the
state ...
                                                                                                                        BUILDING A RIGHT | 525

The problem for our determination is whether the statute as construed and applied unreasonably infringes the
liberty guaranteed to the plaintiff ... by the Fourteenth Amendment ."No State shall ... deprive any person of life,
liberty, or property, without due process of law ..."

Without doubt, it denotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the individual to con-
tract, to engage in any of the common occupations of life, to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, establish a
home and bring up children, to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, and generally to
enjoy those privileges long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free
men.

The established doctrine is that this liberty may not be interfered with, under the guise of protecting the public
interest, by legislative action which is arbitrary or without reasonable relation to some purpose within the com-
petency of the State to effect. Determination by the legislature of what constitutes proper exercise of police
power is not final or conclusive but is subject to supervision by the courts ...

Mere knowledge of the German language cannot reasonably be regarded as harmful. Heretofore it has been com-
monly looked upon as helpful and desirable. Plaintiff in error taught this language in school as part of his occu-
pation. His right thus to teach and the right of parents to engage him so to instruct their children, we think, are
within the liberty of the Amendment ...

That the State may do much, go very far, indeed, in order to improve the quality of its citizens, physically, men-
tally and morally, is clear; but the individual has certain fundamental rights which must be respected. The pro-
tection of the Constitution extends to all, to those who speak other languages as well as to those born with
English on the tongue. Perhaps it would be highly advantageous if all had ready understanding of our ordinary
speech, but this cannot be coerced by methods which conflict with the Constitution-a desirable end cannot be
promoted by prohibited means ...

The judgment of the court below must be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not incon-
sistent with this opinion.

Reversed.

Pierce v. Society of Sisters

68 U.S. 510 (1925)

    Vote: 9-0
    Decision: Affirmed
    Majority: Taft, joined by, Holmes, Van Devanter, McReynolds, Brandies, Sutherland, Butler, Sanford, Stone

MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.

These appeals are from decrees, based upon undenied allegations, which granted preliminary orders restraining
appellants from threatening or attempting to enforce the Compulsory Education Act 1 adopted November 7,
1922 * * * by the voters of Oregon.

They present the same points of law; there are no controverted questions of fact ... The challenged act, effective
September 1, 1926, requires every parent, guardian, or other person having control or charge or custody of a
child between 8 and 16 years to send him `to a public school for the period of time a public school shall be held
during the current year' in the district where the child resides; and failure so to do is declared a misdemeanor.
There are exemptions-not specially important here-for children who are not normal, or who have completed the
eighth grade, or whose parents or private teachers reside at considerable distances from any public school, or who
hold special permits from the county superintendent. The manifest purpose is to compel general attendance at
public schools by normal children, between 8 and 16, who have not completed the eighth grade. And without
doubt enforcement of the statute would seriously impair, perhaps destroy, the profitable features of appellees'
business and greatly diminish the value of their property.

Appellee the Society of Sisters is an Oregon corporation, organized in 1880, with power to care for orphans, edu-
cate and instruct the youth, establish and maintain academies or schools, and acquire necessary real and personal
property. It has long devoted its property and effort to the secular and religious education and care of children,
and has acquired the valuable good will of many parents and guardians. It conducts interdependent primary and
high schools and junior colleges, and maintains orphanages for the custody and control of children between 8
and 16. In its primary schools many 545 children between those ages are taught the subjects usually pursued in
Oregon public schools during the first eight years. Systematic religious instruction and moral training according
to the tenets of the Roman Catholic Church are also regularly provided.

The Compulsory Education Act of 1922 has already caused the withdrawal from its schools of children who
would otherwise continue, and their income has steadily declined ... [T]he Society's bill alleges that the enact-
ment conflicts with the right of parents to choose schools where their children will receive appropriate mental
and religious training, the right of the child to influence the parents' choice of a school, the right of schools and
teachers therein to engage in a useful business or profession, and is accordingly repugnant to the Constitution
and void. * * *
§                                                                                                                       BUILDING A RIGHT | 527

The {three judge} court ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment guaranteed appellees against the deprivation of
their property without due process of law consequent upon the unlawful interference by appellants with the
free choice of patrons, present and prospective. * * *

No question is raised concerning the power of the state reasonably to regulate all schools, to inspect, supervise
and examine them, their teachers and pupils; to require that all children of proper age attend some school, that
teachers shall be of good moral character and patriotic disposition, that certain studies plainly essential to good
citizenship must be taught, and that nothing be taught which is manifestly inimical to the public welfare. The
inevitable practical result of enforcing the act under consideration would be destruction of appellees' primary
schools, and perhaps all other private primary schools for normal children within the state of Oregon. Appellees
are engaged in a kind of undertaking not inherently harmful, but long regarded as useful and meritorious. Cer-
tainly there is nothing in the present records to indicate that they have failed to discharge their obligations to
patrons, students, or the state. And there are no peculiar circumstances or present emergencies which demand
extraordinary measures relative to primary education. Under the doctrine of Meyer v. Nebraska, we think it
entirely plain that the Act of 1922 unreasonably interferes with the liberty of parents and guardians to direct the
upbringing and education of children under their control. As often heretofore pointed out, rights guaranteed by
the Constitution may not be abridged by legislation which has no reasonable relation to some purpose within
the competency of the state. The fundamental theory of liberty upon which all governments in this Union
repose excludes any general power of the state to standardize its children by forcing them to accept instruction
from public teachers only. The child is not the mere creature of the state; those who nurture him and direct his
destiny have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare him for additional obligations. * * *

The decrees below are affirmed.

Mr. Justice Holmes delivered the opinion of the Court.

The case comes here upon the contention that the statute authorizing the judgment is void under the Four-
teenth Amendment as denying to the plaintiff in error due process of law and the equal protection of the laws.
528 | BUILDING A RIGHT

Carrie Buck is a feebleminded white woman who was committed to the State Colony above mentioned in due
form. She is the daughter of a feebleminded mother in the same institution, and the mother of an illegitimate
feebleminded child. She was eighteen years old at the time of the trial of her case in the Circuit Court, in the
latter part of 1924. An Act of Virginia, approved March 20, 1924, recites that the health of the patient and the
welfare of society may be promoted in certain cases by the sterilization of mental defectives, under careful safe-
guard, &c.; that the sterilization may be effected in males by vasectomy and in females, by salpingectomy, with-
out serious pain or substantial danger to life; that the Commonwealth is supporting in various institutions many
defective *persons who if now discharged would become a menace but if incapable of procreating might be dis-
charged with safety and become self-supporting with benefit to themselves and to society; and that experience
has shown that heredity plays an important part in the transmission of insanity, imbecility, &c. The statute then
enacts that whenever the superintendent of certain institutions including the above named State Colony shall
be of opinion that it is for the best interests of the patients and of society that an inmate under his care should
be sexually sterilized, he may have the operation performed upon any patient afflicted with hereditary forms of
insanity, imbecility, &c., on complying with the very careful provisions by which the act protects the patients
from possible abuse.

The attack is not upon the procedure but upon the substantive law. It seems to be contended that in no cir-
cumstances could such an order be justified. It certainly is contended that the order cannot be justified upon
the existing grounds. -The judgment finds the facts that have been recited and that Carrie Buck "is the probable
potential parent of socially inadequate offspring, likewise afflicted, that she may be sexually sterilized without
detriment to her general health and that her welfare and that of society will be promoted by her sterilization,"
and thereupon makes the order. In view of the general declarations of the legislature and the specific findings of
the Court, obviously we cannot say as matter of law that the grounds do not exist, and if they exist they justify
the result. We have seen more than once that the public welfare may call upon the best citizens for their lives. It
would be strange if it could not call upon those who already sap the strength of the State for these lesser sacri-
fices, often not felt to be such by those concerned, in order to prevent our being swamped with incompetence. It
is better for all the world, if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime, or to let them starve for
their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind. The principle
that sustains compulsory vaccination is broad enough to cover cutting the Fallopian tubes. Jacobson v. Massa-
chusetts, 197 U. S. 11. Three generations of imbeciles are enough.

    Opinion: J. Douglas
    Majority: Douglas, Roberts, Black, Reed, Frankfurter, Murphy, Byrnes
    Concurring: J. Jackson, J. Stone

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.

This case touches a sensitive and important area of human rights. Oklahoma deprives certain individuals of a
right which is basic to the perpetuation of a race-the right to have offspring. Oklahoma has decreed the enforce-
ment of its law against petitioner, overruling his claim that it violated the Fourteenth Amendment. Because
that decision raised grave and substantial constitutional questions, we granted the petition for certiorari. The
statute involved is Oklahoma's Habitual Criminal Sterilization Act. Okl.St.Ann. Tit. 57, §171, et seq. That Act
defines an `habitual criminal' as a person who, having been convicted two or more times for crimes `amounting
to felonies involving moral turpitude' either in an Oklahoma court or in a court of any other State, is thereafter
convicted of such a felony in Oklahoma and is sentenced to a term of imprisonment in an Oklahoma penal insti-
tution. Machinery is provided for the institution by the Attorney General of a proceeding against such a person
in the Oklahoma courts for a judgment that such person shall be rendered sexually sterile.

Notice, an opportunity to be heard, and the right to a jury trial are provided. The issues triable in such a pro-
ceeding are narrow and confined. If the court or jury finds that the defendant is an `habitual criminal' and that
he `may be rendered sexually sterile without detriment to his or her general health', then the court `shall render
judgment to the effect that said defendant be rendered sexually sterile' by the operation of vasectomy in case of
a male and of salpingectomy in case of a female. Only one other provision of the Act is material here and that
is §195 which provides that `offenses arising out of the violation of the prohibitory laws, revenue acts, embez-
zlement, or political offenses, shall not come or be considered within the terms of this Act.' Petitioner was con-
victed in 1926 of the crime of stealing chickens and was sentenced to the Oklahoma State Reformatory. In 1929
he was convicted of the crime of robbery with fire arms and was sentenced to the reformatory. In 1934 he was
convicted again of robbery with firearms and was sentenced to the penitentiary. He was confined there in 1935
when the Act was passed ... [T]he Attorney General instituted proceedings against him. Petitioner in his answer
challenged the Act as unconstitutional by reason of the Fourteenth Amendment. A jury trial was had. The court
instructed the jury that the crimes of which petitioner had been convicted were felonies involving moral turpi-
tude and that the only question for the jury was whether the operation of vasectomy could be performed on
petitioner without detriment to his general health. The jury found that it could be. A judgment directing that
the operation of vasectomy be performed on petitioner was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma by a
five to four decision.
530 | BUILDING A RIGHT

Several objections to the constitutionality of the Act have been pressed upon us. It is urged that the Act cannot
be sustained as an exercise of the police power in view of the state of scientific authorities respecting inheritabil-
ity of criminal traits. It is argued that due process is lacking because under this Act, unlike the act upheld in Buck
v. Bell (1927), the defendant is given no opportunity to be heard on the issue as to whether he is the probable
potential parent of socially undesirable offspring. It is also suggested that the Act is penal in character and that
the sterilization provided for is cruel and unusual punishment and violative of the Fourteenth Amendment. We
pass those points without intimating an opinion on them, for there is a feature of the Act which clearly con-
demns it. That is its failure to meet the requirements of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amend-
ment. We do not stop to point out all of the inequalities in this Act. A few examples will suffice. In Oklahoma
grand larceny is a felony. Larceny is grand larceny when the property taken exceeds $20 in value. Embezzlement is
punishable `in the manner prescribed for feloniously stealing property of the value of that embezzled.' Hence he
who embezzles property worth more than $20 is guilty of a felony. A clerk who appropriates over $20 from his
employer's till and a stranger who steals the same amount are thus both guilty of felonies. If the latter repeats his
act and is convicted three times, he may be sterilized. But the clerk is not subject to the pains and penalties of the
Act no matter how large his embezzlements nor how frequent his convictions. A person who enters a chicken
coop and steals chickens commits a felony; and he may be sterilized if he is thrice convicted. If, however, he is
a bailee of the property and fraudulently appropriates it, he is an embezzler. Hence no matter how habitual his
proclivities for embezzlement are and no matter how often his conviction, he may not be sterilized. * * *

Whether a particular act is larceny by fraud or embezzlement thus turns not on the intrinsic quality of the act
but on when the felonious intent arose-a question for the jury under appropriate instructions. It was stated in
Buck v. Bell that the claim that state legislation violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amend-
ment is `the usual last resort of constitutional arguments.' Under our constitutional system the States in deter-
mining the reach and scope of particular legislation need not provide `abstract symmetry'. They may mark and
set apart the classes and types of problems according to the needs and as dictated or suggested by experience. It
was in that connection that Mr. Justice Holmes, speaking for the Court in Bain Peanut Co. v. Pinson (1931)
stated, `We must remember that the machinery of government would not work if it were not allowed a little play
in its joints.' Only recently we reaffirmed the view that the equal protection clause does not prevent the legisla-
ture from recognizing `degrees of evil' * * * {and} that `the Constitution does not require things which are differ-
ent in fact or opinion to be treated in law as though they were the same.'

Thus, if we had here only a question as to a State's classification of crimes, such as embezzlement or larceny, no
substantial federal question would be raised. For a State is not constrained in the exercise of its police power to
ignore experience which marks a class of offenders or a family of offenses for special treatment. Nor is it pre-
vented by the equal protection clause from confining `its restrictions to those classes of cases where the need is
deemed to be clearest'. * * *

But the instant legislation runs afoul of the equal protection clause, though we give Oklahoma that large def-
erence which the rule of the foregoing cases requires. We are dealing here with legislation which involves one
of the basic civil rights of man. Marriage and procreation are fundamental to the very existence and survival of
the race. The power to sterilize, if exercised, may have subtle, far reaching and devastating effects. In evil or reck-
less hands it can cause races or types which are inimical to the dominant group to wither and disappear. There
                                                                                                                        BUILDING A RIGHT | 531

is no redemption for the individual whom the law touches. Any experiment which the State conducts is to his
irreparable injury. He is forever deprived of a basic liberty. We mention these matters not to reexamine the scope
of the police power of the States. We advert to them merely in emphasis of our view that strict scrutiny of the
classification which a State makes in a sterilization law is essential, lest unwittingly or otherwise invidious dis-
criminations are made against groups or types of individuals in violation of the constitutional guaranty of just
and equal laws. The guaranty of `equal protection of the laws is a pledge of the protection of equal laws.' Yick
Wo v. Hopkins (1886).

When the law lays an unequal hand on those who have committed intrinsically the same quality of offense and
sterilizes one and not the other, it has made as an invidious a discrimination as if it had selected a particular race
or nationality for oppressive treatment. Yick Wo v. Hopkins (1886); Gaines v. Canada (1938). Sterilization of
those who have thrice committed grand larceny with immunity for those who are embezzlers is a clear, pointed,
unmistakable discrimination. Oklahoma makes no attempt to say that he who commits larceny by trespass or
trick or fraud has biologically inheritable traits which he who commits embezzlement lacks. Oklahoma's line
between larceny by fraud and embezzlement is determined, as we have noted, `with reference to the time when
the fraudulent intent to convert the property to the taker's own use' arises. We have not the slightest basis for
inferring that that line has any significance in eugenics nor that the inheritability of criminal traits follows the
neat legal distinctions which the law has marked between those 625 two offenses. In terms of fines and impris-
onment the crimes of larceny and embezzlement rate the same under the Oklahoma code. Only when it comes
to sterilization are the pains and penalties of the law different. The equal protection clause would indeed be a
formula of empty words if such conspicuously artificial lines could be drawn.

In Buck v. Bell, the Virginia statute was upheld though it applied only to feebleminded persons in institutions
of the State. But it was pointed out that `so far as the operations enable those who otherwise must be kept con-
fined to be returned to the world, and thus open the asylum to others, the equality aimed at will be more nearly
reached.' Here there is no such saving feature ... We have therefore a situation where the Act as construed and
applied to petitioner is allowed to perpetuate the discrimination which we have found to be fatal.

Reversed.

Mr. Chief Justice Stone concurring.

I concur in the result, but I am not persuaded that we are aided in reaching it by recourse to the equal protection
clause. If Oklahoma may resort generally to the sterilization of criminals on the assumption that their propen-
sities are transmissible to future generations by inheritance, I seriously doubt that the equal protection clause
requires it to apply the measure to all criminals in the first instance, or to none. Moreover, if we must presume
that the legislature knows-what science has been unable to ascertain-that the criminal tendencies of any class of
habitual offenders are transmissible regardless of the varying mental characteristics of its individuals, I should
suppose that we must likewise presume that the legislature, in its wisdom, knows that the criminal tendencies of
some classes of offenders are more likely to be transmitted than those of others. And so I think the real question
532 | BUILDING A RIGHT

we have to consider is not one of equal protection, but whether the wholesale condemnation of a class to such
an invasion of personal liberty, without opportunity to any individual to show that his is not the type of case
which would justify resort to it, satisfies the demands of due process. * * *

And so, while the state may protect itself from the demonstrably inheritable tendencies of the individual which
are injurious to society, the most elementary notions of due process would seem to require it to take appropriate
steps to safeguard the liberty of the individual by affording him, before he is condemned to an irreparable injury
in his person, some opportunity to show that he is without such inheritable tendencies. The state is called on to
sacrifice no permissible end when it is required to reach its objective by a reasonable and just procedure adequate
to safeguard rights of the individual which concededly the Constitution protects.

MR. JUSTICE JACKSON, concurring.

...

I also think the present plan to sterilize the individual in pursuit of a eugenic plan to eliminate from the race
characteristics that are only vaguely identified and which in our present state of knowledge are uncertain as to
transmissibility presents other constitutional questions of gravity. This Court has sustained such an experiment
with respect to an imbecile, a person with definite and observable characteristics where the condition had per-
sisted through three generations and afforded grounds for the belief that it was transmissible and would con-
tinue to manifest itself in generations to come. Buck v. Bell (1927). There are limits to the extent to which a
legislatively represented majority may conduct biological experiments at the expense of the dignity and person-
ality and natural powers of a minority-even those who have been guilty of what the majority define as crimes.
But this Act falls down before reaching this problem, which I mention only to avoid the implication that such a
question may not exist because not discussed. On it I would also reserve judgment.

MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.

...

Having "some information that the petitioner was selling narcotics," three deputy sheriffs of the County of Los
Angeles, on the morning of July 1, 1949, made for the two-story dwelling house in which Rochin lived with his
mother, common-law wife, brothers and sisters. Finding the outside door open, they entered and then forced
open the door to Rochin's room, on the second floor. Inside they found petitioner sitting partly dressed on the
side of the bed, upon which his wife was lying. On a "night stand" beside the bed the deputies spied two capsules.
When asked "Whose stuff is this?" Rochin seized the capsules and put them in his mouth. A struggle ensued,
in the course of which the three officers "jumped upon him" and attempted to extract the capsules. The force
they applied proved unavailing against Rochin's resistance. He was handcuffed and taken to a hospital. At the
direction of one of the officers a doctor forced an emetic solution through a tube into Rochin's stomach against
his will. This "stomach pumping" produced vomiting. In the vomited matter were found two capsules which
proved to contain morphine ...

Rochin was brought to trial before a California Superior Court, sitting without a jury, on the charge of possess-
ing "a preparation of morphine" in violation of the California Health and Safety Code, 1947, § 11,500. Rochin
was convicted and sentenced to sixty days' imprisonment. The chief evidence against him was the two capsules.
They were admitted over petitioner's objection, although the means of obtaining them was frankly set forth in
the testimony by one of, the deputies, substantially as here narrated ...

Restraints on our jurisdiction are self-imposed only in the sense that there is from our decisions no immediate
appeal short of impeachment or constitutional amendment. But that does not make due process of law a matter
of judicial caprice. The faculties of the Due Process Clause may be indefinite and vague, but the mode of their
ascertainment is not self-willed. In each case "due process of law" requires an evaluation based on a disinterested
inquiry pursued in the spirit of science, on a balanced order of facts exactly and fairly stated, on the detached
consideration of conflicting claims on a judgment not ad hoc and episodic but duly mindful of reconciling the
needs both of continuity and of change in a progressive society ...

Applying these general considerations to the circumstances of the present case, we are compelled to conclude
that the proceedings by which this conviction was obtained do more than offend some fastidious squeamishness
534 | BUILDING A RIGHT

or private sentimentalism about combatting crime too energetically. This is conduct that shocks the conscience.
Illegally breaking into the privacy of the petitioner, the struggle to open his mouth and remove what was there,
the forcible extraction of his stomach's contents-this course of proceeding by agents of government to obtain
evidence is bound to offend even hardened sensibilities. They are methods too close to the rack and the screw to
permit of constitutional differentiation ...

On the facts of this case the conviction of the petitioner has been obtained by methods that offend the Due
Process Clause.

The judgment below must be

Reversed.

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.

...

Appellant Griswold is Executive Director of the Planned Parenthood League of Connecticut. Appellant Buxton
is a licensed physician and a professor at the Yale Medical School who served as Medical Director for the League
at its Center in New Haven - a center open and operating from November 1 to November 10, 1961, when
appellants were arrested. They gave information, instruction, and medical advice to married persons as to the
means of preventing conception. They examined the wife and prescribed the best contraceptive device or mater-
ial for her use. Fees were usually charged, although some couples were serviced free. The statutes whose constitu-
tionality is involved in this appeal are 53-32 and 54-196 of the General Statutes of Connecticut (1958 rev.). The
former provides: "Any person who uses any drug, medicinal article or instrument for the purpose of preventing
conception shall be fined not less than fifty dollars or imprisoned not less than sixty days nor more than one year
or be both fined and imprisoned." Section 54-196 provides: "Any person who assists, abets, counsels, causes,
hires or commands another to commit any offense may be prosecuted and punished as if he were the principal
offender." The appellants were found guilty as accessories and fined $100 each, against the claim that the acces-
sory statute as so applied violated the Fourteenth Amendment. The Appellate Division of the Circuit Court
affirmed. The Supreme Court of Errors affirmed that judgment. We noted probable jurisdiction. We think that
appellants have standing to raise the constitutional rights of the married people with whom they had a profes-
sional relationship. * * *

Coming to the merits, we are met with a wide range of questions that implicate the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment. Overtones of some arguments suggest that Lochner v. New York (1905) should be our
guide. But we decline that invitation as we did in West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish (1937); Williamson v. Lee
Optical Co. (1955). We do not sit as a super legislature to determine the wisdom, need, and propriety of laws
536 | THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY

that touch economic problems, business affairs, or social conditions. This law, however, operates directly on an
intimate relation of husband and wife and their physician's role in one aspect of that relation. The association
of people is not mentioned in the Constitution nor in the Bill of Rights. The right to educate a child in a school
of the parents' choice - whether public or private or parochial - is also not mentioned. Nor is the right to study
any particular subject or any foreign language. Yet the First Amendment has been construed to include certain
of those rights. By Pierce v. Society of Sisters (1925), the right to educate one's children as one chooses is made
applicable to the States by the force of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. By Meyer v. Nebraska (1923), the
same dignity is given the right to study the German language in a private school. In other words, the State may
not, consistently with the spirit of the First Amendment, contract the spectrum of available knowledge. The
right of freedom of speech and press includes not only the right to utter or to print, but the right to distribute,
the right to receive, the right to read and freedom of inquiry, freedom of thought, and freedom to teach - indeed
the freedom of the entire university community. Without those peripheral rights the specific rights would be less
secure.

And so we reaffirm the principle of the Pierce and the Meyer cases. In NAACP v. Alabama (1958) we protected
the "freedom to associate and privacy in one's associations," noting that freedom of association was a peripheral
First Amendment right. Disclosure of membership lists of a constitutionally valid association, we held, was
invalid "as entailing the likelihood of a substantial restraint upon the exercise by petitioner's members of their
right to freedom of association." Ibid. In other words, the First Amendment has a penumbra where privacy is
protected from governmental intrusion. In like context, we have protected forms of "association" that are not
political in the customary sense but pertain to the social, legal, and economic benefit of the members.

In Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners (1957) we held it not permissible to bar a lawyer from practice, because
he had once been a member of the Communist Party. The man's "association with that Party" was not shown
to be "anything more than a political faith in a political party" and was not action of a kind proving bad moral
character. Those cases involved more than the "right of assembly" - a right that extends to all irrespective of
their race or ideology. The right of "association," like the right of belief is more than the right to attend a meet-
ing; it includes the right to express one's attitudes or philosophies by membership in a group or by affiliation
with it or by other lawful means. Association in that context is a form of expression of opinion; and while it is
not expressly included in the First Amendment its existence is necessary in making the express guarantees fully
meaningful. The foregoing cases suggest that specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras, formed
by emanations from those guarantees that help give them life and substance. Various guarantees create zones of
privacy. The right of association contained in the penumbra of the First Amendment is one, as we have seen. The
Third Amendment in its prohibition against the quartering of soldiers "in any house" in time of peace without
the consent of the owner is another facet of that privacy. The Fourth Amendment explicitly affirms the "right of
the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures."
The Fifth Amendment in its Self-Incrimination Clause enables the citizen to create a zone of privacy which gov-
ernment may not force him to surrender to his detriment. The Ninth Amendment provides: "The enumeration
in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people."
The Fourth and Fifth Amendments were described in Boyd v. United States (1886), as protection against all gov-
ernmental invasions "of the sanctity of a man's home and the privacies of life." We recently referred in Mapp v.
                                                                                                                 THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY | 537

Ohio (1961) to the Fourth Amendment as creating a "right to privacy, no less important than any other right
carefully and particularly reserved to the people." We have had many controversies over these penumbral rights
of "privacy and repose." These cases bear witness that the right of privacy which presses for recognition here is a
legitimate one.

The present case, then, concerns a relationship lying within the zone of privacy created by several fundamental
constitutional guarantees. And it concerns a law which, in forbidding the use of contraceptives rather than regu-
lating their manufacture or sale, seeks to achieve its goals by means having a maximum destructive impact upon
that relationship. Such a law cannot stand in light of the familiar principle, so often applied by this Court, that
a "governmental purpose to control or prevent activities constitutionally subject to state regulation may not
be achieved by means which sweep unnecessarily broadly and thereby invade the area of protected freedoms."
Would we allow the police to search the sacred precincts of marital bedrooms for telltale signs of the use of con-
traceptives? The very idea is repulsive to the notions of privacy surrounding the marriage relationship. We deal
with a right of privacy older than the Bill of Rights - older than our political parties, older than our school sys-
tem. Marriage is a coming together for better or for worse, hopefully enduring, and intimate to the degree of
being sacred. It is an association that promotes a way of life, not causes; a harmony in living, not political faiths;
a bilateral loyalty, not commercial or social projects. Yet it is an association for as noble a purpose as any involved
in our prior decisions.

Reversed.

Mr. Justice Goldberg, whom the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Brennan join, concurring.

...

I agree with the Court that Connecticut's birth-control law unconstitutionally intrudes upon the right of mari-
tal privacy, and I join in its opinion and judgment. Although I have not accepted the view that "due process" as
used in the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates all of the first eight Amendments I do agree that the concept
of liberty protects those personal rights that are fundamental, and is not confined to the specific terms of the
Bill of Rights. My conclusion that the concept of liberty is not so restricted and that it embraces the right of
marital privacy though that right is not mentioned explicitly in the Constitution is supported both by numer-
ous decisions of this Court, referred to in the Court's opinion, and by the language and history of the Ninth
Amendment. In reaching the conclusion that the right of marital privacy is protected, as being within the pro-
tected penumbra of specific guarantees of the Bill of Rights, the Court refers to the Ninth Amendment. I add
these words to emphasize the relevance of that Amendment to the Court's holding. * * *

While this Court has had little occasion to interpret the Ninth Amendment,"[i]t cannot be presumed that any
clause in the constitution is intended to be without effect." Marbury v. Madison (1803). In interpreting the
Constitution, "real effect should be given to all the words it uses." The Ninth Amendment to the Constitution
may be regarded by some as a recent discovery and may be forgotten by others, but since 1791 it has been a basic
part of the Constitution which we are sworn to uphold. To hold that a right so basic and fundamental and so
deep-rooted in our society as the right of privacy in marriage may be infringed because that right is not guaran-
teed in so many words by the first eight amendments to the Constitution is to ignore the Ninth Amendment and
538 | THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY

to give it no effect whatsoever. Moreover, a judicial construction that this fundamental right is not protected by
the Constitution because it is not mentioned in explicit terms by one of the first eight amendments or elsewhere
in the Constitution would violate the Ninth Amendment, which specifically states that "[t]he enumeration in
the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people."
(Emphasis added.) * * * {t}he Ninth Amendment shows a belief of the Constitution's authors that fundamental
rights exist that are not expressly enumerated in the first eight amendments and an intent that the list of rights
included there not be deemed exhaustive. * * * The Ninth Amendment simply shows the intent of the Consti-
tution's authors that other fundamental personal rights should not be denied such protection or disparaged in
any other way simply because they are not specifically listed in the first eight constitutional amendments. I do
not see how this broadens the authority of the Court; rather it serves to support what this Court has been doing
in protecting fundamental rights. * * *

In sum, I believe that the right of privacy in the marital relation is fundamental and basic - a personal right
"retained by the people" within the meaning of the Ninth Amendment. Connecticut cannot constitutionally
abridge this fundamental right, which is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment from infringement by the
States. I agree with the Court that petitioners' convictions must therefore be reversed.

Mr. Justice Harlan, concurring in the judgment.

...

I fully agree with the judgment of reversal, but find myself unable to join the Court's opinion. The reason is that
it seems to me to evince an approach to this case very much like that taken by my Brothers Black and Stewart in
dissent, namely: the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not touch this Connecticut statute
unless the enactment is found to violate some right assured by the letter or penumbra of the Bill of Rights. * * *
In my view, the proper constitutional inquiry in this case is whether this Connecticut statute infringes the Due
Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because the enactment violates basic values "implicit in the con-
cept of ordered liberty," Palko v. Connecticut (1937). * * *

While I could not more heartily agree that judicial "self restraint" is an indispensable ingredient of sound consti-
tutional adjudication, I do submit that the formula suggested for achieving it is more hollow than real."Specific"
provisions of the Constitution, no less than "due process," lend themselves as readily to "personal" interpreta-
tions by judges whose constitutional outlook is simply to keep the Constitution in supposed "tune with the
times." * * *

Mr. Justice White, concurring in the judgment.

...

In my view this Connecticut law as applied to married couples deprives them of "liberty" without due process
of law, as that concept is used in the Fourteenth Amendment. I therefore concur in the judgment of the Court
reversing these convictions under Connecticut's aiding and abetting statute. * * *

Mr. Justice Black, with whom Mr. Justice Stewart joins, dissenting, {omitted} and Mr. Justice Stewart, whom
Mr. Black joins, dissenting.

...

Since 1879 Connecticut has had on its books a law which forbids the use of contraceptives by anyone. I think
this is an uncommonly silly law. As a practical matter, the law is obviously unenforceable, except in the oblique
context of the present case. As a philosophical matter, I believe the use of contraceptives in the relationship of
marriage should be left to personal and private choice, based upon each individual's moral, ethical, and religious
beliefs. As a matter of social policy, I think professional counsel about methods of birth control should be avail-
able to all, so that each individual's choice can be meaningfully made. But we are not asked in this case to say
whether we think this law is unwise, or even asinine. We are asked to hold that it violates the United States Con-
stitution. And that I cannot do. In the course of its opinion the Court refers to no less than six Amendments to
the Constitution: the First, the Third, the Fourth, the Fifth, the Ninth, and the Fourteenth. But the Court does
not say which of these Amendments, if any, it thinks is infringed by this Connecticut law. We are told that the
Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is not, as such, the "guide" in this case. With that much I
agree. There is no claim that this law, duly enacted by the Connecticut Legislature is unconstitutionally vague.
There is no claim that the appellants were denied any of the elements of procedural due process at their trial, so
as to make their convictions constitutionally invalid. And, as the Court says, the day has long passed since the
Due Process Clause was regarded as a proper instrument for determining "the wisdom, need, and propriety" of
state laws. Lochner v. New York (1905). * * *

What provision of the Constitution, then, does make this state law invalid? The Court says it is the right of pri-
vacy "created by several fundamental constitutional guarantees." With all deference, I can find no such general
right of privacy in the Bill of Rights, in any other part of the Constitution, or in any case ever before decided
by this Court. At the oral argument in this case we were told that the Connecticut law does not "conform to
current community standards." But it is not the function of this Court to decide cases on the basis of commu-
nity standards. We are here to decide cases "agreeably to the Constitution and laws of the United States." It is
the essence of judicial duty to subordinate our own personal views, our own ideas of what legislation is wise and
what is not. If, as I should surely hope, the law before us does not reflect the standards of the people of Connecti-
cut, the people of Connecticut can freely exercise their true Ninth and Tenth Amendment rights to persuade
their elected representatives to repeal it. That is the constitutional way to take this law off the books.

Mr. Justice Black, with whom Mr. Justice Stewart joins, dissenting.

I agree with my Brother Stewart's dissenting opinion. And, like him, I do not to any extent whatever base my
view that this Connecticut law is constitutional on a belief that the law is wise, or that its policy is a good one. In
order that there may be no room at all to doubt why I vote as I do, I feel constrained to add that the law is every
bit as offensive to me as it is to my Brethren of the majority and my Brothers Harlan, White and Goldberg, who,
reciting reasons why it is offensive to them, hold it unconstitutional. There is no single one of the graphic and
540 | THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY

eloquent strictures and criticisms fired at the policy of this Connecticut law either by the Court's opinion or by
those of my concurring Brethren to which I cannot subscribe -- except their conclusion that the evil qualities
they see in the law make it unconstitutional.

Had the doctor defendant here, or even the nondoctor defendant, been convicted for doing nothing more than
expressing opinions to persons coming to the clinic that certain contraceptive devices, medicines or practices
would do them good and would be desirable, or for telling people how devices could be used, I can think of no
reasons at this time why their expressions of views would not be protected by the First and Fourteenth Amend-
ments, which guarantee freedom of speech. But speech is one thing; conduct and physical activities are quite
another ... Strongly as I desire to protect all First Amendment freedoms, I am unable to stretch the Amendment
so as to afford protection to the conduct of these defendants in violating the Connecticut law ... The Court talks
about a constitutional "right of privacy" as though there is some constitutional provision or provisions forbid-
ding any law ever to be passed which might abridge the "privacy" of individuals. But there is not. There are, of
course, guarantees in certain specific constitutional provisions which are designed in part to protect privacy at
certain times and places with respect to certain activities.

...

One of the most effective ways of diluting or expanding a constitutionally guaranteed right is to substitute for
the crucial word or words of a constitutional guarantee another word or words, more or less flexible and more or
less restricted in meaning. This fact is well illustrated by the use of the term "right of privacy" as a comprehen-
sive substitute for the Fourth Amendment's guarantee against "unreasonable searches and seizures." "Privacy"
is a broad, abstract and ambiguous concept which can easily be shrunken in meaning but which can also, on the
other hand, easily be interpreted as a constitutional ban against many things other than searches and seizures. I
have expressed the view many times that First Amendment freedoms, for example, have suffered from a failure
of the courts to stick to the simple language of the First Amendment in construing it, instead of invoking multi-
tudes of words substituted for those the Framers used.

...

The due process argument which my Brothers Harlan and White adopt here is based, as their opinions indicate,
on the premise that this Court is vested with power to invalidate all state laws that it considers to be arbitrary,
capricious, unreasonable, or oppressive, or on this Court's belief that a particular state law under scrutiny has
no "rational or justifying" purpose, or is offensive to a "sense of fairness and justice." If these formulas based on
"natural justice," or others which mean the same thing, are to prevail, they require judges to determine what is
or is not constitutional on the basis of their own appraisal of what laws are unwise or unnecessary. The power to
make such decisions is, of course, that of a legislative body. Surely it has to be admitted that no provision of the
Constitution specifically gives such blanket power to courts to exercise such a supervisory veto over the wisdom
and value of legislative policies and to hold unconstitutional those laws which they believe unwise or danger-
ous. I readily admit that no legislative body, state or national, should pass laws that can justly be given any of the
invidious labels invoked as constitutional excuses to strike down state laws. But perhaps it is not too much to say
that no legislative body ever does pass laws without believing that they will accomplish a sane, rational, wise and
                                                                                                                  THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY | 541

justifiable purpose. While I completely subscribe to the holding of Marbury v. Madison, and subsequent cases,
that our Court has constitutional power to strike down statutes, state or federal, that violate commands of the
Federal Constitution, I do not believe that we are granted power by the Due Process Clause or any other consti-
tutional provision or provisions to measure constitutionality by our belief that legislation is arbitrary, capricious
or unreasonable, or accomplishes no justifiable purpose, or is offensive to our own notions of "civilized standards
of conduct." Such an appraisal of the wisdom of legislation is an attribute of the power to make laws, not of the
power to interpret them.

...

My Brother Goldberg has adopted the recent discovery that the Ninth Amendment as well as the Due Process
Clause can be used by this Court as authority to strike down all state legislation which this Court thinks violates
"fundamental principles of liberty and justice," or is contrary to the "traditions and [collective] conscience of
our people." ... That Amendment was passed not to broaden the powers of this Court or any other department
of "the General Government," but, as every student of history knows, to assure the people that the Constitution
in all its provisions was intended to limit the Federal Government to the powers granted expressly or by neces-
sary implication.

...

I realize that many good and able men have eloquently spoken and written, sometimes in rhapsodical strains,
about the duty of this Court to keep the Constitution in tune with the times. The idea is that the Constitution
must be changed from time to time, and that this Court is charged with a duty to make those changes. For
myself, I must, with all deference, reject that philosophy. The Constitution makers knew the need for change,
and provided for it. Amendments suggested by the people's elected representatives can be submitted to the peo-
ple or their selected agents for ratification. That method of change was good for our Fathers, and, being some-
what old-fashioned, I must add it is good enough for me. And so I cannot rely on the Due Process Clause or the
Ninth Amendment or any mysterious and uncertain natural law concept as a reason for striking down this state
law. The Due Process Clause, with an "arbitrary and capricious" or "shocking to the conscience" formula, was
liberally used by this Court to strike down economic legislation in the early decades of this century, threatening,
many people thought, the tranquility and stability of the Nation. See, e.g., Lochner v. New York. That formula,
based on subjective considerations of "natural justice," is no less dangerous when used to enforce this Court's
views about personal rights than those about economic rights. I had thought that we had laid that formula,
as a means for striking down state legislation, to rest once and for all in cases like West Coast Hotel Co. v. Par­
rish, ; Olsen v. Nebraska ex rel. Western Reference & Bond Assn., and many other opinions.

MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.

...

Appellee William Baird was convicted at a bench trial in the Massachusetts Superior Court under Massachusetts
General Laws Ann., c. 272, 21, first, for exhibiting contraceptive articles in the course of delivering a lecture on
contraception to a group of students at Boston University and, second, for giving a young woman a package of
Emko vaginal foam at the close of his address. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court unanimously set aside
the conviction for exhibiting contraceptives on the ground that it violated Baird's First Amendment rights, but
by a four-to-three vote sustained the conviction for giving away the foam. Baird subsequently filed a petition for
a federal writ of habeas corpus, which the District Court dismissed. On appeal, however, the Court of Appeals
for the First Circuit vacated the dismissal and remanded the action with directions to grant the writ discharging
Baird. This appeal by the Sheriff of Suffolk County, Massachusetts, followed, and we noted probable jurisdic-
tion. (1971). We affirm. Massachusetts General Laws Ann., c. 272, 21, under which Baird was convicted, pro-
vides a maximum five-year term of imprisonment for "whoever ... gives away ... any drug, medicine, instrument
or article whatever for the prevention of conception," except as authorized in 21A. Under 21A, "[a] registered
physician may administer to or prescribe for any married person drugs or articles intended for the prevention of
pregnancy or conception. [And a] registered pharmacist actually engaged in the business of pharmacy may fur-
nish such drugs or articles to any married person presenting a prescription from a registered physician." As inter-
preted by the State Supreme Judicial Court, these provisions make it a felony for anyone, other than a registered
physician or pharmacist acting in accordance with the terms of 21A, to dispense any article with the intention
that it be used for the prevention of conception.

The statutory scheme distinguishes among three distinct classes of distributees - first, married persons may
obtain contraceptives to prevent pregnancy, but only from doctors or druggists on prescription; second, single
persons may not obtain contraceptives from anyone to prevent pregnancy; and, third, married or single persons
may obtain contraceptives from anyone to prevent, not pregnancy, but the spread of disease. This construction
of state law is, of course, binding on us. The legislative purposes that the statute is meant to serve are not alto-
gether clear. In Commonwealth v. Baird, the Supreme Judicial Court noted only the State's interest in protect-
ing the health of its citizens ... In a subsequent decision, Sturgis v. Attorney General (1863), the court, however,
found "a second and more compelling ground for upholding the statute" - namely, to protect morals through
"regulating the private sexual lives of single persons." The Court of Appeals ... concluded that the statutory goal
                                                                                                                 THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY | 543

was to limit contraception in and of itself - a purpose that the court held conflicted "with fundamental human
rights" under Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), where this Court struck down Connecticut's prohibition against
the use of contraceptives as an unconstitutional infringement of the right of marital privacy. We agree that the
goals of deterring premarital sex and regulating the distribution of potentially harmful articles cannot reason-
ably be regarded as legislative aims of 21 and 21A. And we hold that the statute, viewed as a prohibition on
contraception per se, violates the rights of single persons under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment. * * *

For the foregoing reasons we hold that Baird, who is now in a position, and plainly has an adequate incentive,
to assert the rights of unmarried persons denied access to contraceptives, has standing to do so. We turn to the
merits.

The basic principles governing application of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment are
familiar. As the Chief Justice only recently explained in Reed v. Reed (1971): "In applying that clause, this Court
has consistently recognized that the Fourteenth Amendment does not deny to States the power to treat different
classes of persons in different ways. Railway Express Agency v. New York (1949). The Equal Protection Clause
of that amendment does, however, deny to States the power to legislate that different treatment be accorded to
persons placed by a statute into different classes on the basis of criteria wholly unrelated to the objective of that
statute ... The question for our determination in this case is whether there is some ground of difference that
rationally explains the different treatment accorded married and unmarried persons under Massachusetts Gen-
eral Laws Ann., c. 272, 21 and 21A. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that no such ground exists.

First. Section 21 stems from Mass. Stat. 1879, c. 159, 1, which prohibited, without exception, distribution of
articles intended to be used as contraceptives. In Commonwealth v. Allison (1917), the Massachusetts Supreme
Judicial Court explained that the law's "plain purpose is to protect purity, to preserve chastity, to encourage con-
tinence and self restraint, to defend the sanctity of the home, and thus to engender in the State and nation a
virile and virtuous race of men and women." Although the State clearly abandoned that purpose with the enact-
ment of 21A, at least insofar as the illicit sexual activities of married persons are concerned, the court reiterated
in Sturgis v. Attorney General, that the object of the legislation is to discourage premarital sexual intercourse
... What Mr. Justice Goldberg said in Griswold v. Connecticut, (concurring opinion), concerning the effect of
Connecticut's prohibition on the use of contraceptives in discouraging extramarital sexual relations, is equally
applicable here. "The rationality of this justification is dubious, particularly in light of the admitted widespread
availability to all persons in the State of Connecticut, unmarried as well as married, of birth control devices for
the prevention of disease, as distinguished from the prevention of conception." Like Connecticut's laws, 21 and
21A do not at all regulate the distribution of contraceptives when they are to be used to prevent, not pregnancy,
but the spread of disease. Nor, in making contraceptives available to married persons without regard to their
intended use, does Massachusetts attempt to deter married persons from engaging in illicit sexual relations with
unmarried persons.

Even on the assumption that the fear of pregnancy operates as a deterrent to fornication, the Massachusetts
statute is thus so riddled with exceptions that deterrence of premarital sex cannot reasonably be regarded as its
aim ... If health were the rationale of 21A, the statute would be both discriminatory and overbroad. * * *
544 | THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY

We conclude, accordingly, that, despite the statute's superficial earmarks as a health measure, health, on the face
of the statute, may no more reasonably be regarded as its purpose than the deterrence of premarital sexual rela-
tions. Third. If the Massachusetts statute cannot be upheld as a deterrent to fornication or as a health measure,
may it, nevertheless, be sustained simply as a prohibition on contraception? The Court of Appeals analysis "led
inevitably to the conclusion that, so far as morals are concerned, it is contraceptives per se that are considered
immoral - to the extent that Griswold will permit such a declaration." * * *

We need not and do not, however, decide that important question in this case because, whatever the rights of
the individual to access to contraceptives may be, the rights must be the same for the unmarried and the married
alike. If under Griswold the distribution of contraceptives to married persons cannot be prohibited, a ban on
distribution to unmarried persons would be equally impermissible. It is true that in Griswold the right of pri-
vacy in question inhered in the marital relationship. Yet the marital couple is not an independent entity with a
mind and heart of its own, but an association of two individuals each with a separate intellectual and emotional
makeup. If the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from
unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether
to bear or beget a child. See Stanley v. Georgia (1969). See also Skinner v. Oklahoma (1942); Jacobson v. Massa­
chusetts (1905). On the other hand, if Griswold is no bar to a prohibition on the distribution of contraceptives,
the State could not, consistently with the Equal Protection Clause, outlaw distribution to unmarried but not
to married persons. In each case the evil, as perceived by the State, would be identical, and the underinclusion
would be invidious ...

We hold that by providing dissimilar treatment for married and unmarried persons who are similarly situated,
Massachusetts General Laws Ann., c. 272, 21 and 21A, violate the Equal Protection Clause.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Affirmed.

JUSTICE BRENNAN DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.

...

Under New York Educ. Law § 6811 (8) (McKinney 1972) it is a crime (1). for any person to sell or distribute any
contraceptive of any kind to a minor under the age of 16 years, (2) for anyone other than a licensed pharmacist to
distribute contraceptives to persons 16 or over; and (3) for anyone, including licensed pharmacists, to advertise
or display contraceptives.' A three-judge District Court for the Southern District of New York declared § 6811
(8) unconstitutional in its entirety under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the Federal Constitution
insofar as it applies to nonprescription contraceptives, and enjoined its enforcement as so applied ...

PSI is a corporation primarily engaged in the mail-order retail sale of nonmedical contraceptive devices from
its offices in North Carolina. PSI regularly advertises its products in periodicals published or circulated in New
York, accepts orders from New York residents, and fills orders by mailing contraceptives to New York purchasers.
Neither the advertisements nor the order forms accompanying them limit availability of PPA's products to per-
sons of any particular age.

Various New York officials have advised PSI that its activities violate New York law ... notified ... that a PSI adver-
tisement ... violated § 6811(8) ... requested "future compliance" with the law. A second letter ... notifying PSI
that PSI's magazine advertisements of contraceptives violated the statute, referred particularly to the provisions
prohibiting sales to minors and sales by nonpharmacists, and threatened: "In the event you fail to comply, the
matter will be referred to our Attorney General for legal action." Finally, PPA was served with a copy of a report
of inspectors of the State Board of Pharmacy ... which recorded that PPA advertised male contraceptives, and
had been advised to cease selling contraceptives in violation of the state law ...

Although "[t]he Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of privacy," the Court has recognized that
one aspect of the "liberty" protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is "a right of
personal privacy, or a guarantee of certain areas or zones of privacy" Roe v Wade, (1973). This right of per-
sonal privacy includes "the interest in independence in making certain kinds of important decisions." Whalen
v Roe, (1977). While the outer limits of this aspect of privacy have not been marked by the Court, it is clear
546 | THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY

that among the decisions that an individual may make without unjustified government interference are personal
decisions "relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, and child rearing and educa-
tion ... The decision whether or not to beget or bear a child is at the very heart of this cluster of constitutionally
protected choices. That decision holds a particularly important place in the history of the right of privacy, a right
first explicitly recognized in an opinion holding unconstitutional a statute prohibiting the use of contraceptives,
Griswold v Connecticut, supra, and most prominently vindicated in recent years in the contexts of contraception
...

That the constitutionally protected right of privacy extends to an individual's liberty to make choices regarding
contraception does not, however, automatically invalidate every state regulation in this area. The business of
manufacturing and selling contraceptives may be regulated in ways that do not infringe protected individual
choices. And even a burdensome regulation may be validated by a sufficiently compelling state interest. "Com-
pelling" is of course the key word, where a decision as fundamental as that whether to bear or beget a child is
involved, regulations imposing a burden on it may be justified only by compelling state interests, and must be
narrowly drawn to express only those interests. With these principles in mind, we turn to the question whether
the District Court was correct in holding valid the provisions of § 6811 (8) as applied to the distribution of non-
prescription contraceptives ...

Restrictions on the distribution of contraceptives clearly burden the freedom to make such decisions. A total
prohibition against sale of contraceptives, for example, would intrude upon individual decisions in matters of
procreation and contraception as harshly as a direct ban on their use. Indeed, in practice, a prohibition against
all sales, since more easily and less offensively enforced, might have an even more devastating effect upon the free-
dom to choose contraception ...

Limiting the distribution of nonprescription contraceptives to licensed pharmacists clearly imposes a significant
burden on the right of the individuals to use contraceptives if they choose to do so. The burden is, of course,
not as great as that under a total ban on distribution. Nevertheless, the restriction of distribution channels to a
small fraction of the total number of possible retail outlets renders contraceptive devices considerably less acces-
sible to the public, reduces the opportunity for privacy of selection and purchase and lessens the possibility of
price competition. Insofar as § 6811 (8) applies to nonhazardous contraceptives, it bears no relation to the State's
interest in protecting health, the statute is obviously not substantially related to any goal of preventing young
people from selling contraceptives. Nor is the statute designed to serve as a quality control device. Nothing in
the record suggests that pharmacists are particularly qualified to give advice on the merits of different nonmed-
ical contraceptives, or that such advice is more necessary to the purchaser of contraceptive products than to con-
sumers of other nonprescription items. Why pharmacists are better able or more inclined than other retailers to
prevent tampering with prepackaged products, or, if they are, why contraceptives are singled out for this special
protection, is also unexplained.

Since the State may not impose a blanket prohibition, or even a blanket requirement of parental consent, on the
choice of a minor to terminate her pregnancy, the constitutionality of a blanket prohibition of the distribution
of contraceptives to minors is a fortiori foreclosed. The State's interests in protection of the mental and physical
                                                                                                                 THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY | 547

health of the pregnant minor, and in protection of potential life are clearly more implicated by the abortion deci-
sion than by the decision to use a nonhazardous contraceptive. Moreover, there is substantial reason for doubt
whether limiting access to contraceptives will in fact substantially discourage early sexual behavior ...

These arguments therefore do not justify the total suppression of advertising concerning contraceptives.

Roe v. Wade

Mr. Justice Blackmun delivered the opinion of the Court.

...

The Texas statutes that concern us here are Arts. Sec. 1191-1194 and 1196 of the State's Penal Code. These make
it a crime to "procure an abortion," as therein defined, or to attempt one, except with respect to "an abortion
procured or attempted by medical advice for the purpose of saving the life of the mother." Similar statutes are in
existence in a majority of the States ...

Roe alleged that she was unmarried and pregnant; that she wished to terminate her pregnancy by an abortion
"performed by a competent, licensed physician, under safe, clinical conditions"; that she was unable to get a
"legal" abortion in Texas because her life did not appear to be threatened by the continuation of her pregnancy;
and that she could not afford to travel to another jurisdiction in order to secure a legal abortion under safe con-
ditions. She claimed that the Texas statutes were unconstitutionally vague and that they abridged her right of
personal privacy, protected by the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments. By an amendment
to her complaint Roe purported to sue "on behalf of herself and all other women" similarly situated ...

James Hubert Hallford, a licensed physician, sought and was granted leave to intervene in Roe`s action. In his
complaint he alleged that he had been arrested previously for violations of the Texas abortion statutes and that
two such prosecutions were pending against him. He described conditions of patients who came to him seek-
ing abortions, and he claimed that for many cases he, as a physician, was unable to determine whether they fell
within or outside the exception recognized by Article 1196. He alleged that, as a consequence, the statutes were
vague and uncertain, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that they violated his own and his patients'
rights to privacy in the doctor-patient relationship and his own right to practice medicine, rights he claimed were
guaranteed by the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments ...

But when, as here, pregnancy is a significant fact in the litigation, the normal 266-day human gestation period is
so short that the pregnancy will come to term before the usual appellate process is complete. If that termination
                                                                                                               A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT | 549

makes a case moot, pregnancy litigation seldom will survive much beyond the trial stage, and appellate review
will be effectively denied. Our law should not be that rigid. Pregnancy often comes more than once to the same
woman, and in the general population, if man is to survive, it will always be with us. Pregnancy provides a classic
justification for a conclusion of non-mootness. It truly could be "capable of repetition, yet evading review ..."

The principal thrust of appellant's attack on the Texas statutes is that they improperly invade a right, said to be
possessed by the pregnant woman, to choose to terminate her pregnancy. Appellant would discover this right in
the concept of personal "liberty" embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause; or in personal,
marital, familial, and sexual privacy said to be protected by the Bill of Rights or its penumbras ...

Three reasons have been advanced to explain historically the enactment of criminal abortion laws in the 19th
century and to justify their continued existence. It has been argued occasionally that these laws were the product
of a Victorian social concern to discourage illicit sexual conduct. Texas, however, does not advance this justifica-
tion in the present case, and it appears that no court or commentator has taken the argument seriously ...

A second reason is concerned with abortion as a medical procedure. When most criminal abortion laws were
first enacted, the procedure was a hazardous one for the woman ...

Modern medical techniques have altered this situation. Appellants and various amici refer to medical data indi-
cating that abortion in early pregnancy, that is, prior to the end of the first trimester, although not without its
risk, is now relatively safe. Mortality rates for women undergoing early abortions, where the procedure is legal,
appear to be as low as or lower than the rates for normal childbirth." Consequently, any interest of the State in
protecting the woman from an inherently hazardous procedure, except when it would be equally dangerous for
her to forgo it, has largely disappeared. Of course, important state interests in the areas of health and medical
standards do remain.

The State has a legitimate interest in seeing to it that abortion, like any other medical procedure, is performed
under circumstances that ensure maximum safety for the patient. This interest obviously extends at least to the
performing physician and his staff, to the facilities involved, to the availability of after-care, and to adequate
provision for any complication or emergency that might arise. The prevalence of high mortality rates at illegal
"abortion mills" strengthens, rather than weakens, the State's interest in regulating the conditions under which
abortions are performed. Moreover, the risk to the woman increases as her pregnancy continues. Thus, the State
retains a definite interest in protecting the woman's own health and safety when an abortion is proposed at a late
stage of pregnancy.

The third reason is the State's interest-some phrase it in terms of duty-in protecting prenatal life. Some of the
argument for this justification rests on the theory that a new human life is present from the moment of concep-
tion. The State's interest and general obligation to protect life then extends, it is argued, to prenatal life. Only
when the life of the pregnant mother herself is at stake, balanced against the life she carries within her, should
the interest of the embryo or fetus not prevail. Logically, of course, a legitimate state interest in this area need not
stand or fall on acceptance of the belief that life begins at conception or at some other point prior to live birth.
In assessing the State's interest, recognition may be given to the less rigid claim that as long as at least potential
life is involved, the State may assert interests beyond the protection of the pregnant woman alone ...
550 | A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT

It is with these interests, and the eight to be attached to them, that this case is concerned ...

This right of privacy, whether it be founded in the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty and
restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court determined, in the Ninth Amendment's
reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to ter-
minate her pregnancy. The detriment that the State would impose upon the pregnant woman by denying this
choice altogether is apparent. Specific and direct harm medically diagnosable even in early pregnancy may be
involved. Maternity, or additional offspring, may force upon the woman a distressful life and future. Psycholog-
ical harm may be imminent. Mental and physical health may be taxed by child care. There is also the distress,
for all concerned, associated with the unwanted child, and there is the problem of bringing a child into a family
already unable, psychologically and otherwise, to care for it. In other cases, as in this one, the additional difficul-
ties and continuing stigma of unwed motherhood may be involved. All these are all factors the woman and her
responsible physician necessarily will consider in consultation.

On the basis of elements such as these, appellant and some amici argue that the woman's right is absolute and
that she is entitled to terminate her pregnancy at whatever time, in whatever way, and for whatever reason she
alone chooses. With this we do not agree. Appellant's arguments that Texas either has no valid interest at all
in regulating the abortion decision, or no interest strong enough to support any limitation upon the woman's
sole determination, are unpersuasive. The Court's decisions recognizing a right of privacy also acknowledge that
some state regulation in areas protected by that right is appropriate. As noted above, a State may properly assert
important interests in safeguarding health, in maintaining medical standards, and in protecting potential life. At
some point in pregnancy, these respective interests become sufficiently compelling to sustain regulation of the
factors that govern the abortion decision. The privacy right involved, therefore, cannot be said to be absolute. In
fact, it is not clear to us that the claim asserted by some amici that one has an unlimited right to do with one's
body as one pleases bears a close relationship to the right of privacy previously articulated in the Court's deci-
sions ...

With respect to the State's important and legitimate interest in the health of the mother, the "compelling" point,
in the light of present medical knowledge, is at approximately the end of the first trimester. This is so because of
the now-established medical fact ... that until the end of the first trimester mortality in abortion may be less than
mortality in normal childbirth. It follows that, from and after this point, a State may regulate the abortion pro-
cedure to the extent that the regulation reasonably relates to the preservation and protection of maternal health.
Examples of permissible state regulation in this area are requirements as to the qualifications of the person who
is to perform the abortion; as to the licensure of that person; as to the facility in which the procedure is to be per-
formed, that is, whether it must be a hospital or may be a clinic or some other place of less-than-hospital status;
as to the licensing of the facility; and the like ...

This means, on the other hand, that, for the period of pregnancy prior to this "compelling" point, the attending
physician, in consultation with his patient, is free to determine, without regulation by the State, that, in his med-
ical judgment, the patient's pregnancy should be terminated. If that decision is reached, the judgment may. be
effectuated by an abortion free of interference by the State ...
                                                                                                                A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT | 551

With respect to the State's important and legitimate interest in potential life, the "compelling" point is at via-
bility. This is so because the fetus then presumably has the capability of meaningful life outside the mother's
womb. State regulation protective of fetal life after viability thus has both logical and biological justifications. If
the State is interested in protecting fetal life after viability, it may go so far as to proscribe abortion during that
period, except when it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother ...

Measured against these standards, Art. 1196 of the Texas Penal Code, in restricting legal abortions to those "pro-
cured or attempted by medical advice for the purpose of saving the life of the mother," sweeps too broadly. The
statute makes no distinction between abortions performed early in pregnancy and those performed later, and it
limits to a single reason, "saving" the mother's life, the legal justification for the procedure. The statute, there-
fore, cannot survive the constitutional attack made upon it here. This conclusion makes it unnecessary for us to
consider the additional challenge to the Texas statute asserted on grounds of vagueness ...

To summarize and to repeat: 1. A state criminal abortion statute of the current Texas type, that excepts from
criminality only a lifesaving procedure on behalf of the mother, without regard to pregnancy stage and without
recognition of the other interests involved, is violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
(a) For the stage prior to approximately the end of the first trimester, the abortion decision and its effectuation
must be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant woman's attending physician. (b) For the stage subsequent
to approximately the end of the first trimester, the State, in promoting its interest in the health of the mother,
may, if it chooses, regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health. (c) For
the stage subsequent to viability, the State in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life may, if it
chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for
the preservation of the life or health of the mother ...

This `holding, we feel, is consistent with the relative weights of the respective interests involved, with the lessons
and examples of medical and legal history, with the lenity of the common law, and with the demands of the pro-
found problems of the present day. The decision leaves the State free to place increasing restrictions on abortion
as the period of pregnancy lengthens, so long as those restrictions are tailored to the recognized state interests.
The decision vindicates the right of the physician to administer medical treatment according to his professional
judgment up to the points where important state interests provide compelling justifications for intervention. Up
to those points, the abortion decision in all its aspects is inherently, and primarily, a medical decision, and basic
responsibility for it must rest with the physician. If an individual practitioner abuses the privilege of exercising
proper medical judgment, the usual remedies, judicial and intra-professional, are available ...

Our conclusion that Art. 1196 is unconstitutional means, of course, that the Texas abortion statutes, as a unit,
must fall. The exception of Art. 1196 cannot be struck down separately, for then the State would be left with a
statute proscribing all abortion procedures no matter how medically urgent the case ...

Mr. Justice Blackmun delivered the opinion of the Court.

...

The woman's consent. Under § 3(2) of the Act, a woman, prior to submitting to an abortion during the first
12 weeks of pregnancy, must certify in writing her consent to the procedure and "that her consent is informed
and freely given and is not the result of coercion." Appellants argue that this requirement is violative of Roe v.
Wade, by imposing an extra layer and burden of regulation on the abortion decision ... Appellants also claim
that the provision is overbroad and vague ... Despite the fact that apparently no other Missouri statute ... requires
a patient's prior written consent to a surgical procedure, the imposition by § 3(2) of such a requirement for ter-
mination of pregnancy even during the first stage, in our view, is not, in itself, an unconstitutional requirement.

The spouse's consent. Section 3(3) requires the prior written consent of the spouse of the woman seeking an abor-
tion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, unless "the abortion is certified by a licensed physician to be neces-
sary in order to preserve the life of the mother." ...

We recognize, of course, that when a woman, with the approval of her physician but without the approval of
her husband, decides to terminate her pregnancy, it could be said that she is acting unilaterally. The obvious fact
is that when the wife and the husband disagree on this decision, the view of only one of the two marriage part-
ners can prevail. Inasmuch as it is the woman who physically bears the child and who is the more directly and
immediately affected by the pregnancy, as between the two, the balance weighs in her favor. Cf. Roe v. Wade ...
We conclude that § 3(3) of the Missouri Act is inconsistent with the standards enunciated in Roe v. Wade, and
is unconstitutional.
                                                                                                               A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT | 553

Parental consent. Section 3(4) requires, with respect to the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, where the woman is
unmarried and under the age of 18 years, the written consent of a parent or person In loco parentis unless, again,
"the abortion is certified by a licensed physician as necessary in order to preserve the life of the mother." It is to
be observed that only one parent need consent ...

We agree with appellants and with the courts whose decisions have just been cited that the State may not impose
a blanket provision, such as § 3(4), requiring the consent of a parent or person in loco parentis as a condition
for abortion of an unmarried minor during the first 12 weeks of her pregnancy. Just as with the requirement of
consent from the spouse, so here, the State does not have the constitutional authority to give a third party an
absolute, and possibly arbitrary, veto over the decision of the physician and his patient to terminate the patient's
pregnancy, regardless of the reason for withholding the consent.

Constitutional rights do not mature and come into being magically only when one attains the state-defined age
of majority. Minors, as well as adults, are protected by the Constitution, and possess constitutional rights ...

... Any independent interest the parent may have in the termination of the minor daughter's pregnancy is no
more weighty than the right of privacy of the competent minor mature enough to have become pregnant.

We emphasize that our holding that § 3(4) is invalid does not suggest that every minor, regardless of age or matu-
rity, may give effective consent for termination of her pregnancy ... The fault with § 3(4) is that it imposes a spe-
cial consent provision, exercisable by a person other than the woman and her physician, as a prerequisite to a
minor's termination of her pregnancy, and does so without a sufficient justification for the restriction. It violates
the strictures of Roe and Doe.

Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.

Mary Moe was permitted to represent the "class of unmarried minors in Massachusetts who have adequate
capacity to give a valid and informed consent [to abortion], and who do not wish to involve their parents." Baird
v. Bellotti, 393 F. Supp. 847, 850 (Mass. 1975) (Baird I). ...

In its analysis of the relevant constitutional principles, the [lower] court stated that "there can be no doubt but
that a female's constitutional right to an abortion in the first trimester does not depend upon her calendar age."
Id., at 855-856. The court found no justification for the parental consent limitation placed on that right by §
12S, since it concluded that the statute was "cast not in terms of protecting the minor, ... but in recognizing
independent rights of parents." Id., at 856. The "independent" parental rights protected by § 12S, as the court
understood them, were wholly distinct from the best interests of the minor ...

A child, merely on account of his minority, is not beyond the protection of the Constitution. As the Court said
in In re Gault, (1967), "whatever may be their precise impact, neither the Fourteenth Amendment nor the Bill
of Rights is for adults alone." This observation, of course, is but the beginning of the analysis. The Court long
has recognized that the status of minors under the law is unique in many respects ...

The Court's concern for the vulnerability of children is demonstrated in its decisions dealing with minors'
claims to constitutional protection against deprivations of liberty or property interests by the State. With respect
to many of these claims, we have concluded that the child's right is virtually coextensive with that of an adult.
For example, the Court has held that the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee against the deprivation of liberty
without due process of law is applicable to children in juvenile delinquency proceedings ...
                                                                                                               A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT | 555

These rulings have not been made on the uncritical assumption that the constitutional rights of children are
indistinguishable from those of adults. Indeed, our acceptance of juvenile courts distinct from the adult criminal
justice system assumes that juvenile offenders constitutionally may be treated differently from adults ...

Viewed together, our cases show that although children generally are protected by the same constitutional guar-
antees against governmental deprivations as are adults, the State is entitled to adjust its legal system to account
for children's vulnerability and their needs for "concern, ... sympathy, and.., paternal attention ..."

Second, the Court has held that the States validly may limit the freedom of children to choose for themselves
in the making of important, affirmative choices with potentially serious consequences. These rulings have been
grounded in the recognition that, during the formative years of childhood and adolescence, minors often lack
the experience, perspective, and judgment to recognize and avoid choices that could be detrimental to them ...

Third, the guiding role of parents in the upbringing of their children justifies limitations on the freedoms of
minors. The State commonly protects its youth from adverse governmental action and from their own imma-
turity by requiring parental consent to or involvement in important decisions by minors. But an additional and
more important justification for state deference to parental control over children is that "[t]he child is not the
mere creature of the State; those who nurture him and direct his destiny have the right, coupled with the high
duty, to recognize and prepare him for additional obligations ..."

Properly understood, then, the tradition of parental authority is not inconsistent with our tradition of indi-
vidual liberty; rather, the former is one of the basic presuppositions of the latter. Legal restrictions on minors,
especially those supportive of the parental role, may be important to the child's chances for the full growth and
maturity that make eventual participation in a free society meaningful and rewarding. Under the Constitution,
the State can "properly conclude that parents and others, teachers for example, who have [the] primary responsi-
bility for children's well-being are entitled to the support of laws designed to aid discharge of that responsibility
..."

The pregnant minor's options are much different from those facing a minor in other situations, such as deciding
whether to marry. A minor not permitted to marry before the age of majority is required simply to postpone her
decision. She and her intended spouse may preserve the opportunity for later marriage should they continue to
desire it. A pregnant adolescent, however, cannot preserve for long the possibility of aborting, which effectively
expires in a matter of weeks from the onset of pregnancy ... the abortion decision is one that simply cannot be
postponed, or it will be made by default with far-reaching consequences ...

There is no reason to believe that this would be so in the majority of cases where consent is withheld. But many
parents hold strong views on the subject of abortion, and young pregnant minors, especially those living at
home, are particularly vulnerable to their parents' efforts to obstruct both an abortion and their access to court.
It would be unrealistic, therefore, to assume that the mere existence of a legal right to seek relief in superior
court provides an effective avenue of relief for some of those who need it the most. We conclude, therefore, that
under state regulation such as that undertaken by Massachusetts, every minor must have the opportunity-if she
so desires-to go directly to a court without first consulting or notifying her parents. If she satisfies the court that
she is mature and well enough informed to make intelligently the abortion decision on her own, the court must
§556 | A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT

authorize her to act without parental consultation or consent. If she fails to satisfy the court that she is compe-
tent to make this decision independently, she must be permitted to show that an abortion nevertheless would be
in her best interests. If the court is persuaded that it is, the court must authorize the abortion ...

If, however, the court is not persuaded by the minor that she is mature or that the abortion would be in her best
interests, it may decline to sanction the operation. There is, however, an important state interest in encouraging
a family rather than a judicial resolution of a minor's abortion decision. Also, as we have observed above, parents
naturally take an interest in the welfare of their children's interest that is particularly strong where a normal fam-
ily relationship exists and where the child is living with one or both parents. These factors properly may be taken
into account by a court called upon to determine whether an abortion in fact is in a minor's best interests. If, all
things considered, the court determines that an abortion is in the minor's best interests, she is entitled to court
authorization without any parental involvement. On the other hand, the court may deny the abortion request
of an immature minor in the absence of parental consultation if it concludes that her best interests would be
served thereby, or the court may in such a case defer decision until there is parental consultation in which the
court may participate. But this is the full extent to which parental involvement may be required. For the reasons
stated above, the constitutional right to seek an abortion may not be unduly burdened by state-imposed condi-
tions upon initial access to court ...

Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the District Court insofar as it invalidates this statute and enjoins its
enforcement.

Affirmed.

JUSTICE POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court.

...

These cases come to us a decade after we held in Roe v Wade, (1973), that the right of privacy, grounded in the
concept of personal liberty guaranteed by the Constitution, encompasses a woman's right to decide whether to
                                                                                                               A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT | 557

terminate her pregnancy. Legislative responses to the Court's decision have required us on several occasions, and
again today, to define the limits of a State's authority to regulate the performance of abortions. Nonetheless, the
doctrine of stare decisis, while perhaps never entirely persuasive on a constitutional question, is a doctrine that
demands respect in a society governed by the rule of law.' We respect it today, and reaffirm Roe v. Wade ...

The ordinance sets forth 17 provisions that regulate the performance of abortions, see Akron Codified Ordi-
nances, ch. 1870, 5 of which are at issue in this case: (i) Section 1870.03 requires that all abortions performed
after the first trimester of pregnancy be performed in a hospital.3 (ii) Section 1870.05 sets forth requirements for
notification of and consent by parents before abortions may be performed on unmarried minors. (iii) Section
1870.06 requires that the attending physician make certain specified statements to the patient "to insure that
the consent for an abortion is truly informed consent." (iv) Section 1870.07 requires a 24-hour waiting period
between the time the woman signs a consent form and the time the abortion is performed.' (v) Section 1870.16
requires that fetal remains be "disposed of in a humane and sanitary manner ..."

In Roe v. Wade, the Court held that the "right of privacy, ... founded in the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of
personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, ... is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether
or not to terminate her pregnancy." Although the Constitution does not specifically identify this right, the his-
tory of this Court's constitutional adjudication leaves no doubt that "the full scope of the liberty guaranteed by
the Due Process Clause cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere
provided in the Constitution." Poe v. Ullman, (1961) (Harlan, J., dissenting from dismissal of appeal). Central
among these protected liberties is an individual's "freedom of personal choice in matters of marriage and family
life." The Court also has recognized, because abortion is a medical procedure, that the full vindication of the
woman's fundamental right necessarily requires that her physician be given "the room he needs to make his best
medical judgment ..."

First, a State has an "important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life." Id., at
162. Although this interest exists "throughout the course of the woman's pregnancy," Beal v. Doe, (1977), it
becomes compelling only at viability, the point at which the fetus "has the capability of meaningful life outside
the mother's womb ... At viability this interest in protecting the potential life of the unborn child is so impor-
tant that the State may proscribe abortions altogether, "except when it is necessary to preserve the life or health
of the mother ..."

Second, because a State has a legitimate concern with the health of women who undergo abortions, "a State may
properly assert important interests in safeguarding health [and] in maintaining medical standards." Id., at 154.
We held in Roe, however, that this health interest does not become compelling until "approximately the end of
the first trimester" of pregnancy ...

This does not mean that a State never may enact a regulation touching on the woman's abortion right during
the first weeks of pregnancy. Certain regulations that have no significant impact on the woman's exercise of her
right may be permissible where justified by important state health objectives ...
558 | A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT

We have rejected a State's attempt to ban a particular second-trimester abortion procedure, where the ban would
have increased the costs and limited the availability of abortions without promoting important health benefits.
If a State requires licensing or undertakes to regulate the performance of abortions during this period, the health
standards adopted must be "legitimately related to the objective the State seeks to accomplish ..."

Section 1870.03 of the Akron ordinance requires that any abortion performed "upon a pregnant woman subse-
quent to the end of the first trimester of her pregnancy" must be "performed in a hospital." A "hospital" is "a
general hospital or special hospital devoted to gynecology or obstetrics which is accredited by the Joint Commis-
sion on Accreditation of Hospitals or by the American Osteopathic Association." § 1870.01(B). Accreditation
by these organizations requires compliance with comprehensive standards governing a wide variety of health and
surgical services." The ordinance thus prevents the performance of abortions in outpatient facilities that are not
part of an acute-care, full-service hospital ...

There can be no doubt that § 1870.03's second-trimester hospitalization requirement places a significant obsta-
cle in the path of women seeking an abortion. A primary burden created by the requirement is additional cost to
the woman. The Court of Appeals noted that there was testimony that a second-trimester abortion costs more
than twice as much in a hospital as in a clinic. See 651 F. 2d, at 1209 (in-hospital abortion costs $850-$900,
whereas a dilatation-and-evacuation (D&E) abortion performed in a clinic costs $350-$400). Moreover, the
court indicated that second-trimester abortions were rarely performed in Akron hospitals. Ibid. (only nine sec-
ond-trimester abortions performed in Akron hospitals in the year before trial).21 Thus, a second-trimester hos-
pitalization requirement may force women to travel to find available facilities, resulting in both financial expense
and additional health risk. It therefore is apparent that a second trimester hospitalization requirement may sig-
nificantly limit a woman's ability to obtain an abortion ...

It is true that a state abortion regulation is not unconstitutional simply because it does not correspond perfectly
in all cases to the asserted state interest. But the lines drawn in a state regulation must be reasonable, and this
cannot be said of § 1870.03. By preventing the performance of D&E abortions in an appropriate nonhospital
setting, Akron has imposed a heavy, and unnecessary, burden on women's access to a relatively inexpensive, oth-
erwise accessible, and safe abortion procedure." Section 1870.03 has "the effect of inhibiting ... the vast majority
of abortions after the first 12 weeks," Danforth, 428 U. S., at 79, and therefore unreasonably infringes upon a
woman's constitutional right to obtain an abortion ...

...

We turn next to § 1870.05(B), the provision prohibiting a physician from performing an abortion on a minor
pregnant woman under the age of 15 unless he obtains "the informed written consent of one of her parents or
her legal guardian" or unless the minor obtains "an order from a court having jurisdiction over her that the abor-
tion be performed or induced."

... Akron's ordinance does not create expressly the alternative procedure required by Bellotti II. ...

The Akron ordinance provides that no abortion shall be performed except "with the informed written consent
of the pregnant woman, ... given freely and without coercion." § 1879.06(A). Furthermore, "in order to insure
                                                                                                               A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT | 559

that the consent for an abortion is truly informed consent," the woman must be "orally informed by her attend-
ing physician" of the status of her pregnancy, the development of her fetus, the date of possible viability, the
physical and emotional complications that may result from an abortion, and the availability of agencies to pro-
vide her with assistance and information with respect to birth control, adoption, and childbirth. § 1879.06(B).
In addition, the attending physician must inform her

"of the particular risks associated with her own pregnancy and the abortion technique to be employed ... [and]
other information which in his own medical judgment is relevant to her decision as to whether to have an abor-
tion or carry her pregnancy to term."

... The validity of an informed consent requirement thus rests on the State's interest in protecting the health
of the pregnant woman ... We rejected the view that "informed consent" was too vague a term, construing it
to mean "the giving of information to the patient as to just what would be done and as to its consequences.
To ascribe more meaning than this might well confine the attending physician in an undesired and uncomfort-
able straitjacket in the practice of his profession." ... This does not mean, however, that a State has unreviewable
authority to decide what information a woman must be given before she chooses to have an abortion. It remains
primarily the responsibility of the physician to ensure that appropriate information is conveyed to his patient,
depending on her particular circumstances. Danforth's recognition of the State's interest in ensuring that this
information be given will not justify abortion regulations designed to influence the woman's informed choice
between abortion or childbirth. ...

Viewing the city's regulations in this light, we believe that § 1879.06(B) attempts to extend the State's interest in
ensuring "informed consent" beyond permissible limits.

...

The Akron ordinance prohibits a physician from performing an abortion until 24 hours after the pregnant
woman signs a consent form. § 1879.07.

We find that Akron has failed to demonstrate that any legitimate state interest is furthered by an arbitrary and
inflexible waiting period. There is no evidence suggesting that the abortion procedure will be performed more
safely. Nor are we convinced that the State's legitimate concern that the woman's decision be informed is reason-
ably served by requiring a 24-hour delay as a matter of course. The decision whether to proceed with an abortion
is one as to which it is important to "affor[d] the physician adequate discretion in the exercise of his medical
judgment." Colautti v. Franklin ... In accordance with the ethical standards of the profession, a physician will
advise the patient to defer the abortion when he thinks this will be beneficial to her. But if a woman, after appro-
priate counseling, is prepared to give her written informed consent and proceed with the abortion, a State may
not demand that she delay the effectuation of that decision.

...
560 | A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT

Section 1870.16 of the Akron ordinance requires physicians performing abortions to "insure that the remains
of the unborn child are disposed of in a humane and sanitary manner." ... [w]e agree that it violates the Due
Process Clause.

...

We affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals invalidating those sections of Akron's "Regulations of Abor-
tions" ordinance that deal with parental consent, informed consent, a 24-hour waiting period, and the disposal
of fetal remains. The remaining portion of the judgment, sustaining Akron's requirement that all second-
trimester abortions be performed in a hospital, is reversed.

It is so ordered.

...

After considering the fundamental constitutional questions resolved by Roe, principles of institutional integrity,
and the rule of stare decisis, we are led to conclude this: the essential holding of Roe v. Wade should be retained
and once again reaffirmed. It must be stated at the outset and with clarity that Roe`s essential holding, the hold-
ing we reaffirm, has three parts. First is a recognition of the right of the woman to choose to have an abortion
before viability and to obtain it without undue interference from the State. Before viability, the State's interests
are not strong enough to support a prohibition of abortion or the imposition of a substantial obstacle to the
woman's effective right to elect the procedure. Second is a confirmation of the State's power to restrict abortions
after fetal viability, if the law contains exceptions for pregnancies which endanger the woman's life or health.
And third is the principle that the State has legitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting
the health of the woman and the life of the fetus that may become a child. These principles do not contradict
one another; and we adhere to each ...

Constitutional protection of the woman's decision to terminate her pregnancy derives from the Due Process
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It declares that no State shall "deprive any person of life, liberty, or prop-
erty, without due process of law." The controlling word in the cases before us is "liberty." Although a literal
reading of the Clause might suggest that it governs only the procedures by which a State may deprive persons of
liberty, for at least 105 years, since Mugler v. Kansas (1887), the Clause has been understood to contain a sub-
stantive component as well, one "barring certain government actions regardless of the fairness of the procedures
used to implement them ..."

We have seen how time has overtaken some of Roe`s factual assumptions: advances in maternal health care allow
for abortions safe to the mother later in pregnancy than was true in 1973, see Akron I and advances in neonatal
care have advanced viability to a point somewhat earlier. But these facts go only to the scheme of time limits on
562 | THE UNDUE BURDEN STANDARD

the realization of competing interests, and the divergences from the factual premises of 1973 have no bearing on
the validity of Roe`s central holding, that viability marks the earliest point at which the State's interest in fetal life
is constitutionally adequate to justify a legislative ban on nontherapeutic abortions ...

The sum of the precedential enquiry to this point shows Roe`s underpinnings unweakened in any way affecting
its central holding. While it has engendered disapproval, it has not been unworkable. An entire generation has
come of age free to assume Roe`s concept of liberty in defining the capacity of women to act in society, and to
make reproductive decisions; no erosion of principle going to liberty or personal autonomy has left Roe`s central
holding a doctrinal remnant Roe portends no developments at odds with other precedent for the analysis of per-
sonal liberty; and no changes of fact have rendered viability more or less appropriate as the point at which the
balance of interests tips. Within the bounds of normal stare decisis analysis, then, and subject to the considera-
tions on which it customarily turns, the stronger argument is for affirming Roe`s central holding, with whatever
degree of personal reluctance any of us may have, not for overruling it.

...

Roe established a trimester framework to govern abortion regulations. Under this elaborate but rigid construct,
almost no regulation at all is permitted during the first trimester of pregnancy; regulations designed to protect
the woman's health, but not to further the State's interest in potential life, are permitted during the second
trimester; and during the third trimester, when the fetus is viable, prohibitions are permitted provided the life or
health of the mother is not at stake. Roe, supra, at 163-166. Most of our cases since Roe have involved the appli-
cation of rules derived from the trimester framework. See, e. g., Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians
and Gynecologists, supra; Akron I, supra.

The trimester framework no doubt was erected to ensure that the woman's right to choose not become so sub-
ordinate to the State's interest in promoting fetal life that her choice exists in theory but not in fact. We do not
agree, however, that the trimester approach is necessary to accomplish this objective. A framework of this rigid-
ity was unnecessary and in its later interpretation sometimes contradicted the State's permissible exercise of its
powers.

...

We reject the trimester framework, which we do not consider to be part of the essential holding of Roe ...

... The very notion that the State has a substantial interest in potential life leads to the conclusion that not all
regulations must be deemed unwarranted. Not all burdens on the right to decide whether to terminate a preg-
nancy will be undue. In our view, the undue burden standard is the appropriate means of reconciling the State's
interest with the woman's constitutionally protected liberty.

... A finding of an undue burden is a shorthand for the conclusion that a state regulation has the purpose or
effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus. A statute
with this purpose is invalid because the means chosen by the State to further the interest in potential life must be
                                                                                                   THE UNDUE BURDEN STANDARD | 563

calculated to inform the woman's free choice, not hinder it. And a statute which, while furthering the interest
in potential life or some other valid state interest, has the effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a
woman's choice cannot be considered a permissible means of serving its legitimate ends.

We give this summary:

... We reject the rigid trimester framework of Roe v. Wade. To promote the State's interest in potential life
throughout pregnancy, the State may take measures to ensure that the woman's choice is informed. Measures
designed to advance this interest should not be invalidated if their purpose is to persuade the woman to choose
childbirth over abortion. These measures must not be an undue burden on the right ...

... As with any medical procedure, the State may enact regulations to further the health or safety of a woman
seeking an abortion. Unnecessary health regulations that have the purpose or effect of presenting a substantial
obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion impose an undue burden on the right.

Whether the mandatory 24-hour waiting period is nonetheless invalid because in practice it is a substantial
obstacle to a woman's choice to terminate her pregnancy is a closer question. ... [T]he District Court found that
for those women who have the fewest financial resources, those who must travel long distances, and those who
have difficulty explaining their whereabouts to husbands, employers, or others, the 24-hour waiting period will
be "particularly burdensome ..."

These findings are troubling in some respects, but they do not demonstrate that the waiting period constitutes
an undue burden ... Yet, as we have stated, under the undue burden standard a State is permitted to enact persua-
sive measures which favor childbirth over abortion, even if those measures do not further a health interest. And
while the waiting period does limit a physician's discretion, that is not, standing alone, a reason to invalidate it ...

Section 3209 of Pennsylvania's abortion law provides, except in cases of medical emergency, that no physician
shall perform an abortion on a married woman without receiving a signed statement from the woman that she
has notified her spouse that she is about to undergo an abortion. The woman has the option of providing an
alternative signed statement certifying that her husband is not the man who impregnated her; that her husband
could not be located; that the pregnancy is the result of spousal sexual assault which she has reported; or that the
woman believes that notifying her husband will cause him or someone else to inflict bodily injury upon her. A
physician who performs an abortion on a married woman without receiving the appropriate signed statement
will have his or her license revoked, and is liable to the husband for damages ...

A woman in a shelter or a safe house unknown to her husband is not `reasonably likely' to have bodily harm
inflicted upon her by her batterer, however her attempt to notify her husband pursuant to section 3209 could
accidentally disclose her whereabouts to her husband. Her fear of future ramifications would be realistic under.
the circumstances." ... Because of the nature of the battering relationship, battered women are unlikely to avail
themselves of the exceptions to section 3209 of the Act, regardless of whether the section applies to them ..." ...

The spousal notification requirement is thus likely to prevent a significant number of women from obtaining
an abortion. It does not merely make abortions a little more difficult or expensive to obtain; for many women, it
564 | THE UNDUE BURDEN STANDARD

will impose a substantial obstacle. We must not blind ourselves to the fact that the significant number of women
who fear for their safety and the safety of their children are likely to be deterred from procuring an abortion as
surely as if the Commonwealth had outlawed abortion in all cases ...

The husband's interest in the life of the child his wife is carrying does not permit the State to empower him
with this troubling degree of authority over his wife. The contrary view leads to consequences reminiscent of
the common law. A husband has no enforceable right to require a wife to advise him before she exercises her per-
sonal choices. If a husband's interest in the potential life of the child outweighs a wife's liberty, the State could
require a married woman to notify her husband before she uses a postfertilization contraceptive. Perhaps next in
line would be a statute requiring pregnant married women to notify their husbands before engaging in conduct
causing risks to the fetus. After all, if the husband's interest in the fetus' safety is a sufficient predicate for state
regulation, the State could reasonably conclude that pregnant wives should notify their husbands before drink-
ing alcohol or smoking ...

We next consider the parental consent provision. Except in a medical emergency, an unemancipated young
woman under 18 may not obtain an abortion unless she and one of her parents (or guardian) provides informed
consent as defined above. If neither a parent nor a guardian provides consent, a court may authorize the perfor-
mance of an abortion upon a determination that the young woman is mature and capable of giving informed
consent and has in fact given her informed consent, or that an abortion would be in her best interests ...

We have been over most of this ground before. Our cases establish, and we reaffirm today, that a State may
require a minor seeking an abortion to obtain the consent of a parent or guardian, provided that there is an ade-
quate judicial bypass procedure. Under these precedents, in our view, the one-parent consent requirement and
judicial bypass procedure are constitutional ...

Under the recordkeeping and reporting requirements of the statute, every facility which performs abortions is
required to file a report stating its name and address as well as the name and address of any related entity, such
as a controlling or subsidiary organization ... Every abortion facility must also file quarterly reports showing the
number of abortions performed broken down by trimester ...

We think that under this standard, all the provisions at issue here, except that relating to spousal notice, are con-
stitutional. Although they do not relate to the State's interest in informing the woman's choice, they do relate to
health. The collection of information with respect to actual patients is a vital element of medical research, and
so it cannot be said that the requirements serve no purpose other than to make abortions more difficult. Nor do
we find that the requirements impose a substantial obstacle to a woman's choice. At most they might increase
the cost of some abortions by a slight amount. While at some point increased cost could become a substantial
obstacle, there is no such showing on the record before us ...

Our Constitution is a covenant running from the first generation of Americans to us and then to future genera-
tions. It is a coherent succession. Each generation must learn anew that the Constitution's written terms embody
ideas and aspirations that must survive more ages than one.
§                                                                                                  THE UNDUE BURDEN STANDARD | 565

We accept our responsibility not to retreat from interpreting the full meaning of the covenant in light of all of
our precedents. We invoke it once again to define the freedom guaranteed by the Constitution's own promise,
the promise of liberty ...

It is so ordered.

Mazurek v. Armstrong

520 U.S. 968 (1997)

PER CURIAM.

In 1995, the Montana Legislature enacted a statute restricting the performance of abortions to licensed physi-
cians. 1995 Mont. Laws, ch. 321, § 2 (codified at Mont. Code Ann. § 50-20-109 (1995)). Similar rules exist in
40 other States in the Nation. The Montana law was challenged almost immediately by respondents, who are a
group of licensed physicians and one physician-assistant practicing in Montana ...

The Court of Appeals never contested this District Court conclusion that there was "insufficient evidence"
in the record that the requirement posed a "`substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion.'" Instead,
it held that the physician-only requirement was arguably invalid because its purpose, according to the Court of
Appeals, may have been to create a substantial obstacle to women seeking abortions. 94 F. 3d, at 567. But even
assuming the correctness of the Court of Appeals' implicit premise-that a legislative purpose to interfere with the
constitutionally protected right to abortion without the effect of interfering with that right (here it is uncon-
tested that there was insufficient evidence of a "substantial obstacle" to abortion) could render the Montana law
invalid-there is no basis for finding a vitiating legislative purpose here. We do not assume unconstitutional leg-
islative intent even when statutes produce harmful results, see, e. g., Washington v. Davis (1976); much less do
we assume it when the results are harmless.

...

Respondents claim in this Court that the Montana law must have had an invalid purpose because "all health
evidence contradicts the claim that there is any health basis" for the law. Brief in Opposition 7. Respondents
contend that "the only extant study comparing the complication rates for first-trimester abortions performed
by [physician assistants] with those for first-trimester abortions performed by physicians found no significant
difference." Ibid. But this line of argument is squarely foreclosed by Casey itself. In the course of upholding the
physician-only requirement at issue in that case, we emphasized that "[o]ur cases reflect the fact that the Con-
stitution gives the States broad latitude to decide that particular functions may be performed only by licensed
§566 | THE UNDUE BURDEN STANDARD

professionals, even if an objective assessment might suggest that those same tasks could be performed by others,"
(emphasis added). Respondents fall back on the fact that an antiabortion group drafted the Montana law. But
that says nothing significant about the legislature's purpose in passing it.

It is so ordered.

JUSTICE BREYER DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.

...

In Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey (1992), a plurality of the Court concluded that there "exists"
an "undue burden" on a woman's right to decide to have an abortion, and consequently a provision of law is
constitutionally invalid, if the "purpose or effect" of the provision "is to place a substantial obstacle in the path
of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability." (Emphasis added.) The plurality added that
"[u]nnecessary health regulations that have the purpose or effect of presenting a substantial obstacle to a woman
seeking an abortion impose an undue burden on the right." We must here decide whether two provisions of
Texas' House Bill 2 violate the Federal Constitution as interpreted in Casey. The first provision, which we shall
call the "admitting-privileges requirement," says that "[a] physician performing or inducing an abortion ... must,
on the date the abortion is performed or induced, have active admitting privileges at a hospital that ... is located
not further than 30 miles from the location at which the abortion is performed or induced." Tex. Health &
Safety Code Ann. § 171.0031(a) (West Cum. Supp. 2015). This provision amended Texas law that had previ-
ously required an abortion facility to maintain a written protocol "for managing medical emergencies and the
transfer of patients requiring further emergency care to a hospital." 38 Tex. Reg. 6546 (2013). The second pro-
vision, which we shall call the "surgical-center requirement," says that "the minimum standards for an abortion
facility must be equivalent to the minimum standards adopted under [the Texas Health and Safety Code sec-
tion] for ambulatory surgical centers." Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 245.010(a). We conclude that neither
of these provisions confers medical benefits sufficient to justify the burdens upon access that each imposes.
                                                                                                   THE UNDUE BURDEN STANDARD | 567

Each places a substantial obstacle in the path of women seeking a previability abortion, each constitutes an
undue burden on abortion access, Casey (plurality opinion), and each violates the Federal Constitution.

In July 2013, the Texas Legislature enacted House Bill 2 (H.B. 2 or Act). In September (before the new law took
effect), a group of Texas abortion providers filed an action in Federal District Court seeking facial invalidation
of the law's admitting-privileges provision. In late October, the District Court granted the injunction. But three
days later, the Fifth Circuit vacated the injunction, thereby permitting the provision to take effect. The Fifth Cir-
cuit subsequently upheld the provision, and set forth its reasons in an opinion released late the following March.
In that opinion, the Fifth Circuit pointed to evidence introduced in the District Court the previous October. It
noted that Texas had offered evidence designed to show that the admitting-privileges requirement "will reduce
the delay in treatment and decrease health risk for abortion patients with critical complications," and that it
would "`screen out' untrained or incompetent abortion providers." (Abbott). The opinion also explained that
the plaintiffs had not provided sufficient evidence "that abortion practitioners will likely be unable to comply
with the privileges requirement." The court said that all "of the major Texas cities, including Austin, Corpus
Christi, Dallas, El Paso, Houston, and San Antonio," would "continue to have multiple clinics where many
physicians will have or obtain hospital admitting privileges." The Abbott plaintiffs did not file a petition for cer-
tiorari in this Court.

On April 6, one week after the Fifth Circuit's decision, petitioners, a group of abortion providers (many of
whom were plaintiffs in the previous lawsuit), filed the present lawsuit in Federal District Court.

They sought an injunction preventing enforcement of the admitting-privileges provision as applied to physi-
cians at two abortion facilities, one operated by Whole Woman's Health in McAllen and the other operated by
Nova Health Systems in El Paso. They also sought an injunction prohibiting enforcement of the surgical-center
provision anywhere in Texas. They claimed that the admitting-privileges provision and the surgical-center pro-
vision violated the Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment, as interpreted in Casey ...

...

[T]he District Court determined that the surgical-center requirement "imposes an undue burden on the right
of women throughout Texas to seek a previability abortion," and that the "admitting-privileges requirement,
... in conjunction with the ambulatory-surgical-center requirement, imposes an undue burden on the right of
women in the Rio Grande Valley, El Paso, and West Texas to seek a previability abortion." The District Court
concluded that the "two provisions" would cause "the closing of almost all abortion clinics in Texas that were
operating legally in the fall of 2013," and thereby create a constitutionally "impermissible obstacle as applied
to all women seeking a previability abortion" by "restricting access to previously available legal facilities." On
August 29, 2014, the court enjoined the enforcement of the two provisions ...

Undue Burden--Legal Standard

We begin with the standard, as described in Casey. We recognize that the "State has a legitimate interest in seeing
to it that abortion, like any other medical procedure, is performed under circumstances that insure maximum
safety for the patient." Roe v. Wade (1973). But, we added, "a statute which, while furthering [a] valid state
568 | THE UNDUE BURDEN STANDARD

interest, has the effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman's choice cannot be considered
a permissible means of serving its legitimate ends." Casey (plurality opinion). Moreover, "[u]nnecessary health
regulations that have the purpose or effect of presenting a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion
impose an undue burden on the right."

...

Undue Burden-Admitting Privileges Requirement

We have found nothing in Texas' record evidence that shows that, compared to prior law (which required a
"working arrangement" with a doctor with admitting privileges), the new law advanced Texas' legitimate inter-
est in protecting women's health. We add that, when directly asked at oral argument whether Texas knew of
a single instance in which the new requirement would have helped even one woman obtain better treatment,
Texas admitted that there was no evidence in the record of such a case. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 47. This answer is
consistent with the findings of the other Federal District Courts that have considered the health benefits of other
States' similar admitting-privileges laws.

At the same time, the record evidence indicates that the admitting-privileges requirement places a "substantial
obstacle in the path of a woman's choice." Casey (plurality opinion). The District Court found, as of the time
the admitting-privileges requirement began to be enforced, the number of facilities providing abortions dropped
in half, from about 40 to about 20. Eight abortion clinics closed in the months leading up to the requirement's
effective date. Cf. Brief for Planned Parenthood Federation of America et al. as Amici Curiae (noting that abor-
tion facilities in Waco, San Angelo, and Midland no longer operate because Planned Parenthood is "unable to
find local physicians in those communities with privileges who are willing to provide abortions due to the size of
those communities and the hostility that abortion providers face"). Eleven more closed on the day the admitting
privileges requirement took effect. Other evidence helps to explain why the new requirement led to the closure
of clinics. We read that other evidence in light of a brief filed in this Court by the Society of Hospital Medicine.

... In our view, the record contains sufficient evidence that the admitting privileges requirement led to the closure
of half of Texas' clinics, or thereabouts. Those closures meant fewer doctors, longer waiting times, and increased
crowding. Record evidence also supports the finding that after the admitting-privileges provision went into
effect, the "number of women of reproductive age living in a county ... more than 150 miles from a provider 614
increased from approximately 86,000 to 400,000 ... and the number of women living in a county more than 200
miles from a provider from approximately 10,000 to 290,000." We recognize that increased driving distances do
not always constitute an "undue burden." See Casey (joint opinion of O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.). But
here, those increases are but one additional burden, which, when taken together with others that the closings
brought about, and when viewed in light of the virtual absence of any health benefit, lead us to conclude that
the record adequately supports the District Court's "undue burden" conclusion.

Undue Burden--Surgical-Center Requirement

The second challenged provision of Texas' new law sets forth the surgical center requirement. Prior to enactment
of the new requirement, Texas law required abortion facilities to meet a host of health and safety requirements.
                                                                                                   THE UNDUE BURDEN STANDARD | 569

Under those pre-existing laws, facilities were subject to annual reporting and recordkeeping requirements; a
quality assurance program; personnel policies and staffing requirements; physical and environmental require-
ments; infection control standards; disclosure requirements; patient rights standards; and medical- and clinical-
services standards, including anesthesia standards. These requirements are policed by random and announced
inspections, at least annually, as well as administrative penalties, injunctions, civil penalties, and criminal penal-
ties for certain violations.

H.B. 2 added the requirement that an "abortion facility" meet the "minimum standards ... for ambulatory surgi-
cal centers" under Texas law. The surgical center regulations include, among other things, detailed specifications
relating to the size of the nursing staff, building dimensions, and other building requirements. The nursing staff
must comprise at least "an adequate number of [registered nurses] on duty to meet the following minimum staff
requirements: director of the department (or designee), and supervisory and staff personnel for each service area
to assure the immediate availability of [a registered nurse] for emergency care or for any patient when needed,"
as well as "a second individual on duty on the premises who is trained and currently certified in basic cardiac life
support until all patients have been discharged from the facility" for facilities that provide moderate sedation,
such as most abortion facilities. Facilities must include a full surgical suite with an operating room that has "a
clear floor area of at least 240 square feet" in which "[t]he minimum clear dimension between built-in cabinets,
counters, and shelves shall be 14 feet." There must be a preoperative patient holding room and a postoperative
recovery suite. The former "shall be provided and arranged in a one-way traffic pattern so that patients entering
from outside the surgical suite can change, gown, and move directly into the restricted corridor of the surgical
suite," and the latter "shall be arranged to provide a one-way traffic pattern from the restricted surgical corridor
to the postoperative recovery suite, and then to the extended observation rooms or discharge." Surgical centers
must meet numerous other spatial requirements, including specific corridor widths. Surgical centers must also
have an advanced heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system, and must satisfy particular piping system
and plumbing requirements. Dozens of other sections list additional requirements that apply to surgical centers.

There is considerable evidence in the record supporting the District Court's findings indicating that the statu-
tory provision requiring all abortion facilities to meet all surgical-center standards does not benefit patients and
is not necessary ...

The record makes clear that the surgical-center requirement provides no benefit when complications arise in
the context of an abortion produced through medication. That is because, in such a case, complications would
almost always arise only after the patient has left the facility. The record also contains evidence indicating that
abortions taking place in an abortion facility are safe--indeed, safer than numerous procedures that take place
outside hospitals and to which Texas does not apply its surgical-center requirements ... These facts indicate that
the surgical-center provision imposes "a requirement that simply is not based on differences" between abortion
and other surgical procedures "that are reasonably related to" preserving women's health, the asserted "pur-
pos[e] of the Act in which it is found." Doe (quoting Morey v. Doud, (1957); internal quotation marks omitted).

... Moreover, many surgical-center requirements are inappropriate as applied to surgical abortions ... [A]bortions
typically involve either the administration of medicines or procedures performed through the natural opening
of the birth canal, which is itself not sterile.
570 | THE UNDUE BURDEN STANDARD

The upshot is that this record evidence, along with the absence of any evidence to the contrary, provides ample
support for the District Court's conclusion that "[m]any of the building standards mandated by the act and
its implementing rules have such a tangential relationship to patient safety in the context of abortion as to be
nearly arbitrary." That conclusion, along with the supporting evidence, provides sufficient support for the more
general conclusion that the surgical-center requirement "will not [provide] better care or ... more frequent pos-
itive outcomes." Ibid. The record evidence thus supports the ultimate legal conclusion that the surgical-center
requirement is not necessary.

At the same time, the record provides adequate evidentiary support for the District Court's conclusion that the
surgical-center requirement places a substantial obstacle in the path of women seeking an abortion. The par-
ties stipulated that the requirement would further reduce the number of abortion facilities available to seven
or eight facilities, located in Houston, Austin, San Antonio, and Dallas/Fort Worth. In the District Court's
view, the proposition that these "seven or eight providers could meet the demand of the entire State stretches
credulity." We take this statement as a finding that these few facilities could not "meet" that "demand."

... [C]ommon sense suggests that, more often than not, a physical facility that satisfies a certain physical demand
will not be able to meet five times that demand without expanding or otherwise incurring significant costs. Sup-
pose that we know only that a certain grocery store 618 serves 200 customers per week, that a certain apartment
building provides apartments for 200 families, that a certain train station welcomes 200 trains per day. While it
is conceivable that the store, the apartment building, or the train station could just as easily provide for 1,000
customers, families, or trains at no significant additional cost, crowding, or delay, most of us would find this
possibility highly improbable. The dissent takes issue with this general, intuitive point by arguing that many
places operate below capacity and that in any event, facilities could simply hire additional providers. We disagree
that, according to common sense, medical facilities, well known for their wait times, operate below capacity as a
general matter. And the fact that so many facilities were forced to close by the admitting-privileges requirement
means that hiring more physicians would not be quite as simple as the dissent suggests. Courts are free to base
their findings on commonsense inferences drawn from the evidence ...

...

More fundamentally, in the face of no threat to women's health, Texas seeks to force women to travel long dis-
tances to get abortions in crammed-to-capacity superfacilities. Patients seeking these services are less likely to
get the kind of individualized attention, serious conversation, and emotional support that doctors at less taxed
facilities may have offered. Healthcare facilities and medical professionals are not fungible commodities. Surgi-
cal centers attempting to accommodate sudden, vastly increased demand, may find that quality of care declines.
Another commonsense inference that the District Court made is that these effects would be harmful to, not
supportive of, women's health.

We consider three additional arguments that Texas makes and deem none persuasive.

...
                                                                                                   THE UNDUE BURDEN STANDARD | 571

For these reasons the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further pro-
ceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Ginsburg, concurring

* * * When a State severely limits access to safe and legal procedures, women in desperate circumstances may
resort to unlicensed rogue practitioners, faute de mieux, at great risk to their health and safety. See Brief for Ten
Pennsylvania Abortion Care Providers as Amici Curiae. So long as this Court adheres to Roe v. Wade (1973),
and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey (1992), Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers laws
like H. B. 2 that "do little or nothing for health, but rather strew impediments to abortion," cannot survive judi-
cial inspection.

Justice Thomas, dissenting [omitted], Justice Alito, with whom the Chief Justice and Justice Thomas join, dis-
senting.

The constitutionality of laws regulating abortion is one of the most controversial issues in American law, but
this case does not require us to delve into that contentious dispute. Instead, the dispositive issue here concerns a
workaday question that can arise in any case no matter the subject, namely, whether the present case is barred by
res judicata. As a court of law, we have an obligation to apply such rules in a neutral fashion in all cases, regardless
of the subject of the suit. If anything, when a case involves a controversial issue, we should be especially careful to
be scrupulously neutral in applying such rules. The Court has not done so here * * * and will undermine public
confidence in the Court as a fair and neutral arbiter. * * *

Even if res judicata did not bar either facial claim, a sweeping, statewide injunction against the enforcement of
the admitting privileges and ASC requirements would still be unjustified. Petitioners in this case are abortion
clinics and physicians who perform abortions. If they were simply asserting a constitutional right to conduct a
business or to practice a profession without unnecessary state regulation, they would have little chance of success
...

Under our abortion cases, however, they are permitted to rely on the right of the abortion patients they serve.
Thus, what matters for present purposes is not the effect of the H.B. 2 provisions on petitioners but the effect
on their patients. Under our cases, petitioners must show that the admitting privileges and ASC requirements
impose an "undue burden" on women seeking abortions. Gonzales v. Carhart (2007). And in order to obtain
the sweeping relief they seek--facial invalidation of those provisions--they must show, at a minimum, that these
provisions have an unconstitutional impact on at least a "large fraction" of Texas women of reproductive age.
Such a situation could result if the clinics able to comply with the new requirements either lacked the requisite
overall capacity or were located too far away to serve a "large fraction" of the women in question. Petitioners
did not make that showing. Instead of offering direct evidence, they relied on two crude inferences. First, they
pointed to the number of abortion clinics that closed after the enactment of H.B. 2, and asked that it be inferred
that all these closures resulted from the two challenged provisions. They made little effort to show why particu-
lar clinics closed. Second, they pointed to the number of abortions performed annually at ASCs before H.B. 2
§572 | THE UNDUE BURDEN STANDARD

took effect and, because this figure is well below the total number of abortions performed each year in the State,
they asked that it be inferred that ASC-compliant clinics could not meet the demands of women in the State.
Petitioners failed to provide any evidence of the actual capacity of the facilities that would be available to per-
form abortions in compliance with the new law--even though they provided this type of evidence in their first
case to the District Court at trial and then to this Court in their application for interim injunctive relief. * * *

I therefore respectfully dissent.

    Decision: Reversed
    Plurality: Breyer, joined by Ginsburg, Sotomayor, Kagan
    Concurrence: Roberts
    Dissent: Alito, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, Thomas

JUSTICE BREYER announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which JUSTICE
GINSBURG, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, and JUSTICE KAGAN join.

...

In this case, we consider the constitutionality of a Louisiana statute, Act 620, that is almost word-for-word iden-
tical to Texas' admitting-privileges law. See La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §40:1061.10(A)(2)(a) (West 2020). As in Whole
Woman's Health, the District Court found that the statute offers no significant health benefit. It found that
conditions on admitting privileges common to hospitals throughout the State have made and will continue to
make it impossible for abortion providers to obtain conforming privileges for reasons that have nothing to do
with the State's asserted interests in promoting women's health and safety. And it found that this inability places
a substantial obstacle in the path of women seeking an abortion. As in Whole Woman's Health, the substantial
obstacle the Act imposes, and the absence of any health-related benefit, led the District Court to conclude that
the law imposes an undue burden and is therefore unconstitutional ...

The statute defines "active admitting privileges" to mean that the doctor must be "a member in good standing"
of the hospital's "medical staff ... with the ability to admit a patient and to provide diagnostic and surgical ser-
vices to such patient." Ibid.; La. Admin. Code, tit. 48, pt. I, §4401. Failure to comply may lead to fines of up to
$4,000 per violation, license revocation, and civil liability ...

...
                                                                                                   THE UNDUE BURDEN STANDARD | 573

The State's unmistakable concession of standing as part of its effort to obtain a quick decision from the District
Court on the merits of the plaintiffs' undue-burden claims bars our consideration of it here. See Wood v. Mil­
yard, (2012); cf. post, at 24-25 (Alito, J., dissenting) (addressing the Court's approach to claims forfeited, rather
than waived); post, at 7-8 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) (addressing waiver of structural rather than prudential objec-
tions) ... In any event, the rule the State invokes is hardly absolute. We have long permitted abortion providers
to invoke the rights of their actual or potential patients in challenges to abortion-related regulations ... And we
have generally permitted plaintiffs to assert third-party rights in cases where the " `enforcement of the challenged
restriction against the litigant would result indirectly in the violation of third parties' rights.' " Kowalski, (quot-
ing Warth) ...

Turning to the merits, we apply the constitutional standards set forth in our earlier abortion-related cases, and
in particular in Casey and Whole Woman's Health. ... In Whole Woman's Health, we quoted Casey in explaining
that "`a statute which, while furthering [a] valid state interest has the effect of placing a substantial obstacle in
the path of a woman's choice cannot be considered a permissible means of serving its legitimate ends ... '" We
added that "`[u]nnecessary health regulations'" impose an unconstitutional " `undue burden' " if they have "`the
purpose or effect of presenting a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion,'" (quoting Casey, empha-
sis added).

The evidence on which the District Court relied in this case is even stronger and more detailed.

The District Court found that enforcing the admitting-privileges requirement would "result in a drastic reduc-
tion in the number and geographic distribution of abortion providers." Id., at 87. In light of demographic, eco-
nomic, and other evidence, the court concluded that this reduction would make it impossible for "many women
seeking a safe, legal abortion in Louisiana ... to obtain one" and that it would impose "substantial obstacles" on
those who could. Id., at 88.

Just as in Whole Woman's Health, the experiences of the individual doctors in this case support the District
Court's factual finding that Louisiana's admitting-privileges requirement, like that in Texas' law, serves no "`rel-
evant credentialing function.'" (quoting Whole Woman's Health).

... would leave Louisiana with just one clinic with one provider to serve the 10,000 women annually who seek
abortions in the State.

... As in Whole Woman's Health, the reduction in abortion providers caused by Act 620 would inevitably mean
"longer waiting times, and increased crowding."

... Even if they obtain an appointment at a clinic, women who might previously have gone to a clinic in Baton
Rouge or Shreveport would face increased driving distances. New Orleans is nearly a five hour drive from
Shreveport; it is over an hour from Baton Rouge; and Baton Rouge is more than four hours from Shreve-
port. The impact of those increases would be magnified by Louisiana's requirement that every woman undergo
an ultrasound and receive mandatory counseling at least 24 hours before an abortion. La. Rev. Stat. Ann.
574 | THE UNDUE BURDEN STANDARD

§40:1061.10(D). A Shreveport resident seeking an abortion who might previously have obtained care at one of
that city's local clinics would either have to spend nearly 20 hours driving back and forth to Doe 5's clinic twice,
or else find overnight lodging in New Orleans.

We turn finally to the law's asserted benefits. The District Court found that there was "`no significant health-
related problem that the new law helped to cure.'" (quoting Whole Woman's Health). It found that the
admitting-privileges requirement "[d]oes [n]ot [p]rotect [w]omen's [h]ealth," provides "no significant health
benefits," and makes no improvement to women's health "compared to prior law." Our examination of the
record convinces us that these findings are not "clearly erroneous."

Taken together, we think that these findings and the evidence that underlies them are sufficient to support the
District Court's conclusion that Act 620 would place substantial obstacles in the path of women seeking an
abortion in Louisiana ...

This case is similar to, nearly identical with, Whole Woman's Health. And the law must consequently reach a
similar conclusion. Act 620 is unconstitutional. The Court of Appeals' judgment is erroneous.

It is Reversed.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, concurring in the judgment.

...

The legal doctrine of stare decisis requires us, absent special circumstances, to treat like cases alike. The Louisiana
law imposes a burden on access to abortion just as severe as that imposed by the Texas law, for the same reasons.
Therefore Louisiana's law cannot stand under our precedents.

In this context, courts applying a balancing test would be asked in essence to weigh the State's interests in "pro-
tecting the potentiality of human life" and the health of the woman, on the one hand, against the woman's lib-
erty interest in defining her "own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human
life" on the other ...

Nothing about Casey suggested that a weighing of costs and benefits of an abortion regulation was a job for the
courts. On the contrary, we have explained that the "traditional rule" that "state and federal legislatures [have]
wide discretion to pass legislation in areas where there is medical and scientific uncertainty" is "consistent with
Casey ..."

The upshot of Casey is clear: The several restrictions that did not impose a substantial obstacle were constitu-
tional, while the restriction that did impose a substantial obstacle was unconstitutional. To be sure, the Court
at times discussed the benefits of the regulations, including when it distinguished spousal notification from
parental consent ...

So long as that showing is made, the only question for a court is whether a law has the "effect of placing a sub-
stantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus ..."
                                                                                                   THE UNDUE BURDEN STANDARD | 575

Mazurek v. Armstrong places this understanding of Casey's undue burden standard beyond doubt. Mazurek
involved a challenge to a Montana law restricting the performance of abortions to licensed physicians. It was
"uncontested that there was insufficient evidence of a `substantial obstacle' to abortion." Therefore, once the
Court found that the Montana Legislature had not acted with an "unlawful motive," the Court's work was
complete. Ibid. In fact, the Court found the challengers' argument--that the law was invalid because "all health
evidence contradicts the [State's] claim that there is any health basis for the law"--to be "squarely foreclosed by
Casey itself ..."

The question is not whether we would reach the same findings from the same record ...

We accordingly will not disturb the factual conclusions of the trial court unless we are "left with the definite and
firm conviction that a mistake has been committed." United States v. United States Gypsum Co., (1948). In my
view, the District Court's work reveals no such clear error, for the reasons the plurality explains. Ante, at 19-35.
The District Court findings therefore bind us in this case. * * *

Stare decisis instructs us to treat like cases alike. The result in this case is controlled by our decision four years
ago invalidating a nearly identical Texas law. The Louisiana law burdens women seeking previability abortions
to the same extent as the Texas law, according to factual findings that are not clearly erroneous.

For that reason, I concur in the judgment of the Court that the Louisiana law is unconstitutional.

JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.

...

Abortion presents a profound moral issue on which Americans hold sharply conflicting views. Some believe fer-
vently that a human person comes into being at conception and that abortion ends an innocent life. Others feel
just as strongly that any regulation of abortion invades a woman's right to control her own body and prevents
women from achieving full equality. Still others in a third group think that abortion should be allowed under
some but not all circumstances, and those within this group hold a variety of views about the particular restric-
tions that should be imposed ...

At the time of Roe, 30 States still prohibited abortion at all stages. In the years prior to that decision, about a
third of the States had liberalized their laws, but Roe abruptly ended that political process. It imposed the same
highly restrictive regime on the entire Nation, and it effectively struck down the abortion laws of every single
State. As Justice Byron White aptly put it in his dissent, the decision represented the "exercise of raw judicial
power," and it sparked a national controversy that has embittered our political culture for a half century ...

Paradoxically, the judgment in Casey did a fair amount of overruling. Several important abortion decisions were
overruled in toto, and Roe itself was overruled in part. Casey threw out Roe's trimester scheme and substituted a
new rule of uncertain origin under which States were forbidden to adopt any regulation that imposed an "undue
burden" on a woman's right to have an abortion. The decision provided no clear guidance about the difference
between a "due" and an "undue" burden. But the three Justices who authored the controlling opinion "call[ed]
the contending sides of a national controversy to end their national division" by treating the Court's decision as
the final settlement of the question of the constitutional right to abortion ...

As has become increasingly apparent in the intervening years, Casey did not achieve that goal. Americans con-
tinue to hold passionate and widely divergent views on abortion, and state legislatures have acted accordingly.
                                                                                                   THE UNDUE BURDEN STANDARD | 577

Some have recently enacted laws allowing abortion, with few restrictions, at all stages of pregnancy. Others have
tightly restricted abortion beginning well before viability. And in this case, 26 States have expressly asked this
Court to overrule Roe and Casey and allow the States to regulate or prohibit pre-viability abortions ...

Before us now is one such state law. The State of Mississippi asks us to uphold the constitutionality of a law
that generally prohibits an abortion after the 15th week of pregnancy--several weeks before the point at which
a fetus is now regarded as "viable" outside the womb. In defending this law, the State's primary argument is
that we should reconsider and overrule Roe and Casey and once again allow each State to regulate abortion as
its citizens wish. On the other side, respondents and the Solicitor General ask us to reaffirm Roe and Casey, and
they contend that the Mississippi law cannot stand if we do so. Allowing Mississippi to prohibit abortions after
15 weeks of pregnancy, they argue, "would be no different than overruling Casey and Roe entirely." Brief for
Respondents 43. They contend that "no half-measures" are available and that we must either reaffirm or over-
rule Roe and Casey ...

We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled. The Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such
right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision, including the one on which the defenders of Roe
and Casey now chiefly rely--the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. That provision has been
held to guarantee some rights that are not mentioned in the Constitution, but any such right must be "deeply
rooted in this Nation's history and tradition" and "implicit in the concept of ordered liberty." Washington v.
Glucksberg, (1997) ...

The right to abortion does not fall within this category. Until the latter part of the 20th century, such a right was
entirely unknown in American law. Indeed, when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, three quarters of
the States made abortion a crime at all stages of pregnancy. The abortion right is also critically different from any
other right that this Court has held to fall within the Fourteenth Amendment's protection of "liberty." Roe's
defenders characterize the abortion right as similar to the rights recognized in past decisions involving matters
such as intimate sexual relations, contraception, and marriage, but abortion is fundamentally different, as both
Roe and Casey acknowledged, because it destroys what those decisions called "fetal life" and what the law now
before us describes as an "unborn human being" ...

Stare decisis, the doctrine on which Casey's controlling opinion was based, does not compel unending adherence
to Roe's abuse of judicial authority. Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally
weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national settlement of
the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division ...

It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people's elected representatives. "The
permissibility of abortion, and the limitations, upon it, are to be resolved like most important questions in our
democracy: by citizens trying to persuade one another and then voting." Casey, (Scalia, J., concurring in judg-
ment in part and dissenting in part). That is what the Constitution and the rule of law demand ...

In interpreting what is meant by the Fourteenth Amendment's reference to "liberty," we must guard against the
natural human tendency to confuse what that Amendment protects with our own ardent views about the lib-
erty that Americans should enjoy. That is why the Court has long been "reluctant" to recognize rights that are
578 | THE UNDUE BURDEN STANDARD

not mentioned in the Constitution. Collins v. Harker Heights, (1992)."Substantive due process has at times been
a treacherous field for this Court," Moore v. East Cleveland, (1977) (plurality opinion), and it has sometimes led
the Court to usurp authority that the Constitution entrusts to the people's elected representatives. As the Court
cautioned in Glucksberg, "[w]e must ... exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground in
this field, lest the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause be subtly transformed into the policy preferences
of the Members of this Court." ...

Until the latter part of the 20th century, there was no support in American law for a constitutional right to
obtain an abortion. No state constitutional provision had recognized such a right. Until a few years before Roe
was handed down, no federal or state court had recognized such a right. Nor had any scholarly treatise of which
we are aware. And although law review articles are not reticent about advocating new rights, the earliest article
proposing a constitutional right to abortion that has come to our attention was published only a few years before
Roe ...

Not only was there no support for such a constitutional right until shortly before Roe, but abortion had long
been a crime in every single State. At common law, abortion was criminal in at least some stages of pregnancy
and was regarded as unlawful and could have very serious consequences at all stages. American law followed the
common law until a wave of statutory restrictions in the 1800s expanded criminal liability for abortions. By the
time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, three-quarters of the States had made abortion a crime at
any stage of pregnancy, and the remaining States would soon follow ...

Roe either ignored or misstated this history, and Casey declined to reconsider Roe's faulty historical analysis. It is
therefore important to set the record straight ...

We begin with the common law, under which abortion was a crime at least after "quickening"--i.e., the first felt
movement of the fetus in the womb, which usually occurs between the 16th and 18th week of pregnancy ...

English cases dating all the way back to the 13th century corroborate the treatises' statements that abortion was
a crime ...

That the common law did not condone even prequickening abortions is confirmed by what one might call a
proto-felony-murder rule. Hale and Blackstone explained a way in which a pre-quickening abortion could rise
to the level of a homicide. Hale wrote that if a physician gave a woman "with child" a "potion" to cause an abor-
tion, and the woman died, it was "murder" because the potion was given "unlawfully to destroy her child within
her." 1 Hale 429- 430 (emphasis added) ...

The original ground for drawing a distinction between pre- and post-quickening abortions is not entirely clear,
but some have attributed the rule to the difficulty of proving that a pre-quickening fetus was alive. At that time,
there were no scientific methods for detecting pregnancy in its early stages, and thus, as one court put it in 1872:
"[U]ntil the period of quickening there is no evidence of life; and whatever may be said of the fetus, the law has
fixed upon this period of gestation as the time when the child is endowed with life" because "fetal movements
                                                                                                   THE UNDUE BURDEN STANDARD | 579

are the first clearly marked and well defined evidences of life." Evans v. People (emphasis added); Cooper ("In con-
templation of law life commences at the moment of quickening, at that moment when the embryo gives the first
physical proof of life, no matter when it first received it" (emphasis added)) ...

At any rate, the original ground for the quickening rule is of little importance for present purposes because the
rule was abandoned in the 19th century. During that period, treatise writers and commentators criticized the
quickening distinction as "neither in accordance with the result of medical experience, nor with the principles
of the common law." F. Wharton, Criminal Law §1220, p. 606 (rev. 4th ed. 1857) (footnotes omitted); see also
J. Beck, Researches in Medicine and Medical Jurisprudence 26-28 (2d ed. 1835) (describing the quickening dis-
tinction as "absurd" and "injurious") ...

In this country during the 19th century, the vast majority of the States enacted statutes criminalizing abortion at
all stages of pregnancy. See Appendix A, infra (listing state statutory provisions in chronological order). By 1868,
the year when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, threequarters of the States, 28 out of 37, had enacted
statutes making abortion a crime even if it was performed before quickening. See ibid. Of the nine States that
had not yet criminalized abortion at all stages, all but one did so by 1910. See ibid ...

This overwhelming consensus endured until the day Roe was decided. At that time, also by the Roe Court's
own count, a substantial majority--30 States--still prohibited abortion at all stages except to save the life of the
mother. See id., at 118, and n. 2 (listing States). And though Roe discerned a "trend toward liberalization" in
about "one third of the States," those States still criminalized some abortions and regulated them more strin-
gently than Roe would allow. Id., at 140, and n. 37; Tribe 2. In short, the "Court's opinion in Roe itself convinc-
ingly refutes the notion that the abortion liberty is deeply rooted in the history or tradition of our people." ...

We end this opinion where we began. Abortion presents a profound moral question. The Constitution does not
prohibit the citizens of each State from regulating or prohibiting abortion. Roe and Casey arrogated that author-
ity. We now overrule those decisions and return that authority to the people and their elected representatives.

The judgment of the Fifth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.

It is so ordered.

JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring.

...

I write separately to emphasize a second, more fundamental reason why there is no abortion guarantee lurking
in the Due Process Clause. Considerable historical evidence indicates that "due process of law" merely required
executive and judicial actors to comply with legislative enactments and the common law when depriving a
person of life, liberty, or property ... Other sources, by contrast, suggest that "due process of law" prohibited
legislatures "from authorizing the deprivation of a person's life, liberty, or property without providing him
the customary procedures to which freemen were entitled by the old law of England." United States v. Vaello
580 | THE UNDUE BURDEN STANDARD

Madero, (2022) (THOMAS, J., concurring). Either way, the Due Process Clause at most guarantees process.
It does not, as the Court's substantive due process cases suppose, "forbi[d] the government to infringe certain
`fundamental' liberty interests at all, no matter what process is provided." Reno v. Flores, (1993) ...

The Court today declines to disturb substantive due process jurisprudence generally or the doctrine's applica-
tion in other, specific contexts. Cases like Griswold v. Connecticut, (1965) (right of married persons to obtain
contraceptives)*; Lawrence v. Texas, (2003) (right to engage in private, consensual sexual acts); and Obergefell v.
Hodges, (2015) (right to same-sex marriage), are not at issue. The Court's abortion cases are unique, see ante, at
31-32, 66, 71-72, and no party has asked us to decide "whether our entire Fourteenth Amendment jurispru-
dence must be preserved or revised," McDonald, at 813 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). Thus, I agree that "[n]oth-
ing in [the Court's] opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion."
Ante, at 66.

For that reason, in future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court's substantive due process precedents,
including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell. Because any substantive due process decision is "demonstrably
erroneous," Ramos v. Louisiana, (2020) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 7), we have a
duty to "correct the error" established in those precedents, Gamble v. United States, (2019) (THOMAS, J., con-
curring) (slip op., at 9). After overruling these demonstrably erroneous decisions, the question would remain
whether other constitutional provisions guarantee the myriad rights that our substantive due process cases have
generated. For example, we could consider whether any of the rights announced in this Court's substantive
due process cases are "privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States" protected by the Fourteenth
Amendment. Amdt. 14, §1 ... To answer that question, we would need to decide important antecedent ques-
tions, including whether the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects any rights that are not enumerated in the
Constitution and, if so, how to identify those rights ... That said, even if the Clause does protect unenumerated
rights, the Court conclusively demonstrates that abortion is not one of them under any plausible interpretive
approach ...

Substantive due process conflicts with that textual command and has harmed our country in many ways.
Accordingly, we should eliminate it from our jurisprudence at the earliest opportunity ...

JUSTICE BREYER, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, and JUSTICE KAGAN, dissenting.

...

For half a century, Roe v. Wade (1973) and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey (1992) have pro-
tected the liberty and equality of women. Roe held, and Casey reaffirmed, that the Constitution safeguards a
woman's right to decide for herself whether to bear a child. Roe held, and Casey reaffirmed, that in the first
stages of pregnancy, the government could not make that choice for women. The government could not control
a woman's body or the course of a woman's life: It could not determine what the woman's future would be.
See Casey, at 853; Gonzales v. Carhart, 171-172 (2007) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). Respecting a woman as an
autonomous being, and granting her full equality, meant giving her substantial choice over this most personal
and most consequential of all life decisions ...
                                                                                                   THE UNDUE BURDEN STANDARD | 581

Today, the Court discards that balance. It says that from the very moment of fertilization, a woman has no rights
to speak of. A State can force her to bring a pregnancy to term, even at the steepest personal and familial costs.
An abortion restriction, the majority holds, is permissible whenever rational, the lowest level of scrutiny known
to the law. And because, as the Court has often stated, protecting fetal life is rational, States will feel free to enact
all manner of restrictions. The Mississippi law at issue here bars abortions after the 15th week of pregnancy.
Under the majority's ruling, though, another State's law could do so after ten weeks, or five or three or one--or,
again, from the moment of fertilization. States have already passed such laws, in anticipation of today's ruling.
More will follow. Some States have enacted laws extending to all forms of abortion procedure, including taking
medication in one's own home. They have passed laws without any exceptions for when the woman is the victim
of rape or incest. Under those laws, a woman will have to bear her rapist's child or a young girl her father's--no
matter if doing so will destroy her life. So too, after today's ruling, some States may compel women to carry to
term a fetus with severe physical anomalies--for example, one afflicted with Tay-Sachs disease, sure to die within
a few years of birth. States may even argue that a prohibition on abortion need make no provision for protecting
a woman from risk of death or physical harm. Across a vast array of circumstances, a State will be able to impose
its moral choice on a woman and coerce her to give birth to a child ...

The majority tries to hide the geographically expansive effects of its holding. Today's decision, the majority says,
permits "each State" to address abortion as it pleases. Ante, at 79. That is cold comfort, of course, for the poor
woman who cannot get the money to fly to a distant State for a procedure. Above all others, women lacking
financial resources will suffer from today's decision. In any event, interstate restrictions will also soon be in the
offing. After this decision, some States may block women from traveling out of State to obtain abortions, or even
from receiving abortion medications from out of State. Some may criminalize efforts, including the provision of
information or funding, to help women gain access to other States' abortion services. Most threatening of all, no
language in today's decision stops the Federal Government from prohibiting abortions nationwide, once again
from the moment of conception and without exceptions for rape or incest. If that happens, "the views of [an
individual State's] citizens" will not matter. Ante, at 1. The challenge for a woman will be to finance a trip not
to "New York [or] California" but to Toronto. Ante, at 4 (KAVANAUGH, J., concurring) ...

Whatever the exact scope of the coming laws, one result of today's decision is certain: the curtailment of
women's rights, and of their status as free and equal citizens. Yesterday, the Constitution guaranteed that a
woman confronted with an unplanned pregnancy could (within reasonable limits) make her own decision about
whether to bear a child, with all the life-transforming consequences that act involves. And in thus safeguard-
ing each woman's reproductive freedom, the Constitution also protected "[t]he ability of women to participate
equally in [this Nation's] economic and social life." Casey, at 856. But no longer. As of today, this Court holds, a
State can always force a woman to give birth, prohibiting even the earliest abortions. A State can thus transform
what, when freely undertaken, is a wonder into what, when forced, may be a nightmare. Some women, especially
women of means, will find ways around the State's assertion of power. Others--those without money or child-
care or the ability to take time off from work--will not be so fortunate. Maybe they will try an unsafe method
of abortion, and come to physical harm, or even die. Maybe they will undergo pregnancy and have a child, but
582 | THE UNDUE BURDEN STANDARD

at significant personal or familial cost. At the least, they will incur the cost of losing control of their lives. The
Constitution will, today's majority holds, provide no shield, despite its guarantees of liberty and equality for all
...

And no one should be confident that this majority is done with its work. The right Roe and Casey recognized
does not stand alone. To the contrary, the Court has linked it for decades to other settled freedoms involving
bodily integrity, familial relationships, and procreation. Most obviously, the right to terminate a pregnancy arose
straight out of the right to purchase and use contraception. See Griswold v. Connecticut, (1965); Eisenstadt v.
Baird, (1972). In turn, those rights led, more recently, to rights of same-sex intimacy and marriage. See Lawrence
v. Texas, (2003); Obergefell v. Hodges, (2015). They are all part of the same constitutional fabric, protecting
autonomous decision making over the most personal of life decisions. The majority (or to be more accurate,
most of it) is eager to tell us today that nothing it does "cast[s] doubt on precedents that do not concern abor-
tion." Ante, at 66; cf. ante, at 3 (THOMAS, J., concurring) (advocating the overruling of Griswold, Lawrence,
and Obergefell). But how could that be? The lone rationale for what the majority does today is that the right to
elect an abortion is not "deeply rooted in history": Not until Roe, the majority argues, did people think abortion
fell within the Constitution's guarantee of liberty. Ante, at 32. The same could be said, though, of most of the
rights the majority claims it is not tampering with. The majority could write just as long an opinion showing,
for example, that until the mid-20th century, "there was no support in American law for a constitutional right
to obtain [contraceptives]." Ante, at 15. So one of two things must be true. Either the majority does not really
believe in its own reasoning. Or if it does, all rights that have no history stretching back to the mid19th century
are insecure. Either the mass of the majority's opinion is hypocrisy, or additional constitutional rights are under
threat. It is one or the other ...

In sum, none of the cases the majority cites is analogous to today's decision to overrule 50- and 30-year-old water-
shed constitutional precedents that remain unweakened by any changes of law or fact.

The Right to Die

Washington v. Glucksberg

521 U.S. 702 (1997)

    Vote: 9-0
    Decision: Reversed

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.

...

The question presented in this case is whether Washington's prohibition against "caus[ing]" or "aid[ing]" a sui-
cide offends the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. We hold that it does not.

It has always been a crime to assist a suicide in the State of Washington. In 1854, Washington's first Territorial
Legislature outlawed "assisting another in the commission of self murder." Today, Washington law provides: "A
person is guilty of promoting a suicide attempt when he knowingly causes or aids another person to attempt
suicide." "Promoting a suicide attempt" is a felony, punishable by up to five years' imprisonment and up to a
$10,000 fine. At the same time, Washington's Natural Death Act, enacted in 1979, states that the "withholding
or withdrawal of life sustaining treatment" at a patient's direction "shall not, for any purpose, constitute a sui-
cide."

Petitioners in this case are the State of Washington and its Attorney General. Respondents Harold Glucksberg,
M. D., Abigail Halperin, M. D., Thomas A. Preston, M. D., and Peter Shalit, M. D., are physicians who practice
in Washington. These doctors occasionally treat terminally ill, suffering patients, and declare that they would
assist these patients in ending their lives if not for Washington's assisted suicide ban. In January 1994, respon-
dents, along with three gravely ill, pseudonymous plaintiffs who have since died and Compassion in Dying, a
nonprofit organization that counsels people considering physician assisted suicide, sued in the United States Dis-
trict Court, seeking a declaration that Wash Rev. Code 9A.36.060(1) (1994) is, on its face, unconstitutional.

The plaintiffs asserted "the existence of a liberty interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment which
extends to a personal choice by a mentally competent, terminally ill adult to commit physician assisted suicide."
584 | THE RIGHT TO DIE

Relying primarily on Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), and Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Dept. of Health
(1990), the District Court agreed, and concluded that Washington's assisted suicide ban is unconstitutional
because it "places an undue burden on the exercise of [that] constitutionally protected liberty interest." * * *

A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, emphasizing that "[i]n the two hundred and five
years of our existence no constitutional right to aid in killing oneself has ever been asserted and upheld by a court
of final jurisdiction." The Ninth Circuit reheard the case en banc, reversed the panel's decision, and affirmed the
District Court. Like the District Court, the en banc Court of Appeals emphasized our Casey and Cruzan deci-
sions. The court also discussed what it described as "historical" and "current societal attitudes" toward suicide
and assisted suicide, and concluded that "the Constitution encompasses a due process liberty interest in con-
trolling the time and manner of one's death-that there is, in short, a constitutionally recognized `right to die.'
" After "[w]eighing and then balancing" this interest against Washington's various interests, the court held that
the State's assisted suicide ban was unconstitutional "as applied to terminally ill competent adults who wish to
hasten their deaths with medication prescribed by their physicians." * * * We granted certiorari and now reverse.

We begin, as we do in all due process cases, by examining our Nation's history, legal traditions, and practices. In
almost every State-indeed, in almost every western democracy-it is a crime to assist a suicide. The States' assisted
suicide bans are not innovations. Rather, they are longstanding expressions of the States' commitment to the
protection and preservation of all human life.

* * *

More specifically, for over 700 years, the Anglo American common law tradition has punished or otherwise
disapproved of both suicide and assisting suicide. In the 13th century ..."[t]he principle that suicide of a sane
person, for whatever reason, was a punishable felony was ... introduced into English common law." Centuries
later, Sir William Blackstone, whose COMMENTARIES ON THE LAWS OF ENGLAND not only provided
a definitive summary of the common law but was also a primary legal authority for 18th and 19th century
American lawyers, referred to suicide as "self murder" and "the pretended heroism, but real cowardice, of the
Stoic philosophers, who destroyed themselves to avoid those ills which they had not the fortitude to endure. ..."
Blackstone emphasized that "the law has ... ranked [suicide] among the highest crimes," although, anticipating
later developments, he conceded that the harsh and shameful punishments imposed for suicide "borde[r] a little
upon severity."

For the most part, the early American colonies adopted the common law approach. * * * Over time, however, the
American colonies abolished these harsh common law penalties. * * *

Nonetheless, although States moved away from Blackstone's treatment of suicide, courts continued to condemn
it as a grave public wrong.

* * *

The earliest American statute explicitly to outlaw assisting suicide was enacted in New York in 1828, and many
of the new States and Territories followed New York's example. Between 1857 and 1865, a New York commis-
                                                                                                                         THE RIGHT TO DIE | 585

sion ... drafted a criminal code that prohibited "aiding" a suicide and, specifically, "furnish[ing] another person
with any deadly weapon or poisonous drug, knowing that such person intends to use such weapon or drug in
taking his own life." By the time the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, it was a crime in most States to assist
a suicide. * * * In this century, the Model Penal Code also prohibited "aiding" suicide, prompting many States to
enact or revise their assisted suicide bans ...

Though deeply rooted, the States' assisted suicide bans have in recent years been reexamined and, generally, reaf-
firmed. Because of advances in medicine and technology, Americans today are increasingly likely to die in institu-
tions, from chronic illnesses. Public concern and democratic action are therefore sharply focused on how best to
protect dignity and independence at the end of life, with the result that there have been many significant changes
in state laws and in the attitudes these laws reflect. Many States, for example, now permit "living wills," surro-
gate health care decisionmaking, and the withdrawal or refusal of life sustaining medical treatment. At the same
time, however, voters and legislators continue for the most part to reaffirm their States' prohibitions on assisting
suicide. * * *

Thus, the States are currently engaged in serious, thoughtful examinations of physician assisted suicide and other
similar issues. For example, New York State's Task Force on Life and the Law-an ongoing, blue ribbon commis-
sion composed of doctors, ethicists, lawyers, religious leaders, and interested laymen ... unanimously concluded
that "[l]egalizing assisted suicide and euthanasia would pose profound risks to many individuals who are ill and
vulnerable. ... [T]he potential dangers of this dramatic change in public policy would outweigh any benefit that
might be achieved."

... [O]ur laws have consistently condemned, and continue to prohibit, assisting suicide. Despite changes in med-
ical technology and notwithstanding an increased emphasis on the importance of end of life decisionmaking, we
have not retreated from this prohibition. Against this backdrop of history, tradition, and practice, we now turn
to respondents' constitutional claim.

The Due Process Clause guarantees more than fair process, and the "liberty" it protects includes more than the
absence of physical restraint. The Clause also provides heightened protection against government interference
with certain fundamental rights and liberty interests. In a long line of cases, we have held that, in addition to
the specific freedoms protected by the Bill of Rights, the "liberty" specially protected by the Due Process Clause
includes the rights to marry, Loving v. Virginia (1967); to have children, Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson
(1942); to direct the education and upbringing of one's children, Meyer v. Nebraska (1923); Pierce v. Society of
Sisters (1925); to marital privacy, Griswold v. Connecticut (1965); to use contraception, Griswold, Eisenstadt v.
Baird (1972); to bodily integrity, Rochin v. California (1952), and to abortion, Casey. We have also assumed,
and strongly suggested, that the Due Process Clause protects the traditional right to refuse unwanted lifesaving
medical treatment. Cruzan.

But we "ha[ve] always been reluctant to expand the concept of substantive due process because guideposts for
responsible decisionmaking in this unchartered area are scarce and open ended." By extending constitutional
protection to an asserted right or liberty interest, we, to a great extent, place the matter outside the arena of pub-
586 | THE RIGHT TO DIE

lic debate and legislative action. We must therefore "exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break new
ground in this field," lest the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause be subtly transformed into the policy
preferences of the members of this Court.

Our established method of substantive due process analysis has two primary features: First, we have regularly
observed that the Due Process Clause specially protects those fundamental rights and liberties which are, objec-
tively, "deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition," and "implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,"
such that "neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were sacrificed," Palko v. Connecticut (1937). Second,
we have required in substantive due process cases a "careful description" of the asserted fundamental liberty
interest. Our Nation's history, legal traditions, and practices thus provide the crucial "guideposts for responsible
decisionmaking," that direct and restrain our exposition of the Due Process Clause. As we stated recently, the
Fourteenth Amendment "forbids the government to infringe ..."fundamental' liberty interests at all, no matter
what process is provided, unless the infringement is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest."

* * * Turning to the claim at issue here, the Court of Appeals stated that "[p]roperly analyzed, the first issue to
be resolved is whether there is a liberty interest in determining the time and manner of one's death," or, in other
words, "[i]s there a right to die?" Similarly, respondents assert a "liberty to choose how to die" and a right to
"control of one's final days," and describe the asserted liberty as "the right to choose a humane, dignified death,"
and "the liberty to shape death." As noted above, we have a tradition of carefully formulating the interest at
stake in substantive due process cases. For example, although Cruzan is often described as a "right to die" case,
we were, in fact, more precise: we assumed that the Constitution granted competent persons a "constitutionally
protected right to refuse lifesaving hydration and nutrition." Cruzan. The Washington statute at issue in this
case prohibits "aid[ing] another person to attempt suicide" and, thus, the question before us is whether the "lib-
erty" specially protected by the Due Process Clause includes a right to commit suicide which itself includes a
right to assistance in doing so.

We now inquire whether this asserted right has any place in our Nation's traditions. Here * * * we are confronted
with a consistent and almost universal tradition that has long rejected the asserted right, and continues explicitly
to reject it today, even for terminally ill, mentally competent adults. To hold for respondents, we would have
to reverse centuries of legal doctrine and practice, and strike down the considered policy choice of almost every
State.

Respondents contend, however, that the liberty interest they assert is consistent with this Court's substantive
due process line of cases, if not with this Nation's history and practice. Pointing to Casey and Cruzan, respon-
dents read our jurisprudence in this area as reflecting a general tradition of "self sovereignty," and as teaching that
the "liberty" protected by the Due Process Clause includes "basic and intimate exercises of personal autonomy,"
see Casey ("It is a promise of the Constitution that there is a realm of personal liberty which the government
may not enter"). According to respondents, our liberty jurisprudence, and the broad, individualistic principles
it reflects, protects the "liberty of competent, terminally ill adults to make end of life decisions free of undue
government interference." The question presented in this case, however, is whether the protections of the Due
Process Clause include a right to commit suicide with another's assistance. With this "careful description" of
respondents' claim in mind, we turn to Casey and Cruzan.
                                                                                                                         THE RIGHT TO DIE | 587

In Cruzan, we considered whether Nancy Beth Cruzan, who had been severely injured in an automobile
accident and was in a persistive vegetative state, "ha[d] a right under the United States Constitution which
would require the hospital to withdraw life sustaining treatment" at her parents' request. ... We concluded that,
notwithstanding this right, the Constitution permitted Missouri to require clear and convincing evidence of an
incompetent patient's wishes concerning the withdrawal of life sustaining treatment.

* * * The right assumed in Cruzan, however, was not simply deduced from abstract concepts of personal auton-
omy. Given the common law rule that forced medication was a battery, and the long legal tradition protecting
the decision to refuse unwanted medical treatment, our assumption was entirely consistent with this Nation's
history and constitutional traditions. The decision to commit suicide with the assistance of another may be just
as personal and profound as the decision to refuse unwanted medical treatment, but it has never enjoyed similar
legal protection. Indeed, the two acts are widely and reasonably regarded as quite distinct. In Cruzan itself, we
recognized that most States outlawed assisted suicide-and even more do today-and we certainly gave no intima-
tion that the right to refuse unwanted medical treatment could be somehow transmuted into a right to assistance
in committing suicide.

Respondents also rely on Casey. There, the Court's opinion concluded that "the essential holding of Roe v.
Wade should be retained and once again reaffirmed." We held, first, that a woman has a right, before her fetus is
viable, to an abortion "without undue interference from the State"; second, that States may restrict post-viability
abortions, so long as exceptions are made to protect a woman's life and health; and third, that the State has legit-
imate interests throughout a pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the unborn child.
In reaching this conclusion, the opinion discussed in some detail this Court's substantive due process tradition
of interpreting the Due Process Clause to protect certain fundamental rights and "personal decisions relating to
marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and education," and noted that many
of those rights and liberties "involv[e] the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime."

* * * That many of the rights and liberties protected by the Due Process Clause sound in personal autonomy
does not warrant the sweeping conclusion that any and all important, intimate, and personal decisions are so
protected, San Antonio Independent School Dist. v. Rodriguez (1973), and Casey did not suggest otherwise.

The history of the law's treatment of assisted suicide in this country has been and continues to be one of the
rejection of nearly all efforts to permit it. That being the case, our decisions lead us to conclude that the asserted
"right" to assistance in committing suicide is not a fundamental liberty interest protected by the Due Process
Clause. The Constitution also requires, however, that Washington's assisted suicide ban be rationally related to
legitimate government interests. This requirement is unquestionably met here. As the court below recognized,
Washington's assisted suicide ban implicates a number of state interests.

First, Washington has an "unqualified interest in the preservation of human life." The State's prohibition on
assisted suicide, like all homicide laws, both reflects and advances its commitment to this interest. This interest
is symbolic and aspirational as well as practical * * * As we have previously affirmed, the States "may properly
decline to make judgments about the `quality' of life that a particular individual may enjoy." This remains true,
as Cruzan makes clear, even for those who are near death.
588 | THE RIGHT TO DIE

Relatedly, all admit that suicide is a serious public health problem, especially among persons in otherwise vulner-
able groups. The State has an interest in preventing suicide, and in studying, identifying, and treating its causes.

Those who attempt suicide-terminally ill or not-often suffer from depression or other mental disorders. See
New York Task Force (more than 95% of those who commit suicide had a major psychiatric illness at the time
of death; among the terminally ill, uncontrolled pain is a "risk factor" because it contributes to depression). *
* * The New York Task Force, however, expressed its concern that, because depression is difficult to diagnose,
physicians and medical professionals often fail to respond adequately to seriously ill patients' needs. Thus, legal
physician assisted suicide could make it more difficult for the State to protect depressed or mentally ill persons,
or those who are suffering from untreated pain, from suicidal impulses.

The State also has an interest in protecting the integrity and ethics of the medical profession ... [T]he American
Medical Association, like many other medical and physicians' groups, has concluded that "[p]hysician assisted
suicide is fundamentally incompatible with the physician's role as healer." And physician assisted suicide could,
it is argued, undermine the trust that is essential to the doctor patient relationship by blurring the time honored
line between healing and harming.

Next, the State has an interest in protecting vulnerable groups-including the poor, the elderly, and disabled per-
sons-from abuse, neglect, and mistakes. The Court of Appeals dismissed the State's concern that disadvantaged
persons might be pressured into physician assisted suicide as "ludicrous on its face." We have recognized, how-
ever, the real risk of subtle coercion and undue influence in end of life situations. Cruzan. ... If physician assisted
suicide were permitted, many might resort to it to spare their families the substantial financial burden of end of
life health care costs.

The State's interest here goes beyond protecting the vulnerable from coercion; it extends to protecting disabled
and terminally ill people from prejudice, negative and inaccurate stereotypes, and "societal indifference." The
State's assisted suicide ban reflects and reinforces its policy that the lives of terminally ill, disabled, and elderly
people must be no less valued than the lives of the young and healthy, and that a seriously disabled person's sui-
cidal impulses should be interpreted and treated the same way as anyone else's.

Finally, the State may fear that permitting assisted suicide will start it down the path to voluntary and perhaps
even involuntary euthanasia. The Court of Appeals struck down Washington's assisted suicide ban only "as
applied to competent, terminally ill adults who wish to hasten their deaths by obtaining medication prescribed
by their doctors." Washington insists, however, that the impact of the court's decision will not and cannot be
so limited. If suicide is protected as a matter of constitutional right, it is argued, "every man and woman in the
United States must enjoy it." * * * Thus, it turns out that what is couched as a limited right to "physician assisted
suicide" is likely, in effect, a much broader license, which could prove extremely difficult to police and contain.
Washington's ban on assisting suicide prevents such erosion.

We need not weigh exactingly the relative strengths of these various interests. They are unquestionably impor-
tant and legitimate, and Washington's ban on assisted suicide is at least reasonably related to their promotion
                                                                                                                         THE RIGHT TO DIE | 589

and protection. We therefore hold that Wash. Rev. Code §9A.36.060(1) (1994) does not violate the Fourteenth
Amendment, either on its face or "as applied to competent, terminally ill adults who wish to hasten their deaths
by obtaining medication prescribed by their doctors."

* * *

Throughout the Nation, Americans are engaged in an earnest and profound debate about the morality, legality,
and practicality of physician assisted suicide. Our holding permits this debate to continue, as it should in a demo-
cratic society. The decision of the en banc Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice O'Connor, concurring. *

{JUSTICE GINSBURG concurs in the Court's judgments substantially for the reasons stated in this opinion.
JUSTICE BREYER joins this opinion except insofar as it joins the opinions of the Court.}

...

Death will be different for each of us. For many, the last days will be spent in physical pain and perhaps the
despair that accompanies physical deterioration and a loss of control of basic bodily and mental functions. Some
will seek medication to alleviate that pain and other symptoms.

The Court frames the issue in this case as whether the Due Process Clause of the Constitution protects a "right
to commit suicide which itself includes a right to assistance in doing so," and concludes that "our Nation's his-
tory, legal traditions, and practices do not support the existence of such a right." I join the Court's opinions
because I agree that there is no generalized right to "commit suicide." But respondents urge us to address the
narrower question whether a mentally competent person who is experiencing great suffering has a constitution-
ally cognizable interest in controlling the circumstances of his or her imminent death. I see no need to reach that
question in the context of the facial challenges to the New York and Washington laws at issue here ... The par-
ties and amici agree that in these States a patient who is suffering from a terminal illness and who is experienc-
ing great pain has no legal barriers to obtaining medication, from qualified physicians, to alleviate that suffering,
even to the point of causing unconsciousness and hastening death. In this light, even assuming that we would
recognize such an interest, I agree that the State's interests in protecting those who are not truly competent or
facing imminent death, or those whose decisions to hasten death would not truly be voluntary, are sufficiently
weighty to justify a prohibition against physician assisted suicide.

Every one of us at some point may be affected by our own or a family member's terminal illness. There is no
reason to think the democratic process will not strike the proper balance between the interests of terminally ill,
mentally competent individuals who would seek to end their suffering and the State's interests in protecting
those who might seek to end life mistakenly or under pressure. As the Court recognizes, States are presently
undertaking extensive and serious evaluation of physician assisted suicide and other related issues. In such cir-
590 | THE RIGHT TO DIE

cumstances, "the ... challenging task of crafting appropriate procedures for safeguarding ... liberty interests is
entrusted to the `laboratory' of the States ... in the first instance." Cruzan (O'Connor, J., concurring) (citing
New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann (1932)).

In sum, there is no need to address the question whether suffering patients have a constitutionally cognizable
interest in obtaining relief from the suffering that they may experience in the last days of their lives. There is
no dispute that dying patients in Washington and New York can obtain palliative care, even when doing so
would hasten their deaths. The difficulty in defining terminal illness and the risk that a dying patient's request
for assistance in ending his or her life might not be truly voluntary justifies the prohibitions on assisted suicide
we uphold here.

Justice Stevens, concurring in the judgment.

...

The Court ends its opinion with the important observation that our holding today is fully consistent with a
continuation of the vigorous debate about the "morality, legality, and practicality of physician assisted suicide"
in a democratic society. I write separately to make it clear that there is also room for further debate about the
limits that the Constitution places on the power of the States to punish the practice. * * *

Today, the Court decides that Washington's statute prohibiting assisted suicide is not invalid "on its face," that is
to say, in all or most cases in which it might be applied. That holding, however, does not foreclose the possibility
that some applications of the statute might well be invalid. * * *

This case does not require a judgment on whether laws against sodomy between consenting adults in general,
or between homosexuals in particular, are wise or desirable. It raises no question about the right or propriety
of state legislative decisions to repeal their laws that criminalize homosexual sodomy, or of state-court decisions
invalidating those laws on state constitutional grounds. The issue presented is whether the Federal Constitution
confers a fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage in sodomy and hence invalidates the laws of the many
States that still make such conduct illegal and have done so for a very long time. The case also calls for some judg-
ment about the limits of the Court's role in carrying out its constitutional mandate.

We first register our disagreement with the Court of Appeals and with respondent that the Court's prior cases
have construed the Constitution to confer a right of privacy that extends to homosexual sodomy and for all
intents and purposes have decided this case. The reach of this line of cases was sketched in Carey v. Population
Services International, (1977). Pierce v. Society of Sisters, (1925), and Meyer v. Nebraska, (1923), were described
as dealing with child rearing and education; Prince v. Massachusetts, (1944), with family relationships; Skinner v.
Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, (1942), with procreation; Loving v. Virginia, (1967), with marriage; Griswold v.
Connecticut, supra, and Eisenstadt v. Baird, supra, with contraception; and Roe v. Wade, (1973), with abortion.
The latter three cases were interpreted as construing the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to
confer a fundamental individual right to decide whether or not to beget or bear a child ...

The Court is most vulnerable and comes nearest to illegitimacy when it deals with judge-made constitutional
law having little or no cognizable roots in the language or design of the Constitution. That this is so was
painfully demonstrated by the face-off between the Executive and the Court in the 1930's, which resulted in the
repudiation of much of the substantive gloss that the Court had placed on the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth
and Fourteenth Amendments. There should be, therefore, great resistance to expand the substantive reach of
§592 | MARRIAGE AND FAMILY

those Clauses, particularly if it requires redefining the category of rights deemed to be fundamental. Otherwise,
the Judiciary necessarily takes to itself further authority to govern the country without express constitutional
authority. The claimed right pressed on us today falls far short of overcoming this resistance ...

Even if the conduct at issue here is not a fundamental right, respondent asserts that there must be a rational
basis for the law and that there is none in this case other than the presumed belief of a majority of the electorate
in Georgia that homosexual sodomy is immoral and unacceptable. This is said to be an inadequate rationale to
support the law. The law, however, is constantly based on notions of morality, and if all laws representing essen-
tially moral choices are to be invalidated under the Due Process Clause, the courts will be very busy indeed.
Even respondent makes no such claim, but insists that majority sentiments about the morality of homosexuality
should be declared inadequate. We do not agree, and are unpersuaded that the sodomy laws of some 25 States
should be invalidated on this basis..

Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Reversed.

JUSTICE KENNEDY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.

...

Liberty protects the person from unwarranted government intrusions into a dwelling or other private places. In
our tradition the State is not omnipresent in the home. And there are other spheres of our lives and existence,
outside the home, where the State should not be a dominant presence. Freedom extends beyond spatial bounds.
Liberty presumes an autonomy of self that includes freedom of thought, belief, expression, and certain intimate
conduct. The instant case involves liberty of the person both in its spatial and more transcendent dimensions.
                                                                                                                 MARRIAGE AND FAMILY | 593

The question before the Court is the validity of a Texas statute making it a crime for two persons of the same sex
to engage in certain intimate sexual conduct.

In Houston, Texas, officers of the Harris County Police Department were dispatched to a private residence in
response to a reported weapons disturbance. They entered an apartment where one of the petitioners, John
Geddes Lawrence, resided. The right of the police to enter does not seem to have been questioned. The officers
observed Lawrence and another man, Tyron Garner, engaging in a sexual act. The two petitioners were arrested,
held in custody over night, and charged and convicted before a Justice of the Peace.

The complaints described their crime as "deviate sexual intercourse, namely anal sex, with a member of the same
sex (man)." The applicable state law is Tex. Penal Code Ann. § 21.06(a) (2003). It provides: "A person com-
mits an offense if he engages in deviate sexual intercourse with another individual of the same sex." The statute
defines "[d]eviate sexual intercourse" as follows:

"(A) any contact between any part of the genitals of one person and the mouth or anus of another person; or

"(B) the penetration of the genitals or the anus of another person with an object." § 21.01(1).

The petitioners ... challenged the statute as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amend-
ment and of a like provision of the Texas Constitution. Tex. Const., Art.1, § 3a. Those contentions were rejected.

The petitioners, having entered a plea of nolo contendere, were each fined $200 and assessed court costs of
$141.25 ...

We granted certiorari to consider three questions:

"1. Whether Petitioners' criminal convictions under the Texas "Homosexual Conduct" law-which criminalizes
sexual intimacy by same-sex couples, but not identical behavior by different-sex couples-violate the Fourteenth
Amendment guarantee of equal protection of laws?

"2. Whether Petitioners' criminal convictions for adult consensual sexual intimacy in the home violate their vital
interests in liberty and privacy protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?

"3. Whether Bowers v. Hardwick (1986) should be overruled?"

The petitioners were adults at the time of the alleged offense. Their conduct was in private and consensual.

We conclude the case should be resolved by determining whether the petitioners were free as adults to engage in
the private conduct in the exercise of their liberty under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
to the Constitution. For this inquiry we deem it necessary to reconsider the Court's holding in Bowers.

There are broad statements of the substantive reach of liberty under the Due Process Clause in earlier cases,
including Pierce v. Society of Sisters (1925), and Meyer v. Nebraska (1923); but the most pertinent beginning
point is our decision in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965).
594 | MARRIAGE AND FAMILY

In Griswold the Court invalidated a state law prohibiting the use of drugs or devices of contraception and coun-
seling or aiding and abetting the use of contraceptives. The Court described the protected interest as a right to
privacy and placed emphasis on the marriage relation and the protected space of the marital bedroom.

After Griswold it was established that the right to make certain decisions regarding sexual conduct extends
beyond the marital relationship. In Eisenstadt v. Baird (1972), the Court invalidated a law prohibiting the dis-
tribution of contraceptives to unmarried persons. The case was decided under the Equal Protection Clause,
but with respect to unmarried persons, the Court went on to state the fundamental proposition that the law
impaired the exercise of their personal rights. It quoted from the statement of the Court of Appeals finding the
law to be in conflict with fundamental human rights, and it followed with this statement of its own:

"It is true that in Griswold the right of privacy in question inhered in the marital relationship. ... If the right
of privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted gov-
ernmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a
child ..."

At the outset it should be noted that there is no longstanding history in this country of laws directed at homo-
sexual conduct as a distinct matter. Beginning in colonial times there were prohibitions of sodomy derived from
the English criminal laws passed in the first instance by the Reformation Parliament of 1533. The English prohi-
bition was understood to include relations between men and women as well as relations between men and men.
Nineteenth-century commentators similarly read American sodomy, buggery, and crime-against-nature statutes
as criminalizing certain relations between men and women and between men and men ...

Thus early American sodomy laws were not directed at homosexuals as such but instead sought to prohibit non-
procreative sexual activity more generally. This does not suggest approval of homosexual conduct. It does tend to
show that this particular form of conduct was not thought of as a separate category from like conduct between
heterosexual persons.

Laws prohibiting sodomy do not seem to have been enforced against consenting adults acting in private. A sub-
stantial number of sodomy prosecutions and convictions for which there are surviving records were for preda-
tory acts against those who could not or did not consent, as in the case of a minor or the victim of an assault. As
to these, one purpose for the prohibitions was to ensure there would be no lack of coverage if a predator commit-
ted a sexual assault that did not constitute rape as defined by the criminal law. Thus the model sodomy indict-
ments presented in a 19th-century treatise, addressed the predatory acts of an adult man against a minor girl or
minor boy. Instead of targeting relations between consenting adults in private, 19th-century sodomy prosecu-
tions typically involved relations between men and minor girls or minor boys, relations between adults involving
force, relations between adults implicating disparity in status, or relations between men and animals.

To the extent that there were any prosecutions for the acts in question, 19th-century evidence rules imposed a
burden that would make a conviction more difficult to obtain even taking into account the problems always
inherent in prosecuting consensual acts committed in private. Under then-prevailing standards, a man could not
be convicted of sodomy based upon testimony of a consenting partner, because the partner was considered an
accomplice. A partner's testimony, however, was admissible if he or she had not consented to the act or was a
                                                                                                                 MARRIAGE AND FAMILY | 595

minor, and therefore incapable of consent. The rule may explain in part the infrequency of these prosecutions.
In all events that infrequency makes it difficult to say that society approved of a rigorous and systematic pun-
ishment of the consensual acts committed in private and by adults. The longstanding criminal prohibition of
homosexual sodomy upon which the Bowers decision placed such reliance is as consistent with a general con-
demnation of nonprocreative sex as it is with an established tradition of prosecuting acts because of their homo-
sexual character.

...

Despite the absence of prosecutions, there may have been periods in which there was public criticism of homo-
sexuals as such and an insistence that the criminal laws be enforced to discourage their practices. But far from
possessing "ancient roots," American laws targeting same-sex couples did not develop until the last third of the
20th century. The reported decisions concerning the prosecution of consensual, homosexual sodomy between
adults for the years 1880-1995 are not always clear in the details, but a significant number involved conduct in a
public place ...

In summary, the historical grounds relied upon in Bowers are more complex than the majority opinion and the
concurring opinion by Chief Justice Burger indicate. Their historical premises are not without doubt and, at the
very least, are overstated.

In Bowers the Court referred to the fact that before 1961 all 50 States had outlawed sodomy, and that at the
time of the Court's decision 24 States and the District of Columbia had sodomy laws. Justice Powell pointed
out that these prohibitions often were being ignored, however. Georgia, for instance, had not sought to enforce
its law for decades ... In our own constitutional system the deficiencies in Bowers became even more apparent in
the years following its announcement. The 25 States with laws prohibiting the relevant conduct referenced in
the Bowers decision are reduced now to 13, of which 4 enforce their laws only against homosexual conduct. In
those States where sodomy is still proscribed, whether for same-sex or heterosexual conduct, there is a pattern of
nonenforcement with respect to consenting adults acting in private. The State of Texas admitted in 1994 that as
of that date it had not prosecuted anyone under those circumstances.

...

Equality of treatment and the due process right to demand respect for conduct protected by the substantive
guarantee of liberty are linked in important respects, and a decision on the latter point advances both interests.
If protected conduct is made criminal and the law which does so remains unexamined for its substantive validity,
its stigma might remain even if it were not enforceable as drawn for equal protection reasons. When homosex-
ual conduct is made criminal by the law of the State, that declaration in and of itself is an invitation to subject
homosexual persons to discrimination both in the public and in the private spheres. The central holding of Bow­
ers has been brought in question by this case, and it should be addressed. Its continuance as precedent demeans
the lives of homosexual persons.
596 | MARRIAGE AND FAMILY

The stigma this criminal statute imposes, moreover, is not trivial. The offense, to be sure, is but a class C misde-
meanor, a minor offense in the Texas legal system. Still, it remains a criminal offense with all that imports for the
dignity of the persons charged.

The foundations of Bowers have sustained serious erosion from our recent decisions in Casey and Romer. When
our precedent has been thus weakened, criticism from other sources is of greater significance. In the United
States criticism of Bowers has been substantial and continuing, disapproving of its reasoning in all respects, not
just as to its historical assumptions ... The courts of five different States have declined to follow it in interpreting
provisions in their own state constitutions parallel to the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

...

The doctrine of stare decisis is essential to the respect accorded to the judgments of the Court and to the stability
of the law. It is not, however, an inexorable command. In Casey we noted that when a Court is asked to overrule a
precedent recognizing a constitutional liberty interest, individual or societal reliance on the existence of that lib-
erty cautions with particular strength against reversing course. The holding in Bowers, however, has not induced
detrimental reliance comparable to some instances where recognized individual rights are involved. Indeed, there
has been no individual or societal reliance on Bowers of the sort that could counsel against overturning its hold-
ing once there are compelling reasons to do so. Bowers itself causes uncertainty, for the precedents before and
after its issuance contradict its central holding.

The rationale of Bowers does not withstand careful analysis. * * * Bowers was not correct when it was decided,
and it is not correct today. It ought not to remain binding precedent. Bowers v. Hardwick should be and now is
overruled.

The present case does not involve minors. It does not involve persons who might be injured or coerced or who
are situated in relationships where consent might not easily be refused. It does not involve public conduct or
prostitution. It does not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that
homosexual persons seek to enter. The case does involve two adults who, with full and mutual consent from
each other, engaged in sexual practices common to a homosexual lifestyle. The petitioners are entitled to respect
for their private lives. The State cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private
sexual conduct a crime. Their right to liberty under the Due Process Clause gives them the full right to engage in
their conduct without intervention of the government. "It is a promise of the Constitution that there is a realm
of personal liberty which the government may not enter." Casey. The Texas statute furthers no legitimate state
interest which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual.

Had those who drew and ratified the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amend-
ment known the components of liberty in its manifold possibilities, they might have been more specific. They
did not presume to have this insight. They knew times can blind us to certain truths and later generations can see
that laws once thought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress. As the Constitution endures, persons
in every generation can invoke its principles in their own search for greater freedom.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Texas Fourteenth District is reversed, and the case is remanded
for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice O'Connor, concurring in the judgment.

The Court today overrules Bowers v. Hardwick (1986). I joined Bowers, and do not join the Court in overruling
it. Nevertheless, I agree with the Court that Texas' statute banning same-sex sodomy is unconstitutional. Rather
than relying on the substantive component of the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause, as the Court
does, I base my conclusion on the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.

The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment "is essentially a direction that all persons similarly
situated should be treated alike." Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc. (1985) * * * When a law exhibits such
a desire to harm a politically unpopular group, we have applied a more searching form of rational basis review to
strike down such laws under the Equal Protection Clause.

* * * Sodomy between opposite-sex partners, however, is not a crime in Texas. That is, Texas treats the same con-
duct differently based solely on the participants. Those harmed by this law are people who have a same-sex sexual
orientation and thus are more likely to engage in behavior prohibited by § 21.06.

The Texas statute makes homosexuals unequal in the eyes of the law by making particular conduct-and only
that conduct-subject to criminal sanction. It appears that prosecutions under Texas' sodomy law are rare. This
case shows, however, that prosecutions under § 21.06 do occur. And while the penalty imposed on petitioners
in this case was relatively minor, the consequences of conviction are not. * * *

And the effect of Texas' sodomy law is not just limited to the threat of prosecution or consequence of conviction.
Texas' sodomy law brands all homosexuals as criminals, thereby making it more difficult for homosexuals to
be treated in the same manner as everyone else. Indeed, Texas itself has previously acknowledged the collateral
effects of the law, stipulating in a prior challenge to this action that the law "legally sanctions discrimination
against [homosexuals] in a variety of ways unrelated to the criminal law," including in the areas of "employment,
family issues, and housing."

* * * A law branding one class of persons as criminal solely based on the State's moral disapproval of that class and
the conduct associated with that class runs contrary to the values of the Constitution and the Equal Protection
Clause, under any standard of review. I therefore concur in the Court's judgment that Texas' sodomy law ban-
ning "deviate sexual intercourse" between consenting adults of the same sex, but not between consenting adults
of different sexes, is unconstitutional ...

Justice Scalia, with whom the Chief Justice and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

"Liberty finds no refuge in a jurisprudence of doubt." Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey (1992).
That was the Court's sententious response, barely more than a decade ago, to those seeking to overrule Roe v.
Wade (1973). The Court's response today, to those who have engaged in a 17-year crusade to overrule Bowers v.
Hardwick (1986) is very different. The need for stability and certainty presents no barrier.

Most of the rest of today's opinion has no relevance to its actual holding-that the Texas statute "furthers no
legitimate state interest which can justify" its application to petitioners under rational-basis review. Though
there is discussion of "fundamental proposition[s]," and "fundamental decisions," nowhere does the Court's
opinion declare that homosexual sodomy is a "fundamental right" under the Due Process Clause; nor does
it subject the Texas law to the standard of review that would be appropriate (strict scrutiny) if homosexual
sodomy were a "fundamental right." Thus, while overruling the outcome of Bowers, the Court leaves strangely
untouched its central legal conclusion: "[R]espondent would have us announce ... a fundamental right to engage
in homosexual sodomy. This we are quite unwilling to do." Instead the Court simply describes petitioners' con-
duct as "an exercise of their liberty"-which it undoubtedly is-and proceeds to apply an unheard-of form of
rational-basis review that will have far-reaching implications beyond this case ...

I begin with the Court's surprising readiness to reconsider a decision rendered a mere 17 years ago in Bowers
v. Hardwick. I do not myself believe in rigid adherence to stare decisis in constitutional cases; but I do believe
that we should be consistent rather than manipulative in invoking the doctrine. Today's opinions in support of
reversal do not bother to distinguish-or indeed, even bother to mention-the paean to stare decisis coauthored
by three Members of today's majority in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. There, when stare decisis meant preser-
vation of judicially invented abortion rights, the widespread criticism of Roe was strong reason to reaffirm it:

Today's approach to stare decisis invites us to overrule an erroneously decided precedent (including an "intensely
divisive" decision) if: (1) its foundations have been "eroded" by subsequent decisions; (2) it has been subject to
"substantial and continuing" criticism.; and (3) it has not induced "individual or societal reliance" that counsels
against overturning. The problem is that Roe itself-which today's majority surely has no disposition to over-
rule-satisfies these conditions to at least the same degree as Bowers. * * *

I do not quarrel with the Court's claim that Romer v. Evans (1996) "eroded" the "foundations" of Bowers' ratio-
nal-basis holding. But Roe and Casey have been equally "eroded" by Washington v. Glucksberg (1997) which
held that only fundamental rights which are "`deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition'" qualify for
anything other than rational basis scrutiny under the doctrine of "substantive due process." Roe and Casey, of
course, subjected the restriction of abortion to heightened scrutiny without even attempting to establish that
the freedom to abort was rooted in this Nation's tradition. * * *

To tell the truth, it does not surprise me, and should surprise no one, that the Court has chosen today to revise
the standards of stare decisis set forth in Casey. It has thereby exposed Casey's extraordinary deference to prece-
dent for the result-oriented expedient that it is ...

Having decided that it need not adhere to stare decisis, the Court still must establish that Bowers was wrongly
decided and that the Texas statute, as applied to petitioners, is unconstitutional.
                                                                                                                 MARRIAGE AND FAMILY | 599

Texas Penal Code Ann. § 21.06(a) (2003) undoubtedly imposes constraints on liberty. So do laws prohibiting
prostitution, recreational use of heroin, and, for that matter, working more than 60 hours per week in a bakery.
But there is no right to "liberty" under the Due Process Clause, though today's opinion repeatedly makes that
claim. The Fourteenth Amendment expressly allows States to deprive their citizens of "liberty," so long as "due
process of law" is provided ...

Our opinions applying the doctrine known as "substantive due process" hold that the Due Process Clause pro-
hibits States from infringing fundamental liberty interests, unless the infringement is narrowly tailored to serve
a compelling state interest. Washington v. Glucksberg. We have held repeatedly, in cases the Court today does not
overrule, that only fundamental rights qualify for this so-called "heightened scrutiny" protection-that is, rights
which are "`deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition.'" All other liberty interests may be abridged or
abrogated pursuant to a validly enacted state law if that law is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.

Bowers held, first, that criminal prohibitions of homosexual sodomy are not subject to heightened scrutiny
because they do not implicate a "fundamental right" under the Due Process Clause. Noting that "[p]roscrip-
tions against that conduct have ancient roots," that "[s]odomy was a criminal offense at common law and was
forbidden by the laws of the original 13 States when they ratified the Bill of Rights," and that many States had
retained their bans on sodomy, Bowers concluded that a right to engage in homosexual sodomy was not "`deeply
rooted in this Nation's history and tradition.'"

The Court today does not overrule this holding. Not once does it describe homosexual sodomy as a "funda-
mental right" or a "fundamental liberty interest," nor does it subject the Texas statute to strict scrutiny. Instead,
having failed to establish that the right to homosexual sodomy is "`deeply rooted in this Nation's history and
tradition,'" the Court concludes that the application of Texas's statute to petitioners' conduct fails the rational-
basis test, and overrules Bowers' holding to the contrary. "The Texas statute furthers no legitimate state interest
which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual ..."

* * *

It is (as Bowers recognized) entirely irrelevant whether the laws in our long national tradition criminalizing
homosexual sodomy were "directed at homosexual conduct as a distinct matter." Whether homosexual sodomy
was prohibited by a law targeted at same-sex sexual relations or by a more general law prohibiting both homosex-
ual and heterosexual sodomy, the only relevant point is that it was criminalized-which suffices to establish that
homosexual sodomy is not a right "deeply rooted in our Nation's history and tradition." The Court today agrees
that homosexual sodomy was criminalized and thus does not dispute the facts on which Bowers actually relied.

* * * Bowers' conclusion that homosexual sodomy is not a fundamental right "deeply rooted in this Nation's his-
tory and tradition" is utterly unassailable.

...
600 | MARRIAGE AND FAMILY

In any event, an "emerging awareness" is by definition not "deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradi-
tion[s]," as we have said "fundamental right" status requires. Constitutional entitlements do not spring into
existence because some States choose to lessen or eliminate criminal sanctions on certain behavior. Much less do
they spring into existence, as the Court seems to believe, because foreign nations decriminalize conduct. * * *

Today's opinion is the product of a Court, which is the product of a law-profession culture, that has largely
signed on to the so-called homosexual agenda, by which I mean the agenda promoted by some homosexual
activists directed at eliminating the moral opprobrium that has traditionally attached to homosexual conduct. I
noted in an earlier opinion the fact that the American Association of Law Schools (to which any reputable law
school must seek to belong) excludes from membership any school that refuses to ban from its job-interview
facilities a law firm (no matter how small) that does not wish to hire as a prospective partner a person who openly
engages in homosexual conduct. See Romer.

Let me be clear that I have nothing against homosexuals, or any other group, promoting their agenda through
normal democratic means. Social perceptions of sexual and other morality change over time, and every group has
the right to persuade its fellow citizens that its view of such matters is the best. That homosexuals have achieved
some success in that enterprise is attested to by the fact that Texas is one of the few remaining States that crimi-
nalize private, consensual homosexual acts. But persuading one's fellow citizens is one thing, and imposing one's
views in absence of democratic majority will is something else. I would no more require a State to criminalize
homosexual acts-or, for that matter, display any moral disapprobation of them-than I would forbid it to do so.
What Texas has chosen to do is well within the range of traditional democratic action, and its hand should not
be stayed through the invention of a brand-new "constitutional right" by a Court that is impatient of democra-
tic change. It is indeed true that "later generations can see that laws once thought necessary and proper in fact
serve only to oppress," and when that happens, later generations can repeal those laws. But it is the premise of
our system that those judgments are to be made by the people, and not imposed by a governing caste that knows
best.

...

The matters appropriate for this Court's resolution are only three: Texas's prohibition of sodomy neither
infringes a "fundamental right" (which the Court does not dispute), nor is unsupported by a rational relation to
what the Constitution considers a legitimate state interest, nor denies the equal protection of the laws. I dissent.

JUSTICE KENNEDY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.

...

Two women then resident in New York were married in a lawful ceremony in Ontario, Canada, in 2007. Edith
Windsor and Thea Spyer returned to their home in New York City. When Spyer died in 2009, she left her entire
estate to Windsor. Windsor sought to claim the estate tax exemption for surviving spouses. She was barred from
doing so, however, by a federal law, the Defense of Marriage Act, which excludes a same-sex partner from the def-
inition of "spouse" as that term is used in federal statutes. Windsor paid the taxes but filed suit to challenge the
constitutionality of this provision. The United States District Court and the Court of Appeals ruled that this
portion of the statute is unconstitutional and ordered the United States to pay Windsor a refund. This Court
granted certiorari and now affirms the judgment in Windsor's favor.

IIn 1996, as some States were beginning to consider the concept of same-sex marriage, and before any State had
acted to permit it, Congress enacted the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA).

DOMA contains two operative sections: Section 2, which has not been challenged here, allows States to refuse
to recognize same-sex marriages performed under the laws of other States. Section 3 is at issue here. It amends
the Dictionary Act in Title 1, §7, of the United States Code to provide a federal definition of "marriage" and
"spouse." Section 3 of DOMA provides as follows: "In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, or of
any ruling, regulation, or interpretation of the various administrative bureaus and agencies of the United States,
the word `marriage' means only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife, and the
word `spouse' refers only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife." 1 U. S. C. §7. The defi-
nitional provision does not by its terms forbid States from enacting laws permitting same-sex marriages or civil
unions or providing state benefits to residents in that status. The enactment's comprehensive definition of mar-
riage for purposes of all federal statutes and other 635 regulations or directives covered by its terms, however,
does control over 1,000 federal laws in which marital or spousal status is addressed as a matter of federal law.
Edith Windsor and Thea Spyer met in New York City in 1963 and began a long-term relationship. Windsor and
Spyer registered as domestic partners when New York City gave that right to same-sex couples in 1993. Con-
cerned about Spyer's health, the couple made the 2007 trip to Canada for their marriage, but they continued
to reside in New York City. The State of New York deems their Ontario marriage to be a valid one. Spyer died
in February 2009, and left her entire estate to Windsor. Because DOMA denies federal recognition to same-sex
602 | MARRIAGE AND FAMILY

spouses, Windsor did not qualify for the marital exemption from the federal estate tax, which excludes from tax-
ation "any interest in property which passes or has passed from the decedent to his surviving spouse." Windsor
paid $363,053 in estate taxes and sought a refund. The Internal Revenue Service denied the refund, concluding
that, under DOMA, Windsor was not a "surviving spouse." Windsor commenced this refund suit in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York. She contended that DOMA violates the guarantee
of equal protection, as applied to the Federal Government through the Fifth Amendment. While the tax refund
suit was pending, the Attorney General of the United States notified the Speaker of the House of Representa-
tives, pursuant to 28 U. S. C. §530D, that the Department of Justice would no longer defend the constitution-
ality of DOMA's §3. * * *

On the merits of the tax refund suit, the District Court ruled against the United States. It held that §3 of DOMA
is unconstitutional and ordered the Treasury to refund the tax with interest ... Before this Court acted on the
petition, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the District Court's judgment. It applied height-
ened scrutiny to classifications based on sexual orientation, as both the Department and Windsor had urged. * *
*

When at first Windsor and Spyer longed to marry, neither New York nor any other State granted them that
right. After waiting some years, in 2007 they traveled to Ontario to be married there. It seems fair to conclude
that, until recent years, many citizens had not even considered the possibility that two persons of the same sex
might aspire to occupy the same status and dignity as that of a man and woman in lawful marriage. For marriage
between a man and a woman no doubt had been thought of by most people as essential to the very definition
of that term and to its role and function throughout the history of civilization. That belief, for many who long
have held it, became even more urgent, more cherished when challenged. For others, however, came the begin-
nings of a new perspective, a new insight. Accordingly some States concluded that same-sex marriage ought to
be given recognition and validity in the law for those same-sex couples who wish to define themselves by their
commitment to each other. The limitation of lawful marriage to heterosexual couples, which for centuries had
been deemed both necessary and fundamental, came to be seen in New York and certain other States as an unjust
exclusion. Slowly at first and then in rapid course, the laws of New York came to acknowledge the urgency of
this issue for same-sex couples who wanted to affirm their commitment to one another before their children,
their family, their friends, and their community. And so New York recognized same-sex marriages performed
elsewhere; and then it later amended its own marriage laws to permit same- sex marriage. New York, in common
with, as of this writing, 11 other States and the District of Columbia, decided that same-sex couples should have
the right to marry and so live with pride in themselves and their union and in a status of equality with all other
married persons. After a statewide deliberative process that enabled its citizens to discuss and weigh arguments
for and against same- sex marriage, New York acted to enlarge the definition of marriage to correct what its citi-
zens and elected representatives perceived to be an injustice that they had not earlier known or understood. See
Marriage Equality Act, 2011 N. Y. Laws 749 (codified at N. Y. Dom. Rel. Law Ann. §§10-a, 10-b, 13 (West
2013)). Against this background of lawful same-sex marriage in some States, the design, purpose, and effect of
DOMA should be considered as the beginning point in deciding whether it is valid under the Constitution.
                                                                                                                 MARRIAGE AND FAMILY | 603

By history and tradition the definition and regulation of marriage, as will be discussed in more detail, has been
treated as being within the authority and realm of the separate States. Yet it is further established that Congress,
in enacting discrete statutes, can make determinations that bear on marital rights and privileges. * * *

Though these discrete examples establish the constitutionality of limited federal laws that regulate the meaning
of marriage in order to further federal policy, DOMA has a far greater reach; for it enacts a directive applicable
to over 1,000 federal statutes and the whole realm of federal regulations. And its operation is 637 directed to a
class of persons that the laws of New York, and of 11 other States, have sought to protect. In order to assess the
validity of that intervention it is necessary to discuss the extent of the state power and authority over marriage as
a matter of history and tradition. State laws defining and regulating marriage, of course, must respect the con-
stitutional rights of persons, see, e.g., Loving v. Virginia (1967); but, subject to those guarantees, "regulation of
domestic relations" is "an area that has long been regarded as a virtually exclusive province of the States." The
recognition of civil marriages is central to state domestic relations law applicable to its residents and citizens. * * *

Consistent with this allocation of authority, the Federal Government, through our history, has deferred to state-
law policy decisions with respect to domestic relations. * * * In order to respect this principle, the federal courts,
as a general rule, do not adjudicate issues of marital status even when there might otherwise be a basis for federal
jurisdiction. * * *

[I]t is unnecessary to decide whether this federal intrusion on state power is a violation of the Constitution
because it disrupts the federal balance. The State's power in defining the marital relation is of central relevance
in this case quite apart from principles of federalism. Here the State's decision to give this class of persons the
right to marry conferred upon them a dignity and status of immense import. When the State used its historic
and essential authority to define the marital relation in this way, its role and its power in making the decision
enhanced the recognition, dignity, and protection of the class in their own community. DOMA, because of its
reach and extent, departs from this history and tradition of reliance on state law to define marriage."`[D]iscrim-
inations of an unusual character especially suggest careful consideration to determine whether they are obnox-
ious to the constitutional provision.'" Romer v. Evans (1996). The Federal Government uses this state-defined
class for the opposite purpose--to impose restrictions and disabilities. That result requires this Court now to
address whether the resulting injury and indignity is a deprivation of an essential part of the liberty protected by
the Fifth Amendment. What the State of New York treats as alike the federal law deems unlike by a law designed
to injure the same class the State seeks to protect. * * *

The States' interest in defining and regulating the marital relation, subject to constitutional guarantees, stems
from the understanding that marriage is more than a routine classification for purposes of certain statutory ben-
efits. Private, consensual sexual intimacy between two adult persons of the same sex may not be punished by the
State, and it can form "but one element in a personal bond that is more enduring." Lawrence v. Texas (2003).
By its recognition of the validity of same-sex marriages performed in other jurisdictions and then by authorizing
same-sex unions and same-sex marriages, New York sought to give further protection and dignity to that bond.
For same-sex couples who wished to be married, the State acted to give their lawful conduct a lawful status.
This status is a far-reaching legal acknowledgment of the intimate relationship between two people, a relation-
604 | MARRIAGE AND FAMILY

ship deemed by the State worthy of dignity in the community equal with all other marriages. It reflects both the
community's considered perspective on the historical roots of the institution of marriage and its evolving under-
standing of the meaning of equality.

DOMA seeks to injure the very class New York seeks to protect. By doing so it violates basic due process and
equal protection principles applicable to the Federal Government. See U. S. Const., Amdt. 5; Bolling v. Sharpe
(1954). The Constitution's guarantee of equality "must at the very least mean that a bare congressional desire to
harm a politically unpopular group cannot" justify disparate treatment of that group. Department of Agriculture
v. Moreno (1973). In determining whether a law is motived by an improper animus or purpose, "`[d]iscrimina-
tions of an unusual character'" especially require careful consideration. DOMA cannot survive under these prin-
ciples. The responsibility of the States for the regulation of domestic relations is an important indicator of the
substantial societal impact the State's classifications have in the daily lives and customs of its people. DOMA's
unusual deviation from the usual tradition of recognizing and accepting state definitions of marriage here oper-
ates to deprive same-sex couples of the benefits and responsibilities that come with the federal recognition of
their marriages. This is strong evidence of a law having the purpose and effect of disapproval of that class. The
avowed purpose and practical effect of the law here in question are to impose a disadvantage, a separate status,
and so a stigma upon all who enter into same-sex marriages made lawful by the unquestioned authority of the
States. The history of DOMA's enactment and its own text demonstrate that interference with the equal dignity
of same-sex marriages, a dignity conferred by the States in the exercise of their sovereign power, was more than
an incidental effect of the federal statute. It was its essence. The House Report announced its conclusion that
"it is both appropriate and necessary for Congress to do what it can to defend the institution of traditional het-
erosexual marriage. ... H. R. 3396 is appropriately entitled the `Defense of Marriage Act.' "The effort to redefine
`marriage' to extend to homosexual couples is a truly radical proposal that would fundamentally alter the insti-
tution of marriage." H. R. Rep. No. 104-664, pp. 12-13 (1996).

The House concluded that DOMA expresses "both moral disapproval of homosexuality, and a moral conviction
that heterosexuality better comports with traditional (especially Judeo-Christian) morality." The stated purpose
of the law was to promote an "interest in protecting the traditional moral teachings reflected in heterosexual-
only marriage laws." Were there any doubt of this far-reaching purpose, the title of the Act confirms it: The
Defense of Marriage ... This raises a most serious question under the Constitution's Fifth Amendment.
DOMA's operation in practice confirms this purpose. When New York adopted a law to permit same-sex mar-
riage, it sought to eliminate inequality; but DOMA frustrates that objective through a system-wide enactment
with no identified connection to any particular area of federal law. DOMA writes inequality into the entire
United States Code. The particular case at hand concerns the estate tax, but DOMA is more than a simple deter-
mination of what should or should not be allowed as an estate tax refund. Among the over 1,000 statutes and
numerous federal regulations that DOMA controls are laws pertaining to Social Security, housing, taxes, crim-
inal sanctions, copyright, and veterans' benefits. DOMA's principal effect is to identify a subset of state- sanc-
tioned marriages and make them unequal. The principal purpose is to impose inequality, not for other reasons
like governmental efficiency.

Responsibilities, as well as rights, enhance the dignity and integrity of the person. And DOMA contrives to
deprive some couples married under the laws of their State, but not other couples, of both rights and responsi-
                                                                                                                 MARRIAGE AND FAMILY | 605

bilities. By creating two contradictory marriage regimes within the same State, DOMA forces same-sex couples
to live as married for the purpose of state law but unmarried for the purpose of federal law, thus diminishing the
stability and predictability of basic personal relations the State has found it proper to acknowledge and protect.
By this dynamic DOMA undermines both the public and private significance of state sanctioned same-sex mar-
riages; for it tells those couples, and all the world, that their otherwise valid marriages are unworthy of federal
recognition. This places same-sex couples in an unstable position of being in a second-tier marriage. The dif-
ferentiation demeans the couple, whose moral and sexual choices the Constitution protects, see Lawrence, and
whose relationship the State has sought to dignify. And it humiliates tens of thousands of children now being
raised by same-sex couples. The law in question makes it even more difficult for the children to understand the
integrity and closeness of their own family and its concord with other families in their community and in their
daily lives. Under DOMA, same-sex married couples have their lives burdened, by reason of government decree,
in visible and public ways.

By its great reach, DOMA touches many aspects of married and family life, from the mundane to the profound.
It prevents same-sex married couples from obtaining government healthcare benefits they would otherwise
receive. It deprives them of the Bankruptcy Code's special protections for domestic-support obligations. It
forces them to follow a complicated procedure to file their state and federal taxes jointly. It prohibits them
from being buried together in veterans' cemeteries. For certain married couples, DOMA's unequal effects are
even more serious. The federal penal code makes it a crime to "assaul[t], kidna[p], or murde[r] ... a member of
the immediate family" of "a United States official, a United States judge, [or] a Federal law enforcement offi-
cer," with the intent to influence or retaliate against that official. Although a "spouse" qualifies as a member of
the officer's "immediate family," DOMA makes this protection inapplicable to same-sex spouses. DOMA also
brings financial harm to children of same-sex couples. It raises the cost of health care for families by taxing health
benefits provided by employers to their workers' same-sex spouses. And it denies or reduces benefits allowed to
families upon the loss of a spouse and parent, benefits that are an integral part of family security. DOMA divests
married same-sex couples of the duties and responsibilities that are an essential part of married life and that they
in most cases would be honored to accept were DOMA not in force. For instance, because it is expected that
spouses will support each other as they pursue educational opportunities, federal law takes into consideration a
spouse's income in calculating a student's federal financial aid eligibility. Same-sex married couples are exempt
from this requirement. The same is true with respect to federal ethics rules. Federal executive and agency officials
are prohibited from "participat[ing] personally and substantially" in matters as to which they or their spouses
have a financial interest. A similar statute prohibits Senators, Senate employees, and their spouses from accept-
ing high-value gifts from certain sources, and another mandates detailed financial disclosures by numerous high-
ranking officials and their spouses. Under DOMA, however, these Government-integrity rules do not apply to
same-sex spouses. * * *

The power the Constitution grants it also restrains. And though Congress has great authority to design laws to
fit its own conception of sound national policy, it cannot deny the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause
of the Fifth Amendment. What has been explained to this point should more than suffice to establish that the
principal purpose and the necessary effect of this law are to demean those persons who are in a lawful same-sex
marriage. This requires the Court to hold, as it now does, that DOMA is unconstitutional as a deprivation of
§606 | MARRIAGE AND FAMILY

the liberty of the person protected by the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution ... The class to which DOMA
directs its restrictions and restraints are those persons who are joined in same-sex marriages made lawful by the
State. DOMA singles out a class of persons deemed by a State entitled to recognition and protection to enhance
their own liberty. It imposes a disability on the class by refusing to acknowledge a status the State finds to be
dignified and proper. DOMA instructs all federal officials, and indeed all persons with whom same-sex couples
interact, including their own children, that their marriage is less worthy than the marriages of others. The federal
statute is invalid, for no legitimate purpose overcomes the purpose and effect to disparage and to injure those
whom the State, by its marriage laws, sought to protect in personhood and dignity. By seeking to displace this
protection and treating those persons as living in marriages less respected than others, the federal statute is in
violation of the Fifth Amendment. This opinion and its holding are confined to those lawful marriages.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is affirmed.

JUSTICE KENNEDY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.

...

The Constitution promises liberty to all within its reach, a liberty that includes certain specific rights that allow
persons, within a lawful realm, to define and express their identity. The petitioners in these cases seek to find that
liberty by marrying someone of the same sex and having their marriages deemed lawful on the same terms and
conditions as marriages between persons of the opposite sex.

These cases come from Michigan, Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee, States that define marriage as a union
between one man and one woman. See, e.g., Mich. Const., Art. I, §25; Ky. Const. §233A; Ohio Rev. Code Ann.
§3101.01 (Lexis 2008); Tenn. Const., Art. XI, §18. The petitioners are 14 same-sex couples and two men whose
                                                                                                                 MARRIAGE AND FAMILY | 607

same-sex partners are deceased. The respondents are state officials responsible for enforcing the laws in question.
The petitioners claim the respondents violate the Fourteenth Amendment by denying them the right to marry
or to have their marriages, lawfully performed in another State, given full recognition. Petitioners filed these suits
in United States District Courts in their home States. Each District Court ruled in their favor. The respondents
appealed the decisions against them to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. It consolidated
the cases and reversed the judgments of the District Courts. The Court of Appeals held that a State has no con-
stitutional obligation to license same-sex marriages or to recognize same-sex marriages performed out of State.
The petitioners sought certiorari. This Court granted review, limited to two questions.

The first ... is whether the Fourteenth Amendment requires a State to license a marriage between two people of
the same sex. The second ... is whether the Fourteenth Amendment requires a State to recognize a same- sex mar-
riage licensed and performed in a State which does grant that right.

Before addressing the principles and precedents that govern these cases, it is appropriate to note the history of
the subject now before the Court.

From their beginning to their most recent page, the annals of human history reveal the transcendent importance
of marriage. The lifelong union of a man and a woman always has promised nobility and dignity to all persons,
without regard to their station in life. Marriage is sacred to those who live by their religions and offers unique ful-
fillment to those who find meaning in the secular realm. Its dynamic allows two people to find a life that could
not be found alone, for a marriage becomes greater than just the two persons. Rising from the most basic human
needs, marriage is essential to our most profound hopes and aspirations. The centrality of marriage to the human
condition makes it unsurprising that the institution has existed for millennia and across civilizations. Since the
dawn of history, marriage has transformed strangers into relatives, binding families and societies together. Con-
fucius taught that marriage lies at the foundation of government. This wisdom was echoed centuries later and
half a world away by Cicero, who wrote, "The first bond of society is marriage; next, children; and then the fam-
ily." There are untold references to the beauty of marriage in religious and philosophical texts spanning time,
cultures, and faiths, as well as in art and literature in all their forms.

Two years ago, Obergefell and Arthur decided to commit to one another, resolving to marry before Arthur died.
To fulfill their mutual promise, they traveled from Ohio to Maryland, where same-sex marriage was legal. It
was difficult for Arthur to move, and so the couple were wed inside a medical transport plane as it remained on
the tarmac in Baltimore. Three months later, Arthur died. Ohio law does not permit Obergefell to be listed as
the surviving spouse on Arthur's death certificate. By statute, they must remain strangers even in death, a state-
imposed separation Obergefell deems "hurtful for the rest of time." He brought suit to be shown as the surviv-
ing spouse on Arthur's death certificate. ...

The ancient origins of marriage confirm its centrality, but it has not stood in isolation from developments in law
and society. The history of marriage is one of both continuity and change. That institution--even as confined to
opposite-sex relations--has evolved over time. For example, marriage was once viewed as an arrangement by the
couple's parents based on political, religious, and financial concerns; but by the time of the Nation's founding it
was understood to be a voluntary contract between a man and a woman ...
608 | MARRIAGE AND FAMILY

These new insights have strengthened, not weakened, the institution of marriage. Indeed, changed understand-
ings of marriage are characteristic of a Nation where new dimensions of freedom become apparent to new gen-
erations, often through perspectives that begin in pleas or protests and then are considered in the political sphere
and the judicial process. This dynamic can be seen in the Nation's experiences with the rights of gays and les-
bians. Until the mid-20th century, same-sex intimacy long had been condemned as immoral by the state itself
in most Western nations, a belief often embodied in the criminal law. For this reason, among others, many per-
sons did not deem homosexuals to have dignity in their own distinct identity. A truthful declaration by same-sex
couples of what was in their hearts had to remain unspoken. Even when a greater awareness of the humanity
and integrity of homosexual persons came in the period after World War II, the argument that gays and lesbians
had a just claim to dignity was in conflict with both law and widespread social conventions. Same-sex intimacy
remained a crime in many States. Gays and lesbians were prohibited from most government employment, barred
from military service, excluded under immigration laws, targeted by police, and burdened in their rights to asso-
ciate. See Brief for Organization of American Historians as Amicus Curiae 5-28. For much of the 20th century,
moreover, homosexuality was treated as an illness. * * *

In the late 20th century, following substantial cultural and political developments, same-sex couples began to
lead more open and public lives and to establish families. This development was followed by a quite extensive dis-
cussion of the issue in both governmental and private sectors and by a shift in public attitudes toward greater tol-
erance. As a result, questions about the rights of gays and lesbians soon reached the courts, where the issue could
be discussed in the formal discourse of the law. This Court first gave detailed consideration to the legal status
of homosexuals in Bowers v. Hardwick (1986). There it upheld the constitutionality of a Georgia law deemed to
criminalize certain homosexual acts. Ten years later, in Romer v. Evans (1996), the Court invalidated an amend-
ment to Colorado's Constitution that sought to foreclose any branch or political subdivision of the State from
protecting persons against discrimination based on sexual orientation. Then, in 2003, the Court overruled Bow-
ers, holding that laws making same-sex intimacy a crime "demea[n] the lives of homosexual persons." Lawrence
v. Texas. Against this background, the legal question of same-sex marriage arose. In 1993, the Hawaii Supreme
Court held Hawaii's law restricting marriage to opposite-sex couples constituted a classification on the basis of
sex and was therefore subject to strict scrutiny under the Hawaii Constitution. Baehr v. Lewin. Although this
decision did not mandate that same-sex marriage be allowed, some States were concerned by its implications and
reaffirmed in their laws that marriage is defined as a union between opposite-sex partners. So too in 1996, Con-
gress passed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), defining marriage for all federal- law purposes as "only a
legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife." The new and widespread discussion of the
subject led other States to a different conclusion. In 2003, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts held the
State's Constitution guaranteed same-sex couples the right to marry ...

Under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, no State shall "deprive any person of life, liberty,
or property, without due process of law." The fundamental liberties protected by this Clause include most of
the rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights. In addition these liberties extend to certain personal choices central
to individual dignity and autonomy, including intimate choices that define personal identity and beliefs. See,
e.g., Eisenstadt v. Baird, (1972); Griswold v. Connecticut (1965). The identification and protection of fundamen-
tal rights is an enduring part of the judicial duty to interpret the Constitution. That responsibility, however,
                                                                                                                MARRIAGE AND FAMILY | 609

"has not been reduced to any formula." Poe v. Ullman (1961) (Harlan, J., dissenting). Rather, it requires courts
to exercise reasoned judgment in identifying interests of the person so fundamental that the State must accord
them its respect. That process is guided by many of the same considerations relevant to analysis of other consti-
tutional provisions that set forth broad principles rather than specific requirements. History and tradition guide
and discipline this inquiry but do not set its outer boundaries. See Lawrence. That method respects our history
and learns from it without allowing the past alone to rule the present. The nature of injustice is that we may
not always see it in our own times. The generations that wrote and ratified the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth
Amendment did not presume to know the extent of freedom in all of its dimensions, and so they entrusted to
future generations a charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning. When
new insight reveals discord between the Constitution's central protections and a received legal stricture, a claim
to liberty must be addressed. Applying these established tenets, the Court has long held the right to marry is pro-
tected by the Constitution. In Loving v. Virginia (1967), which invalidated bans on interracial unions, a unani-
mous Court held marriage is "one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free
men."

Choices about marriage shape an individual's destiny. As the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has
explained, because "it fulfils yearnings for security, safe haven, and connection that express our common human-
ity, civil marriage is an esteemed institution, and the decision whether and whom to marry is among life's
momentous acts of self-definition." Goodridge v. Department of Public Health (Ma. 2003). The nature of mar-
riage is that, through its enduring bond, two persons together can find other freedoms, such as expression,
intimacy, and spirituality. This is true for all persons, whatever their sexual orientation. See Windsor. There is
dignity in the bond between two men or two women who seek to marry and in their autonomy to make such
profound choices. Cf. Loving ("[T]he freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the
individual and cannot be infringed by the State").

A second principle in this Court's jurisprudence is that the right to marry is fundamental because it supports
a two-person union unlike any other in its importance to the committed individuals. This point was central to
Griswold v. Connecticut, which held the Constitution protects the right of married couples to use contraception.
Suggesting that marriage is a right "older than the Bill of Rights," Griswold described marriage this way: "Mar-
riage is a coming together for better or for worse, hopefully enduring, and intimate to the degree of being sacred.
It is an association that promotes a way of life, not causes; a harmony in living, not political faiths; a bilateral loy-
alty, not commercial or social projects. Yet it is an association for as noble a purpose as any involved in our prior
decisions." ...

As this Court held in Lawrence, same-sex couples have the same right as opposite-sex couples to enjoy intimate
association. Lawrence invalidated laws that made same- sex intimacy a criminal act. And it acknowledged that
"[w]hen sexuality finds overt expression in intimate con- duct with another person, the conduct can be but one
element in a personal bond that is more enduring." But while Lawrence confirmed a dimension of freedom that
allows individuals to engage in intimate association without criminal liability, it does not follow that freedom
stops there. Outlaw to outcast may be a step forward, but it does not achieve the full promise of liberty.
610 | MARRIAGE AND FAMILY

A third basis for protecting the right to marry is that it safeguards children and families and thus draws meaning
from related rights of childrearing, procreation, and education. See Pierce v. Society of Sisters (1925); Meyer. The
Court has recognized these connections by describing the varied rights as a unified whole: "[T]he right to `marry,
establish a home and bring up children' is a central part of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause."
Zablocki, (quoting Meyer). Under the laws of the several States, some of marriage's protections for children and
families are material. But marriage also confers more profound benefits. By giving recognition and legal structure
to their parents' relationship, marriage allows children "to understand the integrity and closeness of their own
family and its concord with other families in their community and in their daily lives." Windsor. Marriage also
affords the permanency and stability important to children's best interests. See Brief for Scholars of the Con-
stitutional Rights of Children as Amici Curiae. As all parties agree, many same-sex couples provide loving and
nurturing homes to their children, whether biological or adopted. And hundreds of thousands of children are
presently being raised by such couples. Most States have allowed gays and lesbians to adopt, either as individuals
or as couples, and many adopted and foster children have same-sex parents. This provides powerful confirma-
tion from the law itself that gays and lesbians can create loving, supportive families.

Excluding same-sex couples from marriage thus conflicts with a central premise of the right to marry. Without
the recognition, stability, and predictability marriage offers, their children suffer the stigma of knowing their
families are somehow lesser. They also suffer the significant material costs of being raised by unmarried parents,
relegated through no fault of their own to a more difficult and uncertain family life. The marriage laws at issue
here thus harm and humiliate the children of same-sex couples. See Windsor. That is not to say the right to
marry is less meaningful for those who do not or cannot have children. An ability, desire, or promise to procreate
is not and has not been a prerequisite for a valid marriage in any State.

In light of precedent protecting the right of a married couple not to procreate, it cannot be said the Court or
the States have conditioned the right to marry on the capacity or commitment to procreate. The constitutional
marriage right has many aspects, of which childbearing is only one. Fourth and finally, this Court's cases and the
Nation's traditions make clear that marriage is a keystone of our social order ...

Marriage remains a building block of our national community. For that reason, just as a couple vows to support
each other, so does society pledge to support the couple, offering symbolic recognition and material benefits to
protect and nourish the union. Indeed, while the States are in general free to vary the benefits they confer on all
married couples, they have throughout our history made marriage the basis for an expanding list of governmen-
tal rights, benefits, and responsibilities. These aspects of marital status include: taxation; inheritance and prop-
erty rights; rules of intestate succession; spousal privilege in the law of evidence; hospital access; medical decision
making authority; adoption rights; the rights and benefits of survivors; birth and death certificates; professional
ethics rules; campaign finance restrictions; workers' compensation benefits; health insurance; and child custody,
support, and visitation rules. There is no difference between same- and opposite-sex couples with respect to this
principle. Yet by virtue of their exclusion from that institution, same sex couples are denied the constellation
of benefits that the States have linked to marriage. This harm results in more than just material burdens. Same-
sex couples are consigned to an instability many opposite-sex couples would deem intolerable in their own lives.
                                                                                                                  MARRIAGE AND FAMILY | 611

As the State itself makes marriage all the more precious by the significance it attaches to it, exclusion from that
status has the effect of teaching that gays and lesbians are unequal in important respects. It demeans gays and
lesbians for the State to lock them out of a central institution of the Nation's society.

...

Under the Constitution, same-sex couples seek in marriage the same legal treatment as opposite-sex couples, and
it would disparage their choices and diminish their personhood to deny them this right. The right of same-sex
couples to marry that is part of the liberty promised by the Fourteenth Amendment is derived, too, from that
Amendment's guarantee of the equal protection of the laws. The Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection
Clause are connected in a profound way, though they set forth independent principles. Rights implicit in liberty
and rights secured by equal protection may rest on different precepts and are not always coextensive, yet in some
instances each may be instructive as to the meaning and reach of the other.

* * *

These considerations lead to the conclusion that the right to marry is a fundamental right inherent in the liberty
of the person, and under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment couples
of the same-sex may not be deprived of that right and that liberty. The Court now holds that same-sex couples
may exercise the fundamental right to marry. No longer may this liberty be denied to them. Baker v. Nelson must
be and now is overruled, and the State laws challenged by Petitioners in these cases are now held invalid to the
extent they exclude same-sex couples from civil marriage on the same terms and conditions as opposite- sex cou-
ples.

There may be an initial inclination in these cases to proceed with caution--to await further legislation, litigation,
and debate. The respondents warn there has been insufficient democratic discourse before deciding an issue so
basic as the definition of marriage. In its ruling on the cases now before this Court, the majority opinion for
the Court of Appeals made a cogent argument that it would be appropriate for the respondents' States to await
further public discussion and political measures before licensing same-sex marriages. Yet there has been far more
deliberation than this argument acknowledges.

Of course, the Constitution contemplates that democracy is the appropriate process for change, so long as that
process does not abridge fundamental rights. Last Term, a plurality of this Court reaffirmed the importance of
the democratic principle in Schuette v. BAMN (2014), noting the "right of citizens to debate so they can learn
and decide and then, through the political process, act in concert to try to shape the course of their own times."
Indeed, it is most often through democracy that liberty is preserved and protected in our lives. But as Schuette
also said, "[t]he freedom secured by the Constitution consists, in one of its essential dimensions, of the right of
the individual not to be injured by the unlawful exercise of governmental power." Thus, when the rights of per-
sons are violated, "the Constitution requires redress by the courts," notwithstanding the more general value of
democratic decision making. This holds true even when protecting individual rights affects issues of the utmost
importance and sensitivity. The dynamic of our constitutional system is that individuals need not await legisla-
tive action before asserting a fundamental right ...
612 | MARRIAGE AND FAMILY

A ruling against same-sex couples would have the same effect--and, like Bowers, would be unjustified under the
Fourteenth Amendment. The petitioners' stories make clear the urgency of the issue they present to the Court.
James Obergefell now asks whether Ohio can erase his marriage to John Arthur for all time. April DeBoer and
Jayne Rowse now ask whether Michigan may continue to deny them the certainty and stability all mothers
desire to protect their children, and for them and their children the childhood years will pass all too soon. Ijpe
DeKoe and Thomas Kostura now ask whether Tennessee can deny to one who has served this Nation the basic
dignity of recognizing his New York marriage ...

Finally, it must be emphasized that religions, and those who adhere to religious doctrines, may continue to advo-
cate with utmost, sincere conviction that, by divine precepts, same-sex marriage should not be condoned. The
First Amendment ensures that religious organizations and persons are given proper protection as they seek to
teach the principles that are so fulfilling and so central to their lives and faiths, and to their own deep aspirations
to continue the family structure they have long revered. The same is true of those who oppose same-sex marriage
for other reasons. In turn, those who believe allowing same- sex marriage is proper or indeed essential, whether
as a matter of religious conviction or secular belief, may engage those who disagree with their view in an open
and searching debate ...

The Constitution, however, does not permit the State to bar same-sex couples from marriage on the same terms
as accorded to couples of the opposite sex. These cases also present the question whether the Constitution
requires States to recognize same-sex marriages validly performed out of State. As made clear by the case of
Obergefell and Arthur, and by that of DeKoe and Kostura, the recognition bans inflict substantial and contin-
uing harm on same-sex couples. Being married in one State but having that valid marriage denied in another
is one of "the most perplexing and distressing complication[s]" in the law of domestic relations. Williams v.
North Carolina (1942). Leaving the current state of affairs in place would maintain and promote instability
and uncertainty. For some couples, even an ordinary drive into a neighboring State to visit family or friends
risks causing severe hardship in the event of a spouse's hospitalization while across state lines. In light of the
fact that many States already allow same-sex marriage--and hundreds of thousands of these marriages already
have occurred--the disruption caused by the recognition bans is significant and ever-growing. As counsel for
the respondents acknowledged at argument, if States are required by the Constitution to issue marriage licenses
to same-sex couples, the justifications for refusing to recognize those marriages performed else- 664 where are
undermined. The Court, in this decision, holds same-sex couples may exercise the fundamental right to marry
in all States. It follows that the Court also must hold--and it now does hold--that there is no lawful basis for a
State to refuse to recognize a lawful same-sex marriage performed in another State on the ground of its same-sex
character. * * *

No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice,
and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of
the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would
misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do
respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be con-
§                                                                                                                MARRIAGE AND FAMILY | 613

demned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization's oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity
in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the
Sixth Circuit is reversed.

It is so ordered.

Pavan v. Smith

576 US ___ (2017)

Per Curiam.

...

As this Court explained in Obergefell v. Hodges, (2015), the Constitution entitles same-sex couples to civil mar-
riage "on the same terms and conditions as opposite-sex couples ..." In the decision below, the Arkansas Supreme
Court considered the effect of that holding on the State's rules governing the issuance of birth certificates. When
a married woman gives birth in Arkansas, state law generally requires the name of the mother's male spouse to
appear on the child's birth certificate--regardless of his biological relationship to the child. According to the
court below, however, Arkansas need not extend that rule to similarly situated same-sex couples: The State need
not, in other words, issue birth certificates including the female spouses of women who give birth in the State.
Because that differential treatment infringes Obergefell's commitment to provide same-sex couples "the constel-
lation of benefits that the States have linked to marriage ..." we reverse the state court's judgment.

The petitioners here are two married same-sex couples who conceived children through anonymous sperm
donation. Leigh and Jana Jacobs were married in Iowa in 2010, and Terrah and Marisa Pavan were married
in New Hampshire in 2011. Leigh and Terrah each gave birth to a child in Arkansas in 2015. When it came
time to secure birth certificates for the newborns, each couple filled out paperwork listing both spouses as par-
ents--Leigh and Jana in one case, Terrah and Marisa in the other. Both times, however, the Arkansas Depart-
ment of Health issued certificates bearing only the birth mother's name.

The department's decision rested on a provision of Arkansas law, Ark. Code §20-18-401 (2014), that specifies
which individuals will appear as parents on a child's state-issued birth certificate. "For the purposes of birth regis-
tration," that statute says, "the mother is deemed to be the woman who gives birth to the child." §20-18-401(e).
And "[i]f the mother was married at the time of either conception or birth," the statute instructs that "the name
of [her] husband shall be entered on the certificate as the father of the child." §20-18-401(f)(1). There are
some limited exceptions to the latter rule--for example, another man may appear on the birth certificate if the
"mother" and "husband" and "putative father" all file affidavits vouching for the putative father's paternity. Ibid.
614 | MARRIAGE AND FAMILY

But as all parties agree, the requirement that a married woman's husband appear on her child's birth certificate
applies in cases where the couple conceived by means of artificial insemination with the help of an anonymous
sperm donor ... ("Any child born to a married woman by means of artificial insemination shall be deemed the
legitimate natural child of the woman and the woman's husband if the husband consents in writing to the arti-
ficial insemination").

The Jacobses and Pavans brought this suit in Arkansas state court against the director of the Arkansas Depart-
ment of Health--seeking, among other things, a declaration that the State's birth-certificate law violates the
Constitution. The trial court agreed, holding that the relevant portions of §20-18-401 are inconsistent with
Obergefell because they "categorically prohibi[t] every same-sex married couple ... from enjoying the same
spousal benefits which are available to every opposite-sex married couple ..." But a divided Arkansas Supreme
Court reversed that judgment, concluding that the statute "pass[es] constitutional muster ..." In that court's
view, "the statute centers on the relationship of the biological mother and the biological father to the child, not
on the marital relationship of husband and wife," and so it "does not run afoul of Obergefell ..." Two justices
dissented from that view, maintaining that under Obergefell "a same-sex married couple is entitled to a birth cer-
tificate on the same basis as an opposite-sex married couple ..."

The Arkansas Supreme Court's decision, we conclude, denied married same-sex couples access to the "constella-
tion of benefits that the Stat[e] ha[s] linked to marriage." Obergefell, 576 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 17). As already
explained, when a married woman in Arkansas conceives a child by means of artificial insemination, the State
will--indeed, must--list the name of her male spouse on the child's birth certificate ... And yet state law, as inter-
preted by the court below, allows Arkansas officials in those very same circumstances to omit a married woman's
female spouse from her child's birth certificate ... As a result, same-sex parents in Arkansas lack the same right as
opposite-sex parents to be listed on a child's birth certificate, a document often used for important transactions
like making medical decisions for a child or enrolling a child in school ...

Echoing the court below, the State defends its birth-certificate law on the ground that being named on a child's
birth certificate is not a benefit that attends marriage. Instead, the State insists, a birth certificate is simply a
device for recording biological parentage--regardless of whether the child's parents are married. But Arkansas
law makes birth certificates about more than just genetics. As already discussed, when an opposite-sex couple
conceives a child by way of anonymous sperm donation--just as the petitioners did here--state law requires the
placement of the birth mother's husband on the child's birth certificate ... And that is so even though (as the
State concedes) the husband "is definitively not the biological father" in those circumstances ...

Arkansas has thus chosen to make its birth certificates more than a mere marker of biological relationships: The
State uses those certificates to give married parents a form of legal recognition that is not available to unmarried
parents. Having made that choice, Arkansas may not, consistent with Obergefell, deny married same-sex couples
that recognition.
                                                                                                                 MARRIAGE AND FAMILY | 615

The petition for a writ of certiorari and the pending motions for leave to file briefs as amici curiae are granted.
The judgment of the Arkansas Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not
inconsistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

    Vote: 9-0
    Decision: Affirmed
    Majority: Waite, joined by Woods, Miller, Field, Bradley, Harlan, Matthews, Gray, and Batchford

MR. JUSTICE WOODS DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.

Herman Presser, the plaintiff in error, was indicted on September 24, 1879, in the Criminal Court of Cook
County, Illinois, far a violation of the following sections of Art. XI of the Military Code of that state, Act of
May 28, 1879, Laws of 1879, 192 ...

The indictment charged in substance that Presser, on September 24, 1879, in the County of Cook, in the State
of Illinois, "did unlawfully belong to and did parade and drill in the City of Chicago with an unauthorized body
of men with arms who had associated themselves together as a military company and organization without hav-
ing a license from the governor, and not being a part of or belonging to `the regular organized volunteer militia'
of the State of Illinois or the troops of the United States." ...

The position of the plaintiff in error in this Court was that the entire statute under which he was convicted was
invalid and void because its enactment was the exercise of a power by the Legislature of Illinois forbidden to the
states by the Constitution of the United States ...

We have not found it necessary to consider or decide the question thus raised, as to the validity of the entire Mil-
itary Code of Illinois, for, in our opinion, the sections under which the plaintiff in error was convicted may be
valid, even if the other sections of the act were invalid. For it is a settled rule "that statutes that are constitutional
in part only will be upheld so far as they are not in- conflict with the Constitution, provided the allowed and
prohibited parts are separable ..." Packet Co. V. Keokuk (1877); Penniman's Case (1880); Unity v. Burrage (1881)
...

We are of opinion that this rule is applicable in this case. The first two sections of Article I of the Military Code
provide that all able-bodied male citizens of the State between the ages of eighteen and forty-five years, except
those exempted, shall be subject to military duty, and be designated the "Illinois State Militia," and declare how
they shall be enrolled and under what circumstances. The residue of the Code, except the two sections on which
the indictment against the plaintiff in error is based, provides for a volunteer active militia, to consist of not more
than eight thousand officers and men, declares how it shall be enlisted and brigaded, and the term of service of
its officers and men; provides for brigade generals and their staffs, for the organization of the requisite battalions

and companies and the election of company officers; provides for inspections, parades, and encampments, arms
and armories, rifle practice, and courts martial; provides for the pay of the officers and men, for medical service,
regimental bands, books of instruction and maps; contains provisions for levying and collecting a military fund
by taxation, and directs how it shall be expended; and appropriates $25,000 out of the treasury, in advance of the
collection of the military fund, to be used for the purposes specified in the Military Code ...

It is only the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States that the clause relied on was intended to
protect. A State may pass laws to regulate the privileges and immunities of its own citizens, provided that in so
doing it does not abridge their privileges and immunities as citizens of the United States. The inquiry is, there-
fore, pertinent, what privilege or immunity of a citizen of the United States is abridged by sections 5 and 6 of
Article XL of the Military Code of Illinois? ...

The plaintiff in error was not a member of the organized volunteer militia of the State of Illinois, nor did he
belong to the troops of the United States or to any organization under the militia law of the United States. On
the contrary, the fact that he did not belong to the organized militia or the troops of the United States was an
ingredient in the offense for which he was convicted and sentenced. The question is therefore had he a right as a
citizen of the United States, in disobedience of the state law, to associate with others as a military company and
to drill and parade with arms in the towns and cities of the state? If the plaintiff in error has any such privilege,
he must be able to point to the provision of the Constitution or statutes of the United States by which it is con-
ferred ...

The right voluntarily to associate together as a military company or organization or to drill or parade with arms
without and independent of an act of Congress or law of the state authorizing the same is not an attribute of
national citizenship ... Under our political system, they are subject to the regulation and control of the state and
federal governments, acting in due regard to their respective prerogatives and powers. The Constitution and
laws of the United States will be searched in vain for any support to the view that these rights are privileges and
immunities of citizens of the United States independent of some specific legislation on the subject.

It cannot be successfully questioned that the State governments, unless restrained by their own Constitutions,
have the power to regulate or prohibit associations and meetings of the people, except in the case of peaceable
assemblies to perform the duties or exercise the privileges of citizens of the United States; and have also the power
to control and regulate the organization, drilling, and parading of military bodies and associations, except when
such bodies or associations are authorized by the militia laws of the United States. The exercise of this power by
the States is necessary to the public peace, safety and good order. To deny the power would be to deny the right
of the State to disperse assemblages organized for sedition and treason, and the right to suppress armed mobs
bent on riot and rapine ...

In respect to these points, we have to say that they present no Federal question. It is not, therefore, our province
to consider or decide them ... All the Federal questions presented by the record were rightly decided by the
Supreme Court of Illinois.

MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.

...

An indictment in the District Court Western District Arkansas, charged that Jack Miller and Frank Layton "did
unlawfully, knowingly, willfully, and feloniously transport in interstate commerce from the town of Claremore
in the State of Oklahoma to the town of Siloam Springs in the State of Arkansas a certain firearm, to-wit, a dou-
ble barrel 12-gauge Stevens shotgun having a barrel less than 18 inches in length, bearing identification number
76230, said defendants, at the time of so transporting said firearm in interstate commerce as aforesaid, not hav-
ing registered said firearm as required by Section 1132d of Title 26, United States Code (Act of June 26, 1934, c.
737, Sec. 4 [§ 5], 48 Stat. 1237), and not having in their possession a stamp-affixed written order for said firearm
as provided by Section 1132c, Title 26, United States Code (June 26, 1934, c. 737, Sec. 4, 48 Stat. 1237) and the
regulations issued under authority of the said Act of Congress known as the `National Firearms Act' approved
June 26, 1934, contrary to the form of the statute in such case made and provided, and against the peace and
dignity of the United States ..."

In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a "shotgun having a barrel of less than
eighteen inches in length" at this time has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a
well-regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an
instrument. Certainly, it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equip-
ment or that its use could contribute to the common defense. Aymette v. State (1840) ...
§620 | HISTORICAL CASES

The Constitution as originally adopted granted to the Congress power-"To provide for calling forth the Militia
to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions; To provide for organizing, arming,
and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the
United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of train-
ing the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress." With obvious purpose to assure the con-
tinuation and render possible the effectiveness of such forces the declaration and guarantee of the Second
Amendment were made. It must be interpreted and applied with that end in view ...

The signification attributed to the term Militia appears from the debates in the Convention, the history and leg-
islation of Colonies and States, and the writings of approved commentators. These show plainly enough that the
Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense." A body of citizens
enrolled for military discipline." And further, that ordinarily when called for service these men were expected to
appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time ...

Most if not all of the States have adopted provisions touching the right to keep and bear arms. Differences in
the language employed in these have naturally led to somewhat variant conclusions concerning the scope of the
right guaranteed. But none of them seem to afford any material support for the challenged ruling of the court
below ...

We are unable to accept the conclusion of the court below and the challenged judgment must be reversed. The
cause will be remanded for further proceedings.

    Majority: Waite, joined by Swayne, Miller, Field, and Strong
    Concurrence (in part)/ Dissent (in part): Clifford, joined by Davis, Bradley, and Hunt

Mr. Chief Justice Waite delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case comes here with a certificate by the judges of the Circuit Court for the District of Louisiana that they
were divided in opinion upon a question which occurred at the hearing. It presents for our consideration an
indictment containing sixteen counts, divided into two series of eight counts each, based upon sect. 6 of the
Enforcement Act of May 31, 1870. That section is as follows:
                                                                                                                       HISTORICAL CASES | 621

"That if two or more persons shall band or conspire together, or go in disguise upon the public highway, or
upon the premises of another, with intent to violate any provision of this act, or to injure, oppress, threaten, or
intimidate any citizen, with intent to prevent or hinder his free exercise and enjoyment of any right or privilege
granted or secured to him by the constitution or laws of the United States, or because of his having exercised
the same, such persons shall be held guilty of felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be fined or imprisoned, or
both, at the discretion of the court, -the fine not to exceed $5,000, and the imprisonment not to exceed ten years;
and shall, moreover, be thereafter ineligible to, and disabled from holding, any office or place of honor, profit, or
trust created by the constitution or laws of the United States."

...

The offences provided for by the statute in question do not consist in the mere "banding" or "conspiring" of two
or more persons together, but in their banding or conspiring with the intent, or for any of the purposes, speci-
fied. To bring this case under the operation of the statute, therefore, it must appear that the right, the enjoyment
of which the conspirators intended to hinder or prevent, was one granted or secured by the constitution or laws
of the United States. If it does not appear, the criminal matter charged has not been made indictable by any act
of Congress.

...

Citizens are the members of the political community to which they belong. They are the people who compose
the community, and who, in their associated capacity, have established or submitted themselves to the dominion
of a government for the promotion of their general welfare and the protection of their individual as well as their
collective rights. In the formation of a government, the people may confer upon it such powers as they choose.
The government, when so formed, may, and when called upon should exercise all the powers it has for the pro-
tection of the rights of its citizens and the people within its jurisdiction; but it can exercise no other. The duty
of a government to afford protection is limited always by the power it possesses for that purpose.

Experience made the fact known to the people of the United States that they required a national government
for national purposes. The separate governments of the separate States, bound together by the articles of con-
federation alone, were not sufficient for the promotion of the general welfare of the people in respect to foreign
nations, or for their complete protection as citizens of the confederated States. For this reason, the people of the
United States, "in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for
the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty" to themselves and their
posterity (Const. Preamble), ordained and established the government of the United States, and defined its pow-
ers by a constitution, which they adopted as its fundamental law, and made its rule of action. The government
thus established and defined is to some extent a government of the States in their political capacity. It is also, for
certain purposes, a government of the people. Its powers are limited in number, but not in degree. Within the
scope of its powers, as enumerated and defined, it is supreme and above the States; but beyond, it has no exis-
tence. It was erected for special purposes, and endowed with all the powers necessary for its own preservation
and the accomplishment of the ends its people had in view. It can neither grant nor secure to its citizens any right
or privilege not expressly or by implication placed under its jurisdiction ...
622 | HISTORICAL CASES

The government of the United States is one of delegated powers alone. Its authority is defined and limited by
the Constitution. All powers not granted to it by that instrument are reserved to the States or the people. No
rights can be acquired under the constitution or laws of the United States, except such as the government of the
United States has the authority to grant or secure. All that cannot be so granted or secured are left under the
protection of the States ...

We now proceed to an examination of the indictment, to ascertain whether the several rights, which it is alleged
the defendants intended to interfere with, are such as had been in law and in fact granted or secured by the con-
stitution or laws of the United States ...

The second and tenth counts are equally defective. The right there specified is that of `bearing arms for a lawful
purpose.' This is not a right granted by the Constitution. Neither is it in any manner dependent upon that
instrument for its existence. The second amendment declares that it shall not be infringed; but this, as has been
seen, means no more than that it shall not be infringed by Congress. This is one of the amendments that has no
other effect than to restrict the powers of the national government, leaving the people to look for their protec-
tion against any violation by their fellow-citizens of the rights it recognizes, to what is called, in The City of New
York v. Miln, 11 Pet. 139, the `powers which relate to merely municipal legislation, or what was, perhaps, more
properly called internal police,' `not surrendered or restrained' by the Constitution of the United States.

If a State cannot protect itself against domestic violence, the United States may, upon the call of the executive,
when the legislature cannot be convened, lend their assistance for that purpose. This is a guaranty of the Consti-
tution (art. 4, sect. 4); but it applies to no case like this ...

... The statute provides for the punishment of those who conspire "to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate
any citizen, with intent to prevent or hinder his free exercise and enjoyment of any right or privilege granted or
secured to him by the constitution or laws of the United States."

These counts in the indictment charge, in substance, that the intent in this case was to hinder and prevent these
citizens in the free exercise and enjoyment of "every, each, all, and singular" the rights granted them by the Con-
stitution ... There is no specification of any particular right. The language is broad enough to cover all ...

But it is needless to pursue the argument further. The conclusion is irresistible, that these counts are too vague
and general. They lack the certainty and precision required by the established rules of criminal pleading. It fol-
lows that they are not good and sufficient in law.

They are so defective that no judgment of conviction should be pronounced upon them. The order of the Cir-
cuit Court arresting the judgment upon the verdict is, therefore, affirmed; and the cause remanded, with instruc-
tions to discharge the defendants.

United States v. Emerson

270 F.3d 203 (2001)

    Vote: 9-0
    Decision: Reversed
    Majority: Garwood, joined by DeMoss, and Parker (Parts I-IV)
    Concurrence: Parker

Justice Garwood delivered the opinion of the Court.

...

On December 8, 1998, the grand jury for the Northern District of Texas, San Angelo division, returned a five-
count indictment against Emerson. The government moved to dismiss counts 2 through 5, which motion the
district court subsequently granted. Count 1, the only remaining count and the count here at issue, alleged
that Emerson on November 16, 1998, unlawfully possessed "in and affecting interstate commerce" a firearm,
a Beretta pistol, while subject to the above-mentioned September 14, 1998 order, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §
922(g) (8). It appears that Emerson had purchased the pistol on October 10, 1997, in San Angelo, Texas, from
a licensed firearms dealer. Emerson does not claim that the pistol had not previously traveled in interstate or for-
eign commerce. It is not disputed that the September 14, 1998 order was in effect at least through November
16, 1998.

Emerson moved pretrial to dismiss the indictment, asserting that section 922(g) (8), facially and as applied to
him, violates the Second Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. He also moved
to dismiss on the basis that section 922(g) (8) was an improper exertion of federal power under the Com-
merce Clause and that, in any case, the law unconstitutionally usurps powers reserved to the states by the Tenth
Amendment. An evidentiary hearing was held on Emerson's motion to dismiss.

The district court granted Emerson's motions to dismiss. Subsequently, the district court issued an amended
memorandum opinion ... The district court held that dismissal of the indictment was proper on Second or Fifth
Amendment grounds, but rejected Emerson's Tenth Amendment and Commerce Clause arguments.

The government appealed. Emerson filed a notice of cross-appeal, which was dismissed by this Court. The gov-
ernment challenges the district court's dismissal on Second and Fifth Amendment grounds. Emerson defends
the district court's dismissal on those grounds and also urges that dismissal was in any event proper under the
Commerce Clause and on statutory grounds.
624 | THE DEBATE EMERGES

We have found no historical evidence that the Second Amendment was intended to convey militia power to the
states, limit the federal government's power to maintain a standing army, or applies only to members of a select
militia while on active duty. All of the evidence indicates that the Second Amendment, like other parts of the
Bill of Rights, applies to and protects individual Americans ...

We find that the history of the Second Amendment reinforces the plain meaning of its text, namely that it pro-
tects individual Americans in their right to keep and bear arms whether or not they are a member of a select
militia or performing active military service or training ...

We reject the collective rights and sophisticated collective rights models for interpreting the Second Amendment.
We hold, consistent with Miller, that it protects the right of individuals, including those not then actually a
member of any militia or engaged in active military service or training, to privately possess and bear their own
firearms, such as the pistol involved here, that are suitable as personal, individual weapons and are not of the
general kind or type excluded by Miller [U.S. v. Miller (1939)]. However, because of our holding that section
922(g) (8), as applied to Emerson, does not infringe his individual rights under the Second Amendment we will
not now further elaborate as to the exact scope of all Second Amendment rights.

...

Although, as we have held, the Second Amendment does protect individual rights, that does not mean that those
rights may never be made subject to any limited, narrowly tailored specific exceptions or restrictions for particu-
lar cases that are reasonable and not inconsistent with the right of Americans generally to individually keep and
bear their private arms as historically understood in this country. Indeed, Emerson does not contend, and the
district court did not hold, otherwise. As we have previously noted, it is clear that felons, infants and those of
unsound mind may be prohibited from possessing firearms. Emerson's argument that his Second Amendment
rights have been violated is grounded on the propositions that the September 14, 1998 order contains no express
finding that he represents a credible threat to the physical safety of his wife (or child), that the evidence before
the court issuing the order would not sustain such a finding and that the provisions of the order bringing it
within clause (C) (ii) of section 922(g) (8) were no more than uncontested boiler-plate. In essence, Emerson, and
the district court, concede that had the order contained an express finding, on the basis of adequate evidence,
that Emerson actually posed a credible threat to the physical safety of his wife, and had that been a genuinely
contested matter at the hearing, with the parties and the court aware of section 922(g) (8), then Emerson could,
consistent with the Second Amendment, be precluded from possessing a firearm while he remained subject to
the order ...

We agree with the district court that the Second Amendment protects the right of individuals to privately keep
and bear their own firearms that are suitable as individual, personal weapons and are not of the general kind or
type excluded by Miller, regardless of whether the particular individual is then actually a member of a militia.
However, for the reasons stated, we also conclude that the predicate order in question here is sufficient, albeit
likely minimally so, to support the deprivation, while it remains in effect, of the defendant's Second Amendment
rights. Accordingly, we reverse the district court's dismissal of the indictment on Second Amendment grounds.

We remand the cause for further proceedings not inconsistent herewith.

554 U.S. 570 (2008)

    Vote: 5-4
    Decision: Affirmed
    Majority: Scalia, joined by Roberts, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito
    Dissent: Stevens, joined by Souter, Ginsburg, Breyer

Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.

...

The District of Columbia generally prohibits the possession of handguns. It is a crime to carry an unregistered
firearm, and the registration of handguns is prohibited. See D. C. Code §§7-2501.01(12), 7-2502.01(a), 7-
2502.02(a)(4) (2001). Wholly apart from that prohibition, no person may carry a handgun without a license,
but the chief of police may issue licenses for 1-year periods. See §§22-4504(a), 22-4506. District of Columbia
law also requires residents to keep their lawfully owned firearms, such as registered long guns, "unloaded and
disassembled or bound by a trigger lock or similar device" unless they are located in a place of business or are
being used for lawful recreational activities ...

Respondent Dick Heller is a D. C. special police officer authorized to carry a handgun while on duty at the
Federal Judicial Center. He applied for a registration certificate for a handgun that he wished to keep at home,
but the District refused. He thereafter filed a lawsuit in the Federal District Court for the District of Colum-
bia seeking, on Second Amendment grounds, to enjoin the city from enforcing the bar on the registration of
handguns, the licensing requirement insofar as it prohibits the carrying of a firearm in the home without a
license, and the trigger-lock requirement insofar as it prohibits the use of "functional firearms within the home."
App. 59a. The District Court dismissed respondent's complaint, see Parker v. District of Columbia (2004). The
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, construing his complaint as seeking the right to render
a firearm operable and carry it about his home in that condition only when necessary for self-defense, reversed,
see Parker v. District of Columbia (2007). It held that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to
possess firearms and that the city's total ban on handguns, as well as its requirement that firearms in the home
be kept nonfunctional even when necessary for self-defense, violated that right ...

The Second Amendment is naturally divided into two parts: its prefatory clause and its operative clause. The
former does not limit the latter grammatically, but rather announces a purpose. The Amendment could be
rephrased, "Because a well-regulated Militia is necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to
                                                                                                                 A STANDARD EMERGES | 627

keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed." Although this structure of the Second Amendment is unique in our
Constitution, other legal documents of the founding era, particularly individual-rights provisions of state con-
stitutions, commonly included a prefatory statement of purpose ...

Logic demands that there be a link between the stated purpose and the command. The Second Amendment
would be nonsensical if it read, "A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right
of the people to petition for redress of grievances shall not be infringed." That requirement of logical connec-
tion may cause a prefatory clause to resolve an ambiguity in the operative clause ("The separation of church and
state being an important objective, the teachings of canons shall have no place in our jurisprudence." The pref-
ace makes clear that the operative clause refers not to canons of interpretation but to clergymen.) But apart from
that clarifying function, a prefatory clause does not limit or expand the scope of the operative clause ...

This holding is not only consistent with, but positively suggests, that the Second Amendment confers an indi-
vidual right to keep and bear arms (though only arms that "have some reasonable relationship to the preservation
or efficiency of a well-regulated militia"). Had the Court believed that the Second Amendment protects only
those serving in the militia, it would have been odd to examine the character of the weapon rather than simply
note that the two crooks were not militiamen ...

We conclude that nothing in our precedents forecloses our adoption of the original understanding of the Second
Amendment. It should be unsurprising that such a significant matter has been for so long judicially unresolved.
For most of our history, the Bill of Rights was not thought applicable to the States, and the Federal Government
did not significantly regulate the possession of firearms by law-abiding citizens. Other provisions of the Bill of
Rights have similarly remained unilluminated for lengthy periods. This Court first held a law to violate the First
Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech in 1931, almost 150 years after the Amendment was ratified, see
Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson (1931), and it was not until after World War II that we held a law invalid under
the Establishment Clause, see Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Board of Ed. of School Dist. No. 71, Champaign Cty.
(1948). ..."[F]or most of our history, the invalidity of Second-Amendment-based objections to firearms regula-
tions has been well settled and uncontroversial." For most of our history the question did not present itself ..."

Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited. From Blackstone through the
19th-century cases, commentators and courts routinely explained that the right was not a right to keep and carry
any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose. See, e.g., US v. Sheldon (1940) ...
Although we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the Second Amend-
ment, nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession
of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as
schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of
arms.

We also recognize another important limitation on the right to keep and carry arms. Miller said, as we have
explained, that the sorts of weapons protected were those "in common use at the time." We think that limitation
is fairly supported by the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of "dangerous and unusual weapons ..."
628 | A STANDARD EMERGES

It may be objected that if weapons that are most useful in military service--M-16 rifles and the like--may be
banned, then the Second Amendment right is completely detached from the prefatory clause. But as we have
said, the conception of the militia at the time of the Second Amendment's ratification was the body of all citizens
capable of military service, who would bring the sorts of lawful weapons that they possessed at home to mili-
tia duty. It may well be true today that a militia, to be as effective as militias in the 18th century, would require
sophisticated arms that are highly unusual in society at large. Indeed, it may be true that no amount of small
arms could be useful against modern-day bombers and tanks. But the fact that modern developments have lim-
ited the degree of fit between the prefatory clause and the protected right cannot change our interpretation of
the right.

...

In sum, we hold that the District's ban on handgun possession in the home violates the Second Amendment,
as does its prohibition against rendering any lawful firearm in the home operable for the purpose of immediate
self-defense. Assuming that Heller is not disqualified from the exercise of Second Amendment rights, the Dis-
trict must permit him to register his handgun and must issue him a license to carry it in the home ...

We are aware of the problem of handgun violence in this country, and we take seriously the concerns raised by
the many amici who believe that prohibition of handgun ownership is a solution. The Constitution leaves the
District of Columbia a variety of tools for combating that problem, including some measures regulating hand-
guns ... But the enshrinement of constitutional rights necessarily takes certain policy choices off the table. These
include the absolute prohibition of handguns held and used for self-defense in the home. Undoubtedly some
think that the Second Amendment is outmoded in a society where our standing army is the pride of our Nation,
where well-trained police forces provide personal security, and where gun violence is a serious problem. That is
perhaps debatable, but what is not debatable is that it is not the role of this Court to pronounce the Second
Amendment extinct.

We affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

It is so ordered.

MR. JUSTICE ALITO ANNOUNCED THE JUDGEMENT OF THE COURT AND DELIVERED THE
OPINION OF THE COURT.

...

Two years ago, in District of Columbia v. Heller, (2008), we held that the Second Amendment protects the right
to keep and bear arms for the purpose of self-defense, and we struck down a District of Columbia law that
banned the possession of handguns in the home. The city of Chicago (City) and the village of Oak Park, a
Chicago suburb, have laws that are similar to the District of Columbia's, but Chicago and Oak Park argue that
their laws are constitutional because the Second Amendment has no application to the States. We have previ-
ously held that most of the provisions of the Bill of Rights apply with full force to both the Federal Government
and the States. Applying the standard that is well established in our case law, we hold that the Second Amend-
ment right is fully applicable to the States.

...

After our decision in Heller, the Chicago petitioners and two groups filed suit against the City in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. They sought a declaration that the handgun ban and
several related Chicago ordinances violate the Second and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Consti-
tution. Another action challenging the Oak Park law was filed in the same District Court by the National Rifle
Association (NRA) and two Oak Park residents. In addition, the NRA and others filed a third action challeng-
ing the Chicago ordinances.

The District Court rejected plaintiffs' argument that the Chicago and Oak Park laws are unconstitutional. ...

The Seventh Circuit affirmed, relying on three 19th-century cases--United States v. Cruikshank,
(1876), Presser v. Illinois, (1886), and Miller v. Texas, (1894)--that were decided in the wake of this Court's
interpretation of the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in the Slaughter-House
630 | A STANDARD EMERGES

Cases, (1873) ... Nevertheless, the Seventh Circuit observed that it was obligated to follow Supreme Court prece-
dents that have "direct application," and it declined to predict how the Second Amendment would fare under
this Court's modern "selective incorporation" ... We granted certiorari.

The Bill of Rights, including the Second Amendment, originally applied only to the Federal Government.
In Barron ex rel. Tiernan v. Mayor of Baltimore, (1833) ...

The constitutional Amendments adopted in the aftermath of the Civil War fundamentally altered our country's
federal system ...

As previously noted, the Seventh Circuit concluded that Cruikshank, Presser, and Miller doomed petitioners'
claims at the Court of Appeals level. Petitioners argue, however, that we should overrule those decisions and
hold that the right to keep and bear arms is one of the "privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States."
In petitioners' view, the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects all of the rights set out in the Bill of Rights, as
well as some others ...

We see no need to reconsider that interpretation here. For many decades, the question of the rights protected by
the Fourteenth Amendment against state infringement has been analyzed under the Due Process Clause of that
Amendment and not under the Privileges or Immunities Clause. We therefore decline to disturb the Slaughter-
House holding.

At the same time, however, this Court's decisions in Cruikshank, Presser, and Miller do not preclude us from
considering whether the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment makes the Second Amendment
right binding on the States ... As explained more fully below, Cruikshank, Presser, and Miller all preceded the era
in which the Court began the process of "selective incorporation" under the Due Process Clause, and we have
never previously addressed the question whether the right to keep and bear arms applies to the States under that
theory ...

With this framework in mind, we now turn directly to the question whether the Second Amendment right to
keep and bear arms is incorporated in the concept of due process. In answering that question, as just explained,
we must decide whether the right to keep and bear arms is fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty, Dun­
can [Louisiana (1968)] ... or as we have said in a related context, whether this right is "deeply rooted in this
Nation's history and tradition ..." Heller makes it clear that this right is "deeply rooted in this Nation's history
and tradition ..." Founding-era legal commentators confirmed the importance of the right to early Americans ...

In Heller, we held that the Second Amendment protects the right to possess a handgun in the home for the pur-
pose of self-defense. Unless considerations of stare decisis counsel otherwise, a provision of the Bill of Rights
that protects a right that is fundamental from an American perspective applies equally to the Federal Govern-
ment and the States. See Duncan ... We therefore hold that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amend-
ment incorporates the Second Amendment right recognized in Heller.

PER CURIAM.

...

The Court has held that "the Second Amendment extends, prima facie, to all instruments that constitute bear-
able arms, even those that were not in existence at the time of the founding," District of Columbia v. Heller,
(2008), and that this "Second Amendment right is fully applicable to the States," McDonald v. Chicago, (2010).
In this case, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts upheld a Massachusetts law prohibiting the posses-
sion of stun guns after examining "whether a stun gun is the type of weapon contemplated by Congress in 1789
as being protected by the Second Amendment." 470 Mass. 774, 777, 26 N. E. 3d 688, 691 (2015).

The court offered three explanations to support its holding that the Second Amendment does not extend to
stun guns. First, the court explained that stun guns are not protected because they "were not in common use at
the time of the Second Amendment's enactment." This is inconsistent with Heller's clear statement that the Sec-
ond Amendment "extends ... to ... arms ... that were not in existence at the time of the founding." ... The court
next asked whether stun guns are "dangerous per se at common law and unusual," ... in an attempt to apply one
"important limitation on the right to keep and carry arms," Heller. (referring to "the historical tradition of pro-
hibiting the carrying of `dangerous and unusual weapons'"). In so doing, the court concluded that stun guns are
"unusual" because they are "a thoroughly modern invention." By equating "unusual" with "in common use at
the time of the Second Amendment's enactment," the court's second explanation is the same as the first; it is
inconsistent with Heller for the same reason.

Finally, the court used "a contemporary lens" and found "nothing in the record to suggest that [stun guns] are
readily adaptable to use in the military." But Heller rejected the proposition "that only those weapons useful in
warfare are protected." For these three reasons, the explanation the Massachusetts court offered for upholding
632 | A STANDARD EMERGES

the law contradicts this Court's precedent. Consequently, the petition for a writ of certiorari and the motion for
leave to proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The judgment of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts
is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

JUSTICE ALITO, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins, concurring in the judgment.

...

It is settled that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms that applies against
both the Federal Government and the States. District of Columbia v. Heller (2008); McDonald v. Chicago (2010)
... That right vindicates the "basic right" of "individual self-defense." ... Caetano's encounter with her violent
ex-boyfriend illustrates the connection between those fundamental rights: By arming herself, Caetano was able
to protect against a physical threat that restraining orders had proved useless to prevent. And, commendably, she
did so by using a weapon that posed little, if any, danger of permanently harming either herself or the father of
her children ...

The Supreme Judicial Court's conclusion that stun guns are "unusual" rested largely on its premise that one
must ask whether a weapon was commonly used in 1789. As already discussed, that is simply wrong ...

... Instead, Miller and Heller recognized that militia members traditionally reported for duty carrying "the sorts
of lawful weapons that they possessed at home," and that the Second Amendment therefore protects such
weapons as a class, regardless of any particular weapon's suitability for military use ...

As the foregoing makes clear, the pertinent Second Amendment inquiry is whether stun guns are commonly
possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes today. The Supreme Judicial Court offered only a cursory
discussion of that question, noting that the "`number of Tasers and stun guns is dwarfed by the number of
firearms.'" This observation may be true, but it is beside the point. Otherwise, a State would be free to ban
all weapons except handguns, because "handguns are the most popular weapon chosen by Americans for self-
defense in the home." Heller ...

If the fundamental right of self-defense does not protect Caetano, then the safety of all Americans is left to the
mercy of state authorities who may be more concerned about disarming the people than about keeping them
safe.

JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.

In District of Columbia v. Heller, (2008), and McDonald v. Chicago, (2010), we recognized that the Second and
Fourteenth Amendments protect the right of an ordinary, law-abiding citizen to possess a handgun in the home
for self-defense. In this case, petitioners and respondents agree that ordinary, law-abiding citizens have a similar
right to carry handguns publicly for their self-defense. We too agree, and now hold, consistent with Heller and
McDonald, that the Second and Fourteenth Amendments protect an individual's right to carry a hand- gun for
self-defense outside the home.

The parties nevertheless dispute whether New York's licensing regime respects the constitutional right to carry
handguns publicly for self-defense. In 43 States, the government issues licenses to carry based on objective crite-
ria. But in six States, including New York, the government further conditions issuance of a license to carry on a
citizen's showing of some additional special need. Because the State of New York issues public-carry licenses only
when an applicant demonstrates a special need for self-defense, we conclude that the State's licensing regime vio-
lates the Constitution.

New York State has regulated the public carry of hand- guns at least since the early 20th century ... Today's licens-
ing scheme largely tracks that of the early

1900s. It is a crime in New York to possess "any firearm" without a license, whether inside or outside the home,
punishable by up to four years in prison or a $5,000 fine for a felony offense, and one year in prison or a $1,000
fine for a misdemeanor. See N. Y. Penal Law Ann. §§265.01-b (West 2017), 261.01(1) (West Cum. Supp. 2022),
70.00(2)(e) and (3)(b), 80.00(1)(a) (West 2021), 70.15(1), 80.05(1). Meanwhile, possessing a loaded firearm
outside one's home or place of business without a license is a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison.
§§265.03(3) (West 2017), 70.00(2)(c) and (3)(b), 80.00(1)(a).

A license applicant who wants to possess a firearm at home (or in his place of business) must convince a "licens-
ing officer"--usually a judge or law enforcement officer--that, among other things, he is of good moral char-
acter, has no history of crime or mental illness, and that "no good cause exists for the denial of the license."
§§400.00(1)(a)-(n) (West Cum. Supp. 2022). If he wants to carry a firearm outside his home or place of busi-
634 | A STANDARD EMERGES

ness for self-defense, the applicant must obtain an unrestricted license to "have and carry" a concealed "pistol or
revolver." §400.00(2)(f ). To secure that license, the applicant must prove that "proper cause exists" to issue it.
Ibid. If an applicant cannot make that showing, he can receive only a "restricted" license for public carry, which
allows him to carry a firearm for a limited purpose, such as hunting, target shooting, or employment.

No New York statute defines "proper cause." But New York courts have held that an applicant shows proper
cause only if he can "demonstrate a special need for self-protection distinguishable from that of the general com-
munity." E.g., In re Klenosky (1980) ... When a licensing officer denies an application, judicial re- view is limited
...

New York is not alone in requiring a permit to carry a handgun in public. But the vast majority of States--43 by
our count--are "shall issue" jurisdictions, where authorities must issue concealed-carry licenses whenever appli-
cants satisfy certain threshold requirements, without granting licensing officials discretion to deny licenses based
on a perceived lack of need or suitability. Meanwhile, only six States and the District of Columbia have "may
issue" licensing laws, under which authorities have discretion to deny concealed-carry licenses even when the
applicant satisfies the statutory criteria, usually because the applicant has not demonstrated cause or suitability
for the relevant license. Aside from New York, then, only California, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Mary-
land, Massachusetts, and New Jersey have analogues to the "proper cause" standard. All of these "proper cause"
analogues have been upheld by the Courts of Appeals, save for the District of Columbia's, which has been per-
manently enjoined since 2017 ...

... Brandon Koch and Robert Nash are law-abiding, adult citizens of Rensselaer County, New York ...

In 2014, Nash applied for an unrestricted license to carry a handgun in public. Nash did not claim any unique
danger to his personal safety; he simply wanted to carry a handgun for self-defense. In early 2015, the State
denied Nash's ap- plication for an unrestricted license but granted him a restricted license for hunting and target
shooting only. In late 2016, Nash asked a licensing officer to remove the restrictions, citing a string of recent rob-
beries in his neighborhood. After an informal hearing, the licensing officer denied the request ... Between 2008
and 2017, Koch was in the same position as Nash ... In late 2017, Koch applied to ... remove the restrictions on
his license ... Like Nash's application, Koch's was denied, except that the officer permitted Koch to "carry to and
from work." App., at 114.

... Petitioners sued respondents for declaratory and injunctive relief under Rev. Stat. 1979, 42 U. S. C. §1983,
alleging that respondents violated their Second and Fourteenth Amendment rights by denying their unre-
stricted- license applications on the basis that they had failed to show "proper cause," i.e., had failed to demon-
strate a unique need for self-defense.

The District Court dismissed petitioners' complaint and the Court of Appeals affirmed. See 818 Fed. Appx. 99,
100 (CA2 2020).

We granted certiorari to decide whether New York's denial of petitioners' license applications violated the Con-
stitution. (2021).
                                                                                                                 A STANDARD EMERGES | 635

In Heller and McDonald, we held that the Second and Fourteenth Amendments protect an individual right to
keep and bear arms for self-defense. In doing so, we held unconstitutional two laws that prohibited the posses-
sion and use of handguns in the home. In the years since, the Courts of Appeals have coalesced around a "two-
step" framework for analyzing Second Amendment challenges that combines history with means-end scrutiny.

Today, we decline to adopt that two-part approach. In keeping with Heller, we hold that when the Second
Amendment's plain text covers an individual's conduct, the Constitution presumptively protects that conduct.
To justify its regulation, the government may not simply posit that the regulation promotes an important inter-
est. Rather, the government must demonstrate that the regulation is consistent with this Nation's historical tra-
dition of firearm regulation. Only if a firearm regulation is consistent with this Nation's historical tradition may
a court conclude that the individual's conduct falls outside the Second Amendment's "unqualified command."
Konigsberg v. State Bar of Cal., (1961).

...

Despite the popularity of this two-step approach, it is one step too many. Step one of the predominant frame-
work is broadly consistent with Heller, which demands a test rooted in the Second Amendment's text, as
informed by history. But Heller and McDonald do not support applying means- end scrutiny in the Second
Amendment context. Instead, the government must affirmatively prove that its firearms regulation is part of the
historical tradition that delimits the outer bounds of the right to keep and bear arms.

To show why Heller does not support applying means-end scrutiny, we first summarize Heller's methodological
approach to the Second Amendment.

In Heller, we began with a "textual analysis" focused on the "`normal and ordinary'" meaning of the Second
Amendment's language, at 576-577, 578.. That analysis suggested that the Amendment's operative
clause--"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed"--"guarantee[s] the individual
right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation" that does not de- pend on service in the militia. Id.,
at 592.

From there, we assessed whether our initial conclusion was "confirmed by the historical background of the Sec-
ond Amendment." Ibid. We looked to history because "it has always been widely understood that the Second
Amendment ... codified a pre-existing right." Ibid ... After surveying English history dating from the late 1600s,
along with American colonial views leading up to the founding, we found "no doubt, on the basis of both text
and history, that the Second Amendment conferred an individual right to keep and bear arms." Id., at 595.

We then canvassed the historical record and found yet further confirmation ...

In assessing the postratification history, we looked to four different types of sources. First, we reviewed "[t]hree
important founding-era legal scholars [who] interpreted the Second Amendment in published writings." Ibid.
Second, we looked to "19th-century cases that interpreted the Second Amendment" and found that they "uni-
versally support an individual right" to keep and bear arms. Id., at 610. Third, we examined the "discussion of
636 | A STANDARD EMERGES

the Second Amendment in Congress and in public discourse" after the Civil War, "as people debated whether
and how to secure constitutional rights for newly freed slaves." Id., at 614. Fourth, we considered how post-Civil
War commentators under- stood the right. See id., at 616-619.

After holding that the Second Amendment protected an individual right to armed self-defense, we also relied
on the historical understanding of the Amendment to demark the limits on the exercise of that right. We noted
that, "[l]ike most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited." Id., at 626 ...

As the foregoing shows, Heller's methodology centered on constitutional text and history. Whether it came to
defining the character of the right (individual or militia dependent), suggesting the outer limits of the right, or
assessing the constitutionality of a particular regulation, Heller relied on text and history. It did not invoke any
means-end test such as strict or intermediate scrutiny ...

In sum, the Courts of Appeals' second step is inconsistent with Heller's historical approach and its rejection of
means- end scrutiny. We reiterate that the standard for applying the Second Amendment is as follows: When
the Second Amendment's plain text covers an individual's conduct, the Constitution presumptively protects
that conduct. The government must then justify its regulation by demonstrating that it is consistent with the
Nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation. Only then may a court conclude that the individual's con-
duct falls outside the Second Amendment's "unqualified command." Konigsberg, at 50, n. 10.

This Second Amendment standard accords with how we protect other constitutional rights. Take, for instance,
the freedom of speech in the First Amendment ... In some cases, that burden includes showing whether the
expressive con- duct falls outside of the category of protected speech. See Illinois ex rel. Madigan v. Telemarket­
ing Associates, Inc., 620, n. 9 (2003). And to carry that burden, the government must generally point to historical
evidence about the reach of the First Amendment's protections ...

And beyond the freedom of speech, our focus on history also comports with how we assess many other constitu-
tional claims ... To be sure, "[h]istorical analysis can be difficult; it some- times requires resolving threshold ques-
tions, and making nuanced judgments about which evidence to consult and how to interpret it." McDonald,
at 803-804 (Scalia, J., concurring). But reliance on history to inform the meaning of constitutional text--espe-
cially text meant to codify a pre-existing right--is, in our view, more legitimate, and more administrable, than
asking judges to "make difficult empirical judgments" about "the costs and benefits of firearms restrictions,"
especially given their "lack [of] expertise" in the field. Id., at 790-791 (plurality opinion).

If the last decade of Second Amendment litigation has taught this Court anything, it is that federal courts tasked
with making such difficult empirical judgments regarding firearm regulations under the banner of "intermediate
scrutiny" often defer to the determinations of legislatures. But while that judicial deference to legislative interest
balancing is understandable--and, elsewhere, appropriate--it is not deference that the Constitution demands
here. The Second Amendment "is the very product of an interest balancing by the people" and it "surely elevates
above all other interests the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms" for self-defense. Heller, at 635.
It is this balance--struck by the traditions of the American people--that demands our unqualified deference.
                                                                                                                 A STANDARD EMERGES | 637

The test that we set forth in Heller and apply today re- quires courts to assess whether modern firearms regula-
tions are consistent with the Second Amendment's text and historical understanding. In some cases, that inquiry
will be fairly straightforward ...

While the historical analogies here and in Heller are relatively simple to draw, other cases implicating unprece-
dented societal concerns or dramatic technological changes may require a more nuanced approach. The regula-
tory challenges posed by firearms today are not always the same as those that preoccupied the Founders in 1791
or the Re- construction generation in 1868. Fortunately, the Founders created a Constitution--and a Second
Amendment-- "intended to endure for ages to come, and consequently, to be adapted to the various crises of
human affairs." McCulloch v. Maryland, (1819). Although its meaning is fixed according to the understand-
ings of those who ratified it, the Constitution can, and must, apply to circumstances beyond those the Founders
specifically anticipated. See, e.g., United States v. Jones, 404-405 (2012).

We have already recognized in Heller at least one way in which the Second Amendment's historically fixed mean-
ing applies to new circumstances: Its reference to "arms" does not apply "only [to] those arms in existence in the
18th century." at 582 ... Thus, even though the Second Amendment's definition of "arms" is fixed according to
its historical understanding, that general definition covers modern instruments that facilitate armed self-defense.
Cf. Caetano v. Massachusetts (2016) ...

Much like we use history to determine which modern "arms" are protected by the Second Amendment, so too
does history guide our consideration of modern regulations that were unimaginable at the founding. When con-
fronting such present-day firearm regulations, this historical inquiry that courts must conduct will often involve
reasoning by analogy--a commonplace task for any lawyer or judge ...

To be clear, analogical reasoning under the Second Amendment is neither a regulatory straightjacket nor a reg-
ulatory blank check. On the one hand, courts should not "uphold every modern law that remotely resembles a
historical analogue," because doing so "risk[s] endorsing outliers that our ancestors would never have accepted."
Drummond v. Robinson (CA3 2021). On the other hand, analogical reasoning requires only that the govern-
ment identify a well-established and representative historical analogue, not a historical twin. So even if a modern-
day regulation is not a dead ringer for historical precursors, it still may be analogous enough to pass constitu-
tional muster ...

Having made the constitutional standard endorsed in Heller more explicit, we now apply that standard to New
York's proper-cause requirement.

It is undisputed that petitioners Koch and Nash--two ordinary, law-abiding, adult citizens--are part of "the
people" whom the Second Amendment protects. See Heller, at 580. Nor does any party dispute that handguns
are weapons "in common use" today for self-defense. See id., at 627; see also Caetano, at 411-412. We therefore
turn to whether the plain text of the Second Amendment protects Koch's and Nash's proposed course of con-
duct--carrying handguns publicly for self-defense.

We have little difficulty concluding that it does ... Nothing in the Second Amendment's text draws a home/
public distinction with respect to the right to keep and bear arms. As we explained in Heller, the "textual ele-
638 | A STANDARD EMERGES

ments" of the Second Amendment's operative clause-- "the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall
not be infringed"--"guarantee the individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation." at
592. Heller further confirmed that the right to "bear arms" refers to the right to "wear, bear, or carry ... upon the
person or in the clothing or in a pocket, for the purpose ... of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive
action in a case of conflict with another person." Id., at 584 ... This definition of "bear" naturally encompasses
public carry ... To confine the right to "bear" arms to the home would nullify half of the Second Amendment's
operative protections.

Moreover, confining the right to "bear" arms to the home would make little sense given that self-defense is "the
central component of the [Second Amendment] right itself." Heller, at 599; see also McDonald, at 767. After
all, the Second Amendment guarantees an "in- dividual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confronta-
tion," Heller, at 592, and confrontation can surely take place outside the home ...

The Second Amendment's plain text thus presumptively guarantees petitioners Koch and Nash a right to "bear"
arms in public for self-defense.

Conceding that the Second Amendment guarantees a general right to public carry, contra, Young, 992 F. 3d, at
813, respondents instead claim that the Amendment "permits a State to condition handgun carrying in areas
`frequented by the general public' on a showing of a non- speculative need for armed self-defense in those
areas," Brief for Respondents ... To support that claim, the burden falls on respondents to show that New
York's proper-cause requirement is consistent with this Nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation. Only
if respondents carry that burden can they show that the pre-existing right codified in the Second Amendment,
and made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth, does not protect petitioners' proposed course of con-
duct ...

Throughout modern Anglo-American history, the right to keep and bear arms in public has traditionally been
subject to well-defined restrictions governing the intent for which one could carry arms, the manner of carry,
or the exceptional circumstances under which one could not carry arms. But apart from a handful of late-19th-
century jurisdictions, the historical record compiled by respondents does not demonstrate a tradition of broadly
prohibiting the public carry of commonly used firearms for self-defense. Nor is there any such historical tradi-
tion limiting public carry only to those law-abiding citizens who demonstrate a special need for self-defense. We
conclude that respondents have failed to meet their burden to identify an American tradition justifying New
York's proper- cause requirement. Under Heller's text-and-history standard, the proper-cause requirement is
therefore unconstitutional ...

We interpret the English history that respondents and the United States muster in light of these interpretive
principles. We find that history ambiguous at best and see little reason to think that the Framers would have
thought it applicable in the New World. It is not sufficiently probative to defend New York's proper-cause
requirement ...

At the very least, we cannot conclude from this historical record that, by the time of the founding, English law
would have justified restricting the right to publicly bear arms suited for self-defense only to those who demon-
strate some special need for self-protection.
                                                                                                                 A STANDARD EMERGES | 639

Respondents next point us to the history of the Colonies and early Republic, but there is little evidence of an
early American practice of regulating public carry by the general public. This should come as no surprise--Eng-
lish subjects founded the Colonies at about the time England had itself begun to eliminate restrictions on the
ownership and use of handguns ...

Regardless, even if respondents' reading of these colonial statutes were correct, it would still do little to support
restrictions on the public carry of handguns today. At most, respondents can show that colonial legislatures
sometimes prohibited the carrying of "dangerous and unusual weapons"--a fact we already acknowledged in
Heller. Drawing from this historical tradition, we explained there that the Second Amendment protects only the
carrying of weapons that are those "in common use at the time," as opposed to those that "are highly unusual in
society at large." Ibid ... Thus, even if these colonial laws prohibited the carrying of handguns because they were
considered "dangerous and unusual weapons" in the 1690s, they provide no justification for laws restricting the
public carry of weapons that are unquestionably in common use today ... Thus, all told, in the century leading
up to the Second Amendment and in the first decade after its adoption, there is no historical basis for conclud-
ing that the pre-existing right enshrined in the Second Amendment permitted broad prohibitions on all forms
of public carry ...

Only after the ratification of the Second Amendment in 1791 did public-carry restrictions proliferate. Respon-
dents rely heavily on these restrictions, which generally fell into three categories: common-law offenses, statutory
prohibitions, and "surety" statutes. None of these restrictions im- posed a substantial burden on public carry
analogous to the burden created by New York's restrictive licensing regime. Common-Law Offenses ...

To summarize: The historical evidence from antebellum America does demonstrate that the manner of public
carry was subject to reasonable regulation. Under the common law, individuals could not carry deadly weapons
in a manner likely to terrorize others. Similarly, although surety statutes did not directly restrict public carry,
they did pro- vide financial incentives for responsible arms carrying. Finally, States could lawfully eliminate one
kind of public carry--concealed carry--so long as they left open the option to carry openly.

None of these historical limitations on the right to bear arms approach New York's proper-cause requirement
be- cause none operated to prevent law-abiding citizens with ordinary self-defense needs from carrying arms in
public for that purpose ...

Evidence from around the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment also fails to support respondents' position
...

In the end, while we recognize the support that postbellum Texas provides for respondents' view, we will not
give disproportionate weight to a single state statute and a pair of state-court decisions. As in Heller, we will not
"stake our interpretation of the Second Amendment upon a single law, in effect in a single [State], that contra-
dicts the overwhelming weight of other evidence regarding the right to keep and bear arms for defense" in pub-
lic. At 632.
640 | A STANDARD EMERGES

Finally, respondents point to the slight uptick in gun regulation during the late-19th century--principally in
the Western Territories. As we suggested in Heller, however, late-19th-century evidence cannot provide much
insight into the meaning of the Second Amendment when it contradicts earlier evidence. See id., at 614 ...

At the end of this long journey through the Anglo-American history of public carry, we conclude that respon-
dents have not met their burden to identify an American tradition justifying the State's proper-cause require-
ment. The Second Amendment guaranteed to "all Americans" the right to bear commonly used arms in public
subject to certain reasonable, well-defined restrictions. Heller. Those restrictions, for example, limited the intent
for which one could carry arms, the manner by which one carried arms, or the exceptional circumstances under
which one could not carry arms, such as before justices of the peace and other government officials. Apart from a
few late-19th- century outlier jurisdictions, American governments simply have not broadly prohibited the pub-
lic carry of commonly used firearms for personal defense. Nor, subject to a few late-in-time outliers, have Amer-
ican governments required law-abiding, responsible citizens to "demonstrate a special need for self-protection
distinguishable from that of the general community" in order to carry arms in public. Klenosky.

The constitutional right to bear arms in public for self- defense is not "a second-class right, subject to an entirely
different body of rules than the other Bill of Rights guarantees." McDonald, at 780. We know of no other con-
stitutional right that an individual may exercise only after demonstrating to government officers some special
need. That is not how the First Amendment works when it comes to unpopular speech or the free exercise of reli-
gion. It is not how the Sixth Amendment works when it comes to a defendant's right to confront the witnesses
against him. And it is not how the Second Amendment works when it comes to public carry for self-defense.

New York's proper-cause requirement violates the Fourteenth Amendment in that it prevents law-abiding citi-
zens with ordinary self-defense needs from exercising their right to keep and bear arms. We therefore reverse the
judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

In 2020, 45,222 Americans were killed by firearms. See Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Fast
Facts: Firearm Violence Prevention (last updated May 4, 2022) (CDC, Fast Facts), https://www.cdc.gov/vio-
lenceprevention/ firearms/fastfact.html. Since the start of this year (2022), there have been 277 reported mass
shootings--an average of more than one per day. See Gun Violence Archive (last visited June 20, 2022),
https://www.gunviolence archive.org. Gun violence has now surpassed motor vehicle crashes as the leading
cause of death among children and adolescents. J. Goldstick, R. Cunningham, & P. Carter, Current Causes of
Death in Children and Adolescents in the United States, 386 New England J. Med. 1955 (May 19, 2022) (Gold-
stick).

Many States have tried to address some of the dangers of gun violence just described by passing laws that limit,
in various ways, who may purchase, carry, or use firearms of different kinds. The Court today severely burdens
States' efforts to do so. It invokes the Second Amendment to strike down a New York law regulating the public
carriage of concealed handguns. In my view, that decision rests upon several serious mistakes ...
                                                                                                                 A STANDARD EMERGES | 641

First, the Court decides this case on the basis of the pleadings, without the benefit of discovery or an evidentiary
record. As a result, it may well rest its decision on a mistaken understanding of how New York's law operates in
practice. Second, the Court wrongly limits its analysis to focus nearly exclusively on history. It refuses to consider
the government interests that justify a challenged gun regulation, regardless of how compelling those interests
may be. The Constitution contains no such limitation, and neither do our precedents. Third, the Court itself
demonstrates the practical problems with its history-only approach. In applying that approach to New York's
law, the Court fails to correctly identify and analyze the relevant historical facts. Only by ignoring an abundance
of historical evidence supporting regulations restricting the public carriage of firearms can the Court conclude
that New York's law is not "consistent with the Nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation." See ante, at
15.

In my view, when courts interpret the Second Amendment, it is constitutionally proper, indeed often necessary,
for them to consider the serious dangers and consequences of gun violence that lead States to regulate firearms.
The Second Circuit has done so and has held that New York's law does not violate the Second Amendment. See
Kachalsky v. County of Westchester (2012). I would affirm that holding. At a minimum, I would not strike down
the law based only on the pleadings, as the Court does today--without first allowing for the development of an
evidentiary record and without considering the State's compelling interest in preventing gun violence. I respect-
fully dissent.

...

How does the Court justify striking down New York's law without first considering how it actually works on
the ground and what purposes it serves? The Court does so by purporting to rely nearly exclusively on history.
It requires "the government [to] affirmatively prove that its firearms regulation is part of the historical tradition
that delimits the outer bounds of `the right to keep and bear arms.'" Ante, at 10. Beyond this historical inquiry,
the Court refuses to employ what it calls "means-end scrutiny." Ibid. That is, it refuses to consider whether New
York has a compelling interest in regulating the concealed carriage of handguns or whether New York's law is
narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. Although I agree that history can often be a useful tool in determining
the meaning and scope of constitutional provisions, I believe the Court's near-exclusive reliance on that single
tool today goes much too far.

The Court concedes that no Court of Appeals has adopted its rigid history-only approach. See ante, at 8. To the
contrary, every Court of Appeals to have addressed the question has agreed on a two-step framework for evalu-
ating whether a firearm regulation is consistent with the Second Amendment. Ibid.; ante, at 10, n. 4 (majority
opinion) (listing cases from the First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh, and
D. C. Circuits) ...

The Court today replaces the Courts of Appeals' consensus framework with its own history-only approach.
That is unusual. We do not normally disrupt settled consensus among the Courts of Appeals, especially not
when that consensus approach has been applied without issue for over a decade. See Brief for Second Amend-
ment Law Professors as Amici Curiae 4, 13-15; see also this Court's Rule 10. The Court attempts to justify
642 | A STANDARD EMERGES

its deviation from our normal practice by claiming that the Courts of Appeals' approach is inconsistent with
Heller. See ante, at 10. In doing so, the Court implies that all 11 Courts of Appeals that have considered this
question misread Heller ...

To the contrary, it is this Court that misreads Heller. The opinion in Heller did focus primarily on "constitu-
tional text and history," ante, at 13 (majority opinion), but it did not "rejec[t] ... means-end scrutiny," as the
Court claims, ante, at 15. Consider what the Heller Court actually said ... The Heller Court concluded that the
Second Amendment's text and history were sufficiently clear to resolve that question: The Second Amendment,
it said, does include such an individual right. Id., at 579-619. There was thus no need for the Court to go fur-
ther--to look beyond text and history, or to suggest what analysis would be appropriate in other cases where the
text and history are not clear.

But the Heller Court did not end its opinion with that preliminary question. After concluding that the Second
Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm for self-defense, the Heller Court added that that
right is "not unlimited." Id., at 626. It thus had to determine whether the District of Columbia's law, which
banned handgun possession in the home, was a permissible regulation of the right. Id., at 628-630. In answering
that second question, it said: "Under any of the standards of scrutiny that we have applied to enumerated consti­
tutional rights, banning from the home `the most preferred firearm in the nation to "keep" and use for protec-
tion of one's home and family' would fail constitutional muster." Id., at 628-629 (emphasis added; footnote
and citation omitted). That language makes clear that the Heller Court understood some form of means-end
scrutiny to apply. It did not need to specify whether that scrutiny should be intermediate or strict because, in its
view, the District's handgun ban was so "severe" that it would have failed either level of scrutiny. Id., at 628-629;
see also id., at 628, n. 27 (clarifying that rational-basis review was not the proper level of scrutiny).

Despite Heller's express invocation of means-end scrutiny, the Court today claims that the majority in Heller
rejected means-end scrutiny because it rejected my dissent in that case. But that argument misreads both my
dissent and the majority opinion. My dissent in Heller proposed directly weighing "the interests protected by
the Second Amendment on one side and the governmental public-safety concerns on the other." Id., at 689. I
would have asked "whether the statute burdens a protected interest in a way or to an extent that is out of pro-
portion to the statute's salutary effects upon other important governmental interests." Id., at 689-690 ...

As Heller's First Amendment example illustrates, the Court today is wrong when it says that its rejection of
means-end scrutiny and near-exclusive focus on history "ac- cords with how we protect other constitutional
rights." Ante, at 15. As the Court points out, we do look to history in the First Amendment context to determine
"whether the expressive conduct falls outside of the category of protected speech." Ibid. But, if conduct falls
within a category of protected speech, we then use means-end scrutiny to deter- mine whether a challenged reg-
ulation unconstitutionally burdens that speech ...

The Court's near-exclusive reliance on history is not only unnecessary, it is deeply impractical. It imposes a task
on the lower courts that judges cannot easily accomplish. Judges understand well how to weigh a law's objectives
(its "ends") against the methods used to achieve those objectives (its "means"). Judges are far less accustomed to
                                                                                                                 A STANDARD EMERGES | 643

resolving difficult historical questions. Courts are, after all, staffed by lawyers, not historians ... The Court's past
experience with historical analysis should serve as a warning against relying exclusively, or nearly exclusively, on
this mode of analysis in the future.

Failing to heed that warning, the Court today does just that. Its near-exclusive reliance on history will pose a
number of practical problems. First, the difficulties attendant to extensive historical analysis will be especially
acute in the lower courts. The Court's historical analysis in this case is over 30 pages long and reviews numerous
original sources from over 600 years of English and American his- tory. Ante, at 30-62. Lower courts--espe-
cially district courts--typically have fewer research resources, less assistance from amici historians, and higher
caseloads than we do. They are therefore ill equipped to conduct the type of searching historical surveys that
the Court's approach requires ... Second, the Court's opinion today compounds these problems, for it gives the
lower courts precious little guidance regarding how to resolve modern constitutional questions based almost
solely on history ... Third, even under ideal conditions, historical evidence will often fail to provide clear
answers to difficult questions ... Fourth, I fear that history will be an especially inadequate tool when it comes to
modern cases presenting mod- ern problems ... This problem is all the more acute when it comes to "modern-
day circumstances that [the Framers] could not have anticipated." Heller, at 721-722 (BREYER, J., dissenting)
...

Although I hope--fervently--that future courts will be able to identify historical analogues supporting the
validity of regulations that address new technologies, I fear that it will often prove difficult to identify analogous
technological and social problems from Medieval England, the founding era, or the time period in which the
Fourteenth Amendment was ratified. Laws addressing repeating crossbows, launcegays, dirks, dagges, skeines,
stilladers, and other ancient weapons will be of little help to courts confronting modern problems. And as tech-
nological progress pushes our society ever further beyond the bounds of the Framers' imaginations, attempts
at "analogical reasoning" will be- come increasingly tortured. In short, a standard that relies solely on history is
unjustifiable and unworkable ...

We are bound by Heller insofar as Heller interpreted the Second Amendment to protect an individual right to
possess a firearm for self-defense. But Heller recognized that that right was not without limits and could appro-
priately be subject to government regulation. at 626-627. Heller therefore does not require holding that New
York's law violates the Second Amendment. In so holding, the Court goes beyond Heller.

It bases its decision to strike down New York's law almost exclusively on its application of what it calls historical
"analogical reasoning." Ante, at 19-20. As I have admitted above, I am not a historian, and neither is the Court.
But the history, as it appears to me, seems to establish a robust tradition of regulations restricting the public car-
riage of concealed firearms. To the extent that any uncertainty re- mains between the Court's view of the history
and mine, that uncertainty counsels against relying on history alone. In my view, it is appropriate in such cir-
cumstances to look beyond the history and engage in what the Court calls means-end scrutiny.
644 | A STANDARD EMERGES

Courts must be permitted to consider the State's interest in preventing gun violence, the effectiveness of the con-
tested law in achieving that interest, the degree to which the law burdens the Second Amendment right, and, if
appropriate, any less restrictive alternatives.

The Second Circuit has previously done just that, and it held that New York's law does not violate the Second
Amendment.

    Dissent: Field and Clifford

MR. JUSTICE STRONG delivered the opinion of the court.

The plaintiff in error, a colored man, was indicted for murder in the Circuit Court of Ohio County, in West Vir-
ginia, on the 20th of October, 1874, and upon trial was convicted and sentenced. The record was then `removed
to the Supreme Court of the State, and there the judgment of the Circuit Court was affirmed. The present case
is a writ of error to that court, and it is now, in substance, averred that at the trial in the State court the defen-
dant (now plaintiff in error) was denied rights to which he was entitled under the Constitution and laws of the
United States.

...

In this court, several errors have been assigned, and the controlling questions underlying them all are, first,
whether, by the Constitution and laws of the United States, every citizen of the United States has a right to a trial
of an indictment against him by a jury selected and impaneled without discrimination against his race or color,
because of race or color; and, second, if he has such a right, and is denied its enjoyment by the State in which he
is indicted, may he cause the case to be removed into the Circuit Court of the United States?

It is to be observed that the first of these questions is not whether a colored man, when an indictment has been
preferred against him, has a right to a grand or a petit jury composed in whole or in part of persons of his own
race or color, but it is whether, in the composition or selection of jurors by whom he is to be indicted or tried, all
persons of his race or color may be excluded by law, solely because of their race or color, so that by no possibility
can any colored man sit upon the jury.

The questions are important, for they demand a construction of the recent amendments of the Constitution. If
the defendant has a right to have a jury selected for the trial of his case without discrimination against all persons
of his race or color, because of their race or color, the right, if not created, is protected by those amendments, and
the legislation of Congress under them. The Fourteenth Amendment ordains that `all persons born or natural-
ized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United States and of the State
648 | FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL

wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any laws which shall abridge the privileges or immunities
of citizens of the United States, nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due
process of law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.'

This is one of a series of constitutional provisions having a common purpose; namely, securing to a race recently
emancipated, a race that through many generations had been held in slavery, all the civil rights that the supe-
rior race enjoy. The true spirit and meaning of the amendments, as we said in the Slaughter-House Cases, (1873),
cannot be understood without keeping in view the history of the times when they were adopted, and the gen-
eral objects they plainly sought to accomplish. At the time when they were incorporated into the Constitution,
it required little knowledge of human nature to anticipate that those who had long been regarded as an infe-
rior and subject race would, when suddenly raised to the rank of citizenship, be looked upon with jealousy and
positive dislike, and that State laws might be enacted or enforced to perpetuate the-distinctions that had before
existed. Discriminations against them had been habitual. It was well known that in some States laws making
such discriminations then existed, and others might well be expected. The colored race, as a race, was abject and
ignorant, and in that condition was unfitted to command the respect of those who had superior intelligence.
Their training had left them mere children, and as such they needed the protection which a wise government
extends to those who are unable to protect themselves. They especially needed protection against unfriendly
action in the States where they were resident. It was in view of these considerations the Fourteenth Amendment
was framed and adopted. It was designed to assure to the colored race the enjoyment of all the civil rights that
under the law are enjoyed by white persons, and to give to that race the protection of the general government,
in that enjoyment, whenever it should be denied by the States. It not only gave citizenship and the privileges
of citizenship to persons of color, but it denied to any State the power to withhold from them the equal pro-
tection of the laws, and authorized Congress to enforce its provisions by appropriate legislation. To quote the
language used by us in the Slaughter-House Cases, "No one can fail to be impressed with the one pervading pur-
pose found in all the amendments, lying at the foundation of each, and without which none of them would have
been suggested, we mean the freedom of the slave race, the security and firm establishment of that freedom, and
the protection of the newly made freeman and citizen from the oppressions of those who had formerly exercised
unlimited dominion over them." So again: "The existence of laws in the States where the newly emancipated
negroes resided, which discriminated with gross injustice and hardship against them as a class, was the evil to be
remedied, and by it [the Fourteenth Amendment] such laws were forbidden. If, however, the States did not con-
form their laws to its requirements, then, by the fifth section of the article of amendment, Congress was autho-
rized to enforce it by suitable legislation." ...

If this is the spirit and meaning of the amendment, whether it means more or not, it is to be construed liberally,
to carry out the purposes of its framers. It ordains that no State shall make or enforce any laws which shall
abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States (evidently referring to the newly made citi-
zens, who, being citizens of the United States, are declared to be also citizens of the State in which they reside).
It ordains that no State shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law, or deny
to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. What is this but declaring that the law in
the States shall be the same for the black as for the white; that all persons, whether colored or white, shall stand
equal before the laws of the States, and, in regard to the colored race, for whose protection the amendment was
                                                                                                        FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL | 649

primarily designed, that no discrimination shall be made against them by law because of their color? The words
of the amendment, it is true, are prohibitory, but they contain a necessary implication of a positive immunity, or
right, most valuable to the colored race, the right to exemption from unfriendly legislation against them distinc-
tively as colored, exemption from legal discriminations, implying inferiority in civil society, lessening the security
of their enjoyment of the rights which others enjoy, and discriminations which are steps towards reducing them
to the condition of a subject race ...

The right to a trial by jury is guaranteed to every citizen of West Virginia by the Constitution of that State, and
the constitution of juries is a very essential part of the protection such a mode of trial is intended to secure. The
very idea of a jury is a body of men composed of the peers or equals of the person whose rights it is selected
or summoned to determine; that is, of his neighbors, fellows, associates, persons having the same legal status in
society as that which he holds ...

... it is hard to see why the statute of West Virginia should not be regarded as discriminating against a colored
man when he is put upon trial for an alleged criminal offence against the State. It is not easy to comprehend how
it can be said that while every white man is entitled to a trial by a jury selected from persons of his own race or
color, or, rather, selected without discrimination against his color, and a negro is not, the latter is equally pro-
tected by the law with the former ... We do not say that within the limits from which it is not excluded by the
amendment a State may not prescribe the qualifications of its jurors, and in so doing make discriminations. It
may confine the selection to males, to freeholders, to citizens, to persons within certain ages, or to persons hav-
ing educational qualifications. We do not believe the Fourteenth Amendment was ever intended to prohibit this
...

The Fourteenth Amendment makes no attempt to enumerate the rights it designed to protect. It speaks in gen-
eral terms, and those are as comprehensive as possible. Its language is prohibitory; but every prohibition implies
the existence of rights and immunities, prominent among which is an immunity from inequality of legal protec-
tion, either for life, liberty, or property. Any State action that denies this immunity to a colored man is in conflict
with the Constitution.

Concluding, therefore, that the statute of West Virginia, discriminating in the selection of jurors, as it does,
against negroes because of their color, amounts to a denial of the equal protection of the laws to a colored man
when he is put upon trial for an alleged offence against the State, it remains only to be considered whether the
power of Congress to enforce the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment by appropriate legislation is suffi-
cient to justify the enactment of sect. 641 of the Revised Statutes.

...

There was error, therefore, in proceeding to the trial of the indictment against him after his petition was filed, as
also in overruling his challenge to the array of the jury, and in refusing to quash the panel.

{Herein is the ordinance referenced, which is listed later in the opinion but should probably be here:

      "SEC. 1. It shall be unlawful, from and after the passage of this order, for any person or persons to establish [...]
      a laundry within the corporate limits of the city and county of San Francisco without having first obtained the
      consent of the board of supervisors, except the same be located in a building constructed either of brick or stone.
      SEC. 2. It shall be unlawful for any person to erect, build, or maintain, or cause to be erected, built, or maintained,
      over or upon the roof of any building now erected or which may hereafter be erected within the limits of said city
      and county, any scaffolding without first obtaining the written permission of the board of supervisors, which per-
      mit shall state fully for what purpose said scaffolding is to be erected and used, and such scaffolding shall not be
      used for any other purpose than that designated in such permit.
      SEC. 3. Any person who shall violate any of the provisions of this order shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor,
      and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars, or by imprison-
      ment in the county jail not more than six months, or by both such fine and imprisonment."}

Mr. JUSTICE MATTHEWS delivered the opinion of the court.

In the case of the petitioner, brought here by writ of error to the Supreme Court of California, our jurisdiction
is limited to the question whether the plaintiff in error has been denied a right in violation of the Constitution,
laws, or treaties of the United States ...

That, however, does not preclude this court from putting upon the ordinances of the supervisors of the county
and city of San Francisco an independent construction, for the determination of the question whether the pro-
                                                                                                         FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL | 651

ceedings under these ordinances and in enforcement of them are in conflict with the Constitution and laws of
the United States necessarily involves the meaning of the ordinance, which, for that purpose, we are required to
ascertain and adjudge ...

We are consequently constrained, at the outset, to differ from the Supreme Court of California upon the real
meaning of the ordinances in question. That court considered these ordinances as vesting in the board of super-
visors a not unusual discretion in granting or withholding their assent to the use of wooden buildings as laun-
dries, to be exercised in reference to the circumstances of each case with a view to the protection of the public
against the dangers of fire ...

The ordinance drawn in question in the present case is of a very different character. It does not prescribe a rule
and conditions for the regulation of the use of property for laundry purposes to which all similarly situated may
conform. It allows without restriction the use for such purposes of buildings of brick or stone, but, as to wooden
buildings, constituting nearly all those in previous use, it divides the owners or occupiers into two classes, not
having respect to their personal character and qualifications for the business, nor the situation and nature and
adaptation of the buildings themselves, but merely by an arbitrary line, on one side of which are those who are
permitted to pursue their industry by the mere will and consent of the supervisors, and on the other those from
whom that consent is withheld at their mere will and pleasure. And both classes are alike only in this, that they
are tenants at will, under the supervisors, of their means of living. The ordinance, therefore, also differs from the
not unusual case where discretion is lodged by law in public officers or bodies to grant or withhold licenses to
keep taverns, or places for the sale of spirituous liquors, and the like, when one of the conditions is that the appli-
cant shall be a fit person for the exercise of the privilege, because, in such cases, the fact of fitness is submitted to
the judgment of the officer, and calls for the exercise of a discretion of a judicial nature.

The rights of the petitioners, as affected by the proceedings of which they complain, are not less because they are
aliens and subjects of the Emperor of China ...

The Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution is not confined to the protection of citizens. It says:

      "Nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law; nor deny to any
      person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."

These provisions are universal in their application to all persons within the territorial jurisdiction, without
regard to any differences of race, of color, or of nationality, and the equal protection of the laws is a pledge of the
protection of equal laws ...

The questions we have to consider and decide in these cases, therefore, are to be treated as invoking the rights of
every citizen of the United States equally with those of the strangers and aliens who now invoke the jurisdiction
of the court.

It is contended on the part of the petitioners that the ordinances for violations of which they are severally sen-
tenced to imprisonment are void on their face as being within the prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment,
and, in the alternative, if not so, that they are void by reason of their administration, operating unequally so as to
652 | FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL

punish in the present petitioners what is permitted to others as lawful, without any distinction of circumstances
-- an unjust and illegal discrimination, it is claimed, which, though not made expressly by the ordinances, is
made possible by them.

When we consider the nature and the theory of our institutions of government ... and review the history of their
development, we are constrained to conclude that they do not mean to leave room for the play and action of
purely personal and arbitrary power ... It is ... true that there must always be ... in some person or body, the
authority of final decision, and in many cases of mere administration, the responsibility is purely political, no
appeal lying except to the ultimate tribunal of the public judgment, exercised either in the pressure of opinion or
by means of the suffrage. But the fundamental rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness ... are secured
by those maxims of constitutional law which are the monuments showing the ... blessings of civilization under
the reign of just and equal laws, so that, in the famous language of the Massachusetts Bill of Rights, the govern-
ment of the commonwealth "may be a government of laws, and not of men." For the very idea that one man may
be compelled to hold ... any material right essential to the enjoyment of life at the mere will of another seems to
be intolerable in any country where freedom prevails ...

...

This conclusion, and the reasoning on which it is based, are deductions from the face of the ordinance, as to its
necessary tendency and ultimate actual operation. In the present cases, we are not obliged to reason from the
probable to the actual ... of unequal and unjust discrimination in their administration. For the cases present the
ordinances in actual operation, and the facts shown establish an administration directed so exclusively against a
particular class of persons as to warrant and require the conclusion that, whatever may have been the intent of
the ordinances as adopted, they are applied by the public authorities charged with their administration ... with
a mind so unequal and oppressive as to amount to a practical denial by the State of that equal protection of the
laws which is secured to the petitioners ...

... It appears that both petitioners have complied with every requisite deemed by the law or by the public officers
charged with its administration necessary for the protection of neighboring property from fire or as a precau-
tion against injury to the public health. No reason whatever, except the will of the supervisors, is assigned why
they should not be permitted to carry on, in ... their harmless and useful occupation, on which they depend
for a livelihood. And while this consent of the supervisors is withheld from them and from two hundred others
who have also petitioned, all of whom happen to be Chinese subjects, eighty others, not Chinese subjects, are
permitted to carry on the same business under similar conditions. The fact of this discrimination is admitted.
No reason for it is shown, and the conclusion cannot be resisted that no reason for it exists except hostility to
the race and nationality to which the petitioners belong, and which, in the eye of the law, is not justified. The
discrimination is, therefore, illegal, and the public administration which enforces it is a denial of the equal pro-
tection of the laws and a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution. The imprisonment of
the petitioners is, therefore, illegal, and they must be discharged. To this end,
§                                                                                                       FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL | 653

The judgment of the Supreme Court of California in the case of Yick Wo, and that of the Circuit Court of the
United States for the District of California in the case of Wo Lee, are severally reversed, and the cases remanded,
each to the proper court, with directions to discharge the petitioners from custody and imprisonment.

Plessy v. Ferguson

163 U.S. 537 (1896)

    Vote: 7-1
    Decision: Affirmed
    Opinion: Brown
    Majority: Brown, joined by Fuller, Field, Gray, Shiras, White, Peckham
    Dissent: Harlan
    Not participating: Brewer

Mr. Justice Brown, after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case turns upon the constitutionality of an act of the General Assembly of the State of Louisiana, passed in
1890, providing for separate railway carriages for the white and colored races.

...

The constitutionality of this act is attacked upon the ground that it conflicts both with the Thirteenth Amend-
ment of the Constitution, abolishing slavery, and the Fourteenth Amendment, which prohibits certain restric-
tive legislation on the part of the States.

That it does not conflict with the Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery and involuntary servitude,
except as a punishment for crime, is too clear for argument. Slavery implies involuntary servitude -a state of
bondage; the ownership of mankind as a chattel, or at least the control of the labor and services of one man for
the benefit of another, and the absence of a legal right to the disposal of his own person, property and services.
..it was said [in the Civil Rights Cases] that the act of a mere individual, the owner of an inn, a public conveyance
or place of amusement, refusing accommodations to colored people cannot be justly regarded as imposing any
badge of slavery or servitude upon the applicant, but only as involving an ordinary civil injury ...

A statute which implies merely a legal distinction between the white and colored races -a distinction which is
founded in the color of the two races and which must always exist so long as white men are distinguished from
the other race by color- has no tendency to destroy the legal equality of the two races, or reestablish a state of
involuntary servitude. Indeed, we do not understand that the Thirteenth Amendment is strenuously relied upon
by the plaintiff in error in this connection.
654 | FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL

By the Fourteenth Amendment, all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the juris-
diction thereof are made citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside, and the States are
forbidden from making or enforcing any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the
United States, or shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, or deny to any
person within their jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.

The object of the amendment was undoubtedly to enforce the absolute equality of the two races before the law,
but, in the nature of things, it could not have been intended to abolish distinctions based upon color. Laws
permitting, and even requiring, their separation in places where they are liable to be brought into contact do
not necessarily imply the inferiority of either race to the other, and have been generally, if not universally, recog-
nized as within the competency of the state legislatures in the exercise of their police power. The most common
instance of this is connected with the establishment of separate schools for white and colored children, which
has been held to be a valid exercise of the legislative power even by courts of States where the political rights of
the colored race have been longest and most earnestly enforced.

The distinction between laws interfering with the political equality of the negro and those requiring the separa-
tion of the two races in schools, theatres and railway carriages has been frequently drawn by this court ...

So far, then, as a conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment is concerned, the case reduces itself to the question
whether the statute of Louisiana is a reasonable regulation, and, with respect to this, there must necessarily be
a large discretion on the part of the legislature. In determining the question of reasonableness, it is at liberty to
act with reference to the established usages, customs, and traditions of the people, and with a view to the pro-
motion of their comfort and the preservation of the public peace and good order. Gauged by this standard, we
cannot say that a law which authorizes or even requires the separation of the two races in public conveyances is
unreasonable, or more obnoxious to the Fourteenth Amendment than the acts of Congress requiring separate
schools for colored children in the District of Columbia, the constitutionality of which does not seem to have
been questioned, or the corresponding acts of state legislatures.

We consider the underlying fallacy of the plaintiff's argument to consist in the assumption that the enforced
separation of the two races stamps the colored race with a badge of inferiority. If this be so, it is not by reason
of anything found in the act, but solely because the colored race chooses to put that construction upon it. The
argument necessarily assumes that if, as has been more than once the case and is not unlikely to be so again, the
colored race should become the dominant power in the state legislature, and should enact a law in precisely simi-
lar terms, it would thereby relegate the white race to an inferior position. We imagine that the white race, at least,
would not acquiesce in this assumption. The argument also assumes that social prejudices may be overcome by
legislation, and that equal rights cannot be secured to the negro except by an enforced commingling of the two
races. We cannot accept this proposition. If the two races are to meet upon terms of social equality, it must be the
result of natural affinities, a mutual appreciation of each other's merits, and a voluntary consent of individuals.
                                                                                                        FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL | 655

Legislation is powerless to eradicate racial instincts or to abolish distinctions based upon physical differences,
and the attempt to do so can only result in accentuating the difficulties of the present situation. If the civil and
political rights of both races be equal, one cannot be inferior to the other civilly or politically. If one race be infe-
rior to the other socially, the Constitution of the United States cannot put them upon the same plane.

The judgment of the court below is, therefore,

Affirmed.

Mr. Justice Harlan, dissenting.

By the Louisiana statute the validity of which is here involved, all railway companies (other than street railroad
companies) carrying passengers in that State are required to have separate but equal accommodations for white
and colored persons

"by providing two or more passenger coaches for each passenger train, or by dividing the passenger coaches by a
partition so as to secure separate accommodations."

Under this statute, no colored person is permitted to occupy a seat in a coach assigned to white persons, nor any
white person to occupy a seat in a coach assigned to colored persons ... If a passenger insists upon going into a
coach or compartment not set apart for persons of his race, he is subject to be fined or to be imprisoned in the
parish jail. Penalties are prescribed for the refusal or neglect of the officers, directors, conductors and employees
of railroad companies to comply with the provisions of the act.

...

Thus, the State regulates the use of a public highway by citizens of the United States solely upon the basis of
race.

However apparent the injustice of such legislation may be, we have only to consider whether it is consistent with
the Constitution of the United States.

...

Indeed, such legislation as that here in question is inconsistent not only with that equality of rights which per-
tains to citizenship, National and State, but with the personal liberty enjoyed by everyone within the United
States.

...

The Thirteenth Amendment does not permit the withholding or the deprivation of any right necessarily inher-
ing in freedom. It not only struck down the institution of slavery as previously existing in the United States, but
it prevents the imposition of any burdens or disabilities that constitute badges of slavery or servitude. It decreed
universal civil freedom in this country. This court has so adjudged. But that amendment having been found
656 | FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL

inadequate to the protection of the rights of those who had been in slavery, it was followed by the Fourteenth
Amendment, which added greatly to the dignity and glory of American citizenship and to the security of per-
sonal liberty ...

These two amendments, if enforced according to their true intent and meaning, will protect all the civil rights
that pertain to freedom and citizenship ...

These notable additions to the fundamental law were welcomed by the friends of liberty throughout the world.
They removed the race line from our governmental systems. They had, as this court has said, a common pur-
pose, namely to secure to a race recently emancipated, a race that through many generations have been held in
slavery, all the civil rights that the superior race enjoy.

It was said in argument that the statute of Louisiana does not discriminate against either race, but prescribes
a rule applicable alike to white and colored citizens. But this argument does not meet the difficulty. Everyone
knows that the statute in question had its origin in the purpose not so much to exclude white persons from rail-
road cars occupied by blacks as to exclude colored people from coaches occupied by or assigned to white persons.
The thing to accomplish was, under the guise of giving equal accommodation for whites and blacks, to compel
the latter to keep to themselves while traveling in railroad passenger coaches. No one would be so wanting in
candor a to assert the contrary. If a white man and a black man choose to occupy the same public conveyance on
a public highway, it is their right to do so, and no government, proceeding alone on grounds of race, can prevent
it without infringing the personal liberty of each.

It is one thing for railroad carriers to furnish, or to be required by law to furnish, equal accommodations for
all whom they are under a legal duty to carry. It is quite another thing for government to forbid citizens of the
white and black races from traveling in the same public conveyance, and to punish officers of railroad companies
for permitting persons of the two races to occupy the same passenger coach. If a State can prescribe, as a rule of
civil conduct, that whites and blacks shall not travel as passengers in the same railroad coach, why may it not so
regulate the use of the streets of its cities and towns as to compel white citizens to keep on one side of a street
and black citizens to keep on the other? Why may it not, upon like grounds, punish whites and blacks who ride
together in streetcars or in open vehicles on a public road or street? [...] if this statute of Louisiana is consistent
with the personal liberty of citizens, why may not the State require the separation in railroad coaches of native
and naturalized citizens of the United States, or of Protestants and Roman Catholics?

...

The white race deems itself to be the dominant race in this country. And so it is in prestige, in achievements,
in education, in wealth and in power. So, I doubt not, it will continue to be for all time if it remains true to its
great heritage and holds fast to the principles of constitutional liberty. But in view of the Constitution, in the
eye of the law, there is in this country no superior, dominant, ruling class of citizens. There is no caste here. Our
Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens. In respect of civil rights, all
citizens are equal before the law. The humblest is the peer of the most powerful. The law regards man as man,
and takes no account of his surroundings or of his color when his civil rights as guaranteed by the supreme law
                                                                                                        FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL | 657

of the land are involved. It is therefore to be regretted that this high tribunal, the final expositor of the funda-
mental law of the land, has reached the conclusion that it is competent for a State to regulate the enjoyment by
citizens of their civil rights solely upon the basis of race.

...

The arbitrary separation of citizens on the basis of race while they are on a public highway is a badge of servitude
wholly inconsistent with the civil freedom and the equality before the law established by the Constitution. It
cannot be justified upon any legal grounds.

If evils will result from the commingling of the two races upon public highways established for the benefit of all,
they will be infinitely less than those that will surely come from state legislation regulating the enjoyment of civil
rights upon the basis of race. We boast of the freedom enjoyed by our people above all other peoples. But it is
difficult to reconcile that boast with a state of the law which, practically, puts the brand of servitude and degra-
dation upon a large class of our fellow citizens, our equals before the law. The thin disguise of "equal" accom-
modations for passengers in railroad coaches will not mislead anyone, nor atone for the wrong this day done.

I am of opinion that the statute of Louisiana is inconsistent with the personal liberty of citizens, white and black,
in that State, and hostile to both the spirit and letter of the Constitution of the United States. If laws of like
character should be enacted in the several States of the Union, the effect would be in the highest degree mischie-
vous. Slavery, as an institution tolerated by law would, it is true, have disappeared from our country, but there
would remain a power in the States, by sinister legislation, to interfere with the full enjoyment of the blessings
of freedom to regulate civil rights, common to all citizens, upon the basis of race, and to place in a condition of
legal inferiority a large body of American citizens now constituting a part of the political community called the
People of the United States, for whom and by whom, through representatives, our government is administered.
Such a system is inconsistent with the guarantee given by the Constitution to each State of a republican form
of government, and may be stricken down by Congressional action, or by the courts in the discharge of their
solemn duty to maintain the supreme law of the land, anything in the constitution or laws of any State to the
contrary notwithstanding.

For the reasons stated, I am constrained to withhold my assent from the opinion and judgment of the majority.

Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada

305 U.S. 337 (1938)

    Vote: 6-2
    Decision: Reversed
    Majority: Hughes, joined by Brandeis, Stone, Roberts, Black, and Reed
    Dissent: McReynolds, joined by Butler

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.

Petitioner Lloyd Gaines, a negro, was refused admission to the School of Law at the State University of Missouri.
Asserting that this refusal constituted a denial by the State of the equal protection of the laws in violation of the
Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution ... We granted certiorari, October 10, 1938.

Petitioner is a citizen of Missouri. In August, 1935, he was graduated with the degree of Bachelor of Arts at the
Lincoln University, an institution maintained by the State of Missouri for the higher education of negroes. That
University has no law school. Upon the filing of his application for admission to the law school of the University
of Missouri, the registrar advised him to communicate with the president of Lincoln University, and the latter
directed petitioner's attention to § 9622 of the Revised Statutes of Missouri (1929), providing as follows:

      "Sec. 9622. [...]. -- Pending the full development of the Lincoln university, the board of curators shall have the
      authority to arrange for the attendance of negro residents of the state of Missouri at the university of any adjacent
      state to take any course or to study any subjects provided for at the state university of Missouri, and which are not
      taught at the Lincoln university and to pay the reasonable tuition fees for such attendance; provided that, when-
      ever the board of curators deem it advisable, they shall have the power to open any necessary school or department.
      (Laws 1921, p. 86, § 7.)"

[...] It was admitted on the trial that petitioner's

      "work and credits at the Lincoln University would qualify him for admission to the School of Law of the Univer-
      sity of Missouri if he were found otherwise eligible."

He was refused admission upon the ground that it was "contrary to the constitution, laws and public policy of
the State to admit a negro as a student in the University of Missouri." It appears that there are schools of law in
connection with the state universities of four adjacent States, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa and Illinois, where non-
resident negroes are admitted.

The clear and definite conclusions of the state court in construing the pertinent state legislation narrow the
issue. The action of the curators ... must be regarded as state action.

While there is no express constitutional provision requiring that the white and negro races be separated for the
purpose of higher education, the state court ... held that it was intended to separate the white and negro races for
that purpose also. Referring in particular to Lincoln University, the court deemed it to be clear
                                                                                                        FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL | 659

      "that the Legislature intended to bring the Lincoln University up to the standard of the University of Missouri,
      and give to the whites and negroes an equal opportunity for higher education -- the whites at the University of
      Missouri, and the negroes at Lincoln University."

Further, the court concluded that the provisions of § 9622 to the effect that negro residents "may attend the uni-
versity of any adjacent State with their tuition paid, pending the full development of Lincoln University," made
it evident "that the Legislature did not intend that negroes and whites should attend the same university in this
State." In that view, it necessarily followed that the curators of the University of Missouri acted in accordance
with the policy of the State in denying petitioner admission to its School of Law upon the sole ground of his
race.

In answering petitioner's contention that this discrimination constituted a denial of his constitutional right, the
state court has fully recognized the obligation of the State to provide negroes with advantages for higher educa-
tion substantially equal to the advantages afforded to white students. The State has sought to fulfill that obliga-
tion by furnishing equal facilities in separate schools ...

... It is said that Missouri ... is the only State in the Union which has established a separate university for negroes
on the same basis as the state university for white students. But, commendable as is that action, the fact remains
that instruction in law for negroes is not now afforded by the State, either at Lincoln University or elsewhere
within the State, and that the State excludes negroes from the advantages of the law school it has established at
the University of Missouri.

It is manifest that this discrimination ... would constitute a denial of equal protection ...

The Supreme Court of Missouri in the instant case has distinguished ... (1) that, in Missouri ... there is "a legisla-
tive declaration of a purpose to establish a law school for negroes at Lincoln University whenever necessary or
practical", and (2) that,

      "pending the establishment of such a school, adequate provision has been made for the legal education of negro
      students in recognized schools outside of this State."

As to the first ground, it appears that the policy of establishing a law school at Lincoln University has not yet
ripened into an actual establishment, and it cannot be said that a mere declaration of purpose, still unfulfilled, is
enough ...

... In the light of its ruling, we must regard the question whether the provision for the legal education in other
States of negroes resident in Missouri is sufficient to satisfy the constitutional requirement of equal protection
as the pivot upon which this case turns.

The state court stresses the advantages that are afforded by the law schools of the adjacent States -- Kansas,
Nebraska, Iowa and Illinois -- which admit nonresident negroes. The court considered that these were schools
of high standing where one desiring to practice law in Missouri can get "as sound, comprehensive, valuable legal
education" as in the University of Missouri [...].

[...]
§660 | FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL

We think that these matters are beside the point. The basic consideration is not as to what sort of opportunities
other States provide, or whether they are as good as those in Missouri, but as to what opportunities Missouri
itself furnishes to white students and denies to negroes solely upon the ground of color ... The question here is
not of a duty of the State to supply legal training, or of the quality of the training which it does supply, but of
its duty when it provides such training to furnish it to the residents of the State upon the basis of an equality
of right. By the operation of the laws of Missouri, a privilege has been created for white law students which is
denied to negroes by reason of their race. The white resident is afforded legal education within the State; the
negro resident having the same qualifications is refused it there, and must go outside the State to obtain it. That
is a denial of the equality of legal right to the enjoyment of the privilege which the State has set up, and the pro-
vision for the payment of tuition fees in another State does not remove the discrimination.

... Manifestly, the obligation of the State to give the protection of equal laws can be performed only where its
laws operate, that is, within its own jurisdiction ... It is an obligation the burden of which cannot be cast by one
State upon another, and no State can be excused from performance by what another State may do or fail to do
...

... We must conclude that, in so doing, the court denied the federal right which petitioner set up and the question
as to the correctness of that decision is before us. We are of the opinion that the ruling was error, and that peti-
tioner was entitled to be admitted to the law school of the State University in the absence of other and proper
provision for his legal training within the State.

The judgment of the Supreme Court of Missouri is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings
not inconsistent with this opinion.

Reversed.

Mr. Chief Justice Vinson delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case and McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents (1950), present different aspects of this general question: to
what extent does the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment limit the power of a state to dis-
                                                                                                         FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL | 661

tinguish between students of different races in professional and graduate education in a state university? Broader
issues have been urged for our consideration, but we adhere to the principle of deciding constitutional questions
only in the context of the particular case before the Court ...

... Petitioner filed an application for admission to the University of Texas Law School for the February, 1946,
term. His application was rejected solely because he is a Negro. Petitioner thereupon brought this suit for man-
damus against the appropriate school officials, respondents here, to compel his admission. At that time, there
was no law school in Texas which admitted Negroes.

The state trial court recognized that the action of the State in denying petitioner the opportunity to gain a
legal education while granting it to others deprived him of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the
Fourteenth Amendment. The court did not grant the relief requested, however, but continued the case for six
months to allow the State to supply substantially equal facilities. At the expiration of the six months, in Decem-
ber, 1946, the court denied the writ on the showing that the authorized university officials had adopted an order
calling for the opening of a law school for Negroes the following February.

Finding that the new school offered petitioner

"privileges, advantages, and opportunities for the study of law substantially equivalent to those offered by the
State to white students at the University of Texas,"

the trial court denied mandamus. The Court of Civil Appeals affirmed. Petitioner's application for a writ of
error was denied by the Texas Supreme Court. We granted certiorari, because of the manifest importance of the
constitutional issues involved.

The University of Texas Law School, from which petitioner was excluded, was staffed by a faculty of sixteen
full-time and three part-time professors, some of whom are nationally recognized authorities in their field. Its
student body numbered 850. The library contained over 65,000 volumes ... It may properly be considered one
of the nation's ranking law schools.

The law school for Negroes which was to have opened in February, 1947, would have had no independent fac-
ulty or library. The teaching was to be carried on by four members of the University of Texas Law School fac-
ulty, who were to maintain their offices at the University of Texas while teaching at both institutions. Few of
the 10,000 volumes ordered for the library had arrived, nor was there any full-time librarian. The school lacked
accreditation.

... [R]espondents report the opening of a law school at the Texas State University for Negroes. It is apparently on
the road to full accreditation. It has a faculty of five full-time professors; a student body of 23; a library of some
16,500 volumes serviced by a full-time staff; a practice court and legal aid association, and one alumnus who has
become a member of the Texas Bar.

Whether the University of Texas Law School is compared with the original or the new law school for Negroes,
we cannot find substantial equality in the educational opportunities offered white and Negro law students by
the State. In terms of number of the faculty, variety of courses and opportunity for specialization, size of the
662 | FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL

student body, scope of the library, availability of law review and similar activities, the University of Texas Law
School is superior. What is more important, the University of Texas Law School possesses to a far greater degree
those qualities which are incapable of objective measurement but which make for greatness in a law school. Such
qualities, to name but a few, include reputation of the faculty, experience of the administration, position and
influence of the alumni, standing in the community, traditions and prestige. It is difficult to believe that one who
had a free choice between these law schools would consider the question close.

Moreover, although the law is a highly learned profession, we are well aware that it is an intensely practical one
... The law school to which Texas is willing to admit petitioner excludes from its student body members of the
racial groups which number 85% of the population of the State and include most of the lawyers, witnesses,
jurors, judges and other officials with whom petitioner will inevitably be dealing when he becomes a member of
the Texas Bar. With such a substantial and significant segment of society excluded, we cannot conclude that the
education offered petitioner is substantially equal to that which he would receive if admitted to the University
of Texas Law School.

It may be argued that excluding petitioner from that school is no different from excluding white students from
the new law school. This contention overlooks realities. It is unlikely that a member of a group so decisively in
the majority, attending a school with rich traditions and prestige which only a history of consistently maintained
excellence could command, would claim that the opportunities afforded him for legal education were unequal
to those held open to petitioner.

...

In Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada, (1938), the Court, speaking through Chief Justice Hughes, declared that

"petitioner's right was a personal one. It was as an individual that he was entitled to the equal protection of the
laws, and the State was bound to furnish him within its borders facilities for legal education substantially equal
to those which the State there afforded for persons of the white race, whether or not other negroes sought the
same opportunity."

These are the only cases in this Court which present the issue of the constitutional validity of race distinctions
in state supported graduate and professional education.

In accordance with these cases, petitioner may claim his full constitutional right: legal education equivalent to
that offered by the State to students of other races. Such education is not available to him in a separate law
school as offered by the State. We cannot, therefore, agree with respondents that the doctrine of Plessy v. Fergu­
son, (1896), requires affirmance of the judgment below. Nor need we reach petitioner's contention that Plessy
v. Ferguson should be reexamined in the light of contemporary knowledge respecting the purposes of the Four-
teenth Amendment and the effects of racial segregation.

We hold that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that petitioner be admitted

McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents

339 U.S. 637 (1950)

    Vote: 9-0
    Decision: Reversed
    Majority: Vinson, joined by Black, Reed, Frankfurter, Douglas, Jackson, Burton, Clark and Minton

Mr. Chief Justice Vinson delivered the opinion of the Court.

In this case, we are faced with the question whether a state may, after admitting a student to graduate instruction
in its state university, afford him different treatment from other students solely because of his race.

...

Appellant is a Negro citizen of Oklahoma. Possessing a Master's degree, he applied for admission to the Univer-
sity of Oklahoma in order to pursue studies and courses leading to a Doctorate in Education. At that time, his
application was denied, solely because of his race. The school authorities were required to exclude him by the
Oklahoma statutes, 70 Okl.Stat. (1941) §§ 455, 456, 457, which made it a misdemeanor to maintain or operate,
teach or attend a school at which both whites and Negroes are enrolled or taught. Appellant filed a complaint
requesting injunctive relief, alleging that the action of the school authorities and the statutes upon which their
action was based were unconstitutional and deprived him of the equal protection of the laws ... a ... three-judge
District Court held ... that the State had a constitutional duty to provide him with the education he sought ...
further held that to the extent the Oklahoma statutes denied him admission they were unconstitutional and void
...

Following this decision, the Oklahoma legislature amended these statutes to permit the admission of Negroes to
institutions of higher learning attended by white students, in cases where such institutions offered courses not
available in the Negro schools. The amendment provided, however, that, in such cases the program of instruc-
tion "shall be given at such colleges or institutions of higher education upon a segregated basis." ... Appellant was
664 | FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL

thereupon admitted ... he was required to sit apart at a designated desk in an anteroom adjoining the classroom;
to sit at a designated desk on the mezzanine floor of the library, but not to use the desks in the regular reading
room, and to sit at a designated table and to eat at a different time from the other students in the school cafeteria.

...

In the interval between the decision of the court below and the hearing in this Court, the treatment afforded
appellant was altered. For some time, the section of the classroom in which appellant sat was surrounded by a
rail on which there was a sign stating, `Reserved for Colored,' but these have been removed. He is now assigned
to a seat in the classroom in a row specified for colored students; he is assigned to a table in the library on the
main floor, and he is permitted to eat at the same time in the cafeteria as other students, although here again he
is assigned to a special table.

These restrictions were obviously imposed in order to comply, as nearly as could be, with the statutory require-
ments of Oklahoma. But they signify that the State, in administering the facilities it affords for professional and
graduate study, sets McLaurin apart from the other students. The result is that appellant is handicapped in his
pursuit of effective graduate instruction. Such restrictions impair and inhibit his ability to study, to engage in
discussions and exchange views with other students, and, in general, to learn his profession.

...

It may be argued that appellant will be in no better position when these restrictions are removed, for he may still
be set apart by his fellow students. This we think irrelevant. There is a vast difference--a Constitutional differ-
ence--between restrictions imposed by the state which prohibit the intellectual commingling of students, and
the refusal of individuals to commingle where the state presents no such bar ...

We conclude that the conditions under which this appellant is required to receive his education deprive him of
his personal and present right to the equal protection of the laws. See Sweatt v. Painter, ante, p. 339 U. S. 629.
We hold that, under these circumstances, the Fourteenth Amendment precludes differences in treatment by the
state based upon race. Appellant, having been admitted to a state-supported graduate school, must receive the
same treatment at the hands of the state as students of other races. The judgment is

Reversed.

Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka

347 U.S. 483 (1954)

Argued December 9, 1952
Reargued December 8, 1953
Decided May 17, 1954*

    Vote: 9-0
    Decision: Remanded
    Majority: Warren, joined by Black, Reed, Frankfurter, Douglas, Jackson, Clark, Burton and Minton

Mr. Chief Justice Warren delivered the opinion of the Court.

These cases come to us from the States of Kansas, South Carolina, Virginia, and Delaware. They are premised on
different facts and different local conditions, but a common legal question justifies their consideration together
in this consolidated opinion.

In each of the cases, minors of the Negro race, through their legal representatives, seek the aid of the courts in
obtaining admission to the public schools of their community on a nonsegregated basis. In each instance, they
had been denied admission to schools attended by white children under laws requiring or permitting segregation
according to race. In each of the cases other than the Delaware case, a three-judge federal district court denied
relief to the plaintiffs on the so-called "separate but equal" doctrine announced by this Court in Plessy v. Fergson.
Under that doctrine, equality of treatment is accorded when the races are provided substantially equal facilities,
even though these facilities be separate ...

The plaintiffs contend that segregated public schools are not "equal" and cannot be made "equal," and that
hence they are deprived of the equal protection of the laws. Because of the obvious importance of the question
presented, the Court took jurisdiction. Argument was heard in the 1952 Term, and reargument was heard this
Term on certain questions propounded by the Court.

Reargument was largely devoted to the circumstances surrounding the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment
in 1868. It covered exhaustively consideration of the Amendment in Congress, ratification by the states, then-
existing practices in racial segregation, and the views of proponents and opponents of the Amendment. This
discussion and our own investigation convince us that, although these sources cast some light, it is not enough
to resolve the problem with which we are faced. At best, they are inconclusive. The most avid proponents of the
post-War Amendments undoubtedly intended them to remove all legal distinctions among "all persons born or
naturalized in the United States." Their opponents, just as certainly, were antagonistic to both the letter and the
spirit of the Amendments and wished them to have the most limited effect. What others in Congress and the
state legislatures had in mind cannot be determined with any degree of certainty.

...
666 | FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL

In the first cases in this Court construing the Fourteenth Amendment, decided shortly after its adoption, the
Court interpreted it as proscribing all state-imposed discriminations against the Negro race. The doctrine of sep-
arate but equal" did not make its appearance in this Court until 1896 in the case of Plessy v. Ferguson, involving
not education but transportation. American courts have since labored with the doctrine for over half a century.
In this Court, there have been six cases involving the "separate but equal" doctrine in the field of public educa-
tion ... In none of these cases was it necessary to reexamine the doctrine to grant relief to the Negro plaintiff ...

In the instant cases, that question is directly presented. Here, unlike Sweatt v. Painter, there are findings below
that the Negro and white schools involved have been equalized, or are being equalized, with respect to buildings,
curricula, qualifications and salaries of teachers, and other "tangible" factors. Our decision, therefore, cannot
turn on merely a comparison of these tangible factors in the Negro and white schools involved in each of the
cases. We must look instead to the effect of segregation itself on public education.

In approaching this problem, we cannot turn the clock back to 1868, when the Amendment was adopted, or
even to 1896, when Plessy v. Ferguson was written. We must consider public education in the light of its full
development and its present place in American life throughout the Nation. Only in this way can it be deter-
mined if segregation in public schools deprives these plaintiffs of the equal protection of the laws.

Today, education is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments. Compulsory school
attendance laws and the great expenditures for education both demonstrate our recognition of the importance
of education to our democratic society. It is required in the performance of our most basic public responsi-
bilities, even service in the armed forces. It is the very foundation of good citizenship. Today it is a principal
instrument in awakening the child to cultural values, in preparing him for later professional training, and in
helping him to adjust normally to his environment. In these days, it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be
expected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education. Such an opportunity, where the state
has undertaken to provide it, is a right which must be made available to all on equal terms.

We come then to the question presented: does segregation of children in public schools solely on the basis of
race, even though the physical facilities and other "tangible" factors may be equal, deprive the children of the
minority group of equal educational opportunities? We believe that it does.

In Sweatt v. Painter, supra, in finding that a segregated law school for Negroes could not provide them equal
educational opportunities, this Court relied in large part on "those qualities which are incapable of objective
measurement but which make for greatness in a law school." ... Such considerations apply with added force to
children in grade and high schools. To separate them from others of similar age and qualifications solely because
of their race generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and
minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone ... Whatever may have been the extent of psychological knowledge
at the time of Plessy v. Ferguson, this finding is amply supported by modern authority. Any language in Plessy v.
Ferguson contrary to this finding is rejected.

We conclude that, in the field of public education, the doctrine of "separate but equal" has no place. Separate
educational facilities are inherently unequal. Therefore, we hold that the plaintiffs and others similarly situated
§                                                                                                       FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL | 667

for whom the actions have been brought are, by reason of the segregation complained of, deprived of the equal
protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. This disposition makes unnecessary any dis-
cussion whether such segregation also violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Because these are class actions, because of the wide applicability of this decision, and because of the great variety
of local conditions, the formulation of decrees in these cases presents problems of considerable complexity. On
reargument, the consideration of appropriate relief was necessarily subordinated to the primary question -- the
constitutionality of segregation in public education. We have now announced that such segregation is a denial
of the equal protection of the laws.

It is so ordered.

Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka

349 U.S. 294 (1955)

    Vote: 9-0
    Decision: Reversed and remanded
    Majority: Warren, joined by Black, Reed, Frankfurter, Douglas, Jackson, Clark, Burton and Minton

Mr. Chief Justice Warren delivered the opinion of the Court.

[...]

Because these cases arose under different local conditions and their disposition will involve a variety of local
problems, we requested further argument on the question of relief. In view of the nationwide importance of the
decision, we invited the Attorney General of the United States and the Attorneys General of all states requiring
or permitting racial discrimination in public education to present their views on that question.

[...]

Full implementation of these constitutional principles may require solution of varied local school problems.
School authorities have the primary responsibility for elucidating, assessing, and solving these problems; courts
will have to consider whether the action of school authorities constitutes good faith implementation of the gov-
erning constitutional principles. Because of their proximity to local conditions and the possible need for further
hearings, the courts which originally heard these cases can best perform this judicial appraisal. Accordingly, we
believe it appropriate to remand the cases to those courts.

[...]
§668 | FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL

While giving weight to these public and private considerations, the courts will require that the defendants make
a prompt and reasonable start toward full compliance with our May 17, 1954, ruling. [...] the courts may con-
sider problems related to administration, arising from the physical condition of the school plant, the school
transportation system, personnel, revision of school districts and attendance areas into compact units to achieve
a system of determining admission to the public schools on a nonracial basis, and revision of local laws and reg-
ulations which may be necessary in solving the foregoing problems. They will also consider the adequacy of any
plans the defendants may propose to meet these problems and to effectuate a transition to a racially nondiscrim-
inatory school system. During this period of transition, the courts will retain jurisdiction of these cases.

The judgments below, except that, in the Delaware case, are accordingly reversed, and the cases are remanded
to the District Courts to take such proceedings and enter such orders and decrees consistent with this opinion
as are necessary and proper to admit to public schools on a racially nondiscriminatory basis with all deliberate
speed the parties to these cases. The judgment in the Delaware case -- ordering the immediate admission of the
plaintiffs to schools previously attended only by white children -- is affirmed on the basis of the principles stated
in our May 17, 1954, opinion, but the case is remanded to the Supreme Court of Delaware for such further pro-
ceedings as that Court may deem necessary in light of this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Green v. County Sch. Bd. of New Kent County

391 U.S. 430 (1968)

    Vote: 9-0
    Decision: Reversed and remanded
    Majority: Brennan, joined by Warren, Black, Douglas, Harlan II, Stewart, White, Fortas and Marshall

Mr. Chief Justice Brennan delivered the opinion of the Court.

The question for decision is whether, under all the circumstances here, respondent School Board's adoption of
a "freedom of choice" plan which allows a pupil to choose his own public school constitutes adequate compli-
ance with the Board's responsibility "to achieve a system of determining admission to the public schools on a
nonracial basis. ..." Brown v. Board of Education (Brown II).

Petitioners brought this action in March, 1965, seeking injunctive relief against respondent's continued mainte-
nance of an alleged racially segregated school system. New Kent County is a rural county in Eastern Virginia ...
In a memorandum filed May 17, 1966, the District Court found that the
                                                                                                        FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL | 669

      "school system serves approximately 1,300 pupils, of which 740 are Negro and 550 are White. The School Board
      operates one white combined elementary and high school [New Kent], and one Negro combined elementary and
      high school [George W. Watkins]. There are no attendance zones. Each school serves the entire County."

...

The segregated system was initially established and maintained under the compulsion of Virginia constitutional
and statutory provisions mandating racial segregation in public education ... These provisions were held to vio-
late the Federal Constitution in Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, decided with Brown v.
Board of Education (Brown I). The respondent School Board continued the segregated operation of the system
after the Brown decisions, presumably on the authority of several statutes enacted by Virginia in resistance to
those decisions. Some of these statutes were held to be unconstitutional on their face or as applied. One statute,
the Pupil Placement Act, Va.Code § 22-232.1 et seq. (1964), not repealed until 1966, divested local boards of
authority to assign children to particular schools and placed that authority in a State Pupil Placement Board.
Under that Act, children were each year automatically reassigned to the school previously attended unless, upon
their application, the State Board assigned them to another school; students seeking enrollment for the first
time were also assigned at the discretion of the State Board. To September 1964, no Negro pupil had applied
for admission to the New Kent school under this statute and no white pupil had applied for admission to the
Watkins school.

... on August 2, 1965, five months after the suit was brought, respondent School Board, in order to remain eligi-
ble for federal financial aid, adopted a "freedom of choice" plan for desegregating the schools. Under that plan,
each pupil, except those entering the first and eighth grades, may annually choose between the New Kent and
Watkins schools and pupils not making a choice are assigned to the school previously attended; first and eighth
grade pupils must affirmatively choose a school. After the plan was filed the District Court denied petitioners'
prayer for an injunction and granted respondent leave to submit an amendment to the plan with respect to
employment and assignment of teachers and staff on a racially nondiscriminatory basis. The amendment was
duly filed and on June 2, 1966, the District Court approved the "freedom of choice" plan as so amended.

The pattern of separate "white" and "Negro" schools in the New Kent County school system established under
compulsion of state laws is precisely the pattern of segregation to which Brown I and Brown II were particu-
larly addressed, and which Brown I declared unconstitutionally denied Negro school children equal protection
of the laws. Racial identification of the system's schools was complete, extending not just to the composition
of student bodies at the two schools, but to every facet of school operations -- faculty, staff, transportation,
extracurricular activities and facilities. In short, the State, acting through the local school board and school offi-
cials, organized and operated a dual system, part "white" and part "Negro."

It was such dual systems that, 14 years ago, Brown I held unconstitutional, and, a year later, Brown II held must
be abolished; school boards operating such school systems were required by Brown II "to effectuate a transition
to a racially nondiscriminatory school system." It is, of course, true that, for the time immediately after Brown
II, the concern was with making an initial break in a long-established pattern of excluding Negro children from
schools attended by white children. The principal focus was on obtaining for those Negro children courageous
enough to break with tradition a place in the "white" schools. See, e.g., Cooper v. Aaron. Under Brown II, that
670 | FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL

immediate goal was only the first step, however. The transition to a unitary, nonracial system of public education
was and is the ultimate end to be brought about; it was because of the "complexities arising from the transition
to a system of public education freed of racial discrimination" that we provided for "all deliberate speed" in the
implementation of the principles of Brown I.

...

It is against this background that 13 years after Brown II commanded the abolition of dual systems we must mea-
sure the effectiveness of respondent School Board's "freedom of choice" plan to achieve that end. The School
Board contends that it has fully discharged its obligation by adopting a plan by which every student, regardless of
race, may "freely" choose the school he will attend. The Board attempts to cast the issue in its broadest form by
arguing that its "freedom of choice" plan may be faulted only by reading the Fourteenth Amendment as univer-
sally requiring "compulsory integration," a reading it insists the wording of the Amendment will not support.
But that argument ignores the thrust of Brown II. In the light of the command of that case, what is involved here
is the question whether the Board has achieved the "racially nondiscriminatory school system" Brown II held
must be effectuated in order to remedy the established unconstitutional deficiencies of its segregated system. In
the context of the state-imposed segregated pattern of long standing, the fact that, in 1965, the Board opened
the doors of the former "white" school to Negro children and of the "Negro" school to white children merely
begins, not ends, our inquiry whether the Board has taken steps adequate to abolish its dual, segregated sys-
tem. Brown II was a call for the dismantling of well entrenched dual systems tempered by an awareness that com-
plex and multifaceted problems would arise which would require time and flexibility for a successful resolution.

...

In determining whether respondent School Board met that command by adopting its "freedom of choice"
plan, it is relevant that this first step did not come until some 11 years after Brown I was decided and 10 years
after Brown II directed the making of a "prompt and reasonable start." This deliberate perpetuation of the
unconstitutional dual system can only have compounded the harm of such a system ... Moreover, a plan that, at
this late date, fails to provide meaningful assurance of prompt and effective disestablishment of a dual system is
also intolerable.

...

The obligation of the district courts, as it always has been, is to assess the effectiveness of a proposed plan in
achieving desegregation. There is no universal answer to complex problems of desegregation; there is obviously
no one plan that will do the job in every case ... Where the court finds the board to be acting in good faith and the
proposed plan to have real prospects for dismantling the state-imposed dual system "at the earliest practicable
date," then the plan may be said to provide effective relief. Of course, the availability to the board of other more
promising courses of action may indicate a lack of good faith, and, at the least, it places a heavy burden upon the
board to explain its preference for an apparently less effective method. Moreover, whatever plan is adopted will
require evaluation in practice, and the court should retain jurisdiction until it is clear that state-imposed segre-
gation has been completely removed.
                                                                                                         FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL | 671

...

We do not hold that "freedom of choice" can have no place in such a plan. We do not hold that a "freedom of
choice" plan might of itself be unconstitutional, although that argument has been urged upon us. Rather, all we
decide today is that, in desegregating a dual system, a plan utilizing "freedom of choice" is not an end in itself.

The New Kent School Board's "freedom of choice" plan cannot be accepted as a sufficient step to "effectuate a
transition" to a unitary system. In three years of operation, not a single white child has chosen to attend Watkins
school, and, although 115 Negro children enrolled in New Kent school in 1967 (up from 35 in 1965 and 111
in 1966) 85% of the Negro children in the system still attend the all-Negro Watkins school. In other words, the
school system remains a dual system. Rather than further the dismantling of the dual system, the plan has oper-
ated simply to burden children and their parents with a responsibility which Brown II placed squarely on the
School Board. The Board must be required to formulate a new plan and, in light of other courses which appear
open to the Board, such as zoning,] fashion steps which promise realistically to convert promptly to a system
without a "white" school and a "Negro" school, but just schools.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated insofar as it affirmed the District Court, and the case is
remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ.

402 U.S. 1 (1971)

    Vote: 9-0
    Decision: Affirmed
    Majority: Burger, joined by Black, Douglas, Harlan II, Brennan, Stewart, White, Marshall and Blackmun

Mr. Chief Justice Burger delivered the opinion of the Court.

We granted certiorari in this case to review important issues as to the duties of school authorities and the scope
of powers of federal courts under this Court's mandates to eliminate racially separate public schools established
and maintained by state action. Brown v. Board of Education (Brown I).

This case and those argued with it arose in States having a long history of maintaining two sets of schools in a sin-
gle school system deliberately operated to carry out a governmental policy to separate pupils in schools solely on
the basis of race. That was what Brown v. Board of Education was all about ... This Court, in Brown I, appropri-
ately dealt with the large constitutional principles; other federal courts had to grapple with the flinty, intractable
realities of day-to-day implementation of those constitutional commands. Their efforts, of necessity, embraced
a process of "trial and error," and our effort to formulate guidelines must take into account their experience.

The Charlotte-Mecklenburg school system, the 43d largest in the Nation, encompasses the city of Charlotte
and surrounding Mecklenburg County, North Carolina ... As of June, 1969, there were approximately 24,000
Negro students in the system, of whom 21,000 attended schools within the city of Charlotte. Two-thirds of
those 21,000 -- approximately 14,000 Negro students -- attended 21 schools which were either totally Negro
or more than 99% Negro.

The District Court held numerous hearings and received voluminous evidence. In addition to finding certain
actions of the school board to be discriminatory, the court also found that residential patterns in the city and
county resulted in part from federal, state, and local government action other than school board decisions.
School board action based on these patterns, for example, by locating schools in Negro residential areas and fix-
ing the size of the schools to accommodate the needs of immediate neighborhoods, resulted in segregated educa-
tion. These findings were subsequently accepted by the Court of Appeals.

In April, 1969, the District Court ordered the school board to come forward with a plan for both faculty and
student desegregation. Proposed plans were accepted by the court in June and August, 1969, on an interim basis
only, and the board was ordered to file a third plan by November, 1969 ... In December, 1969, the District Court
held that the board's submission was unacceptable and appointed an expert in education administration, Dr.
John Finger, to prepare a desegregation plan. Thereafter in February, 1970, the District Court was presented
with two alternative pupil assignment plans- the finalized "board plan" and the "Finger plan."
                                                                                                        FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL | 673

As finally submitted, the school board plan closed seven schools and reassigned their pupils. It restructured
school attendance zones to achieve greater racial balance but maintained existing grade structures ... The plan
created a single athletic league, eliminated the previously racial basis of the school bus system, provided racially
mixed faculties and administrative staffs, and modified its free-transfer plan into an optional majority-to-minor-
ity transfer system.

...

The board plan with respect to elementary schools relied entirely upon gerrymandering of geographic zones.
More than half of the Negro elementary pupils were left in nine schools that were 86% to 100% Negro; approxi-
mately half of the white elementary pupils were assigned to schools 86% to 100% white.

The Finger Plan. The plan submitted by the court-appointed expert, Dr. Finger, adopted the school board zon-
ing plan for senior high schools with one modification: it required that an additional 300 Negro students be
transported from the Negro residential area of the city to the nearly all-white Independence High School.

...

The Finger plan departed from the board plan chiefly in its handling of the system's 76 elementary schools.
Rather than relying solely upon geographic zoning, Dr. Finger proposed use of zoning, pairing, and grouping
techniques, with the result that student bodies throughout the system would range from 9% to 38% Negro.

[...]

On February 5, 1970, the District Court adopted the board plan, as modified by Dr. Finger, for the junior and
senior high schools. The court rejected the board elementary school plan and adopted the Finger plan as pre-
sented. Implementation was partially stayed by the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit on March 5, and
this Court declined to disturb the Fourth Circuit's order, (1970).

On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's order as to faculty desegregation and the sec-
ondary school plans, but vacated the order respecting elementary schools. [...] The case was remanded to the
District Court for reconsideration and submission of further plans. This Court granted certiorari, 399 U.S. 926,
and directed reinstatement of the District Court's order pending further proceedings in that court.

[...]

After a lengthy evidentiary hearing, the District Court concluded that its own plan (the Finger plan), the minor-
ity plan, and an earlier draft of the Finger plan were all reasonable and acceptable. It directed the board to adopt
one of the three or, in the alternative, to come forward with a new, equally effective plan of its own; the court
ordered that the Finger plan would remain in effect in the event the school board declined to adopt a new plan.
On August 7, the board indicated it would "acquiesce" in the Finger plan, reiterating its view that the plan was
unreasonable. The District Court, by order dated August 7, 1970, directed that the Finger plan remain in effect.
674 | FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL

Nearly 17 years ago, this Court held, in explicit terms, that state-imposed segregation by race in public schools
denies equal protection of the laws. At no time has the Court deviated in the slightest degree from that holding
or its constitutional underpinnings. [...]

Over the 16 years since Brown II, many difficulties were encountered in implementation of the basic constitu-
tional requirement that the State not discriminate between public school children on the basis of their race.
Nothing in our national experience prior to 1955 prepared anyone for dealing with changes and adjustments of
the magnitude and complexity encountered since then. Deliberate resistance of some to the Court's mandates
has impeded the good faith efforts of others to bring school systems into compliance. The detail and nature of
these dilatory tactics have been noted frequently by this Court and other courts.

[...]

The problems encountered by the district courts and courts of appeals make plain that we should now try to
amplify guidelines, however incomplete and imperfect, for the assistance of school authorities and courts. The
failure of local authorities to meet their constitutional obligations aggravated the massive problem of converting
from the state-enforced discrimination of racially separate school systems. [...]

The objective today remains to eliminate from the public schools all vestiges of state-imposed segregation. Segre-
gation was the evil struck down by Brown I as contrary to the equal protection guarantees of the Constitution.
That was the violation sought to be corrected by the remedial measures of Brown II.

[...]

If school authorities fail in their affirmative obligations under these holdings, judicial authority may be invoked.
Once a right and a violation have been shown, the scope of a district court's equitable powers to remedy past
wrongs is broad, for breadth and flexibility are inherent in equitable remedies.

The school authorities argue that the equity powers of federal district courts have been limited by Title IV of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000c. The language and the history of Title IV show that it was enacted
not to limit, but to define, the role of the Federal Government in the implementation of the Brown I decision. ...
The legislative history of Title IV indicates that Congress was concerned that the Act might be read as creating
a right of action under the Fourteenth Amendment in the situation of so-called "de facto segregation," where
racial imbalance exists in the schools but with no showing that this was brought about by discriminatory action
of state authorities. In short, there is nothing in the Act that provides us material assistance in answering the
question of remedy for state-imposed segregation in violation of Brown I. The basis of our decision must be the
prohibition of the Fourteenth Amendment that no State shall "deny to any person within its jurisdiction the
equal protection of the laws."

We turn now to the problem of defining with more particularity the responsibilities of school authorities in
desegregating a state-enforced dual school system in light of the Equal Protection Clause. [...]
                                                                                                        FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL | 675

[...] Independent of student assignment, where it is possible to identify a "white school" or a "Negro school"
simply by reference to the racial composition of teachers and staff, the quality of school buildings and equip-
ment, or the organization of sports activities, a prima facie case of violation of substantive constitutional rights
under the Equal Protection Clause is shown.

When a system has been dual in these respects, the first remedial responsibility of school authorities is to elim-
inate invidious racial distinctions. With respect to such matters as transportation, supporting personnel, and
extracurricular activities, no more than this may be necessary. Similar corrective action must be taken with regard
to the maintenance of buildings and the distribution of equipment. In these areas, normal administrative prac-
tice should produce schools of like quality, facilities, and staffs. Something more must be said, however, as to
faculty assignment and new school construction.

[...]

The construction of new schools and the closing of old ones are two of the most important functions of local
school authorities and also two of the most complex. They must decide questions of location and capacity in
light of population growth, finances, land values, site availability, through an almost endless list of factors to be
considered. The result of this will be a decision which, when combined with one technique or another of stu-
dent assignment, will determine the racial composition of the student body in each school in the system. Over
the long run, the consequences of the choices will be far-reaching. People gravitate toward school facilities, just
as schools are located in response to the needs of people. The location of schools may thus influence the pat-
terns of residential development of a metropolitan area and have important impact on composition of inner-city
neighborhoods.

In the past, choices in this respect have been used as a potent weapon for creating or maintaining a state-seg-
regated school system. In addition to the classic pattern of building schools specifically intended for Negro or
white students, school authorities have sometimes, since Brown, closed schools which appeared likely to become
racially mixed through changes in neighborhood residential patterns. This was sometimes accompanied by
building new schools in the areas of white suburban expansion farthest from Negro population centers in order
to maintain the separation of the races with a minimum departure from the formal principles of "neighborhood
zoning." Such a policy does more than simply influence the short-run composition of the student body of a new
school. It may well promote segregated residential patterns which, when combined with "neighborhood zon-
ing," further lock the school system into the mold of separation of the races. Upon a proper showing, a district
court may consider this in fashioning a remedy.

In ascertaining the existence of legally imposed school segregation, the existence of a pattern of school construc-
tion and abandonment is thus a factor of great weight. In devising remedies where legally imposed segregation
has been established, it is the responsibility of local authorities and district courts to see to it that future school
construction and abandonment are not used and do not serve to perpetuate or reestablish the dual system. When
necessary, district courts should retain jurisdiction to assure that these responsibilities are carried out.

The central issue in this case is that of student assignment, and there are essentially four problem areas:
676 | FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL

(1) to what extent racial balance or racial quotas may be used as an implement in a remedial order to correct a
previously segregated system;

(2) whether every all-Negro and all-white school must be eliminated as an indispensable part of a remedial
process of desegregation;

(3) what the limits are, if any, on the rearrangement of school districts and attendance zones, as a remedial mea-
sure; and

(4) what the limits are, if any, on the use of transportation facilities to correct state-enforced racial school segre-
gation.

(1) Racial Balances or Racial Quotas.

The constant theme and thrust of every holding from Brown I to date is that state-enforced separation of races
in public schools is discrimination that violates the Equal Protection Clause. The remedy commanded was to
dismantle dual school systems.

We are concerned in these cases with the elimination of the discrimination inherent in the dual school systems,
not with myriad factors of human existence which can cause discrimination in a multitude of ways on racial,
religious, or ethnic grounds. The target of the cases from Brown I to the present was the dual school system.
The elimination of racial discrimination in public schools is a large task, and one that should not be retarded
by efforts to achieve broader purposes lying beyond the jurisdiction of school authorities. One vehicle can carry
only a limited amount of baggage. It would not serve the important objective of Brown I to seek to use school
desegregation cases for purposes beyond their scope, although desegregation of schools ultimately will have
impact on other forms of discrimination. We do not reach in this case the question whether a showing that
school segregation is a consequence of other types of state action, without any discriminatory action by the
school authorities, is a constitutional violation requiring remedial action by a school desegregation decree. This
case does not present that question and we therefore do not decide it.

Our objective in dealing with the issues presented by these cases is to see that school authorities exclude no pupil
of a racial minority from any school, directly or indirectly, on account of race; it does not and cannot embrace
all the problems of racial prejudice, even when those problems contribute to disproportionate racial concentra-
tions in some schools.

As the voluminous record in this case shows, the predicate for the District Court's use of the 71%-29% ratio was
twofold: first, its express finding, approved by the Court of Appeals and not challenged here, that a dual school
system had been maintained by the school authorities at least until 1969; second, its finding, also approved by
the Court of Appeals, that the school board had totally defaulted in its acknowledged duty to come forward
with an acceptable plan of its own, notwithstanding the patient efforts of the District Judge who, on at least
three occasions, urged the board to submit plans. [...]

We see therefore that the use made of mathematical ratios was no more than a starting point in the process of
shaping a remedy, rather than an inflexible requirement. From that starting point, the District Court proceeded
                                                                                                        FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL | 677

to frame a decree that was within its discretionary powers, as an equitable remedy for the particular circum-
stances. As we said in Green, a school authority's remedial plan or a district court's remedial decree is to be judged
by its effectiveness. Awareness of the racial composition of the whole school system is likely to be a useful starting
point in shaping a remedy to correct past constitutional violations. In sum, the very limited use made of mathe-
matical ratios was within the equitable remedial discretion of the District Court.

(2) One-race Schools.

The record in this case reveals the familiar phenomenon that, in metropolitan areas, minority groups are often
found concentrated in one part of the city. In some circumstances, certain schools may remain all or largely of
one race until new schools can be provided or neighborhood patterns change. Schools all or predominately of
one race in a district of mixed population will require close scrutiny to determine that school assignments are
not part of state-enforced segregation.

[...] No per se rule can adequately embrace all the difficulties of reconciling the competing interests involved; but,
in a system with a history of segregation, the need for remedial criteria of sufficient specificity to assure a school
authority's compliance with its constitutional duty warrants a presumption against schools that are substantially
disproportionate in their racial composition. Where the school authority's proposed plan for conversion from a
dual to a unitary system contemplates the continued existence of some schools that are all or predominately of
one race, they have the burden of showing that such school assignments are genuinely nondiscriminatory. The
court should scrutinize such schools, and the burden upon the school authorities will be to satisfy the court that
their racial composition is not the result of present or past discriminatory action on their part.

(3) Remedial Altering of Attendance Zones.

[...]

No fixed or even substantially fixed guidelines can be established as to how far a court can go, but it must be rec-
ognized that there are limits. The objective is to dismantle the dual school system. "Racially neutral" assignment
plans proposed by school authorities to a district court may be inadequate; such plans may fail to counteract the
continuing effects of past school segregation resulting from discriminatory location of school sites or distortion
of school size in order to achieve or maintain an artificial racial separation. When school authorities present a
district court with a "loaded game board," affirmative action in the form of remedial altering of attendance zones
is proper to achieve truly nondiscriminatory assignments. In short, an assignment plan is not acceptable simply
because it appears to be neutral.

In this area, we must of necessity rely to a large extent, as this Court has for more than 16 years, on the informed
judgment of the district courts in the first instance and on courts of appeals.

We hold that the pairing and grouping of noncontiguous school zones is a permissible tool, and such action is to
be considered in light of the objectives sought. Judicial steps in shaping such zones going beyond combinations
of contiguous areas should be examined in light of what is said in subdivisions (1), (2), and (3) of this opinion
concerning the objectives to be sought. Maps do not tell the whole story, since noncontiguous school zones may
678 | FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL

be more accessible to each other in terms of the critical travel time, because of traffic patterns and good high-
ways, than schools geographically closer together. Conditions in different localities will vary so widely that no
rigid rules can be laid down to govern all situations.

(4) Transportation of Students.

The scope of permissible transportation of students as an implement of a remedial decree has never been defined
by this Court, and, by the very nature of the problem, it cannot be defined with precision. No rigid guidelines
as to student transportation can be given for application to the infinite variety of problems presented in thou-
sands of situations. Bus transportation has been an integral part of the public education system for years, and
was perhaps the single most important factor in the transition from the one-room schoolhouse to the consoli-
dated school. [...]

Thus, the remedial techniques used in the District Court's order were within that court's power to provide equi-
table relief; implementation of the decree is well within the capacity of the school authority.

The decree provided that the buses used to implement the plan would operate on direct routes. Students would
be picked up at schools near their homes and transported to the schools they were to attend. The trips for ele-
mentary school pupils average about seven miles, and the District Court found that they would take "not over
35 minutes, at the most." This system compares favorably with the transportation plan previously operated in
Charlotte, under which, each day, 23,600 students on all grade levels were transported an average of 15 miles
one way for an average trip requiring over an hour. In these circumstances, we find no basis for holding that the
local school authorities may not be required to employ bus transportation as one tool of school desegregation.
Desegregation plans cannot be limited to the walk-in school.

[...]

An objection to transportation of students may have validity when the time or distance of travel is so great as
to either risk the health of the children or significantly impinge on the educational process. District courts must
weigh the soundness of any transportation plan in light of what is said in subdivisions (1), (2), and (3) above. It
hardly needs stating that the limits on time of travel will vary with many factors, but probably with none more
than the age of the students. The reconciliation of competing values in a desegregation case is, of course, a diffi-
cult task with many sensitive facets, but fundamentally no more so than remedial measures courts of equity have
traditionally employed.

The Court of Appeals, searching for a term to define the equitable remedial power of the district courts, used
the term "reasonableness." [...] On the facts of this case, we are unable to conclude that the order of the District
Court is not reasonable, feasible and workable. [...]

At some point, these school authorities and others like them should have achieved full compliance with this
Court's decision in Brown I. The systems would then be "unitary" in the sense required by our decisions
in Green and Alexander.
§                                                                                                       FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL | 679

It does not follow that the communities served by such systems will remain demographically stable, for, in
a growing, mobile society, few will do so. Neither school authorities nor district courts are constitutionally
required to make year-by-year adjustments of the racial composition of student bodies once the affirmative duty
to desegregate has been accomplished and racial discrimination through official action is eliminated from the sys-
tem. This does not mean that federal courts are without power to deal with future problems; but, in the absence
of a showing that either the school authorities or some other agency of the State has deliberately attempted to fix
or alter demographic patterns to affect the racial composition of the schools, further intervention by a district
court should not be necessary.

For the reasons herein set forth, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed as to those parts in which
it affirmed the judgment of the District Court. The order of the District Court, dated August 7, 1970, is also
affirmed.

It is so ordered.

MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.

This school desegregation case concerns the Denver, Colorado, school system. That system has never been oper-
ated under a constitutional or statutory provision that mandated or permitted racial segregation in public edu-
cation. Rather, the gravamen of this action, brought in June, 1969, in the District Court for the District of
Colorado by parents of Denver schoolchildren, is that respondent School Board alone, by use of various tech-
niques such as the manipulation of student attendance zones, school site selection and a neighborhood school
policy, created or maintained racially or ethnically (or both racially and ethnically) segregated schools through-
out the school district, entitling petitioners to a decree directing desegregation of the entire school district.
680 | FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL

The boundaries of the school district are coterminous with the boundaries of the city and county of Denver.
There were, in 1969, 119 schools with 96,580 pupils in the school system. In early 1969, the respondent School
Board adopted three resolutions ... designed to desegregate the schools in the Park Hill area in the northeast por-
tion of the city. Following an election which produced a Board majority opposed to the resolutions, the resolu-
tions were rescinded and replaced with a voluntary student transfer program. Petitioners then filed this action,
requesting an injunction against the rescission of the resolutions and an order directing that the respondent
School Board desegregate ... The District Court found that, by the construction of a new, relatively small ele-
mentary school, Barrett, in the middle of the Negro community west of Park Hill, by the gerrymandering of
student attendance zones, by the use of so-called "optional zones," and by the excessive use of mobile classroom
units, among other things, the respondent School Board had engaged over almost a decade after 1960 in an
unconstitutional policy of deliberate racial segregation with respect to the Park Hill schools. The court therefore
ordered the Board to desegregate those schools through the implementation of the three rescinded resolutions.

Segregation in Denver schools is not limited, however, to the schools in the Park Hill area ... petitioners pressed
their prayer that the District Court order desegregation of all segregated schools in the city of Denver, particu-
larly the heavily segregated schools in the core city area. But that court concluded that its finding of a purposeful
and systematic program of racial segregation affecting thousands of students in the Park Hill area did not, in
itself, impose on the School Board an affirmative duty to eliminate segregation throughout the school district.
Instead, the court fractionated the district and held that petitioners had to make a fresh showing of de jure seg-
regation in each area of the city for which they sought relief. Moreover, the District Court held that its find-
ing of intentional segregation in Park Hill was not in any sense material to the question of segregative intent in
other areas of the city. Under this restrictive approach, the District Court concluded that petitioners' evidence
of intentionally discriminatory School Board action in areas of the district other than Park Hill was insufficient
...

Nevertheless, the District Court went on to hold that the proofs established that the segregated core city schools
were educationally inferior to the predominantly "white" or "Anglo" schools in other parts of the district ...
Thus, the court held that, under the doctrine of Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), respondent School Board constitu-
tionally "must at a minimum ... offer an equal educational opportunity," 313 F. Supp. at 83, and, therefore,
although all-out desegregation "could not be decreed, ... the only feasible and constitutionally acceptable pro-
gram -- the only program which furnishes anything approaching substantial equality -- is a system of desegre-
gation and integration which provides compensatory education in an integrated environment."

Respondent School Board appealed, and petitioners cross-appealed, to the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Cir-
cuit. That court sustained the District Court's finding that the Board had engaged in an unconstitutional policy
of deliberate racial segregation with respect to the Park Hill schools, and ... As to the core city schools ... reversed
the legal determination of the District Court that those schools were maintained in violation of the Fourteenth
Amendment ...

We granted petitioners' petition for certiorari to review the Court of Appeals' judgment insofar as it reversed
that part of the District Court's Final Decree as pertained to the core city schools.
                                                                                                         FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL | 681

Before turning to the primary question we decide today, a word must be said about the District Court's method
of defining a "segregated" school. Denver is a tri-ethnic, as distinguished from a bi-racial, community. The over-
all racial and ethnic composition of the Denver public schools is 66% Anglo, 14% Negro, and 20% Hispano. The
District Court, in assessing the question of de jure segregation in the core city schools, preliminarily resolved
that Negroes and Hispanos should not be placed in the same category to establish the segregated character of a
school ...

We conclude, however, that the District Court erred in separating Negroes and Hispanos for purposes of defin-
ing a "segregated" school. We have held that Hispanos constitute an identifiable class for purposes of the Four-
teenth Amendment ... This is agreement that, though of different origins, Negroes and Hispanos in Denver
suffer identical discrimination in treatment when compared with the treatment afforded Anglo students. In that
circumstance, we think petitioners are entitled to have schools with a combined predominance of Negroes and
Hispanos included in the category of "segregated" schools.

In our view, the only other question that requires our decision at this time is ... whether the District Court and
the Court of Appeals applied an incorrect legal standard in addressing petitioners' contention that respondent
School Board engaged in an unconstitutional policy of deliberate segregation in the core city schools. Our con-
clusion is that those courts did not apply the correct standard in addressing that contention.

Petitioners apparently concede for the purposes of this case that, in the case of a school system like Denver's,
where no statutory dual system has ever existed, plaintiffs must prove not only that segregated schooling exists
but also that it was brought about or maintained by intentional state action. Petitioners proved that, for almost
a decade after 1960, respondent School Board had engaged in an unconstitutional policy of deliberate racial seg-
regation in the Park Hill schools. ... We have never suggested that plaintiffs in school desegregation cases must
bear the burden of proving the elements of de jure segregation as to each and every school or each and every
student within the school system. Rather, we have held that, where plaintiffs prove that a current condition of
segregated schooling exists within a school district where a dual system was compelled or authorized by statute
at the time of our decision in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) (Brown I), the State automatically assumes an
affirmative duty ... to eliminate from the public schools within their school system "all vestiges of state-imposed
segregation." Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education (1971).

This is not a case, however, where a statutory dual system has ever existed. Nevertheless, where plaintiffs prove
that the school authorities have carried out. a systematic program of segregation affecting a substantial portion
of the students, schools, teachers, and facilities within the school system, it is only common sense to conclude
that there exists a predicate for a finding of the existence of a dual school system ...

In short, common sense dictates the conclusion that racially inspired school board actions have an impact
beyond the particular schools that are the subjects of those actions. This is not to say, of course, that there can
never be a case in which the geographical structure of, or the natural boundaries within, a school district may
have the effect of dividing the district into separate, identifiable and unrelated units. Such a determination is
essentially a question of fact to be resolved by the trial court in the first instance, but such cases must be rare. In
the absence of such a determination, proof of state-imposed segregation in a substantial portion of the district
682 | FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL

will suffice to support a finding by the trial court of the existence of a dual system. Of course, where that finding
is made, as in cases involving statutory dual systems, the school authorities have an affirmative duty "to effectuate
a transition to a racially nondiscriminatory school system." Brown II ...

The District Court proceeded on the premise that the finding as to the Park Hill schools was irrelevant to the
consideration of the rest of the district, and began its examination of the core city schools by requiring that peti-
tioners prove all of the essential elements of de jure segregation -- that is, stated simply, a current condition of
segregation resulting from intentional state action directed specifically to the core city schools. The segregated
character of the core city schools could not be and is not denied. Petitioners' proof showed that, at the time of
trial 22 of the schools in the core city area were less than 30% in Anglo enrollment and 11 of the schools were less
than 10% Anglo. Petitioners also introduced substantial evidence demonstrating the existence of a dispropor-
tionate racial and ethnic composition of faculty and staff at these schools. On the question of segregative intent,
petitioners presented evidence tending to show that the Board, through its actions over a period of years, inten-
tionally created and maintained the segregated character of the core city schools ...

Although petitioners had already proved the existence of intentional school segregation in the Park Hill schools,
this crucial finding was totally ignored when attention turned to the core city schools. Plainly, a finding of inten-
tional segregation as to a portion of a school system is not devoid of probative value in assessing the school
authorities' intent with respect to other parts of the same school system. On the contrary, where, as here, the
case involves one school board, a finding of intentional segregation on its part in one portion of a school system
is highly relevant to the issue of the board's intent with respect to other segregated schools in the system. This is
merely an application of the well-settled evidentiary principle that

"the prior doing of other similar acts, whether clearly a part of a scheme or not, is useful as reducing the possi-
bility that the act in question was done with innocent intent." ...

Applying these principles in the special context of school desegregation cases, we hold that a finding of inten-
tionally segregative school board actions in a meaningful portion of a school system, as in this case, creates a pre-
sumption that other segregated schooling within the system is not adventitious. It establishes, in other words,
a prima facie case of unlawful segregative design on the part of school authorities, and shifts to those authorities
the burden of proving that other segregated schools within the system are not also the result of intentionally seg-
regative actions ...

...

Thus, respondent School Board having been found to have practiced deliberate racial segregation in schools
attended by over one-third of the Negro school population, that crucial finding establishes a prima facie case of
intentional segregation in the core city schools. In such case, respondent's neighborhood school policy is not to
be determinative "simply because it appears to be neutral."

In summary, the District Court on remand, first, will afford respondent School Board the opportunity to prove
its contention that the Park Hill area is a separate, identifiable and unrelated section of the school district that
should be treated as isolated from the rest of the district. If respondent School Board fails to prove that con-
§                                                                                                       FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL | 683

tention, the District Court, second, will determine whether respondent School Board's conduct over almost a
decade after 1960 in carrying out a policy of deliberate racial segregation in the Park Hill schools constitutes the
entire school system a dual school system.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is modified to vacate, instead of reverse, the parts of the Final Decree that
concern the core city schools, and the case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Mr. Chief Justice Burger delivered the opinion of the Court.

We granted certiorari in these consolidated cases to determine whether a federal court may impose a multi-dis-
trict, area-wide remedy to a single-district de jure segregation problem absent any finding that the other included
school district have failed to operate unitary school systems within their districts, absent any claim or finding
that the boundary lines of any affected school district were established with the purpose of fostering racial segre-
gation in public schools, absent any finding that the included districts committed acts which effected segregation
within the other districts, and absent a meaningful opportunity for the included neighboring school districts to
present evidence or be heard on the propriety of a multi-district remedy or on the question of constitutional
violations by those neighboring districts.

...

Ever since Brown v. Board of Education (1954), judicial consideration of school desegregation cases has begun
with the standard:
684 | FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL

"[I]n the field of public education, the doctrine of `separate but equal' has no place. Separate educational facili-
ties are inherently unequal."

This has been reaffirmed time and again as the meaning of the Constitution and the controlling rule of law.

The target of the Brown holding was clear and forthright: the elimination of state-mandated or deliberately
maintained dual school systems with certain schools for Negro pupils and others for white pupils. This duality
and racial segregation were held to violate the Constitution in the cases subsequent to 1954. ...

Proceeding from these basic principles, we first note that, in the District Court, the complainants sought a rem-
edy aimed at the condition alleged to offend the Constitution -- the segregation within the Detroit City School
District.

...

... [H]owever, the District Court abruptly rejected the proposed Detroit-only plans on the ground that,

"while [they] would provide a racial mix more in keeping with the Black-White proportions of the student pop-
ulation [they] would accentuate the racial identifiability of the [Detroit] district as a Black school system, and
would not accomplish desegregation."

...

Viewing the record as a whole, it seems clear that the District Court and the Court of Appeals shifted the pri-
mary focus from a Detroit remedy to the metropolitan area only because of their conclusion that total desegre-
gation of Detroit would not produce the racial balance which they perceived as desirable. Both courts proceeded
on an assumption that the Detroit schools could not be truly desegregated -- in their view of what consti-
tuted desegregation -- unless the racial composition of the student body of each school substantially reflected
the racial composition of the population of the metropolitan area as a whole. The metropolitan area was then
defined as Detroit plus 53 of the outlying school districts. That this was the approach the District Court
expressly and frankly employed is shown by the order which expressed the court's view of the constitutional
standard:

"Within the limitations of reasonable travel time and distance factors, pupil reassignments shall be effected
within the clusters described ... so as to achieve the greatest degree of actual desegregation to the end that, upon
implementation, no school, grade or classroom [will be] substantially disproportionate to the overall pupil racial
composition."

In Swann, which arose in the context of a single independent school district, the Court held:

"If we were to read the holding of the District Court to require, as a matter of substantive constitutional right,
any particular degree of racial balance or mixing, that approach would be disapproved and we would be obliged
to reverse."

402 U.S. at 402 U. S. 24. The clear import of this language from Swann is that desegregation, in the sense of
dismantling a dual school system, does not require any particular racial balance in each "school, grade or class-
room."

Here, the District Court's approach to what constituted "actual desegregation" raises the fundamental question,
not presented in Swann, as to the circumstances in which a federal court may order desegregation relief that
embraces more than a single school district. The court's analytical starting point was its conclusion that school
district lines are no more than arbitrary lines on a map drawn "for political convenience." Boundary lines may be
bridged where there has been a constitutional violation calling for inter-district relief, but the notion that school
district lines may be casually ignored or treated as a mere administrative convenience is contrary to the history of
public education in our country. No single tradition in public education is more deeply rooted than local con-
trol over the operation of schools; local autonomy has long been thought essential both to the maintenance of
community concern and support for public schools and to quality of the educational process ...

... The metropolitan remedy would require, in effect, consolidation of 54 independent school districts histori-
cally administered as separate units into a vast new super school district. Entirely apart from the logistical and
other serious problems attending large-scale transportation of students, the consolidation would give rise to an
array of other problems in financing and operating this new school system ...

... [I]t is obvious from the scope of the inter-district remedy itself that, absent a complete restructuring of the
laws of Michigan relating to school districts, the District Court will become first, a de facto "legislative author-
ity" to resolve these complex questions, and then the "school superintendent" for the entire area. This is a task
which few, if any, judges are qualified to perform and one which would deprive the people of control of schools
through their elected representatives.

... School district lines and the present laws with respect to local control are not sacrosanct, and, if they conflict
with the Fourteenth Amendment, federal courts have a duty to prescribe appropriate remedies. But our prior
holdings have been confined to violations and remedies within a single school district. We therefore turn to
address, for the first time, the validity of a remedy mandating cross-district or inter-district consolidation to rem-
edy a condition of segregation found to exist in only one district.

... With no showing of significant violation by the 53 outlying school districts and no evidence of any inter-dis-
trict violation or effect, the court went beyond the original theory of the case as framed by the pleadings and
mandated a metropolitan area remedy. To approve the remedy ordered by the court would impose on the out-
lying districts, not shown to have committed any constitutional violation, a wholly impermissible remedy based
on a standard not hinted at in Brown I and II or any holding of this Court.

... Brown, supra; Green, supra; Swann, supra; Scotland Neck, supra; and Emporia ... each addressed the issue of
constitutional wrong in terms of an established geographic and administrative school system populated by both
Negro and white children. In such a context, terms such as "unitary" and "dual" systems, and "racially identi-
fiable schools," have meaning, and the necessary federal authority to remedy the constitutional wrong is firmly
established. But the remedy is necessarily designed, as all remedies are, to restore the victims of discriminatory
686 | FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL

conduct to the position they would have occupied in the absence of such conduct. Disparate treatment of white
and Negro students occurred within the Detroit school system, and not elsewhere, and, on this record, the rem-
edy must be limited to that system.

...

... In light of our holding that, absent an inter-district violation, there is no basis for an inter-district remedy ... It
is clear, however, that the District Court, with the approval of the Court of Appeals, has provided an inter-dis-
trict remedy in the face of a record which shows no constitutional violations that would call for equitable relief
except within the city of Detroit. In these circumstances, there was no occasion for the parties to address, or for
the District Court to consider, whether there were racially discriminatory acts for which any of the 53 outlying
districts were responsible and which had direct and significant segregative effect on schools of more than one
district.

We conclude that the relief ordered by the District Court and affirmed by the Court of Appeals was based upon
an erroneous standard and was unsupported by record evidence that acts of the outlying districts effected the
discrimination found to exist in the schools of Detroit.

Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion leading to prompt formulation of a decree directed to eliminating the segregation
found to exist in Detroit city schools, a remedy which has been delayed since 1970.

It is so ordered.

 Pasadena City Bd. of Educ. v. Spangler

      No participation: Stevens

  Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court.

  In 1968, several students in the public schools of Pasadena, Cal., joined by their parents, instituted an action in
  the United States District Court for the Central District of California seeking injunctive relief from allegedly
  unconstitutional segregation of the high schools of the Pasadena Unified School District (PUSD). This action
  named as defendants the Pasadena City Board of Education, which operates the PUSD, and several of its offi-
  cials. Before the defendants had filed an answer, the United States moved to intervene in the case pursuant to
  Title IX ... The District Court granted this motion. Later ... the court granted defendant Board's motion to
  strike those portions of the United States' complaint ... which sought to include in the case other areas of the
  Pasadena public school system: the elementary schools, the junior high schools, and the special schools. This
  ruling was the subject of an interlocutory appeal1 to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ... that court
  reversed the District Court and ordered the United States' demand for systemwide relief reinstated ... No further
  review of this decision was sought.

  Following remand from this decision, the District Court held a trial on the allegations that the Pasadena school
  system was unconstitutionally segregated. On January 23, 1970, the court entered a judgment in which it con-
  cluded that the defendants' educational policies and procedures were violative of the Fourteenth Amendment.
  The court ordered the defendants "enjoined from failing to prepare and adopt a plan to correct racial imbalance
  at all levels in the Pasadena Unified School District." The defendants were further ordered to submit to the Dis-
  trict Court a plan for desegregating the Pasadena schools ... The District Court ordered that

  "[t]he plan shall provide for student assignments in such a manner that, by or before the beginning of the school
  year that commences in September of 1970, there shall be no school in the District, elementary or junior high or
  senior high school, with a majority of any minority students."

  In February, the defendants submitted their proposed plan, the "Pasadena Plan," and on March 10, 1970, the
  District Court approved the plan ... The "Pasadena Plan" was implemented the following September, and the
  Pasadena schools have been under its terms ever since.

688 | FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL

... Petitioners, successors to the original defendants in this action, filed a motion with the District Court seeking
relief from the court's 1970 order. Petitioners sought four changes: to have the judgment modified so as to elim-
inate the requirement that there be "no school in the District, elementary or junior high or senior high school,
with a majority of any minority students"; to have the District Court's injunction dissolved; to have the District
Court terminate its "retained jurisdiction" over the actions of the Board; or, as an alternative, to obtain approval
of petitioners' propose modifications of the "Pasadena Plan."

The District Court held hearings on these motions and, on March 1, 1974, denied them in their entirety ...
Because the case seemed to present issues of importance regarding the extent of a district court's authority in
imposing a plan designed to achieve a unitary school system, we granted certiorari. 423 U.S. 945 (1975). We
vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to that court for further proceedings.

Petitioners requested the District Court to dissolve its injunctive order requiring that there be no school in the
PUSD with a majority of any minority students enrolled. The District Court refused this request, and ordered
the injunction continued ... It was apparently the view of the majority of the Court of Appeals' panel that this
failure to maintain literal compliance with the 1970 injunction indicated that the District Court had not abused
its discretion in refusing to grant so much of petitioner's motion for modification as pertained to this aspect of
the order. We think this view was wrong.

...

All that is now before us are the questions of whether the District Court was correct in denying relief when peti-
tioners, in 1974, sought to modify the "no majority" requirement as then interpreted by the District Court.

The meaning of this requirement, as originally established by the District Court, was apparently unclear even to
the parties. In opposing the petitioners' request for relief in 1974, counsel for the original individual plaintiffs
and counsel for the Government jointly stipulated that they were aware "of no violations of the Pasadena Plan
up to and including the present." These parties were, of course, aware that some of the Pasadena schools had
"slipped out of compliance" with the literal terms of the order.

...

When the District Court's order in this case, as interpreted and applied by that court, is measured against what
this Court said in its intervening decision in Swann v. Board of Education (1971), regarding the scope of the
judicially created relief which might be available to remedy violations of the Fourteenth Amendment, we think
the inconsistency between the two is clear. The District Court's interpretation of the order appears to contem-
plate the "substantive constitutional right [to a] particular degree of racial balance or mixing" which the Court
in Swann expressly disapproved.

The District Court apparently believed it had authority to impose this requirement even though subsequent
changes in the racial mix in the Pasadena schools might be caused by factors for which the defendants could not
be considered responsible ... While the District Court found such a violation in 1970, and while this unappealed
finding afforded a basis for its initial requirement that the defendants prepare a plan to remedy such racial segre-
                                                                                                        FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL | 689

gation, its adoption of the Pasadena Plan in 1970 established a racially neutral system of student assignment in
the PUSD. Having done that, we think that, in enforcing its order so as to require annual readjustment of atten-
dance zones so that there would not be a majority of any minority in any Pasadena public school, the District
Court exceeded its authority.

...

The fact that black student enrollment at 5 out of 32 of the regular Pasadena schools came to exceed 50% during
the 4-year period from 1970 to 1974 apparently resulted from people's randomly moving into, out of, and
around the PUSD area. This quite normal pattern of human migration resulted in some changes in the demo-
graphics of Pasadena's residential patterns, with resultant shifts in the racial makeup of some of the schools. But,
as these shifts were not attributed to any segregative actions on the part of the petitioners, we think this case
comes squarely within the sort of situation foreseen in Swann:

      "It does not follow that the communities served by [unitary] systems will remain demographically stable, for, in a
      growing, mobile society, few will do so. Neither school authorities nor district courts are constitutionally required
      to make year-by-year adjustments of the racial composition of student bodies once the affirmative duty to deseg-
      regate has been accomplished and racial discrimination through official action is eliminated from the system."

...

No one disputes that the initial implementation of this plan accomplished that objective. That being the case,
the District Court was not entitled to require the PUSD to rearrange its attendance zones each year so as to
ensure that the racial mix desired by the court was maintained in perpetuity. For having once implemented a
racially neutral attendance pattern in order to remedy the perceived constitutional violations on the part of the
defendants, the District Court had fully performed its function of providing the appropriate remedy for previ-
ous racially discriminatory attendance patterns.

...

Even had the District Court's decree been unambiguous and clearly understood by the parties to mean what
that court declared it to mean in 1974, the "no majority of any minority" provision would, as we have indicated
previously, be contrary to the intervening decision of this Court in Swann, supra.

...

Petitioners have plainly established that they were entitled to relief from the District Court's injunction insofar
as it required them to alter school attendance zones in response to shifts in demographics within the PUSD. The
order of the District Court which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals equally plainly envisioned the continu-
ation of such a requirement. We do not think petitioners must be satisfied with what may have been the implicit
assumption of the Court of Appeals that the District Court would heed the "disapproval" expressed by each
member of the panel of that court in his opinion. Instead, we think petitioners were entitled on this phase of
the case to a judgment of the Court of Appeals reversing the District Court with respect to its treatment of that
portion of the order.
§690 | FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL

Because the case is to be returned to the Court of Appeals, that court will have an opportunity to reconsider
its decision in light of our observations regarding the appropriate scope of equitable relief in this case. We thus
think it unnecessary for us to consider petitioners' other contentions. ... Accordingly the judgment of the Court
of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this
opinion.

Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.

DeKalb County, Georgia, is a major suburban area of Atlanta. This case involves a court-ordered desegregation
decree for the DeKalb County School System (DCSS) ...

DCSS has been subject to the supervision and jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Northern
District of Georgia since 1969, when it was ordered to dismantle its dual school system. In 1986, petitioners filed
a motion for final dismissal. The District Court ruled that DCSS had not achieved unitary status in all respects
but had done so in student attendance and three other categories. In its order the District Court relinquished
remedial control as to those aspects of the system in which unitary status had been achieved, and retained super-
visory authority only for those aspects of the school system in which the district was not in full compliance.
The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed, holding that a district court should retain full remedial
authority over a school system until it achieves unitary status in six categories at the same time for several years.
We now reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand, holding that a district court is permitted to
withdraw judicial supervision with respect to discrete categories in which the school district has achieved com-
pliance with a court-ordered desegregation plan. A district court need not retain active control over every aspect
of school administration until a school district has demonstrated unitary status in all facets of its system.

...
                                                                                                         FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL | 691

For decades before our decision in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) (Brown I), and our mandate in Brown v.
Board of Education (1955) (Brown II),which ordered school districts to desegregate with "all deliberate speed,"
DCSS was segregated by law. DCSS' initial response to the mandate of Brown II was an all too familiar one.
Interpreting "all deliberate speed" as giving latitude to delay steps to desegregate, DCSS took no positive action
toward desegregation until the 1966-1967 school year, when it did nothing more than adopt a freedom of choice
transfer plan. Some black students chose to attend former de jure white schools, but the plan had no significant
effect on the former de jure black schools.

In 1968, we decided Green v. School Bd. of New Kent County. We held that adoption of a freedom of choice
plan does not, by itself, satisfy a school district's mandatory responsibility to eliminate all vestiges of a dual sys-
tem. Green was a turning point in our law in a further respect. Concerned by more than a decade of inaction,
we stated that" `[t]he time for mere "deliberate speed" has run out."' ... We said that the obligation of school dis-
tricts once segregated by law was to come forward with a plan that "promises realistically to work, and promises
realistically to work now." ... (emphasis in original) ...

Within two months of our ruling in Green, respondents, who are black schoolchildren and their parents, insti-
tuted this class action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. After the suit was
filed, DCSS voluntarily began working with the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to devise a com-
prehensive and final plan of desegregation. The District Court, in June 1969, entered a consent order approv-
ing the proposed plan, which was to be implemented in the 1969-1970 school year. The order abolished the
freedom of choice plan and adopted a neighborhood school attendance plan that had been proposed by DCSS
and accepted by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare subject to a minor modification. Under the
plan all of the former de jure black schools were closed, and their students were reassigned among the remaining
neighborhood schools. The District Court retained jurisdiction.

...

In 1986, petitioners filed a motion for final dismissal of the litigation. They sought a declaration that DCSS had
satisfied its duty to eliminate the dual education system, that is to say a declaration that the school system had
achieved unitary status ... The District Court approached the question whether DCSS had achieved unitary sta-
tus by asking whether DCSS was unitary with respect to each of the factors identified in Green. The court con-
sidered an additional factor that is not named in Green: the quality of education being offered to the white and
black student populations. The District Court found DCSS to be "an innovative school system that has travelled
the often long road to unitary status almost to its end," noting that "the court has continually been impressed
by the successes of the DCSS and its dedication to providing a quality education for all students within that
system." ... It found that DCSS is a unitary system with regard to student assignments, transportation, phys-
ical facilities, and extracurricular activities, and ruled that it would order no further relief in those areas. The
District Court stopped short of dismissing the case, however, because it found that DCSS was not unitary in
every respect. The court said that vestiges of the dual system remain in the areas of teacher and principal assign-
ments, resource allocation, and quality of education. DCSS was ordered to take measures to address the remain-
ing problems.
692 | FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL

...

Both parties appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The Court of Appeals
affirmed the District Court's ultimate conclusion that DCSS has not yet achieved unitary status, but reversed
the District Court's ruling that DCSS has no further duties in the area of student assignment ... held that the
District Court erred by considering the six Green factors as separate categories. The Court of Appeals rejected
the District Court's incremental approach, an approach that has also been adopted by the Court of Appeals for
the First Circuit ... and held that a school system achieves unitary status only after it has satisfied all six factors at
the same time for several years ... We granted certiorari ...

Two principal questions are presented. The first is whether a district court may relinquish its supervision and
control over those aspects of a school system in which there has been compliance with a desegregation decree if
other aspects of the system remain in noncompliance. As we answer this question in the affirmative, the second
question is whether the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the District Court's order providing for incremental
withdrawal of supervision in all the circumstances of this case.

...

We hold that, in the course of supervising desegregation plans, federal courts have the authority to relinquish
supervision and control of school districts in incremental stages, before full compliance has been achieved in
every area of school operations. While retaining jurisdiction over the case, the court may determine that it will
not order further remedies in areas where the school district is in compliance with the decree. That is to say, upon
a finding that a school system subject to a court-supervised desegregation plan is in compliance in some but not
all areas, the court in appropriate cases may return control to the school system in those areas where compliance
has been achieved, limiting further judicial supervision to operations that are not yet in full compliance with the
court decree. In particular, the district court may determine that it will not order further remedies in the area of
student assignments where racial imbalance is not traceable, in a proximate way, to constitutional violations.

We reach now the question whether the Court of Appeals erred in prohibiting the District Court from return-
ing to DCSS partial control over some of its affairs. We decide that the Court of Appeals did err in holding that,
as a matter of law, the District Court had no discretion to permit DCSS to regain control over student assign-
ment, transportation, physical facilities, and extracurricular activities, while retaining court supervision over the
areas of faculty and administrative assignments and the quality of education, where full compliance had not
been demonstrated.

...

As the de jure violation becomes more remote in time and these demographic changes intervene, it becomes less
likely that a current racial imbalance in a school district is a vestige of the prior de jure system ...

To say, as did the Court of Appeals, that a school district must meet all six Green factors before the trial court
can declare the system unitary and relinquish its control over school attendance zones, and to hold further that
§                                                                                                       FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL | 693

racial balancing by all necessary means is required in the interim, is simply to vindicate a legal phrase. The law
is not so formalistic. A proper rule must be based on the necessity to find a feasible remedy that ensures system-
wide compliance with the court decree and that is directed to curing the effects of the specific violation.

...

The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded to the Court of Appeals. It should determine what issues
are open for its further consideration in light of the previous briefs and arguments of the parties and in light of
the principles set forth in this opinion. Thereupon it should order further proceedings as necessary or order an
appropriate remand to the District Court ...

It is so ordered.

Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School
District No. 1

551 U.S. 701 (2007)

    Vote: 5-4
    Decision: Reversed and remanded
    Plurality: Roberts, joined by Scalia, Thomas, and Alito
    Concurrence: Thomas

    Dissent: Stevens
    Dissent: Breyer, joined by Stevens, Ginsburg, and Souter

Chief Justice Roberts announced the judgment of the Court, and delivered the opinion of the Court with
respect to Parts I, II, III-A, and III-C, and an opinion with respect to Parts III-B and IV, in which Justices
Scalia, Thomas, and Alito join.

The school districts in these cases voluntarily adopted student assignment plans that rely upon race to determine
which public schools certain children may attend. The Seattle school district classifies children as white or non-
white; the Jefferson County school district as black or "other." In Seattle, this racial classification is used to
allocate slots in oversubscribed high schools. In Jefferson County, it is used to make certain elementary school
assignments and to rule on transfer requests. In each case, the school district relies upon an individual student's
race in assigning that student to a particular school, so that the racial balance at the school falls within a predeter-
mined range based on the racial composition of the school district as a whole. Parents of students denied assign-
694 | FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL

ment to particular schools under these plans solely because of their race brought suit, contending that allocating
children to different public schools on the basis of race violated the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of equal
protection. The Courts of Appeals below upheld the plans. We granted certiorari, and now reverse.

Both cases present the same underlying legal question--whether a public school that had not operated legally
segregated schools or has been found to be unitary may choose to classify students by race and rely upon that
classification in making school assignments. Although we examine the plans under the same legal framework,
the specifics of the two plans, and the circumstances surrounding their adoption, are in some respects quite dif-
ferent.

Seattle School District No. 1 operates 10 regular public high schools. In 1998, it adopted the plan at issue in this
case for assigning students to these schools. The plan allows incoming ninth graders to choose from among any
of the district's high schools, ranking however many schools they wish in order of preference.

... If too many students list the same school as their first choice, the district employs a series of "tiebreakers"
to determine who will fill the open slots at the oversubscribed school. The first tiebreaker selects for admission
students who have a sibling currently enrolled in the chosen school. The next tiebreaker depends upon the
racial composition of the particular school and the race of the individual student. In the district's public schools
approximately 41 percent of enrolled students are white; the remaining 59 percent, comprising all other racial
groups, are classified by Seattle for assignment purposes as nonwhite. If an oversubscribed school is not within
10 percentage points of the district's overall white/nonwhite racial balance, it is what the district calls "integra-
tion positive," and the district employs a tiebreaker that selects for assignment students whose race "will serve
to bring the school into balance." If it is still necessary to select students for the school after using the racial
tiebreaker, the next tiebreaker is the geographic proximity of the school to the student's residence.

Seattle has never operated segregated schools--legally separate schools for students of different races--nor has
it ever been subject to court-ordered desegregation. It nonetheless employs the racial tiebreaker in an attempt
to address the effects of racially identifiable housing patterns on school assignments. Most white students live
in the northern part of Seattle, most students of other racial backgrounds in the southern part. Four of Seat-
tle's high schools are located in the north--Ballard, Nathan Hale, Ingraham, and Roosevelt--and five in the
south--Rainier Beach, Cleveland, West Seattle, Chief Sealth, and Franklin. One school--Garfield--is more or
less in the center of Seattle.

For the 2000-2001 school year, five of these schools were oversubscribed ... so much so that 82 percent of incom-
ing ninth graders ranked one of these schools as their first choice. Three of the oversubscribed schools were "inte-
gration positive" because the school's white enrollment the previous school year was greater than 51 percent ...
Thus, more nonwhite students ... who selected one of these three schools as a top choice received placement at
the school than would have been the case had race not been considered, and proximity been the next tiebreaker
...

Petitioner Parents Involved in Community Schools (Parents Involved) is a nonprofit corporation comprising
the parents of children who have been or may be denied assignment to their chosen high school in the district
because of their race. The concerns of Parents Involved are illustrated by Jill Kurfirst, who sought to enroll her

ninth-grade son, Andy Meeks, in Ballard High School's special Biotechnology Career Academy. Andy suffered
from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and dyslexia, but had made good progress with hands-on instruc-
tion, and his mother and middle school teachers thought that the smaller biotechnology program held the most
promise for his continued success. Andy was accepted into this selective program but, because of the racial
tiebreaker, was denied assignment to Ballard High School. Parents Involved commenced this suit in the Western
District of Washington, alleging that Seattle's use of race in assignments violated the Equal Protection Clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Washington Civil Rights Act.

The District Court granted summary judgment to the school district, finding that state law did not bar the dis-
trict's use of the racial tiebreaker and that the plan survived strict scrutiny on the federal constitutional claim
because it was narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest. The Ninth Circuit initially reversed
... The panel determined that while achieving racial diversity and avoiding racial isolation are compelling gov-
ernment interests, Seattle's use of the racial tiebreaker was not narrowly tailored to achieve these interests. The
Ninth Circuit granted rehearing en banc, and overruled the panel decision, affirming the District Court's deter-
mination that Seattle's plan was narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest. We granted certio-
rari.

Jefferson County Public Schools operates the public school system in metropolitan Louisville, Kentucky. In
1973 a federal court found that Jefferson County had maintained a segregated school system, and in 1975 the
District Court entered a desegregation decree. Jefferson County operated under this decree until 2000, when the
District Court dissolved the decree after finding that the district had achieved unitary status by eliminating "[t]o
the greatest extent practicable" the vestiges of its prior policy of segregation.

In 2001, after the decree had been dissolved, Jefferson County adopted the voluntary student assignment plan
at issue in this case. Approximately 34 percent of the district's 97,000 students are black; most of the remaining
66 percent are white. The plan requires all nonmagnet schools to maintain a minimum black enrollment of 15
percent, and a maximum black enrollment of 50 percent.

At the elementary school level, based on his or her address, each student is designated a "resides" school to which
students within a specific geographic area are assigned; elementary resides schools are "grouped into clusters in
order to facilitate integration." The district assigns students to nonmagnet schools in one of two ways: Parents
of kindergartners, first-graders, and students new to the district may submit an application indicating a first
and second choice among the schools within their cluster; students who do not submit such an application are
assigned within the cluster by the district."Decisions to assign students to schools within each cluster are based
on available space within the schools and the racial guidelines in the District's current student assignment plan."
If a school has reached the "extremes of the racial guidelines," a student whose race would contribute to the
school's racial imbalance will not be assigned there. After assignment, students at all grade levels are permitted
to apply to transfer between nonmagnet schools in the district. Transfers may be requested for any number of
reasons, and may be denied because of lack of available space or on the basis of the racial guidelines.

When petitioner Crystal Meredith moved into the school district in August 2002, she sought to enroll her son,
Joshua McDonald, in kindergarten for the 2002-2003 school year. His resides school was only a mile from his
696 | FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL

new home, but it had no available space--assignments had been made in May, and the class was full. Jeffer-
son County assigned Joshua to another elementary school in his cluster, Young Elementary. This school was 10
miles from home, and Meredith sought to transfer Joshua to a school in a different cluster, Bloom Elementary,
which--like his resides school--was only a mile from home. Space was available at Bloom, and intercluster trans-
fers are allowed, but Joshua's transfer was nonetheless denied because, in the words of Jefferson County, "[t]he
transfer would have an adverse effect on desegregation compliance" of Young.

Meredith brought suit in the Western District of Kentucky, alleging violations of the Equal Protection Clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment. The District Court found that Jefferson County had asserted a compelling inter-
est in maintaining racially diverse schools, and that the assignment plan was (in all relevant respects) narrowly
tailored to serve that compelling interest. The Sixth Circuit affirmed in a per curiam opinion relying upon the
reasoning of the District Court, concluding that a written opinion "would serve no useful purpose." We granted
certiorari.

...

It is well established that when the government distributes burdens or benefits on the basis of individual racial
classifications, that action is reviewed under strict scrutiny. Grutter v. Bollinger (2003) ... As the Court recently
reaffirmed, "`racial classifications are simply too pernicious to permit any but the most exact connection between
justification and classification.'" Gratz v. Bollinger (2003) ... School districts must demonstrate that the use of
individual racial classifications in the assignment plans here under review is "narrowly tailored" to achieve a
"compelling" government interest.

Without attempting in these cases to set forth all the interests a school district might assert, it suffices to note
that our prior cases ... have recognized two interests that qualify as compelling. The first is the compelling inter-
est of remedying the effects of past intentional discrimination. See Freeman v. Pitts (1992). Yet the Seattle public
schools have not shown that they were ever segregated by law ... The Jefferson County public schools were pre-
viously segregated by law and were subject to a desegregation decree ... In 2000, the District Court that entered
that decree dissolved it, finding that Jefferson County had "eliminated the vestiges associated with the former
policy of segregation and its pernicious effects ... Jefferson County accordingly does not rely upon an interest in
remedying the effects of past intentional discrimination in defending its present use of race in assigning students.

Nor could it ... Once Jefferson County achieved unitary status, it had remedied the constitutional wrong that
allowed race-based assignments. Any continued use of race must be justified on some other basis.

The second government interest we have recognized as compelling for purposes of strict scrutiny is the interest
in diversity in higher education upheld in Grutter. The specific interest found compelling in Grutter was student
body diversity "in the context of higher education." The diversity interest was not focused on race alone but
encompassed "all factors that may contribute to student body diversity." ...

The entire gist of the analysis in Grutter was that the admissions program at issue there focused on each appli-
cant as an individual, and not simply as a member of a particular racial group. The classification of applicants by
race upheld ... was only as part of a "highly individualized, holistic review." As the Court explained, "[t]he impor-
                                                                                                        FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL | 697

tance of this individualized consideration in the context of a race-conscious admissions program is paramount."
The point of the narrow tailoring analysis in which the Grutter Court engaged was to ensure that the use of
racial classifications was indeed part of a broader assessment of diversity, and not simply an effort to achieve racial
balance, which the Court explained would be "patently unconstitutional."

In the present cases, by contrast, race is not considered as part of a broader effort to achieve "exposure to widely
diverse people, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints;" race, for some students, is determinative standing alone ... Like
the University of Michigan undergraduate plan struck down in Gratz ... the plans here "do not provide for a
meaningful individualized review of applicants" but instead rely on racial classifications in a "nonindividualized,
mechanical" way.

Even when it comes to race, the plans here employ only a limited notion of diversity, viewing race exclusively
in white/nonwhite terms in Seattle and black/"other" terms in Jefferson County. The Seattle "Board Statement
Reaffirming Diversity Rationale" speaks of the "inherent educational value" in "[p]roviding students the oppor-
tunity to attend schools with diverse student enrollment." But under the Seattle plan, a school with 50 percent
Asian-American students and 50 percent white students but no African-American, Native-American, or Latino
students would qualify as balanced, while a school with 30 percent Asian-American, 25 percent African-Ameri-
can, 25 percent Latino, and 20 percent white students would not. It is hard to understand how a plan that could
allow these results can be viewed as being concerned with achieving enrollment that is " `broadly diverse,'" Grut­
ter ...

In upholding the admissions plan in Grutter, though, this Court relied upon considerations unique to institu-
tions of higher education, noting that in light of "the expansive freedoms of speech and thought associated with
the university environment, universities occupy a special niche in our constitutional tradition." ... The Court
in Grutter expressly articulated key limitations on its holding--defining a specific type of broad-based diversity
and noting the unique context of higher education--but these limitations were largely disregarded by the lower
courts in extending Grutter to uphold race-based assignments in elementary and secondary schools. The present
cases are not governed by Grutter.

Perhaps recognizing that reliance on Grutter cannot sustain their plans, both school districts assert additional
interests, distinct from the interest upheld in Grutter, to justify their race-based assignments. In briefing and
argument before this Court, Seattle contends that its use of race helps to reduce racial concentration in schools
and to ensure that racially concentrated housing patterns do not prevent nonwhite students from having access
to the most desirable schools. Jefferson County has articulated a similar goal, phrasing its interest in terms of
educating its students "in a racially integrated environment." Each school district argues that educational and
broader socialization benefits flow from a racially diverse learning environment, and each contends that because
the diversity they seek is racial diversity--not the broader diversity at issue in Grutter--it makes sense to pro-
mote that interest directly by relying on race alone.

... Accepting racial balancing as a compelling state interest would justify the imposition of racial proportionality
throughout American society, contrary to our repeated recognition that "[a]t the heart of the Constitution's
guarantee of equal protection lies the simple command that the Government must treat citizens as individuals,
698 | FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL

not as simply components of a racial, religious, sexual or national class." Allowing racial balancing as a com-
pelling end in itself would "effectively assur[e] that race will always be relevant in American life, and that the
`ultimate goal' of `eliminating entirely from governmental decisionmaking such irrelevant factors as a human
being's race' will never be achieved." Croson v. Richmond (1989) [quoting Wygant v. Jackson Bd. Of Ed. (1986)]
...

The principle that racial balancing is not permitted is one of substance, not semantics. Racial balancing is
not transformed from "patently unconstitutional" to a compelling state interest simply by relabeling it "racial
diversity." While the school districts use various verbal formulations to describe the interest they seek to pro-
mote--racial diversity, avoidance of racial isolation, racial integration--they offer no definition of the interest
that suggests it differs from racial balance ...

However closely related race-based assignments may be to achieving racial balance, that itself cannot be the goal,
whether labeled "racial diversity" or anything else. To the extent the objective is sufficient diversity so that stu-
dents see fellow students as individuals rather than solely as members of a racial group, using means that treat
students solely as members of a racial group is fundamentally at cross-purposes with that end.

...

While we do not suggest that greater use of race would be preferable, the minimal impact of the districts' racial
classifications on school enrollment casts doubt on the necessity of using racial classifications ... Classifying and
assigning schoolchildren according to a binary conception of race is an extreme approach in light of our prece-
dents and our Nation's history of using race in public schools, and requires more than such an amorphous end
to justify it ...

Justice Breyer's dissent takes a different approach to these cases, one that fails to ground the result it would reach
in law ... Justice Breyer's dissent candidly dismisses the significance of this Court's repeated holdings that all
racial classifications must be reviewed under strict scrutiny, arguing that a different standard of review should be
applied because the districts use race for beneficent rather than malicious purposes.

... Justice Breyer nonetheless relies on the good intentions and motives of the school districts, stating that he has
found "no case that ... repudiated this constitutional asymmetry between that which seeks to exclude and that
which seeks to include members of minority races." We have found many ...

This argument that different rules should govern racial classifications designed to include rather than exclude is
not new ... and has been repeatedly rejected.

... Our established strict scrutiny test for racial classifications, however, insists on "detailed examination, both as
to ends and as to means." Adarand Constructors v. Pena, at 236 (1995) ... Simply because the school districts may
seek a worthy goal does not mean they are free to discriminate on the basis of race to achieve it, or that their racial
classifications should be subject to less exacting scrutiny.

...
                                                                                                        FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL | 699

If the need for the racial classifications embraced by the school districts is unclear, even on the districts' own
terms, the costs are undeniable ... Government action dividing us by race is inherently suspect because such clas-
sifications promote "notions of racial inferiority and lead to a politics of racial hostility," Croson ..."reinforce
the belief, held by too many for too much of our history, that individuals should be judged by the color of
their skin," Shaw v. Reno (1993) ... and "endorse race-based reasoning and the conception of a Nation divided
into racial blocs, thus contributing to an escalation of racial hostility and conflict." Metro Broadcasting v.
FCC (1990) (O'Connor, J., dissenting) ...

All this is true enough in the contexts in which these statements were made--government contracting, voting
districts, allocation of broadcast licenses, and electing state officers--but when it comes to using race to assign
children to schools, history will be heard. In Brown v. Board of Education (1954) (Brown I), we held that seg-
regation deprived black children of equal educational opportunities regardless of whether school facilities and
other tangible factors were equal, because government classification and separation on grounds of race them-
selves denoted inferiority. It was not the inequality of the facilities but the fact of legally separating children
on the basis of race on which the Court relied to find a constitutional violation in 1954 ... What do the racial
classifications do in these cases, if not determine admission to a public school on a racial basis? Before Brown,
schoolchildren were told where they could and could not go to school based on the color of their skin. The
school districts in these cases have not carried the heavy burden of demonstrating that we should allow this once
again--even for very different reasons. For schools that never segregated on the basis of race, such as Seattle, or
that have removed the vestiges of past segregation, such as Jefferson County, the way "to achieve a system of
determining admission to the public schools on a nonracial basis," Brown II, is to stop assigning students on a
racial basis. The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.

The judgments of the Courts of Appeals for the Sixth and Ninth Circuits are reversed, and the cases are
remanded for further proceedings.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting

These cases consider the longstanding efforts of two local school boards to integrate their public schools. The
school board plans before us resemble many others adopted in the last 50 years by primary and secondary schools
throughout the Nation. All of those plans represent local efforts to bring about the kind of racially integrated
education that Brown v. Board of Education (1954), long ago promised--efforts that this Court has repeatedly
required, permitted, and encouraged local authorities to undertake. This Court has recognized that the public
interests at stake in such cases are "compelling." We have approved of "narrowly tailored" plans that are no less
race-conscious than the plans before us. And we have understood that the Constitution permits local communi-
ties to adopt desegregation plans even where it does not require them to do so.

The plurality pays inadequate attention to this law, to past opinions' rationales, their language, and the contexts
in which they arise. As a result, it reverses course and reaches the wrong conclusion. In doing so, it distorts prece-
dent, it misapplies the relevant constitutional principles, it announces legal rules that will obstruct efforts by
state and local governments to deal effectively with the growing resegregation of public schools, it threatens to
700 | FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL

substitute for present calm a disruptive round of race-related litigation, and it undermines Brown's promise of
integrated primary and secondary education that local communities have sought to make a reality. This cannot
be justified in the name of the Equal Protection Clause.

Facts

The historical and factual context in which these cases arise is critical. In Brown, this Court held that the gov-
ernment's segregation of schoolchildren by race violates the Constitution's promise of equal protection ... In
dozens of subsequent cases, this Court told school districts previously segregated by law what they must do at a
minimum to comply with Brown's constitutional holding. The measures required by those cases often included
race-conscious practices, such as mandatory busing and race-based restrictions on voluntary transfers ...

Beyond those minimum requirements, the Court left much of the determination of how to achieve integration
to the judgment of local communities. Thus, in respect to race-conscious desegregation measures that the Con-
stitution permitted, but did not require (measures similar to those at issue here) ...

Overall these efforts brought about considerable racial integration. More recently, however, progress has stalled.
Between 1968 and 1980, the number of black children attending a school where minority children constituted
more than half of the school fell from 77% to 63% in the Nation ... Similarly, between 1968 and 1980, the num-
ber of black children attending schools that were more than 90% minority fell from 64% to 33% in the Nation
(from 78% to 23% in the South) ... As of 2002, almost 2.4 million students, or over 5% of all public school enroll-
ment, attended schools with a white population of less than 1%. Of these, 2.3 million were black and Latino stu-
dents, and only 72,000 were white. Today, more than one in six black children attend a school that is 99-100%
minority ... In light of the evident risk of a return to school systems that are in fact (though not in law) resegre-
gated, many school districts have felt a need to maintain or to extend their integration efforts.

[The opinion then provides a long history of both school districts ... ]

The histories I have set forth describe the extensive and ongoing efforts of two school districts to bring about
greater racial integration of their public schools. In both cases the efforts were in part remedial. Louisville began
its integration efforts in earnest when a federal court in 1975 entered a school desegregation order. Seattle under-
took its integration efforts in response to the filing of a federal lawsuit and as a result of its settlement of a segre-
gation complaint filed with the federal OCR.

...

Both districts sought greater racial integration for educational and democratic, as well as for remedial, reasons ...

The Legal Standard

A longstanding and unbroken line of legal authority tells us that the Equal Protection Clause permits local school
boards to use race-conscious criteria to achieve positive race-related goals, even when the Constitution does not compel
it. Because of its importance, I shall repeat what this Court said about the matter in Swann. Chief Justice Burger,
on behalf of a unanimous Court in a case of exceptional importance, wrote:
                                                                                                         FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL | 701

"School authorities are traditionally charged with broad power to formulate and implement educational policy
and might well conclude, for example, that in order to prepare students to live in a pluralistic society each school
should have a prescribed ratio of Negro to white students reflecting the proportion for the district as a whole. To
do this as an educational policy is within the broad discretionary powers of school authorities." Swann v. Char­
lotte-Mecklenburg Bd. Of Ed. (1971), 16 ...

This Court has also held that school districts may be required by federal statute to undertake race-conscious
desegregation efforts even when there is no likelihood that de jure segregation can be shown ...

There is reason to believe that those who drafted an Amendment with this basic purpose in mind would have
understood the legal and practical difference between the use of race-conscious criteria in defiance of that pur-
pose, namely to keep the races apart, and the use of race-conscious criteria to further that purpose, namely to
bring the races together ...

The upshot is that the cases to which the plurality refers, though all applying strict scrutiny, do not treat exclusive
and inclusive uses the same. Rather, they apply the strict scrutiny test in a manner that is "fatal in fact" only to
racial classifications that harmfully exclude; they apply the test in a manner that is not fatal in fact to racial classi-
fications that seek to include.

...

The upshot is that these plans' specific features--(1) their limited and historically-diminishing use of race, (2)
their strong reliance upon other non-race-conscious elements, (3) their history and the manner in which the dis-
tricts developed and modified their approach, (4) the comparison with prior plans, and (5) the lack of reasonably
evident alternatives--together show that the districts' plans are "narrowly tailored" to achieve their "compelling"
goals. In sum, the districts' race-conscious plans satisfy "strict scrutiny" and are therefore lawful.

...

Consequences

...

The districts' past and current plans are not unique ...

At the state level, 46 States and Puerto Rico have adopted policies that encourage or require local school districts
to enact interdistrict or intradistrict open choice plans. Eight of those States condition approval of transfers to
another school or district on whether the transfer will produce increased racial integration. Eleven other States
require local boards to deny transfers that are not in compliance with the local school board's desegregation
plans.

...

Until today, this Court understood the Constitution as affording the people, acting through their elected rep-
resentatives, freedom to select the use of "race-conscious" criteria from among their available options ... Today,
702 | FROM SEPARATE BUT EQUAL

however, the Court restricts (and some Members would eliminate) that leeway. I fear the consequences of doing
so for the law, for the schools, for the democratic process, and for America's efforts to create, out of its diversity,
one Nation.

...

Indeed, the consequences of the approach the Court takes today are serious. Yesterday, the plans under review
were lawful. Today, they are not. Yesterday, the citizens of this Nation could look for guidance to this Court's
unanimous pronouncements concerning desegregation. Today, they cannot. Yesterday, school boards had avail-
able to them a full range of means to combat segregated schools. Today, they do not.

...

The last half-century has witnessed great strides toward racial equality, but we have not yet realized the promise
of Brown. To invalidate the plans under review is to threaten the promise of Brown. The plurality's position, I
fear, would break that promise. This is a decision that the Court and the Nation will come to regret.

I must dissent.

Hirabayashi v. United States

320 U.S. 81 (1943)

    Vote: 9-0
    Decision: Affirmed
    Majority: Stone, joined by Roberts, Black, Reed, Frankfurter and Jackson
    Concurrence: Douglas
    Concurrence: Murphy
    Concurrence: Rutledge

Mr. Chief Justice Stone delivered the opinion of the Court.

Appellant, an American citizen of Japanese ancestry, was convicted in the district court of violating the Act of
Congress of March 21, 1942, 56 Stat. 173, 18 U.S.C. § 97a, which makes it a misdemeanor knowingly to dis-
regard restrictions made applicable by a military commander to persons in a military area prescribed by him as
such, all as authorized by an Executive Order of the President.

The questions for our decision are whether the particular restriction violated, namely that all persons of Japanese
ancestry residing in such an area be within their place of residence daily between the hours of 8:00 p.m. and 6:00
a.m., was adopted by the military commander in the exercise of an unconstitutional delegation by Congress of
its legislative power, and whether the restriction unconstitutionally discriminated between citizens of Japanese
ancestry and those of other ancestries in violation of the Fifth Amendment.

...

[The evidence showed that] appellant was born in Seattle in 1918, of Japanese parents who had come from Japan
to the United States, and who had never afterward returned to Japan; that he was educated in the Washington
public schools and at the time of his arrest was a senior in the University of Washington; that he had never been
in Japan or had any association with Japanese residing there.

The evidence showed that appellant had failed to report to the Civil Control Station on May 11 or May 12,
1942, as directed, to register for evacuation from the military area. He admitted failure to do so, and stated it had
at all times been his belief that he would be waiving his rights as an American citizen by so doing. The evidence
also showed that for like reason he was away from his place of residence after 8:00 p.m. on May 9, 1942. The jury
returned a verdict of guilty on both counts and appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of three
months on each, the sentences to run concurrently ...
704 | HOW COURTS REVIEW RACIAL DISCRIMINATION

The curfew order which appellant violated, and to which the sanction prescribed by the Act of Congress has
been deemed to attach, purported to be issued pursuant to an Executive Order of the President. In passing upon
the authority of the military commander to make and execute the order, it becomes necessary to consider in
some detail the official action which preceded or accompanied the order and from which it derives its purported
authority.

...

[We therefore conclude that] Executive Order No. 9066, promulgated in time of war for the declared purpose
of prosecuting the war by protecting national defense resources from sabotage and espionage, and the Act of
March 21, 1942, ratifying and confirming the Executive Order, were each an exercise of the power to wage war
conferred on the Congress and on the President, as Commander in Chief of the armed forces, by Articles I and
II of the Constitution ...

In the critical days of March, 1942, the danger to our war production by sabotage and espionage in this area
seems obvious ... Espionage by persons in sympathy with the Japanese Government had been found to have been
particularly effective in the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. At a time of threatened Japanese attack upon this
country, the nature of our inhabitants' attachments to the Japanese enemy was consequently a matter of grave
concern. Of the 126,000 persons of Japanese descent in the United States, citizens and non-citizens, approxi-
mately 112,000 resided in California, Oregon and Washington at the time of the adoption of the military regu-
lations. Of these approximately two-thirds are citizens because [they were] born in the United States. Not only
did the great majority of such persons reside within the Pacific Coast states but they were concentrated in or near
three of the large cities, Seattle, Portland and Los Angeles, all in Military Area No. 1.

There is support for the view that social, economic and political conditions which have prevailed since the close
of the last century, when the Japanese began to come to this country in substantial numbers, have intensified
their solidarity and have in large measure prevented their assimilation as an integral part of the white popula-
tion ... The large number of resident alien Japanese, approximately one-third of all Japanese inhabitants of the
country, are of mature years and occupy positions of influence in Japanese communities. The association of
influential Japanese residents with Japanese Consulates has been deemed a ready means for the dissemination of
propaganda and for the maintenance of the influence of the Japanese Government with the Japanese population
in this country ...

Viewing these data in all their aspects, Congress and the Executive could reasonably have concluded that these
conditions have encouraged the continued attachment of members of this group to Japan and Japanese institu-
tions ...

But appellant insists that the exercise of the power is inappropriate and unconstitutional because it discriminates
against citizens of Japanese ancestry, in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The Fifth Amendment contains no
equal protection clause and it restrains only such discriminatory legislation by Congress as amounts to a denial
of due process. Congress may hit at a particular danger where it is seen, without providing for others which are
not so evident or so urgent.
                                                                             HOW COURTS REVIEW RACIAL DISCRIMINATION | 705

Distinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people
whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality. For that reason, legislative classification or dis-
crimination based on race alone has often been held to be a denial of equal protection ... We may assume that
these considerations would be controlling here were it not for the fact that the danger of espionage and sabo-
tage, in time of war and of threatened invasion, calls upon the military authorities to scrutinize every relevant
fact bearing on the loyalty of populations in the danger areas. Because racial discriminations are in most circum-
stances irrelevant and therefore prohibited, it by no means follows that, in dealing with the perils of war, Con-
gress and the Executive are wholly precluded from taking into account those facts and circumstances which are
relevant to measures for our national defense and for the successful prosecution of the war, and which may in
fact place citizens of one ancestry in a different category from others ...

Our investigation here does not go beyond the inquiry whether, in the light of all the relevant circumstances pre-
ceding and attending their promulgation, the challenged orders and statute afforded a reasonable basis for the
action taken in imposing the curfew. We cannot close our eyes to the fact, demonstrated by experience, that in
time of war residents having ethnic affiliations with an invading enemy may be a greater source of danger than
those of a different ancestry. Nor can we deny that Congress, and the military authorities acting with its autho-
rization, have constitutional power to appraise the danger in the light of facts of public notoriety. We need not
now attempt to define the ultimate boundaries of the war power. We decide only the issue as we have defined
it--we decide only that the curfew order as applied, and at the time it was applied, was within the boundaries
of the war power. In this case it is enough that circumstances within the knowledge of those charged with the
responsibility for maintaining the national defense afforded a rational basis for the decision which they made.
Whether we would have made it is irrelevant ...

Korematsu v. United States

323 U.S. 214 (1944)

    Vote: 6-3
    Decision: Affirmed
    Majority: Black, joined by Reed, Frankfurter, Douglas, and Rutledge, and Stone
    Concurrence: Frankfurter
    Dissent: Jackson
    Dissent: Murphy
    Dissent: Roberts

Mr. Justice Black delivered the opinion of the Court.

The petitioner, an American citizen of Japanese descent, was convicted in a federal district court for remaining
in San Leandro, California, a "Military Area," contrary to Civilian Exclusion Order No. 34 of the Commanding
General of the Western Command, U.S. Army, which directed that, after May 9, 1942, all persons of Japanese
ancestry should be excluded from that area. No question was raised as to petitioner's loyalty to the United States.
The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed and the importance of the constitutional question involved caused us to
grant certiorari.

It should be noted, to begin with, that all legal restrictions which curtail the civil rights of a single racial group
are immediately suspect. That is not to say that all such restrictions are unconstitutional. It is to say that courts
must subject them to the most rigid scrutiny. Pressing public necessity may sometimes justify the existence of
such restrictions; racial antagonism never can.

... In Hirabayashi, it was argued that] to apply the curfew order against none but citizens of Japanese ancestry
amounted to a constitutionally prohibited discrimination solely on account of race. To these questions, we gave
the serious consideration which their importance justified. We upheld the curfew order as an exercise of the
power of the government to take steps necessary to prevent espionage and sabotage in an area threatened by
Japanese attack.

In the light of the principles we announced in the Hirabayashi case, we are unable to conclude that it was
beyond the war power of Congress and the Executive to exclude those of Japanese ancestry from the West Coast
war area at the time they did. True, exclusion from the area in which one's home is located is a far greater depri-
vation than constant confinement to the home from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. Nothing short of apprehension by the
proper military authorities of the gravest imminent danger to the public safety can constitutionally justify either.
But exclusion from a threatened area, no less than curfew, has a definite and close relationship to the prevention
of espionage and sabotage. The military authorities, charged with the primary responsibility of defending our
shores, concluded that curfew provided inadequate protection and ordered exclusion. They did so, as pointed
out in our Hirabayashi opinion, in accordance with Congressional authority to the military to say who should,
and who should not, remain in the threatened areas ...
                                                                             HOW COURTS REVIEW RACIAL DISCRIMINATION | 707

It is said that we are dealing here with the case of imprisonment of a citizen in a concentration camp solely
because of his ancestry, without evidence or inquiry concerning his loyalty and good disposition towards the
United States. Our task would be simple, our duty clear, were this a case involving the imprisonment of a loyal
citizen in a concentration camp because of racial prejudice. Regardless of the true nature of the assembly and
relocation centers--and we deem it unjustifiable to call them concentration camps, with all the ugly connota-
tions that term implies--we are dealing specifically with nothing but an exclusion order. To cast this case into
outlines of racial prejudice, without reference to the real military dangers which were presented, merely confuses
the issue. Korematsu was not excluded from the Military Area because of hostility to him or his race. He was
excluded because we are at war with the Japanese Empire, because the properly constituted military authorities
feared an invasion of our West Coast and felt constrained to take proper security measures, because they decided
that the military urgency of the situation demanded that all citizens of Japanese ancestry be segregated from the
West Coast temporarily, and, finally, because Congress, reposing its confidence in this time of war in our military
leaders--as inevitably it must--determined that they should have the power to do just this. There was evidence
of disloyalty on the part of some, the military authorities considered that the need for action was great, and time
was short. We cannot--by availing ourselves of the calm perspective of hindsight--now say that, at that time,
these actions were unjustified.

Affirmed.

Mr. Justice Murphy, dissenting.

This exclusion of "all persons of Japanese ancestry, both alien and non-alien," from the Pacific Coast area on a
plea of military necessity in the absence of martial law ought not to be approved. Such exclusion goes over "the
very brink of constitutional power," and falls into the ugly abyss of racism.

In dealing with matters relating to the prosecution and progress of a war, we must accord great respect and con-
sideration to the judgments of the military authorities who are on the scene and who have full knowledge of the
military facts. The scope of their discretion must, as a matter of necessity and common sense, be wide. And their
judgments ought not to be overruled lightly by those whose training and duties ill-equip them to deal intelli-
gently with matters so vital to the physical security of the nation.

At the same time, however, it is essential that there be definite limits to military discretion, especially where mar-
tial law has not been declared. Individuals must not be left impoverished of their constitutional rights on a plea
of military necessity that has neither substance nor support. Thus, like other claims conflicting with the asserted
constitutional rights of the individual, the military claim must subject itself to the judicial process of having its
reasonableness determined and its conflicts with other interests reconciled.

...

The judicial test of whether the Government, on a plea of military necessity, can validly deprive an individual
of any of his constitutional rights is whether the deprivation is reasonably related to a public danger that is so
"immediate, imminent, and impending" as not to admit of delay and not to permit the intervention of ordi-
nary constitutional processes to alleviate the danger. United States v. Russell (1871) ... Being an obvious racial
708 | HOW COURTS REVIEW RACIAL DISCRIMINATION

discrimination, the order deprives all those within its scope of the equal protection of the laws as guaranteed by
the Fifth Amendment. It further deprives these individuals of their constitutional rights to live and work where
they will, to establish a home where they choose and to move about freely. In excommunicating them without
benefit of hearings, this order also deprives them of all their constitutional rights to procedural due process. Yet
no reasonable relation to an "immediate, imminent, and impending" public danger is evident to support this
racial restriction, which is one of the most sweeping and complete deprivations of constitutional rights in the
history of this nation in the absence of martial law.

It must be conceded that the military and naval situation in the spring of 1942 was such as to generate a very real
fear of invasion of the Pacific Coast, accompanied by fears of sabotage and espionage in that area. The military
command was therefore justified in adopting all reasonable means necessary to combat these dangers. In adjudg-
ing the military action taken in light of the then apparent dangers, we must not erect too high or too meticu-
lous standards; it is necessary only that the action have some reasonable relation to the removal of the dangers
of invasion, sabotage and espionage. But the exclusion, either temporarily or permanently, of all persons with
Japanese blood in their veins has no such reasonable relation. And that relation is lacking because the exclusion
order necessarily must rely for its reasonableness upon the assumption that all persons of Japanese ancestry may
have a dangerous tendency to commit sabotage and espionage and to aid our Japanese enemy in other ways. It is
difficult to believe that reason, logic, or experience could be marshalled in support of such an assumption.

That this forced exclusion was the result in good measure of this erroneous assumption of racial guilt, rather
than bona fide military necessity is evidenced by the Commanding General's Final Report on the evacuation
from the Pacific Coast area. In it, he refers to all individuals of Japanese descent as "subversive," as belonging to
"an enemy race" whose "racial strains are undiluted," and as constituting "over 112,000 potential enemies ... at
large today" along the Pacific Coast. In support of this blanket condemnation of all persons of Japanese descent,
however, no reliable evidence is cited to show that such individuals were generally disloyal, or had generally so
conducted themselves in this area as to constitute a special menace to defense installations or war industries, or
had otherwise, by their behavior, furnished reasonable ground for their exclusion as a group.

Justification for the exclusion is sought, instead, mainly upon questionable racial and sociological grounds not
ordinarily within the realm of expert military judgment, supplemented by certain semi-military conclusions
drawn from an unwarranted use of circumstantial evidence ... No adequate reason is given for the failure to treat
these Japanese Americans on an individual basis by holding investigations and hearings to separate the loyal from
the disloyal, as was done in the case of persons of German and Italian ancestry ... It is asserted merely that the
loyalties of this group "were unknown and time was of the essence." ...

I dissent, therefore, from this legalization of racism. Racial discrimination in any form and in any degree has no
justifiable part whatever in our democratic way of life. It is unattractive in any setting, but it is utterly revolting
among a free people who have embraced the principles set forth in the Constitution of the United States.

All residents of this nation are kin in some way by blood or culture to a foreign land. Yet they are primarily and
necessarily a part of the new and distinct civilization of the United States. They must, accordingly, be treated at
all times as the heirs of the American experiment, and as entitled to all the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the

MR. JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.

At issue in this case is the validity of a conviction under § 798.05 of the Florida statutes, F.S.A., providing that:

      "Any negro man and white woman, or any white man and negro woman, who are not married to each other, who
      shall habitually live in and occupy in the night-time the same room shall each be punished by imprisonment not
      exceeding twelve months, or by fine not exceeding five hundred dollars."

Because the section applies only to a white person and a Negro who commit the specified acts, and because no
couple other than one made up of a white and a Negro is subject to conviction upon proof of the elements com-
prising the offense it proscribes, we hold § 798.05 invalid as a denial of the equal protection of the laws guaran-
teed by the Fourteenth Amendment ...

Appellants were charged with a violation of § 798.05. The elements of the offense as described by the trial judge
are the (1) habitual occupation of a room at night, (2) by a Negro and a white person (3) who are not married.
The State presented evidence going to each factor, appellants' constitutional contentions were overruled and the
jury returned a verdict of guilty ... Solely on the authority of Pace v. Alabama 106 U. S. 583, the Florida Supreme
Court affirmed and sustained the validity of § 798.05 as against appellants' claims that the section denied them
equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. We noted probable jurisdiction ... We
deal with the single issue of equal protection and on this basis set aside these convictions.

It is readily apparent that § 798.05 treats the interracial couple made up of a white person and a Negro differently
than it does any other couple ...
710 | HOW COURTS REVIEW RACIAL DISCRIMINATION

In this situation, Pace v. Alabama ... is relied upon as controlling authority. In our view, however, Pace represents
a limited view of the Equal Protection Clause which has not withstood analysis in the subsequent decisions of
this Court. In that case, the Court let stand a conviction under an Alabama statute forbidding adultery or forni-
cation between a white person and a Negro and imposing a greater penalty than allowed under another Alabama
statute of general application and proscribing the same conduct whatever the race of the participants ... [T]he
Court pointed out that Alabama had designated as a separate offense the commission by a white person and a
Negro of the identical acts forbidden by the general provisions. There was, therefore, no impermissible discrim-
ination, because the difference in punishment was "directed against the offence designated," and because, in the
case of each offense, all who committed it, white and Negro, were treated alike ... Because each of the Alabama
laws applied equally to those to whom it was applicable, the different treatment accorded interracial and interra-
cial couples was irrelevant.

...

Judicial inquiry under the Equal Protection Clause ... does not end with a showing of equal application among
the members of the class defined by the legislation. The courts must reach and determine the question whether
the classifications drawn in a statute are reasonable in light of its purpose -- in this case, whether there is an arbi-
trary or invidious discrimination between those classes covered by Florida's cohabitation law and those excluded.
That question is what Pace ignored, and what must be faced here.

...

The Florida Supreme Court, relying upon Pace v. Alabama ... found no legal discrimination at all and gave no
consideration to statutory purpose. The State in its brief in this Court, however, says that the legislative pur-
pose of § 798.05, like the other sections of chapter 798, was to prevent breaches of the basic concepts of sexual
decency, and we see no reason to quarrel with the State's characterization of this statute, dealing as it does with
illicit extramarital and premarital promiscuity.

We find nothing in this suggested legislative purpose, however, which makes it essential to punish promiscuity
of one racial group and not that of another. There is no suggestion that a white person and a Negro are any more
likely habitually to occupy the same room together than the white or the Negro couple or to engage in illicit
intercourse if they do. Sections 798.01-798.05 indicate no legislative conviction that promiscuity by the inter-
racial couple presents any particular problems requiring separate or different treatment if the suggested over-all
policy of the chapter is to be adequately served.

Florida's remaining argument is related to its law against interracial marriage, § 741.11, which, in the light of
certain legislative history of the Fourteenth Amendment, is said to be immune from attack under the Equal Pro-
tection Clause. Its interracial cohabitation law, § 798.05, is likewise valid, it is argued, because it is ancillary to
and serves the same purpose as the miscegenation law itself.
§                                                                             HOW COURTS REVIEW RACIAL DISCRIMINATION | 711

We reject this argument, without reaching the question of the validity of the State's prohibition against interra-
cial marriage or the soundness of the arguments rooted in the history of the Amendment. For even if we posit
the constitutionality of the ban against the marriage of a Negro and a white, it does not follow that the cohabi-
tation law is not to be subjected to independent examination under the Fourteenth Amendment ...

There is involved here an exercise of the state police power which trenches upon the constitutionally protected
freedom from invidious official discrimination based on race. Such a law, even though enacted pursuant to a
valid state interest, bears a heavy burden of justification, as we have said, and will be upheld only if it is neces-
sary, and not merely rationally related, to the accomplishment of a permissible state policy ... Those provisions of
chapter 798 which are neutral as to race express a general and strong state policy against promiscuous conduct,
whether engaged in by those who are married, those who may marry or those who may not. These provisions,
if enforced, would reach illicit relations of any kind, and, in this way, protect the integrity of the marriage laws
of the State, including what is claimed to be a valid ban on interracial marriage. These same provisions, more-
over, punish premarital sexual relations as severely or more severely in some instances than do those provisions
which focus on the interracial couple. Florida has offered no argument that the State's policy against interracial
marriage cannot be as adequately served by the general, neutral, and existing ban on illicit behavior ... In short,
it has not been shown that § 798.05 is a necessary adjunct to the State's ban on interracial marriage. We accord-
ingly invalidate § 798.05 without expressing any views about the State's prohibition of interracial marriage, and
reverse these convictions.

Reversed.

    Majority: Warren, joined by Black, Douglas, Clark, Harlan, Brennan, Stewart, White and Fortas
    Concurrence: Stewart

Mr. Chief Justice Warren delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case presents a constitutional question never addressed by this Court: whether a statutory scheme adopted
by the State of Virginia to prevent marriages between persons solely on the basis of racial classifications violates
the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. For reasons which seem to us
to reflect the central meaning of those constitutional commands, we conclude that these statutes cannot stand
consistently with the Fourteenth Amendment.
712 | HOW COURTS REVIEW RACIAL DISCRIMINATION

In June, 1958, two residents of Virginia, Mildred Jeter, a Negro woman, and Richard Loving, a white man, were
married in the District of Columbia pursuant to its laws. Shortly after their marriage, the Lovings returned to
Virginia and established their marital abode in Caroline County. At the October Term, 1958, of the Circuit
Court of Caroline County, a grand jury issued an indictment charging the Lovings with violating Virginia's ban
on interracial marriages. On January 6, 1959, the Lovings pleaded guilty to the charge, and were sentenced to
one year in jail; however, the trial judge suspended the sentence for a period of 25 years on the condition that the
Lovings leave the State and not return to Virginia together for 25 years. He stated in an opinion that:

      Almighty God created the races white, black, yellow, malay and red, and he placed them on separate continents.
      And, but for the interference with his arrangement, there would be no cause for such marriage. The fact that he
      separated the races shows that he did not intend for the races to mix.

After their convictions, the Lovings took up residence in the District of Columbia. On November 6, 1963, they
filed a motion in the state trial court to vacate the judgment and set aside the sentence on the ground that the
statutes which they had violated were repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment ... we noted probable jurisdic-
tion ...

The two statutes under which appellants were convicted and sentenced are part of a comprehensive statutory
scheme aimed at prohibiting and punishing interracial marriages. The Lovings were convicted of violating § 258
of the Virginia Code:

      Leaving State to evade law.--If any white person and colored person shall go out of this State, for the purpose of
      being married, and with the intention of returning, and be married out of it, and afterwards return to and reside
      in it, cohabiting as man and wife, they shall be punished as provided in § 20-59, and the marriage shall be governed
      by the same law as if it had been solemnized in this State. The fact of their cohabitation here as man and wife shall
      be evidence of their marriage.

Section 259, which defines the penalty for miscegenation, provides:

      Punishment for marriage.--If any white person intermarry with a colored person, or any colored person inter-
      marry with a white person, he shall be guilty of a felony and shall be punished by confinement in the penitentiary
      for not less than one nor more than five years.

Other central provisions in the Virginia statutory scheme are § 20-57, which automatically voids all marriages
between "a white person and a colored person" without any judicial proceeding, and §§ 20-54 and 1-14 which,
respectively, define "white persons" and "colored persons and Indians" for purposes of the statutory prohibi-
tions. The Lovings have never disputed in the course of this litigation that Mrs. Loving is a "colored person" or
that Mr. Loving is a "white person" within the meanings given those terms by the Virginia statutes.

Virginia is now one of 16 States which prohibit and punish marriages on the basis of racial classifications. Penal-
ties for miscegenation arose as an incident to slavery, and have been common in Virginia since the colonial
period. The present statutory scheme dates from the adoption of the Racial Integrity Act of 1924, passed during
the period of extreme nativism which followed the end of the First World War. The central features of this Act,
and current Virginia law, are the absolute prohibition of a "white person" marrying other than another "white
                                                                              HOW COURTS REVIEW RACIAL DISCRIMINATION | 713

person," a prohibition against issuing marriage licenses until the issuing official is satisfied that the applicants'
statements as to their race are correct, certificates of "racial composition" to be kept by both local and state reg-
istrars, and the carrying forward of earlier prohibitions against racial intermarriage.

In upholding the constitutionality of these provisions in the decision below, the Supreme Court of Appeals
of Virginia referred to its 1965 decision in Naim v. Naim as stating the reasons supporting the validity of
these laws. In Naim, the state court concluded that the State's legitimate purposes were "to preserve the racial
integrity of its citizens," and to prevent "the corruption of blood," "a mongrel breed of citizens," and "the oblit-
eration of racial pride," obviously an endorsement of the doctrine of White Supremacy. The court also reasoned
that marriage has traditionally been subject to state regulation without federal intervention, and, consequently,
the regulation of marriage should be left to exclusive state control by the Tenth Amendment.

While the state court is no doubt correct in asserting that marriage is a social relation subject to the State's police
power, Maynard v. Hill (1888), the State does not contend in its argument before this Court that its powers to
regulate marriage are unlimited notwithstanding the commands of the Fourteenth Amendment. Nor could it
do so in light of Meyer v. Nebraska (1923), and Skinner v. Oklahoma (1942). Instead, the State argues that the
meaning of the Equal Protection Clause, as illuminated by the statements of the Framers, is only that state penal
laws containing an interracial element as part of the definition of the offense must apply equally to whites and
Negroes in the sense that members of each race are punished to the same degree. Thus, the State contends that,
because its miscegenation statutes punish equally both the white and the Negro participants in an interracial
marriage, these statutes, despite their reliance on racial classifications, do not constitute an invidious discrimina-
tion based upon race. The second argument advanced by the State assumes the validity of its equal application
theory. The argument is that, if the Equal Protection Clause does not outlaw miscegenation statutes because of
their reliance on racial classifications, the question of constitutionality would thus become whether there was
any rational basis for a State to treat interracial marriages differently from other marriages. On this question, the
State argues, the scientific evidence is substantially in doubt and, consequently, this Court should defer to the
wisdom of the state legislature in adopting its policy of discouraging interracial marriages.

Because we reject the notion that the mere "equal application" of a statute containing racial classifications is
enough to remove the classifications from the Fourteenth Amendment's proscription of all invidious racial dis-
criminations, we do not accept the State's contention that these statutes should be upheld if there is any pos-
sible basis for concluding that they serve a rational purpose. The mere fact of equal application does not mean
that our analysis of these statutes should follow the approach we have taken in cases involving no racial dis-
crimination where the Equal Protection Clause has been arrayed against a statute discriminating between the
kinds of advertising which may be displayed on trucks in New York City, Railway Express Agency, Inc. v. New
York (1949) ... In these cases, involving distinctions not drawn according to race, the Court has merely asked
whether there is any rational foundation for the discriminations, and has deferred to the wisdom of the state leg-
islatures. In the case at bar, however, we deal with statutes containing racial classifications, and the fact of equal
application does not immunize the statute from the very heavy burden of justification which the Fourteenth
Amendment has traditionally required of state statutes drawn according to race.
714 | HOW COURTS REVIEW RACIAL DISCRIMINATION

The State argues that statements in the Thirty-ninth Congress about the time of the passage of the Fourteenth
Amendment indicate that the Framers did not intend the Amendment to make unconstitutional state misce-
genation laws. Many of the statements alluded to by the State concern the debates over the Freedmen's Bureau
Bill, which President [Andrew] Johnson vetoed, and the Civil Rights Act of 1866, enacted over his veto. While
these statements have some relevance to the intention of Congress in submitting the Fourteenth Amendment,
it must be understood that they pertained to the passage of specific statutes, and not to the broader, organic
purpose of a constitutional amendment ... The most avid proponents of the post-War Amendments undoubt-
edly intended them to remove all legal distinctions among "all persons born or naturalized in the United States."
Their opponents, just as certainly, were antagonistic to both the letter and the spirit of the Amendments, and
wished them to have the most limited effect. Brown v. Board of Education (1954). See also Strauder v. West Vir­
ginia (1880). We have rejected the proposition that the debates in the Thirty-ninth Congress or in the state
legislatures which ratified the Fourteenth Amendment supported the theory advanced by the State, that the
requirement of equal protection of the laws is satisfied by penal laws defining offenses based on racial classifica-
tions so long as white and Negro participants in the offense were similarly punished.

The State finds support for its "equal application" theory in the decision of the Court in Pace v.
Alabama (1883). In that case, the Court upheld a conviction under an Alabama statute forbidding adultery
or fornication between a white person and a Negro which imposed a greater penalty than that of a statute
proscribing similar conduct by members of the same race. The Court reasoned that the statute could not be
said to discriminate against Negroes because the punishment for each participant in the offense was the same.
However, as recently as the 1964 Term, in rejecting the reasoning of that case, we stated "Pace represents a lim-
ited view of the Equal Protection Clause which has not withstood analysis in the subsequent decisions of this
Court." McLaughlin v. Florida. As we there demonstrated, the Equal Protection Clause requires the consider-
ation of whether the classifications drawn by any statute constitute an arbitrary and invidious discrimination.
The clear and central purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to eliminate all official state sources of invidi-
ous racial discrimination in the States. Slaughter-House Cases (1873) ...

There can be no question but that Virginia's miscegenation statutes rest solely upon distinctions drawn accord-
ing to race. The statutes proscribe generally accepted conduct if engaged in by members of different races. Over
the years, this Court has consistently repudiated "[d]istinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry"
as being "odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality." Hirabayashi
v. United States (1943). At the very least, the Equal Protection Clause demands that racial classifications, espe-
cially suspect in criminal statutes, be subjected to the "most rigid scrutiny," Korematsu v. United States (1944),
and, if they are ever to be upheld, they must be shown to be necessary to the accomplishment of some permis-
sible state objective, independent of the racial discrimination which it was the object of the Fourteenth Amend-
ment to eliminate. Indeed, two members of this Court have already stated that they cannot conceive of a valid
legislative purpose ... which makes the color of a person's skin the test of whether his conduct is a criminal
offense. McLaughlin v. Florida (Stewart, J., joined by Douglas, J., concurring).

There is patently no legitimate overriding purpose independent of invidious racial discrimination which justifies
this classification. The fact that Virginia prohibits only interracial marriages involving white persons demon-
strates that the racial classifications must stand on their own justification, as measures designed to maintain
§                                                                             HOW COURTS REVIEW RACIAL DISCRIMINATION | 715

White Supremacy. We have consistently denied the constitutionality of measures which restrict the rights of cit-
izens on account of race. There can be no doubt that restricting the freedom to marry solely because of racial
classifications violates the central meaning of the Equal Protection Clause.

These statutes also deprive the Lovings of liberty without due process of law in violation of the Due Process
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the vital per-
sonal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.

Marriage is one of the "basic civil rights of man," fundamental to our very existence and survival. Skinner v.
Oklahoma (1942). See also Maynard v. Hill (1888). To deny this fundamental freedom on so unsupportable a
basis as the racial classifications embodied in these statutes, classifications so directly subversive of the principle
of equality at the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment, is surely to deprive all the State's citizens of liberty
without due process of law. The Fourteenth Amendment requires that the freedom of choice to marry not be
restricted by invidious racial discriminations. Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a
person of another race resides with the individual, and cannot be infringed by the State.

These convictions must be reversed.

It is so ordered.

    Majority: Burger, joined by Brennan, White, Marshall, Blackmun, Powell, Rehnquist, Stevens, and O'Con-

Chief Justice Burger delivered the opinion of the Court.

We granted certiorari to review a judgment of a state court divesting a natural mother of the custody of her infant
child because of her remarriage to a person of a different race.

When petitioner Linda Sidoti Palmore and respondent Anthony Sidoti, both Caucasians, were divorced in May,
1980, in Florida, the mother was awarded custody of their 3-year-old daughter.
716 | HOW COURTS REVIEW RACIAL DISCRIMINATION

In September, 1981, the father sought custody of the child by filing a petition to modify the prior judgment
because of changed conditions. The change was that the child's mother was then cohabiting with a Negro,
Clarence Palmore, Jr., whom she married two months later. Additionally, the father made several allegations of
instances in which the mother had not properly cared for the child.

After hearing testimony from both parties and considering a court counselor's investigative report, the court
noted that the father had made allegations about the child's care, but the court made no findings with respect to
these allegations ...

The court then addressed the recommendations of the court counselor, who had made an earlier report

      "in [another] case coming out of this circuit also involving the social consequences of an interracial marriage. Niles
      v. Niles, 299 So. 2d 162."

From this vague reference to that earlier case, the court turned to the present case and noted the counselor's rec-
ommendation for a change in custody because

      "[t]he wife [petitioner] has chosen for herself, and for her child, a lifestyle unacceptable to the father and to society.
      ... The child ... is, or at school age will be, subject to environmental pressures not of choice."

The court then concluded that the best interests of the child would be served by awarding custody to the father.
The court's rationale is contained in the following:

      "The father's evident resentment of the mother's choice of a black partner is not sufficient to wrest custody from
      the mother. It is of some significance, however, that the mother did see fit to bring a man into her home and carry
      on a sexual relationship with him without being married to him. Such action tended to place gratification of her
      own desires ahead of her concern for the child's future welfare. This Court feels that despite the strides that have
      been made in bettering relations between the races in this country, it is inevitable that Melanie will, if allowed to
      remain in her present situation and attains school age, and thus more vulnerable to peer pressures, suffer from the
      social stigmatization that is sure to come."

The Second District Court of Appeal affirmed without opinion ... thus denying the Florida Supreme Court
jurisdiction to review the case. We granted certiorari and we reverse.

The judgment of a state court determining or reviewing a child custody decision is not ordinarily a likely candi-
date for review by this Court. However, the court's opinion, after stating that the "father's evident resentment of
the mother's choice of a black partner is not sufficient" to deprive her of custody, then turns to what it regarded
as the damaging impact on the child from remaining in a racially mixed household. This raises important federal
concerns arising from the Constitution's commitment to eradicating discrimination based on race.

The Florida court did not focus directly on the parental qualifications of the natural mother or her present hus-
band, or indeed on the father's qualifications to have custody of the child. The court found that

      "there is no issue as to either party's devotion to the child, adequacy of housing facilities, or respectability of the
      new spouse of either parent."
                                                                              HOW COURTS REVIEW RACIAL DISCRIMINATION | 717

...

The court correctly stated that the child's welfare was the controlling factor. But that court was entirely candid,
and made no effort to place its holding on any ground other than race. Taking the court's findings and rationale
at face value, it is clear that the outcome would have been different had petitioner married a Caucasian male of
similar respectability.

...

The State, of course, has a duty of the highest order to protect the interests of minor children, particularly those
of tender years. In common with most states, Florida law mandates that custody determinations be made in the
best interests of the children involved ... The goal of granting custody based on the best interests of the child is
indisputably a substantial governmental interest for purposes of the Equal Protection Clause.

It would ignore reality to suggest that racial and ethnic prejudices do not exist, or that all manifestations of those
prejudices have been eliminated. There is a risk that a child living with a stepparent of a different race may be
subject to a variety of pressures and stresses not present if the child were living with parents of the same racial or
ethnic origin.

The question, however, is whether the reality of private biases and the possible injury they might inflict are per-
missible considerations for removal of an infant child from the custody of its natural mother. We have little diffi-
culty concluding that they are not. The Constitution cannot control such prejudices, but neither can it tolerate
them. Private biases may be outside the reach of the law, but the law cannot, directly or indirectly, give them
effect.

...

Whatever problems racially mixed households may pose for children in 1984 can no more support a denial of
constitutional rights than could the stresses that residential integration was thought to entail in 1917. The effects
of racial prejudice, however real, cannot justify a racial classification removing an infant child from the custody
of its natural mother found to be an appropriate person to have such custody.

Mr. Justice White delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case involves the validity of a qualifying test administered to applicants for positions as police officers in the
District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department. The test was sustained by the District Court but invali-
dated by the Court of Appeals. We are in agreement with the District Court and hence reverse the judgment of
the Court of Appeals.

[The issue involved an assertion] that their applications to become officers in the Department had been rejected,
and that the Department's recruiting procedures discriminated on the basis of race against black applicants by
a series of practices including, but not limited to, a written personnel test which excluded a disproportionately
high number of Negro applicants. These practices were asserted to violate respondents' rights "under the due
process clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution ... Defendants answered, and discov-
ery and various other proceedings followed. Respondents then filed a motion for partial summary judgment
with respect to the recruiting phase of the case, seeking a declaration that the test administered to those apply-
ing to become police officers is "unlawfully discriminatory and thereby in violation of the due process clause of
the Fifth Amendment . . ." No issue under any statute or regulation was raised by the motion. The District of
Columbia defendants, petitioners here, and the federal parties also filed motions for summary judgment with
respect to the recruiting aspects of the case, asserting that respondents were entitled to relief on neither constitu-
tional nor statutory grounds. The District Court granted petitioners' and denied respondents' motions.

According to the findings and conclusions of the District Court, to be accepted by the Department and to enter
an intensive 17-week training program, the police recruit was required to satisfy certain physical and character
standards, to be a high school graduate or its equivalent, and to receive a grade of at least 40 out of 80 on "Test
21," which is "an examination that is used generally throughout the federal service," which "was developed by
the Civil Service Commission, not the Police Department," and which was "designed to test verbal ability, vocab-
ulary, reading and comprehension."

The validity of Test 21 was the sole issue before the court on the motions for summary judgment. The District
Court noted that there was no claim of "an intentional discrimination or purposeful discriminatory acts" but
only a claim that Test 21 bore no relationship to job performance and "has a highly discriminatory impact in
screening out black candidates." Respondents' evidence, the District Court said, warranted three conclusions:
"(a) The number of black police officers, while substantial, is not proportionate to the population mix of the
city. (b) A higher percentage of blacks fail the Test than whites. (c) The Test has not been validated to estab-
                                                                              HOW COURTS REVIEW RACIAL DISCRIMINATION | 719

lish its reliability for measuring subsequent job performance." This showing was deemed sufficient to shift the
burden of proof to the defendants in the action, petitioners here; but the court nevertheless concluded that on
the undisputed facts respondents were not entitled to relief. The District Court relied on several factors. Since
August 1969, 44% of new police force recruits had been black; that figure also represented the proportion of
blacks on the total force and was roughly equivalent to 20- to 29-year-old blacks in the 50-mile radius in which
the recruiting efforts of the Police Department had been concentrated. It was undisputed that the Department
had systematically and affirmatively sought to enroll black officers many of whom passed the test but failed to
report for duty. The District Court rejected the assertion that Test 21 was culturally slanted to favor whites and
was "satisfied that the undisputable facts prove the test to be reasonably and directly related to the requirements
of the police recruit training program and that it is neither so designed nor operates [sic] to discriminate against
otherwise qualified blacks." It was thus not necessary to show that Test 21 was not only a useful indicator of
training school performance but had also been validated in terms of job performance - "The lack of job perfor-
mance validation does not defeat the Test, given its direct relationship to recruiting and the valid part it plays in
this process." The District Court ultimately concluded that "[t]he proof is wholly lacking that a police officer
qualifies on the color of his skin rather than ability" and that the Department "should not be required on this
showing to lower standards or to abandon efforts to achieve excellence."

Having lost on both constitutional and statutory issues in the District Court, respondents brought the case to
the Court of Appeals claiming that their summary judgment motion, which rested on purely constitutional
grounds, should have been granted. The tendered constitutional issue was whether the use of Test 21 invidiously
discriminated against Negroes and hence denied them due process of law contrary to the commands of the Fifth
Amendment ... The Court of Appeals ... would be guided by Griggs v. Duke Power Co (1971), a case involving ...
Title VII ... and ... over a dissent ... reversed the judgment of the District Court and directed that respondents'
motion for partial summary judgment be granted. We granted the petition for certiorari ...

Because the Court of Appeals erroneously applied the legal standards applicable to Title VII cases in resolving
the constitutional issue before it, we reverse its judgment in respondents' favor ...

... We have never held that the constitutional standard for adjudicating claims of invidious racial discrimination
is identical to the standards applicable under Title VII, and we decline to do so today.

The central purpose of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is the prevention of official
conduct discriminating on the basis of race. It is also true that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amend-
ment contains an equal protection component prohibiting the United States from invidiously discriminating
between individuals or groups. Bolling v. Sharpe (1954). But our cases have not embraced the proposition that
a law or other official act, without regard to whether it reflects a racially discriminatory purpose, is unconstitu-
tional solely because it has a racially disproportionate impact.

Almost 100 years ago, Strauder v. West Virginia (1880), established that the exclusion of Negroes from grand
and petit juries in criminal proceedings violated the Equal Protection Clause, but the fact that a particular jury
or a series of juries does not statistically reflect the racial composition of the community does not in itself make
720 | HOW COURTS REVIEW RACIAL DISCRIMINATION

out an invidious discrimination forbidden by the Clause. "A purpose to discriminate must be present which may
be proven by systematic exclusion of eligible jurymen of the proscribed race or by unequal application of the law
to such an extent as to show intentional discrimination." Akins v. Texas (1945) ...

The school desegregation cases have also adhered to the basic equal protection principle that the invidious qual-
ity of a law claimed to be racially discriminatory must ultimately be traced to a racially discriminatory purpose
...

This is not to say that the necessary discriminatory racial purpose must be express or appear on the face of the
statute, or that a law's disproportionate impact is irrelevant in cases involving Constitution-based claims of racial
discrimination. A statute, otherwise neutral on its face, must not be applied so as invidiously to discriminate on
the basis of race. Yick Wo v. Hopkins (1886). It is also clear from the cases dealing with racial discrimination in
the selection of juries that the systematic exclusion of Negroes is itself such an "unequal application of the law
... as to show intentional discrimination." Akins v. Texas ...

Necessarily, an invidious discriminatory purpose may often be inferred from the totality of the relevant facts,
including the fact, if it is true, that the law bears more heavily on one race than another ... Nevertheless, we
have not held that a law, neutral on its face and serving ends otherwise within the power of government to pur-
sue, is invalid under the Equal Protection Clause simply because it may affect a greater proportion of one race
than of another. Disproportionate impact is not irrelevant, but it is not the sole touchstone of an invidious
racial discrimination forbidden by the Constitution. Standing alone, it does not trigger the rule, McLaughlin v.
Florida (1964), that racial classifications are to be subjected to the strictest scrutiny and are justifiable only by
the weightiest of considerations ...

As an initial matter, we have difficulty understanding how a law establishing a racially neutral qualification for
employment is nevertheless racially discriminatory and denies "any person ... equal protection of the laws" sim-
ply because a greater proportion of Negroes fail to qualify than members of other racial or ethnic groups ...
Test 21, which is administered generally to prospective Government employees, concededly seeks to ascertain
whether those who take it have acquired a particular level of verbal skill; and it is untenable that the Constitution
prevents the Government from seeking modestly to upgrade the communicative abilities of its employees rather
than to be satisfied with some lower level of competence, particularly where the job requires special ability to
communicate orally and in writing. Respondents, as Negroes, could no more successfully claim that the test
denied them equal protection than could white applicants who also failed. The conclusion would not be differ-
ent in the face of proof that more Negroes than whites had been disqualified by Test 21. That other Negroes
also failed to score well would, alone, not demonstrate that respondents individually were being denied equal
protection of the laws by the application of an otherwise valid qualifying test being administered to prospective
police recruits.

Nor on the facts of the case before us would the disproportionate impact of Test 21 warrant the conclusion that
it is a purposeful device to discriminate against Negroes and hence an infringement of the constitutional rights
of respondents as well as other black applicants. As we have said, the test is neutral on its face and rationally
may be said to serve a purpose the Government is constitutionally empowered to pursue. Even agreeing with
§                                                                             HOW COURTS REVIEW RACIAL DISCRIMINATION | 721

the District Court that the differential racial effect of Test 21 called for further inquiry, we think the District
Court correctly held that the affirmative efforts of the Metropolitan Police Department to recruit black officers,
the changing racial composition of the recruit classes and of the force in general, and the relationship of the test
to the training program negated any inference that the Department discriminated on the basis of race or that "a
police officer qualifies on the color of his skin rather than ability."

...

A rule that a statute designed to serve neutral ends is nevertheless invalid, absent compelling justification, if
in practice it benefits or burdens one race more than another would be far reaching and would raise serious
questions about, and perhaps invalidate, a whole range of tax, welfare, public service, regulatory, and licensing
statutes that may be more burdensome to the poor and to the average black than to the more affluent white.

Given that rule, such consequences would perhaps be likely to follow. However, in our view, extension of the
rule beyond those areas where it is already applicable by reason of statute, such as in the field of public employ-
ment, should await legislative prescription.

As we have indicated, it was error to direct summary judgment for respondents based on the Fifth Amendment.

...

The judgment of the Court of Appeals accordingly is reversed.

So ordered.

Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp.

Justice Powell delivered the opinion of the Court.

In 1971, respondent Metropolitan Housing Development Corporation (MHDC) applied to petitioner, the Vil-
lage of Arlington Heights, Ill., for the rezoning of a 15-acre parcel from single-family to multiple family clas-
722 | HOW COURTS REVIEW RACIAL DISCRIMINATION

sification. Using federal financial assistance, MHDC planned to build 190 clustered townhouse units for low-
and moderate-income tenants. The Village denied the rezoning request. MHDC, joined by other plaintiffs who
are also respondents here, brought suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.
They alleged that the denial was racially discriminatory and that it violated, inter alia, the Fourteenth Amend-
ment and the Fair Housing Act of 1968. Following a bench trial, the District Court entered judgment for the
Village and respondents appealed. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed, finding that the "ulti-
mate effect" of the denial was racially discriminatory, and that the refusal to rezone therefore violated the Four-
teenth Amendment. We granted the Village's petition for certiorari and now reverse.

Arlington Heights is a suburb of Chicago, located about 26 miles northwest of the downtown Loop area. Most
of the land in Arlington Heights is zoned for detached single-family homes, and this is in fact the prevailing land
use. The Village experienced substantial growth during the 1960's, but, like other communities in northwest
Cook County, its population of racial minority groups remained quite low. According to the 1970 census, only
27 of the Village's 64,000 residents were black.

The Clerics of St. Viator, a religious order (Order), own an 80-acre parcel just east of the center of Arlington
Heights. Part of the site is occupied by the Viatorian high school, and part by the Order's three-story novitiate
building, which houses dormitories and a Montessori school. Much of the site, however, remains vacant. Since
1959, when the Village first adopted a zoning ordinance, all the land surrounding the Viatorian property has
been zoned R-3, a single-family specification with relatively small minimum lot-size requirements. On three sides
of the Viatorian land there are single-family homes just across a street; to the east, the Viatorian property directly
adjoins the backyards of other single-family homes.

The Order decided in 1970 to devote some of its land to low- and moderate-income housing. Investigation
revealed that the most expeditious way to build such housing was to work through a nonprofit developer expe-
rienced in the use of federal housing subsidies under § 236 of the National Housing Act. MHDC is such a
developer. It was organized in 1968 by several prominent Chicago citizens for the purpose of building low-
and moderate-income housing throughout the Chicago area. In 1970, MHDC was in the process of building
one § 236 development near Arlington Heights, and already had provided some federally assisted housing on a
smaller scale in other parts of the Chicago area.

...

The planned development did not conform to the Village's zoning ordinance, and could not be built unless
Arlington Heights rezoned the parcel to R-5, its multiple family housing classification. Accordingly, MHDC
filed with the Village Plan Commission a petition for rezoning, accompanied by supporting materials describing
the development and specifying that it would be subsidized under § 236. The materials made clear that one
requirement under § 236 is an affirmative marketing plan designed to assure that a subsidized development is
racially integrated. MHDC also submitted studies demonstrating the need for housing of this type and analyz-
ing the probable impact of the development. To prepare for the hearings before the Plan Commission and to
                                                                              HOW COURTS REVIEW RACIAL DISCRIMINATION | 723

assure compliance with the Village building code, fire regulations, and related requirements, MHDC consulted
with the Village staff for preliminary review of the development. The parties have stipulated that every change
recommended during such consultations was incorporated into the plans.

During the spring of 1971, the Plan Commission considered the proposal at a series of three public meetings,
which drew large crowds. Although many of those attending were quite vocal and demonstrative in opposition
... a number of individuals and representatives of community groups spoke in support of rezoning. Some of the
comments, both from opponents and supporters, addressed what was referred to as the "social issue"--the desir-
ability or undesirability of introducing at this location in Arlington Heights low- and moderate income housing,
housing that would probably be racially integrated.

Many of the opponents, however, focused on the zoning aspects of the petition, stressing two arguments. First,
the area always had been zoned single-family, and the neighboring citizens had built or purchased there in
reliance on that classification. Rezoning threatened to cause a measurable drop in property value for neighbor-
ing sites. Second, the Village's apartment policy, adopted by the Village Board in 1962 and amended in 1970,
called for R-5 zoning primarily to serve as a buffer between single-family development and land uses thought
incompatible, such as commercial or manufacturing districts. [This project] did not meet this requirement ...

At the close of the third meeting, the Plan Commission adopted a motion to recommend to the Village's Board
of Trustees that it deny the request ... The Village Board met on September 28, 1971, to consider MHDC's
request and the recommendation of the Plan Commission. After a public hearing, the Board denied the rezon-
ing by a 6-1 vote.

The following June, MHDC and three Negro individuals filed this lawsuit against the Village, seeking declara-
tory and injunctive relief. A second nonprofit corporation and an individual of Mexican-American descent
intervened as plaintiffs.

The trial resulted in a judgment for petitioners. Assuming that MHDC had standing to bring the suit, the
District Court held that the petitioners were not motivated by racial discrimination or intent to discriminate
against low income groups when they denied rezoning, but rather by a desire "to protect property values and
the integrity of the Village's zoning plan." The District Court concluded also that the denial would not have a
racially discriminatory effect.

A divided Court of Appeals reversed ... ruled that the denial ... had racially discriminatory effects and could be
tolerated only if it served compelling interests. Neither the buffer policy nor the desire to protect property values
met this exacting standard. The court therefore concluded that the denial violated the Equal Protection Clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment.

...

Our decision last Term, in Washington v. Davis (1976) made it clear that official action will not be held uncon-
stitutional solely because it results in a racially disproportionate impact ... Proof of racially discriminatory intent
724 | HOW COURTS REVIEW RACIAL DISCRIMINATION

or purpose is required to show a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. Although some contrary indications
may be drawn from some of our cases, the holding in Davis reaffirmed a principle well established in a variety of
contexts.

Davis does not require a plaintiff to prove that the challenged action rested solely on racially discriminatory pur-
poses. Rarely can it be said that a legislature or administrative body operating under a broad mandate made a
decision motivated solely by a single concern, or even that a particular purpose was the "dominant" or "primary"
one. In fact, it is because legislators and administrators are properly concerned with balancing numerous com-
peting considerations that courts refrain from reviewing the merits of their decisions, absent a showing of arbi-
trariness or irrationality ... When there is a proof that a discriminatory purpose has been a motivating factor in
the decision, this judicial deference is no longer justified.

Determining whether invidious discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor demands a sensitive inquiry into
such circumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may be available. The impact of the official action--whether
it "bears more heavily on one race than another," Washington v. Davis,--may provide an important starting
point. Sometimes a clear pattern, unexplainable on grounds other than race, emerges from the effect of the state
action even when the governing legislation appears neutral on its face. Yick Wo v. Hopkins (1886) ...

Departures from the normal procedural sequence also might afford evidence that improper purposes are playing
a role ...

The foregoing summary identifies, without purporting to be exhaustive, subjects of proper inquiry in determin-
ing whether racially discriminatory intent existed. With these in mind, we now address the case before us.

This case was tried in the District Court and reviewed in the Court of Appeals before our decision in Washing­
ton v. Davis. The respondents proceeded on the erroneous theory that the Village's refusal to rezone carried a
racially discriminatory effect and was, without more, unconstitutional. But both courts below understood that
at least part of their function was to examine the purpose underlying the decision.

In making its findings on this issue, the District Court noted that some of the opponents ... might have been
motivated by opposition to minority groups. The court held, however, that the evidence "does not warrant the
conclusion that this motivated the defendants."

On appeal, the Court of Appeals focused primarily on respondents' claim that the Village's buffer policy had
not been consistently applied and was being invoked with a strictness here that could only demonstrate some
other underlying motive. The court concluded that the buffer policy, though not always applied with perfect
consistency, had on several occasions formed the basis for the Board's decision to deny other rezoning proposals.
"The evidence does not necessitate a finding that Arlington Heights administered this policy in a discriminatory
manner." The Court of Appeals therefore approved the District Court's findings concerning the Village's pur-
poses in denying rezoning to MHDC.

We also have reviewed the evidence ... [T]here is little about the sequence of events leading up to the decision
that would spark suspicion. The area around the Viatorian property has been zoned R-3 since 1959, the year
                                                                              HOW COURTS REVIEW RACIAL DISCRIMINATION | 725

when Arlington Heights first adopted a zoning map. Single-family homes surround the 80-acre site, and the Vil-
lage is undeniably committed to single-family homes as its dominant residential land use. The rezoning request
progressed according to the usual procedures. The Plan Commission even scheduled two additional hearings, at
least in part to accommodate MHDC and permit it to supplement its presentation with answers to questions
generated at the first hearing.

The statements by the Plan Commission and Village Board members, as reflected in the official minutes, focused
almost exclusively on the zoning aspects of the MHDC petition, and the zoning factors on which they relied are
not novel criteria in the Village's rezoning decisions. There is no reason to doubt that there has been reliance by
some neighboring property owners on the maintenance of single-family zoning in the vicinity. The Village orig-
inally adopted its buffer policy long before MHDC entered the picture, and has applied the policy too consis-
tently for us to infer discriminatory purpose from its application in this case. Finally, MHDC called one member
of the Village Board to the stand at trial. Nothing in her testimony supports an inference of invidious purpose.

In sum, the evidence does not warrant overturning the concurrent findings of both courts below. Respondents
simply failed to carry their burden of proving that discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor in the Vil-
lage's decision.

This conclusion ends the constitutional inquiry. The Court of Appeals' further finding that the Village's deci-
sion carried a discriminatory "ultimate effect" is without independent constitutional significance.

Reversed and remanded.

Shelley v. Kraemer

334 U.S. 1 (1948)

    Vote: 6-0
    Decision: Reversed
    Majority: Vinson, joined by Black, Frankfurter, Douglas, Murphy and Burton
    Not participating: Reed, Jackson, and Rutledge

Chief Justice Vinson delivered the Opinion of the Court.

These cases present for our consideration questions relating to the validity of court enforcement of private agree-
ments, generally described as restrictive covenants, which have as their purpose the exclusion of persons of des-
ignated race or color from the ownership or occupancy of real property. Basic constitutional issues of obvious
importance have been raised.

The first of these cases comes to this Court on certiorari to the Supreme Court of Missouri. On February 16,
1911, thirty out of a total of thirty-nine owners of property fronting both sides of Labadie Avenue between Tay-
lor Avenue and Cora Avenue in the city of St. Louis, signed an agreement, which was subsequently recorded,
providing in part:

      " ... the said property is hereby restricted to the use and occupancy for the term of Fifty (50) years from this date, so
      that it shall be a condition all the time and whether recited and referred to as [sic] not in subsequent conveyances
      and shall attach to the land as a condition precedent to the sale of the same, that hereafter no part of said property
      or any portion thereof shall be, for said term of Fifty-years, occupied by any person not of the Caucasian race, it
      being intended hereby to restrict the use of said property for said period of time against the occupancy as own-
      ers or tenants of any portion of said property for resident or other purpose by people of the Negro or Mongolian
      Race."

The entire district described in the agreement included fifty-seven parcels of land. The thirty owners who signed
the agreement held title to forty-seven parcels, including the particular parcel involved in this case. At the time
the agreement was signed, five of the parcels in the district were owned by Negroes. One of those had been occu-
pied by Negro families since 1882, nearly thirty years before the restrictive agreement was executed. The trial
court found that owners of seven out of nine homes on the south side of Labadie Avenue, within the restricted
district and "in the immediate vicinity" of the premises in question, had failed to sign the restrictive agreement
in 1911. At the time this action was brought, four of the premises were occupied by Negroes, and had been so
occupied for periods ranging from twenty-three to sixty-three years. A fifth parcel had been occupied by Negroes
until a year before this suit was instituted.
                                                                                                               DEFINING STATE ACTION | 727

On August 11, 1945, pursuant to a contract of sale, petitioners Shelley, who are Negroes, for valuable consider-
ation received from one Fitzgerald a warranty deed to the parcel in question. The trial court found that petition-
ers had no actual knowledge of the restrictive agreement at the time of the purchase.

On October 9, 1945, respondents, as owners of other property subject to the terms of the restrictive covenant,
brought suit in the Circuit Court of the city of St. Louis praying that petitioners Shelley be restrained from tak-
ing possession of the property and that judgment be entered divesting title out of petitioners Shelley and revest-
ing title in the immediate grantor or in such other person as the court should direct. The trial court denied the
requested relief on the ground that the restrictive agreement, upon which respondents based their action, had
never become final and complete because it was the intention of the parties to that agreement that it was not to
become effective until signed by all property owners in the district, and signatures of all the owners had never
been obtained.

The Supreme Court of Missouri sitting en banc reversed and directed the trial court to grant the relief for which
respondents had prayed. That court held the agreement effective and concluded that enforcement of its provi-
sions violated no rights guaranteed to petitioners by the Federal Constitution. At the time the court rendered its
decision, petitioners were occupying the property in question.

The second of the cases under consideration comes to this Court from the Supreme Court of Michigan. The
circumstances presented do not differ materially from the Missouri case ...

Whether the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment inhibits judicial enforcement by state
courts of restrictive covenants based on race or color is a question which this Court has not heretofore been
called upon to consider ...

[But it is] clear that restrictions on the right of occupancy of the sort sought to be created by the private agree-
ments in these cases could not be squared with the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment if imposed by
state statute or local ordinance. We do not understand respondents to urge the contrary ...

Here the particular patterns of discrimination and the areas in which the restrictions are to operate, are deter-
mined, in the first instance, by the terms of agreements among private individuals. Participation of the State
consists in the enforcement of the restrictions so defined. The crucial issue with which we are here confronted is
whether this distinction removes these cases from the operation of the prohibitory provisions of the Fourteenth
Amendment.

Since the decision of this Court in the Civil Rights Cases, 109 U.S. 3 (1883), the principle has become firmly
embedded in our constitutional law that the action inhibited by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment
is only such action as may fairly be said to be that of the States. That Amendment erects no shield against merely
private conduct, however discriminatory or wrongful.
728 | DEFINING STATE ACTION

We conclude, therefore, that the restrictive agreements standing alone cannot be regarded as a violation of any
rights guaranteed to petitioners by the Fourteenth Amendment. So long as the purposes of those agreements are
effectuated by voluntary adherence to their terms, it would appear clear that there has been no action by the state
and the provisions of the Amendment have not been violated.

But here there was more. These are cases in which the purposes of the agreements were secured only by judicial
enforcement by state courts of the restrictive terms of the agreements. The respondents urge that judicial
enforcement of private agreements does not amount to state action; or, in any event, the participation of the
State is so attenuated in character as not to amount to state action within the meaning of the Fourteenth
Amendment. Finally, it is suggested, even if the States in these cases may be deemed to have acted in the consti-
tutional sense, their action did not deprive petitioners of rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. We
move to a consideration of these matters.

... [T]he examples of state judicial action which have been held by this Court to violate the Amendment's com-
mands are not restricted to situations in which the judicial proceedings were found in some manner to be proce-
durally unfair. It has been recognized that the action of state courts in enforcing a substantive common-law rule
formulated by those courts, may result in the denial of rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, even
though the judicial proceedings in such cases may have been in complete accord with the most rigorous concep-
tions of procedural due process ...

The short of the matter is that from the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment until the present, it
has been the consistent ruling of this Court that the action of the States to which the Amendment has reference,
includes action of state courts and state judicial officials ... [I]t has never been suggested that state court action
is immunized from the operation of those provisions simply because the act is that of the judicial branch of the
state government.

Against this background of judicial construction, extending over a period of some three-quarters of a century,
we are called upon to consider whether enforcement by state courts of the restrictive agreements in these cases
may be deemed to be the acts of those States; and, if so, whether that action has denied these petitioners the
equal protection of the laws which the Amendment was intended to insure.

We have no doubt that there has been state action in these cases in the full and complete sense of the phrase.
The undisputed facts disclose that petitioners were willing purchasers of properties upon which they desired to
establish homes. The owners of the properties were willing sellers; and contracts of sale were accordingly con-
summated. It is clear that but for the active intervention of the state courts, supported by the full panoply of
state power, petitioners would have been free to occupy the properties in question without restraint.

...

The enforcement of the restrictive agreements by the state courts in these cases was directed pursuant to the
common-law policy of the States as formulated by those courts in earlier decisions. In the Missouri case, enforce-
ment of the covenant was directed in the first instance by the highest court of the State after the trial court had
determined the agreement to be invalid for want of the requisite number of signatures. In the Michigan case, the
                                                                                                               DEFINING STATE ACTION | 729

order of enforcement by the trial court was affirmed by the highest state court. The judicial action in each case
bears the clear and unmistakable imprimatur of the State. We have noted that previous decisions of this Court
have established the proposition that judicial action is not immunized from the operation of the Fourteenth
Amendment simply because it is taken pursuant to the state's common-law policy. Nor is the Amendment inef-
fective simply because the particular pattern of discrimination, which the State has enforced, was defined initially
by the terms of a private agreement ...

Respondents urge, however, that since the state courts stand ready to enforce restrictive covenants excluding
white persons from the ownership or occupancy of property covered by such agreements, enforcement of
covenants excluding colored persons may not be deemed a denial of equal protection of the laws to the colored
persons who are thereby affected. This contention does not bear scrutiny. The parties have directed our attention
to no case in which a court, state or federal, has been called upon to enforce a covenant excluding members of the
white majority from ownership or occupancy of real property on grounds of race or color. But there are more
fundamental considerations. The rights created by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment are, by its
terms, guaranteed to the individual. The rights established are personal rights. It is, therefore, no answer to these
petitioners to say that the courts may also be induced to deny white persons rights of ownership and occupancy
on grounds of race or color. Equal protection of the laws is not achieved through indiscriminate imposition of
inequalities.

Nor do we find merit in the suggestion that property owners who are parties to these agreements are denied
equal protection of the laws if denied access to the courts to enforce the terms of restrictive covenants and to
assert property rights which the state courts have held to be created by such agreements. The Constitution con-
fers upon no individual the right to demand action by the State which results in the denial of equal protection
of the laws to other individuals. And it would appear beyond question that the power of the State to create and
enforce property interests must be exercised within the boundaries defined by the Fourteenth Amendment. Cf.
Marsh v. Alabama (1946). [...]

730 | DEFINING STATE ACTION

Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority

365 U.S. 715 (1961)

    Vote: 6-3
    Decision: Reversed
    Majority: Clark, joined by Warren, Black, Douglas, and Brennan
    Concurrence: Stewart

    Dissent: Harlan, joined by and Whittaker

Mr. Justice Clark delivered the opinion of the Court.

In this action for declaratory and injunctive relief, it is admitted that the Eagle Coffee Shoppe, Inc., a restaurant
located within an off-street automobile parking building in Wilmington, Delaware, has refused to serve appel-
lant food or drink solely because he is a Negro. The parking building is owned and operated by the Wilmington
Parking Authority, an agency of the State of Delaware, and the restaurant is the Authority's lessee. Appellant
claims that such refusal abridges his rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
to the United States Constitution. The Supreme Court of Delaware has held that Eagle was acting in "a purely
private capacity" under its lease; that its action was not that of the Authority, and was not, therefore, state action
within the contemplation of the prohibitions contained in that Amendment ... On appeal here from the judg-
ment as having been based upon a statute construed unconstitutionally, we postponed consideration of the
question of jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1257(2), to the hearing on the merits ... We agree with the respon-
dents that the appeal should be dismissed, and accordingly the motion to dismiss is granted. However, since
the action of Eagle in excluding appellant raises an important constitutional question, the papers whereon the
appeal was taken are treated as a petition for a writ of certiorari, 28 U.S.C. § 2103, and the writ is granted. 28
U.S.C. § 1257(3). On the merits, we have concluded that the exclusion of appellant under the circumstances
shown to be present here was discriminatory state action in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Four-
teenth Amendment.

...

Agreeing to pay an annual rental of $28,700, Eagle covenanted to

      "occupy and use the leased premises in accordance with all applicable laws, statutes, ordinances and rules and reg-
      ulations of any federal, state or municipal authority."

Its lease, however, contains no requirement that its restaurant services be made available to the general public
on a nondiscriminatory basis, in spite of the fact that the Authority has power to adopt rules and regulations
respecting the use of its facilities except any as would impair the security of its bondholders ...

In August, 1958, appellant parked his car in the building and walked around to enter the restaurant by its front
door on Ninth Street. Having entered and sought service, he was refused it. Thereafter, he filed this declaratory
                                                                                                               DEFINING STATE ACTION | 731

judgment action in the Court of Chancery. On motions for summary judgment, based on the pleadings and affi-
davits, the Chancellor concluded, contrary to the contentions of respondents, that whether in fact the lease was
a "device" or was executed in good faith, it would not "serve to insulate the public authority from the force and
effect of the Fourteenth Amendment." ... The Supreme Court of Delaware reversed ... holding that Eagle, "in
the conduct of its business, is acting in a purely private capacity." It therefore denied appellant's claim under the
Fourteenth Amendment ... Delaware's highest court has thus denied the equal protection claim of the appellant
...

...

... It is clear, as it always has been since the Civil Rights Cases, supra, that "Individual invasion of individual rights
is not the subject matter of the amendment," at 109 U. S. 11, and that private conduct abridging individual
rights does no violence to the Equal Protection Clause unless, to some significant extent, the State, in any of its
manifestations, has been found to have become involved in it ... to fashion and apply a precise formula for recog-
nition of state responsibility under the Equal Protection Clause is an "impossible task" which "This Court has
never attempted." Kotch v. Board of River Port Pilot Comm'rs [1947]. Only by sifting facts and weighing circum-
stances can the nonobvious involvement of the State in private conduct be attributed its true significance.

... [T]he Delaware Supreme Court seems to have placed controlling emphasis on its conclusion, as to the accu-
racy of which there is doubt, that only some 15% of the total cost of the facility was "advanced" from public
funds; ... that the Authority had no original intent to place a restaurant in the building, it being only a happen-
stance resulting from the bidding; that Eagle expended considerable moneys on furnishings; that the restaurant's
main and marked public entrance is on Ninth Street, without any public entrance direct from the parking area;
and that

      "the only connection Eagle has with the public facility ... is the furnishing of the sum of $28,700 annually in the
      form of rent which is used by the Authority to defray a portion of the operating expense of an otherwise unprof-
      itable enterprise."

... While these factual considerations are indeed validly accountable aspects of the enterprise upon which the
State has embarked, we cannot say that they lead inescapably to the conclusion that state action is not present.
Their persuasiveness is diminished when evaluated in the context of other factors which must be acknowledged.

The land and building were publicly owned. As an entity, the building was dedicated to "public uses" in per-
formance of the Authority's "essential governmental functions." 22 Del.Code, §§ 501, 514. The costs of land
acquisition, construction, and maintenance are defrayed entirely from donations by the City of Wilmington,
from loans and revenue bonds, and from the proceeds of rentals and parking services out of which the loans and
bonds were payable. Assuming that the distinction would be significant, cf. Derrington v. Plummer, the com-
mercially leased areas were not surplus state property, but constituted a physically and financially integral and,
indeed, indispensable part of the State's plan to operate its project as a self-sustaining unit. Upkeep and mainte-
nance of the building, including necessary repairs, were responsibilities of the Authority, and were payable out
of public funds. It cannot be doubted that the peculiar relationship of the restaurant to the parking facility in
which it is located confers on each an incidental variety of mutual benefits. Guests of the restaurant are afforded
732 | DEFINING STATE ACTION

a convenient place to park their automobiles, even if they cannot enter the restaurant directly from the parking
area. Similarly, its convenience for diners may well provide additional demand for the Authority's parking facili-
ties. Should any improvements effected in the leasehold by Eagle become part of the realty, there is no possibility
of increased taxes' being passed on to it, since the fee is held by a tax-exempt government agency. Neither can it be
ignored, especially in view of Eagle's affirmative allegation that for it to serve Negroes would injure its business,
that profits earned by discrimination not only contribute to, but also are indispensable elements in, the financial
success of a governmental agency.

Addition of all these activities, obligations and responsibilities of the Authority, the benefits mutually conferred,
together with the obvious fact that the restaurant is operated as an integral part of a public building devoted
to a public parking service, indicates that degree of state participation and involvement in discriminatory action
which it was the design of the Fourteenth Amendment to condemn. It is irony amounting to grave injustice
that, in one part of a single building, erected and maintained with public funds by an agency of the State to
serve a public purpose, all persons have equal rights, while in another portion, also serving the public, a Negro
is a second-class citizen, offensive because of his race, without rights and unentitled to service, but at the same
time fully enjoys equal access to nearby restaurants in wholly privately owned buildings ... By its inaction, the
Authority, and through it the State, has not only made itself a party to the refusal of service, but has elected to
place its power, property and prestige behind the admitted discrimination. The State has so far insinuated itself
into a position of interdependence with Eagle that it must be recognized as a joint participant in the challenged
activity, which, on that account, cannot be considered to have been so "purely private" as to fall without the
scope of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Because readily applicable formulae may not be fashioned, the conclusions drawn from the facts and circum-
stances of this record are by no means declared as universal truths on the basis of which every state leasing agree-
ment is to be tested. Owing to the very "largeness" of government, a multitude of relationships might appear to
some to fall within the Amendment's embrace, but that, it must be remembered, can be determined only in the
framework of the peculiar facts or circumstances present. Therefore, respondents' prophecy of nigh universal
application of a constitutional precept so peculiarly dependent for its invocation upon appropriate facts fails to
take into account "Differences in circumstances [which] beget appropriate differences in law," Whitney v. State
Tax Comm'n, 309 U. S. 530, 309 U. S. 542. Specifically defining the limits of our inquiry, what we hold today
is that, when a State leases public property in the manner and for the purpose shown to have been the case here,
the proscriptions of the Fourteenth Amendment must be complied with by the lessee as certainly as though they
were binding covenants written into the agreement itself.
§                                                                                                              DEFINING STATE ACTION | 733

Reitman v. Mulkey

387 U.S. 369 (1967)

    Vote: 5-4
    Decision: Affirmed
    Majority: Warren, joined by Douglas, Brennan, White, and Fortas
    Dissent: Harlan, joined by Black, Clark, and Stewart

Justice White delivered the opinion of the Court.

The question here is whether Art. I, § 26, of the California Constitution denies "to any person ... the equal
protection of the laws" within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United
States. Section 26 of Art. I, an initiated measure submitted to the people as Proposition 14 in a statewide ballot
in 1964, provides in part as follows:

      "Neither the State nor any subdivision or agency thereof shall deny, limit or abridge, directly or indirectly, the right
      of any person, who is willing or desires to sell, lease or rent any part or all of his real property, to decline to sell,
      lease or rent such property to such person or persons as he, in his absolute discretion, chooses."

The real property covered by § 26 is limited to residential property, and contains an exception for state-owned
real estate.

The issue arose in two separate actions in the California courts, Mulkey v. Reitman and Prendergast v. Sny­
der. In Reitman, the Mulkeys, who are husband and wife and respondents here, sued under § 51 and § 52 of the
California Civil Code alleging that petitioners had refused to rent them an apartment solely on account of their
race. An injunction and damages were demanded. Petitioners moved for summary judgment on the ground that
§§ 51 and 52, insofar as they were the basis for the Mulkeys' action, had been rendered null and void by the adop-
tion of Proposition 14 after the filing of the complaint. The trial court granted the motion, and respondents
took the case to the California Supreme Court.

...
734 | DEFINING STATE ACTION

In the Prendergast case, respondents, husband and wife, filed suit in December, 1964, seeking to enjoin eviction
from their apartment; respondents alleged that the eviction was motivated by racial prejudice, and therefore
would violate § 51 and § 52 of the Civil Code. Petitioner Snyder cross-complained for a judicial declaration that
he was entitled to terminate the month-to-month tenancy even if his action was based on racial considerations.
In denying petitioner's motion for summary judgment, the trial court found it unnecessary to consider the valid-
ity of Proposition 14, because it concluded that judicial enforcement of an eviction based en racial grounds
would, in any event, violate the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. The cross-complaint
was dismissed with prejudice and petitioner Snyder appealed to the California Supreme Court, which consid-
ered the case along with Mulkey v. Reitman. That court, in reversing the Reitman case, held that Art. I, § 26,
was invalid as denying the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. 64 Cal. 2d
529, 413 P.2d 825. For similar reasons, the court affirmed the judgment in the Prendergast case. 64 Cal. 2d 877,
413 P.2d 847. We granted certiorari because the cases involve an important issue arising under the Fourteenth
Amendment.

We affirm the judgments of the California Supreme Court. We first turn to the opinion of that court in Reit­
man, which quite properly undertook to examine the constitutionality of § 26 in terms of its "immediate
objective" its "ultimate effect" and its "historical context and the conditions existing prior to its enactment."
Judgments such as these we have frequently undertaken ourselves ...

[Describes the California Supreme Court decision ... ]

There is no sound reason for rejecting this judgment. Petitioners contend that the California court has miscon-
strued the Fourteenth Amendment, since the repeal of any statute prohibiting racial discrimination, which is
constitutionally permissible, may be said to "authorize" and "encourage" discrimination because it makes legally
permissible that which was formerly proscribed ... [The California Supreme Court] did not read either our cases
or the Fourteenth Amendment as establishing an automatic constitutional barrier to the repeal of an existing
law prohibiting racial discriminations in housing; nor did the court rule that a State may never put in statutory
form an existing policy of neutrality with respect to private discrimination. What the court below did was first
to reject the notion that the State was required to have a statute prohibiting racial discriminations in housing.
Second, it held the intent of § 26 was to authorize private racial discriminations in the housing market ... and
to create a constitutional right to discriminate on racial grounds in the sale and leasing of real property. Hence,
the court dealt with § 26 as though it expressly authorized and constitutionalized the private right to discrimi-
nate. Third, the court assessed the ultimate impact of § 26 in the California environment, and concluded that
the section would encourage and significantly involve the State in private racial discrimination contrary to the
Fourteenth Amendment.

The California court could very reasonably conclude that § 26 would and did have wider impact than a mere
repeal of existing statutes. Section 26 ... announced the constitutional right of any person to decline to sell or
lease his real property to anyone to whom he did not desire to sell or lease ... But the section struck more deeply
and more widely. Private discriminations in housing were now not only free from [statutory authority], but they
also enjoyed a far different status than was true before the passage of those statutes. The right to discriminate,
including the right to discriminate on racial grounds, was now embodied in the State's basic charter, immune
§                                                                                                              DEFINING STATE ACTION | 735

from legislative, executive, or judicial regulation at any level of the state government. Those practicing racial dis-
criminations need no longer rely solely on their personal choice. They could now invoke express constitutional
authority, free from censure or interference of any kind from official sources.

This Court has never attempted the "impossible task" of formulating an infallible test for determining whether
the State "in any of its manifestations" has become significantly involved in private discriminations. "Only by
sifting facts and weighing circumstances" on a case-by-case basis can a "nonobvious involvement of the State in
private conduct be attributed its true significance." Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, (1961). Here, the
California court, armed as it was with the knowledge of the facts and circumstances concerning the passage and
potential impact of § 26, and familiar with the milieu in which that provision would operate, has determined
that the provision would involve the State in private racial discriminations to an unconstitutional degree. We
accept this holding of the California court.

... Here we are dealing with a provision which does not just repeal an existing law forbidding private racial dis-
criminations. Section 26 was intended to authorize, and does authorize, racial discrimination in the housing
market. The right to discriminate is now one of the basic policies of the State. The California Supreme Court
believes that the section will significantly encourage and involve the State in private discriminations. We have
been presented with no persuasive considerations indicating that these judgments should be overturned.

Affirmed.

Moose Lodge v. Irvis

407 U.S. 163 (1972)

    Vote: 6-3
    Decision: Reversed and remanded
    Majority: Rehnquist, joined by Burger, Stewart, White, Blackmun, and Powell
    Dissent: Douglas, joined by Marshall
    Dissent: Brennan, joined by Marshall

Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court.

Appellee Irvis, a Negro (hereafter appellee), was refused service by appellant Moose Lodge, a local branch of the
national fraternal organization located in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Appellee then brought this action under 42
U.S.C. § 1983 for injunctive relief in the United States District Court ... He claimed that, because the Pennsyl-
vania liquor board had issued appellant Moose Lodge a private club license that authorized the sale of alcoholic
beverages on its premises, the refusal of service to him was "state action" for the purposes of the Equal Protection
736 | DEFINING STATE ACTION

Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. He named both Moose Lodge and the Pennsylvania Liquor Authority
as defendants, seeking injunctive relief that would have required the defendant liquor board to revoke Moose
Lodge's license so long as it continued its discriminatory practices. Appellee sought no damages.

A three-judge district court, convened at appellee's request, upheld his contention on the merits, and entered a
decree declaring invalid the liquor license issued to Moose Lodge "as long as it follows a policy of racial discrimi-
nation in its membership or operating policies or practices." Moose Lodge alone appealed from the decree ...

...

The District Court did not find, and it could not have found on this record, that appellee had sought member-
ship in Moose Lodge and been denied it. Appellant contends that, because of this fact, appellee had no standing
to litigate the constitutional issue respecting Moose Lodge's membership requirements, and that, therefore, the
decree of the court below erred insofar as it decided that issue.

Any injury to appellee from the conduct of Moose Lodge stemmed not from the lodge's membership require-
ments, but from its policies with respect to the serving of guests of members. Appellee has standing to seek
redress for injuries done to him, but may not seek redress for injuries done to others.

...

Because appellee had no standing to litigate a constitutional claim arising out of Moose Lodge's membership
practices, the District Court erred in reaching that issue on the merits. But it did not err in reaching the constitu-
tional claim of appellee that Moose Lodge's guest service practices under these circumstances violated the Four-
teenth Amendment. Nothing in the positions taken by the parties since the entry of the District Court decree
has mooted that claim, and we therefore turn to its disposition.

...

Appellee, while conceding the right of private clubs to choose members upon a discriminatory basis, asserts that
the licensing of Moose Lodge to serve liquor by the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board amounts to such state
involvement with the club's activities as to make its discriminatory practices forbidden by the Equal Protection
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The relief sought and obtained by appellee in the District Court was
an injunction forbidding the licensing by the liquor authority of Moose Lodge until it ceased its discriminatory
practices. We conclude that Moose Lodge's refusal to serve food and beverages to a guest by reason of the fact
that he was a Negro does not, under the circumstances here presented, violate the Fourteenth Amendment.

The Court has never held, of course, that discrimination by an otherwise private entity would be violative of
the Equal Protection Clause if the private entity receives any sort of benefit or service at all from the State, or if
it is subject to state regulation in any degree whatever. Since state-furnished services include such necessities of
life as electricity, water, and police and fire protection, such a holding would utterly emasculate the distinction
between private, as distinguished from state, conduct set forth in The Civil Rights Cases, supra, and adhered to in
                                                                                                               DEFINING STATE ACTION | 737

subsequent decisions. Our holdings indicate that, where the impetus for the discrimination is private, the State
must have "significantly involved itself with invidious discriminations," (1967), in order for the discriminatory
action to fall within the ambit of the constitutional prohibition.

...

With the exception hereafter noted, the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board plays absolutely no part in estab-
lishing or enforcing the membership or guest policies of the club that it licenses to serve liquor. There is no sug-
gestion in this record that Pennsylvania law, either as written or as applied, discriminates against minority groups
either in their right to apply for club licenses themselves or in their right to purchase and be served liquor in
places of public accommodation. The only effect that the state licensing of Moose Lodge to serve liquor can be
said to have on the right of any other Pennsylvanian to buy or be served liquor on premises other than those of
Moose Lodge is that, for some purposes, club licenses are counted in the maximum number of licenses that may
be issued in a given municipality ...

... We therefore hold that, with the exception hereafter noted, the operation of the regulatory scheme enforced
by the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board does not sufficiently implicate the State in the discriminatory guest
policies of Moose Lodge to make the latter "state action" within the ambit of the Equal Protection Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment.

    Vote: 8-0
    Decision: Affirmed
    Majority: Stewarts, joined by Burger, Blackmun, Powell and Rehnquist
    Concurrence: Marshall, joined by Brennan and White

Justice Stevens took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.

Mr. Justice Steward delivered the opinion of the Court.

The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has been judicially found to have
violated the Fifth Amendment and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in connection with the selection of sites for
public housing in the city of Chicago. The issue before us is whether the remedial order of the federal trial court
may extend beyond Chicago's territorial boundaries.

This extended litigation began in 1966, when the respondents, six Negro tenants in or applicants for public
housing in Chicago, brought separate actions on behalf of themselves and all other Negro tenants and applicants
similarly situated against the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) and HUD. The complaint filed against CHA
in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleged that, between 1950 and 1965,
substantially all of the sites for family public housing selected by CHA and approved by the Chicago City Coun-
cil were "at the time of such selection, and are now," located "within the areas known as the Negro Ghetto." The
respondents further alleged that CHA deliberately selected the sites to "avoid the placement of Negro families
in white neighborhoods" in violation of federal statutes and the Fourteenth Amendment. In a companion suit
against HUD, the respondents claimed that it had "assisted in the carrying on and continues to assist in the car-
rying on of a racially discriminatory public housing system within the City of Chicago" by providing financial
assistance and other support for CHA's discriminatory housing projects.

The District Court stayed the action against HUD pending resolution of the CHA suit. In February, 1969, the
court entered summary judgment against CHA on the ground that it had violated the respondents' constitu-
tional rights by selecting public housing sites and assigning tenants on the basis of race. Gautreaux v. Chicago
Housing Authority. Uncontradicted evidence submitted to the District Court established that the public hous-
ing system operated by CHA was racially segregated, with four overwhelmingly white projects located in white
neighborhoods and with 99 1/2% of the remaining family units located in Negro neighborhoods and 99% of
those units occupied by Negro tenants. Id. at 910. In order to prohibit future violations and to remedy the
effects of past unconstitutional practices, the court directed CHA to build its next 700 family units in predomi-
nantly white areas of Chicago, and thereafter to locate at least 75% of its new family public housing in predom-
inantly white areas inside Chicago or in Cook County. Gautreaux v. Chicago Housing Authority. In addition,
CHA was ordered to modify its tenant assignment and site selection procedures and to use its best efforts to
increase the supply of dwelling units as rapidly as possible in conformity with the judgment.
                                                                                                               DEFINING STATE ACTION | 739

The District Court then turned to the action against HUD. In September, 1970, it granted HUD's motion to
dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted. The
United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed, and ordered the District Court to enter sum-
mary judgment for the respondents, holding that HUD had violated both the Fifth Amendment and § 601 of
the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 252, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, by knowingly sanctioning and assisting CHA's
racially discriminatory public housing program. Gautreaux v. Romney.

On remand, the trial court addressed the difficult problem of providing an effective remedy for the racially seg-
regated public housing system that had been created by the unconstitutional conduct of CHA and HUD. The
court granted the respondents' motion to consolidate the CHA and HUD cases and ordered the parties to for-
mulate "a comprehensive plan to remedy the past effects of unconstitutional site selection procedures." The
order directed the parties to "provide the Court with as broad a range of alternatives as seem ... feasible," includ-
ing "alternatives which are not confined in their scope to the geographic boundary of the City of Chicago."
After consideration of the plans submitted by the parties and the evidence adduced in their support, the court
denied the respondents' motion to consider metropolitan area relief and adopted the petitioner's proposed order
requiring HUD to use its best efforts to assist CHA in increasing the supply of dwelling units and enjoining
HUD from funding family public housing programs in Chicago that were inconsistent with the previous judg-
ment entered against CHA. The court found that metropolitan area relief was unwarranted because "the wrongs
were committed within the limits of Chicago and solely against residents of the City" and there were no alle-
gations that "CHA and HUD discriminated or fostered racial discrimination in the suburbs." On appeal, the
Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, with one judge dissenting, reversed and remanded the case for

"the adoption of a comprehensive metropolitan area plan that will not only disestablish the segregated public
housing system in the City of Chicago ... but will increase the supply of dwelling units as rapidly as possible."

503 F.2d 930, 939. Shortly before the Court of Appeals announced its decision, this Court, in Milliken v.
Bradley ... had reversed a judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit that had approved a plan
requiring the consolidation of 54 school districts in the Detroit metropolitan area to remedy racial discrimi-
nation in the operation of the Detroit public schools. Understanding Milliken "to hold that the relief sought
there would be an impractical and unreasonable overresponse to a violation limited to one school district," the
Court of Appeals concluded that the Milliken decision did not bar a remedy extending beyond the limits of
Chicago in the present case because of the equitable and administrative distinctions between a metropolitan
public housing plan and the consolidation of numerous local school districts. 503 F.2d at 935-936. In addition,
the appellate court found that, in contrast to Milliken, there was evidence of suburban discrimination and of
the likelihood that there had been an "extra-city impact" of the petitioner's "intra-city discrimination." Id. at
936-937, 939-940. The appellate court's determination that a remedy extending beyond the city limits was both
"necessary and equitable" rested in part on the agreement of the parties and the expert witnesses that "the met-
ropolitan area is a single relevant locality for low rent housing purposes and that a city-only remedy will not
work." Id. at 936-937. HUD subsequently sought review in this Court of the permissibility in light of Mil­
liken of "inter-district relief for discrimination in public housing in the absence of a finding of an inter-district
violation." We granted certiorari to consider this important question. 421 U.S. 962.
740 | DEFINING STATE ACTION

In Milliken v. Bradley, supra, this Court considered the proper scope of a federal court's equity decree in the
context of a school desegregation case ... After finding that constitutional violations committed by the Detroit
School Board and state officials had contributed to racial segregation in the Detroit schools, the trial court had pro­
ceeded to the formulation of a remedy. Although there had been neither proof of unconstitutional actions on the part
of neighboring school districts nor a demonstration that the Detroit violations had produced significant segregative
effects in those districts, the court established a desegregation panel and ordered it to prepare a remedial plan consoli­
dating the Detroit school system and 53 independent suburban school districts. Id. at 733-734. The Court of Appeals
for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the desegregation order ... This Court reversed the Court of Appeals, holding that the
multidistrict remedy contemplated by the desegregation order was an erroneous exercise of the equitable authority
of the federal courts.

Although the Milliken opinion discussed the many practical problems that would be encountered in the con-
solidation of numerous school districts by judicial decree, the Court's decision rejecting the metropolitan area
desegregation order was actually based on fundamental limitations on the remedial powers of the federal courts
to restructure the operation of local and state governmental entities. That power is not plenary. It "may be exer-
cised only on the basis of a constitutional violation.'" quoting Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education
... Once a constitutional violation is found, a federal court is required to tailor "the scope of the remedy" to fit "the
nature and extent of the constitutional violation." Swann, supra ... In Milliken, there was no finding of unconstitu­
tional action on the part of the suburban school officials and no demonstration that the violations committed in the
operation of the Detroit school system had had any significant segregative effects in the suburbs. The desegregation
order in Milliken requiring the consolidation of local school districts in the Detroit metropolitan area thus consti­
tuted direct federal judicial interference with local governmental entities without the necessary predicate of a consti­
tutional violation by those entities or of the identification within them of any significant segregative effects resulting
from the Detroit school officials' unconstitutional conduct. Under these circumstances, the Court held that the inter-
district decree was impermissible because it was not commensurate with the constitutional violation to be repaired.

Since the Milliken decision was based on basic limitations on the exercise of the equity power of the federal
courts, and not on a balancing of particular considerations presented by school desegregation cases, it is apparent
that the Court of Appeals erred in finding Milliken inapplicable on that ground to this public housing case.
The school desegregation context of the Milliken case is nonetheless important to an understanding of its dis-
cussion of the limitations on the exercise of federal judicial power ... The District Court's desegregation order
in Milliken was held to be an impermissible remedy not because it envisioned relief against a wrongdoer extend-
ing beyond the city in which the violation occurred, but because it contemplated a judicial decree restructuring
the operation of local governmental entities that were not implicated in any constitutional violation.

The question presented in this case concerns only the authority of the District Court to order HUD to take
remedial action outside the city limits of Chicago. HUD does not dispute the Court of Appeals' determination
that it violated the Fifth Amendment and § 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by knowingly funding CHA's
racially discriminatory family public housing program, nor does it question the appropriateness of a remedial
order designed to alleviate the effects of past segregative practices by requiring that public housing be developed
in areas that will afford respondents an opportunity to reside in desegregated neighborhoods. But HUD con-
tends that the Milliken decision bars a remedy affecting its conduct beyond the boundaries of Chicago for two
                                                                                                                DEFINING STATE ACTION | 741

reasons. First, it asserts that such a remedial order would constitute the grant of relief incommensurate with the
constitutional violation to be repaired. And second, it claims that a decree regulating HUD's conduct beyond
Chicago's boundaries would inevitably have the effect of "consolidat[ing] for remedial purposes" governmental
units not implicated in HUD's and CHA's violations.

We reject the contention that, since HUD's constitutional and statutory violations were committed in
Chicago, Milliken precludes an order against HUD that will affect its conduct in the greater metropolitan area.
The critical distinction between HUD and the suburban school districts in Milliken is that HUD has been
found to have violated the Constitution. That violation provided the necessary predicate for the entry of a reme-
dial order against HUD and, indeed, imposed a duty on the District Court to grant appropriate relief ... As the
Court observed in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education:

"Once a right and a violation have been shown, the scope of a district court's equitable powers to remedy past
wrongs is broad, for breadth and flexibility are inherent in equitable remedies."

Nothing in the Milliken decision suggests a per se rule that federal courts lack authority to order parties found to
have violated the Constitution to undertake remedial efforts beyond the municipal boundaries of the city where
the violation occurred ...

In this case, it is entirely appropriate and consistent with Milliken to order CHA and HUD to attempt to create
housing alternatives for the respondents in the Chicago suburbs. Here, the wrong committed by HUD confined
the respondents to segregated public housing. The relevant geographic area for purposes of the respondents'
housing options is the Chicago housing market, not the Chicago city limits.

...

An order directing HUD to use its discretion under the various federal housing programs to foster projects
located in white areas of the Chicago housing market would be consistent with and supportive of well estab-
lished federal housing policy.

...

A remedial plan designed to insure that HUD will utilize its funding and administrative powers in a manner
consistent with affording relief to the respondents need not abrogate the role of local governmental units in the
federal housing-assistance programs. Under the major housing programs in existence at the time the District
Court entered its remedial order pertaining to HUD, local housing authorities and municipal governments had
to make application for funds or approve the use of funds in the locality before HUD could make housing assis-
tance money available. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 1415(7)(b), 1421b(a)(2). An order directed solely to HUD would not
force unwilling localities to apply for assistance under these programs, but would merely reinforce the regula-
tions guiding HUD's determination of which of the locally authorized projects to assist with federal funds.

...
742 | DEFINING STATE ACTION

Use of the § 8 program to expand low income housing opportunities outside areas of minority concentration
would not have a coercive effect on suburban municipalities. For under the program, the local governmental
units retain the right to comment on specific assistance proposals, to reject certain proposals that are inconsistent
with their approved housing assistance plans, and to require that zoning and other land use restrictions be
adhered to by builders.

In sum, there is no basis for the petitioner's claim that court-ordered metropolitan area relief in this case would
be impermissible as a matter of law under the Milliken decision. In contrast to the desegregation order in that
case, a metropolitan area relief order directed to HUD would not consolidate or in any way restructure local
governmental units. The remedial decree would neither force suburban governments to submit public housing
proposals to HUD nor displace the rights and powers accorded local government entities under federal or state
housing statutes or existing land use laws. The order would have the same effect on the suburban governments
as a discretionary decision by HUD to use its statutory powers to provide the respondents with alternatives to
the racially segregated Chicago public housing system created by CHA and HUD.

Since we conclude that a metropolitan area remedy in this case is not impermissible as a matter of law, we affirm
the judgment of the Court of Appeals remanding the case to the District Court "for additional evidence and for
further consideration of the issue of metropolitan area relief." 503 F.2d at 940. Our determination that the Dis-
trict Court has the authority to direct HUD to engage in remedial efforts in the metropolitan area outside the
city limits of Chicago should not be interpreted as requiring a metropolitan area order. The nature and scope
of the remedial decree to be entered on remand is a matter for the District Court in the exercise of its equitable
discretion, after affording the parties an opportunity to present their views.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals remanding this case to the District Court is affirmed, but further pro-
ceedings in the District Court are to be consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case requires us to decide whether the use of race as a factor in student admissions by the University of
Michigan Law School (Law School) is unlawful.

The Law School ranks among the Nation's top law schools. It receives more than 3,500 applications each year
for a class of around 350 students. Seeking to "admit a group of students who individually and collectively are
among the most capable," the Law School looks for individuals with "substantial promise for success in law
school" and "a strong likelihood of succeeding in the practice of law and contributing in diverse ways to the well-
being of others." More broadly, the Law School seeks "a mix of students with varying backgrounds and experi-
ences who will respect and learn from each other." ...

The hallmark of [the school's] policy is its focus on academic ability coupled with a flexible assessment of appli-
cants' talents, experiences, and potential "to contribute to the learning of those around them." The policy
requires admissions officials to evaluate each applicant based on all the information available in the file, including
a personal statement, letters of recommendation, and an essay describing the ways in which the applicant will
contribute to the life and diversity of the Law School. In reviewing an applicant's file, admissions officials must
consider the applicant's undergraduate grade point average (GPA) and Law School Admissions Test (LSAT)
score because they are important (if imperfect) predictors of academic success in law school. The policy stresses
that "no applicant should be admitted unless we expect that applicant to do well enough to graduate with no
serious academic problems."

The policy makes clear, however, that even the highest possible score does not guarantee admission to the Law
School. Nor does a low score automatically disqualify an applicant. Rather, the policy requires admissions offi-
cials to look beyond grades and test scores to other criteria that are important to the Law School's educational
744 | EDUCATIONAL AFFIRMATIVE ACTION

objectives. So-called "soft' variables" such as "the enthusiasm of recommenders, the quality of the undergraduate
institution, the quality of the applicant's essay, and the areas and difficulty of undergraduate course selection"
are all brought to bear in assessing an "applicant's likely contributions to the intellectual and social life of the
institution."

The policy aspires to "achieve that diversity which has the potential to enrich everyone's education and thus
make a law school class stronger than the sum of its parts." Id., at 118. The policy does not restrict the types of
diversity contributions eligible for "substantial weight" in the admissions process, but instead recognizes "many
possible bases for diversity admissions." Id., at 118, 120. The policy does, however, reaffirm the Law School's
longstanding commitment to "one particular type of diversity," that is, "racial and ethnic diversity with spe-
cial reference to the inclusion of students from groups which have been historically discriminated against, like
African-Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans, who without this commitment might not be represented
in our student body in meaningful numbers." Id., at 120. By enrolling a " `critical mass' of [underrepresented]
minority students," the Law School seeks to "ensur[e] their ability to make unique contributions to the charac-
ter of the Law School." Id., at 120-121.

The policy does not define diversity "solely in terms of racial and ethnic status." Id., at 121. Nor is the policy
"insensitive to the competition among all students for admission to the [L]aw [S]chool." Ibid. Rather, the policy
seeks to guide admissions officers in "producing classes both diverse and academically outstanding, classes made
up of students who promise to continue the tradition of outstanding contribution by Michigan Graduates to
the legal profession." Ibid.

...

Petitioner Barbara Grutter is a white Michigan resident who applied to the Law School in 1996 with a 3.8 GPA
and 161 LSAT score. The Law School initially placed petitioner on a waiting list, but subsequently rejected her
application. In December 1997, petitioner filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District
of Michigan against the Law School, the Regents of the University of Michigan, Lee Bollinger (Dean of the Law
School from 1987 to 1994, and President of the University of Michigan from 1996 to 2002), Jeffrey Lehman
(Dean of the Law School), and Dennis Shields (Director of Admissions at the Law School from 1991

until 1998). Petitioner alleged that respondents discriminated against her on the basis of race in violation of the
Fourteenth Amendment; Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 252, 42 U. S. C. § 2000d; and Rev.
Stat. § 1977, as amended, 42 U. S. C. § 1981.

Petitioner further alleged that her application was rejected because the Law School uses race as a "predominant"
factor, giving applicants who belong to certain minority groups "a significantly greater chance of admission than
students with similar credentials from disfavored racial groups." App.33-34. Petitioner also alleged that respon-
dents "had no compelling interest to justify their use of race in the admissions process." Id., at 34. Petitioner
requested compensatory and punitive damages, an order requiring the Law School to offer her admission, and
an injunction prohibiting the Law School from continuing to discriminate on the basis of race. Id., at 36..
                                                                                              EDUCATIONAL AFFIRMATIVE ACTION | 745

In the end, the District Court concluded that the Law School's use of race as a factor in admissions decisions
was unlawful. Applying strict scrutiny, the District Court determined that the Law School's asserted interest in
assembling a diverse student body was not compelling because "the attainment of a racially diverse class ... was
not recognized as such by Bakke and it is not a remedy for past discrimination." Id., at 246a. The District Court
went on to hold that even if diversity were compelling, the Law School had not narrowly tailored its use of race
to further that interest. The District Court granted petitioner's request for declaratory relief and enjoined the
Law School from using race as a factor in its admissions decisions ...

Sitting en banc, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's judgment and vacated the injunction. The
Court of Appeals first held that Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke was binding precedent establishing diversity
as a compelling state interest.

...

We last addressed the use of race in public higher education over 25 years ago. In the landmark Bakke case, we
reviewed a racial set-aside program that reserved 16 out of 100 seats in a medical school class for members of
certain minority groups. (1978) ... The only holding for the Court in Bakke was that a "State has a substantial
interest that legitimately may be served by a properly devised admissions program involving the competitive con-
sideration of race and ethnic origin." Id., at 320.

We have held that all racial classifications imposed by government "must be analyzed by a reviewing court under
strict scrutiny." Adarand (1995). This means that such classifications are constitutional only if they are narrowly
tailored to further compelling governmental interests."Absent searching judicial inquiry into the justification for
such race-based measures," we have no way to determine what "classifications are `benign' or `remedial' and what
classifications are in fact motivated by illegitimate notions of racial inferiority or simple racial politics." Rich­
mond v. A. Croson Co. (1989) (plurality opinion). We apply strict scrutiny to all racial classifications to " `smoke
out' illegitimate uses of race by assuring that [government] is pursuing a goal important enough to warrant use
of a highly suspect tool." Croson.

Strict scrutiny is not "strict in theory, but fatal in fact." Adarand. Although all governmental uses of race are
subject to strict scrutiny, not all are invalidated by it. As we have explained, "whenever the government treats
any person unequally because of his or her race, that person has suffered an injury that falls squarely within
the language and spirit of the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection." Adarand. But that observation
"says nothing about the ultimate validity of any particular law; that determination is the job of the court apply-
ing strict scrutiny." Id. When race-based action is necessary to further a compelling governmental interest, such
action does not violate the constitutional guarantee of equal protection so long as the narrow-tailoring require-
ment is also satisfied.

...

With these principles in mind, we turn to the question whether the Law School's use of race is justified by a
compelling state interest. Before this Court, as they have throughout this litigation, respondents assert only one
746 | EDUCATIONAL AFFIRMATIVE ACTION

justification for their use of race in the admissions process: obtaining "the educational benefits that flow from a
diverse student body." In other words, the Law School asks us to recognize, in the context of higher education, a
compelling state interest in student body diversity.

We first wish to dispel the notion that the Law School's argument has been foreclosed, either expressly or implic-
itly, by our affirmative-action cases decided since Bakke ... But we have never held that the only governmental
use of race that can survive strict scrutiny is remedying past discrimination. Nor, since Bakke, have we directly
addressed the use of race in the context of public higher education. Today, we hold that the Law School has a
compelling interest in attaining a diverse student body.

The Law School's educational judgment that such diversity is essential to its educational mission is one to which
we defer. The Law School's assessment that diversity will, in fact, yield educational benefits is substantiated by
respondents and their amici. Our scrutiny of the interest asserted by the Law School is no less strict for taking
into account complex educational judgments in an area that lies primarily within the expertise of the university.
Our holding today is in keeping with our tradition of giving a degree of deference to a university's academic deci-
sions, within constitutionally prescribed limits.

We have long recognized that, given the important purpose of public education and the expansive freedoms of
speech and thought associated with the university environment, universities occupy a special niche in our con-
stitutional tradition. In announcing the principle of student body diversity as a compelling state interest, Justice
Powell invoked our cases recognizing a constitutional dimension, grounded in the First Amendment, of educa-
tional autonomy: "The freedom of a university to make its own judgments as to education includes the selection
of its student body." Bakke. From this premise, Justice Powell reasoned that by claiming "the right to select those
students who will contribute the most to the `robust exchange of ideas,' " a university "seek[s] to achieve a goal
that is of paramount importance in the fulfillment of its mission." Our conclusion that the Law School has a
compelling interest in a diverse student body is informed by our view that attaining a diverse student body is at
the heart of the Law School's proper institutional mission, and that "good faith" on the part of a university is
"presumed" absent "a showing to the contrary."

As part of its goal of "assembling a class that is both exceptionally academically qualified and broadly diverse,"
the Law School seeks to "enroll a `critical mass' of minority students." The Law School's interest is not simply
"to assure within its student body some specified percentage of a particular group merely because of its race or
ethnic origin." Bakke (opinion of Powell, J.). That would amount to outright racial balancing, which is patently
unconstitutional. Bakke; Freeman v. Pitts (1992) ("Racial balance is not to be achieved for its own sake"); Rich­
mond v. A. Croson Co. Rather, the Law School's concept of critical mass is defined by reference to the educational
benefits that diversity is designed to produce.

These benefits are substantial. As the District Court emphasized, the Law School's admissions policy promotes
"cross-racial understanding," helps to break down racial stereotypes, and "enables [students] to better under-
stand persons of different races." These benefits are "important and laudable," because "classroom discussion is
livelier, more spirited, and simply more enlightening and interesting" when the students have "the greatest pos-
sible variety of backgrounds."
                                                                                              EDUCATIONAL AFFIRMATIVE ACTION | 747

...

In order to cultivate a set of leaders with legitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry, it is necessary that the path to
leadership be visibly open to talented and qualified individuals of every race and ethnicity. All members of our
heterogeneous society must have confidence in the openness and integrity of the educational institutions that
provide this training. As we have recognized, law schools "cannot be effective in isolation from the individuals
and institutions with which the law interacts." See Sweatt v. Painter. Access to legal education (and thus the legal
profession) must be inclusive of talented and qualified individuals of every race and ethnicity, so that all mem-
bers of our heterogeneous society may participate in the educational institutions that provide the training and
education necessary to succeed in America.

The Law School does not premise its need for critical mass on "any belief that minority students always (or even
consistently) express some characteristic minority viewpoint on any issue." To the contrary, diminishing the
force of such stereotypes is both a crucial part of the Law School's mission, and one that it cannot accomplish
with only token numbers of minority students. Just as growing up in a particular region or having particular
professional experiences is likely to affect an individual's views, so too is one's own, unique experience of being
a racial minority in a society, like our own, in which race unfortunately still matters. The Law School has deter-
mined, based on its experience and expertise, that a "critical mass" of underrepresented minorities is necessary to
further its compelling interest in securing the educational benefits of a diverse student body.

Even in the limited circumstance when drawing racial distinctions is permissible to further a compelling state
interest, government is still "constrained in how it may pursue that end: [T]he means chosen to accomplish the
[government's] asserted purpose must be specifically and narrowly framed to accomplish that purpose." The
purpose of the narrow tailoring requirement is to ensure that "the means chosen `fit' ... th[e] compelling goal so
closely that there is little or no possibility that the motive for the classification was illegitimate racial prejudice or
stereotype." Richmond v. A. Croson Co. (plurality opinion).

... To be narrowly tailored, a race-conscious admissions program cannot use a quota system-it cannot "insulat[e]
each category of applicants with certain desired qualifications from competition with all other appli-
cants." Bakke (opinion of Powell, J.). Instead, a university may consider race or ethnicity only as a " `plus' in a
particular applicant's file," without "insulat[ing] the individual from comparison with all other candidates for
the available seats." In other words, an admissions program must be "flexible enough to consider all pertinent
elements of diversity in light of the particular qualifications of each applicant, and to place them on the same
footing for consideration, although not necessarily according them the same weight."

We find that the Law School's admissions program bears the hallmarks of a narrowly tailored plan. As Justice
Powell made clear in Bakke, truly individualized consideration demands that race be used in a flexible, nonme-
chanical way. It follows from this mandate that universities cannot establish quotas for members of certain racial
groups or put members of those groups on separate admissions tracks. Nor can universities insulate applicants
who belong to certain racial or ethnic groups from the competition for admission. Universities can, however,
consider race or ethnicity more flexibly as a "plus" factor in the context of individualized consideration of each
and every applicant.
748 | EDUCATIONAL AFFIRMATIVE ACTION

...

That a race-conscious admissions program does not operate as a quota does not, by itself, satisfy the requirement
of individualized consideration. When using race as a "plus" factor in university admissions, a university's admis-
sions program must remain flexible enough to ensure that each applicant is evaluated as an individual and not
in a way that makes an applicant's race or ethnicity the defining feature of his or her application. The impor-
tance of this individualized consideration in the context of a race-conscious admissions program is paramount.
See Bakke (opinion of Powell, J.) (identifying the "denial ... of th[e] right to individualized consideration" as the
"principal evil" of the medical school's admissions program).

Here, the Law School engages in a highly individualized, holistic review of each applicant's file, giving serious
consideration to all the ways an applicant might contribute to a diverse educational environment. The Law
School affords this individualized consideration to applicants of all races. There is no policy, either de jure or de
facto, of automatic acceptance or rejection based on any single "soft" variable. Unlike the program at issue
in Gratz v. Bollinger, the Law School awards no mechanical, predetermined diversity "bonuses" based on race or
ethnicity. Like the Harvard plan, the Law School's admissions policy "is flexible enough to consider all pertinent
elements of diversity in light of the particular qualifications of each applicant, and to place them on the same
footing for consideration, although not necessarily according them the same weight." Bakke (opinion of Powell,
J.).

We also find that, like the Harvard plan Justice Powell referenced in Bakke, the Law School's race-conscious
admissions program adequately ensures that all factors that may contribute to student body diversity are mean-
ingfully considered alongside race in admissions decisions. With respect to the use of race itself, all underrep-
resented minority students admitted by the Law School have been deemed qualified. By virtue of our Nation's
struggle with racial inequality, such students are both likely to have experiences of particular importance to the
Law School's mission, and less likely to be admitted in meaningful numbers on criteria that ignore those experi-
ences.

The Law School does not, however, limit in any way the broad range of qualities and experiences that may
be considered valuable contributions to student body diversity. To the contrary, the 1992 policy makes clear
"[t]here are many possible bases for diversity admissions," and provides examples of admittees who have lived
or traveled widely abroad, are fluent in several languages, have overcome personal adversity and family hardship,
have exceptional records of extensive community service, and have had successful careers in other fields. The Law
School seriously considers each "applicant's promise of making a notable contribution to the class by way of a
particular strength, attainment, or characteristic-e.g., an unusual intellectual achievement, employment expe-
rience, nonacademic performance, or personal background." All applicants have the opportunity to highlight
their own potential diversity contributions through the submission of a personal statement, letters of recom-
mendation, and an essay describing the ways in which the applicant will contribute to the life and diversity of
the Law School.

What is more, the Law School actually gives substantial weight to diversity factors besides race. The Law School
frequently accepts nonminority applicants with grades and test scores lower than underrepresented minor-
                                                                                              EDUCATIONAL AFFIRMATIVE ACTION | 749

ity applicants (and other nonminority applicants) who are rejected. This shows that the Law School seriously
weighs many other diversity factors besides race that can make a real and dispositive difference for nonminority
applicants as well. By this flexible approach, the Law School sufficiently takes into account, in practice as well as
in theory, a wide variety of characteristics besides race and ethnicity that contribute to a diverse student body.
Justice Kennedy [in dissenting opinion] speculates that "race is likely outcome determinative for many members
of minority groups" who do not fall within the upper range of LSAT scores and grades. But the same could be
said of the Harvard plan discussed approvingly by Justice Powell in Bakke, and indeed of any plan that uses race
as one of many factors.

...

We agree with the Court of Appeals that the Law School sufficiently considered workable race-neutral alterna-
tives. The District Court took the Law School to task for failing to consider race-neutral alternatives such as
"using a lottery system" or "decreasing the emphasis for all applicants on undergraduate GPA and LSAT scores."
But these alternatives would require a dramatic sacrifice of diversity, the academic quality of all admitted stu-
dents, or both.

The Law School's current admissions program considers race as one factor among many, in an effort to assemble
a student body that is diverse in ways broader than race ... The United States advocates "percentage plans,"
recently adopted by public undergraduate institutions in Texas, Florida, and California to guarantee admission
to all students above a certain class-rank threshold in every high school in the State. Brief for United States
as Amicus Curiae 14--18. The United States does not, however, explain how such plans could work for graduate
and professional schools. Moreover, even assuming such plans are race-neutral, they may preclude the university
from conducting the individualized assessments necessary to assemble a student body that is not just racially
diverse, but diverse along all the qualities valued by the university. We are satisfied that the Law School ade-
quately considered race-neutral alternatives currently capable of producing a critical mass without forcing the
Law School to abandon the academic selectivity that is the cornerstone of its educational mission.

We acknowledge that "there are serious problems of justice connected with the idea of preference
itself." Bakke (opinion of Powell, J.). Narrow tailoring, therefore, requires that a race-conscious admissions pro-
gram not unduly harm members of any racial group. Even remedial race-based governmental action generally
"remains subject to continuing oversight to assure that it will work the least harm possible to other innocent
persons competing for the benefit." Id. To be narrowly tailored, a race-conscious admissions program must not
"unduly burden individuals who are not members of the favored racial and ethnic groups." Metro Broadcasting,
Inc. v. FCC (1990) (O'Connor, J., dissenting).

We are satisfied that the Law School's admissions program does not. Because the Law School considers "all
pertinent elements of diversity," it can (and does) select nonminority applicants who have greater potential to
enhance student body diversity over underrepresented minority applicants. See Bakke (opinion of Powell, J.). As
Justice Powell recognized in Bakke, so long as a race-conscious admissions program uses race as a "plus" factor in
the context of individualized consideration, a rejected applicant "will not have been foreclosed from all consid-
750 | EDUCATIONAL AFFIRMATIVE ACTION

eration for that seat simply because he was not the right color or had the wrong surname. ... His qualifications
would have been weighed fairly and competitively, and he would have no basis to complain of unequal treatment
under the Fourteenth Amendment."

We agree that, in the context of its individualized inquiry into the possible diversity contributions of all appli-
cants, the Law School's race-conscious admissions program does not unduly harm nonminority applicants. We
are mindful, however, that "[a] core purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to do away with all govern-
mentally imposed discrimination based on race." Palmore v. Sidoti (1984). Accordingly, race-conscious admis-
sions policies must be limited in time. This requirement reflects that racial classifications, however compelling
their goals, are potentially so dangerous that they may be employed no more broadly than the interest demands.
Enshrining a permanent justification for racial preferences would offend this fundamental equal protection
principle. We see no reason to exempt race-conscious admissions programs from the requirement that all gov-
ernmental use of race must have a logical end point. The Law School, too, concedes that all "race-conscious pro-
grams must have reasonable durational limits."

In the context of higher education, the durational requirement can be met by sunset provisions in race-conscious
admissions policies and periodic reviews to determine whether racial preferences are still necessary to achieve
student body diversity ...

We take the Law School at its word that it would "like nothing better than to find a race-neutral admissions
formula" and will terminate its race-conscious admissions program as soon as practicable. It has been 25 years
since Justice Powell first approved the use of race to further an interest in student body diversity in the context
of public higher education. Since that time, the number of minority applicants with high grades and test scores
has indeed increased. We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary
to further the interest approved today.

In summary, the Equal Protection Clause does not prohibit the Law School's narrowly tailored use of race in
admissions decisions to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a
diverse student body ... The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, accordingly, is affirmed.

Justice Powell announced the judgement of the Court.

This case presents a challenge to the special admissions program of the petitioner, the Medical School of the
University of California at Davis, which is designed to assure the admission of a specified number of students
from certain minority groups.

...

The Medical School of the University of California at Davis opened in 1968 with an entering class of 50 stu-
dents. In 1971, the size of the entering class was increased to 100 students, a level at which it remains. No
admissions program for disadvantaged or minority students existed when the school opened, and the first class
contained three Asians but no blacks, no Mexican-Americans, and no American Indians. Over the next two
years, the faculty devised a special admissions program to increase the representation of "disadvantaged" stu-
dents in each Medical School class. The special program consisted of a separate admissions system operating in
coordination with the regular admissions process ... While the overall class size was still 50, the prescribed num-
ber was 8; in 1973 and 1974, when the class size had doubled to 100, the prescribed number of special admis-
sions also doubled, to 16.

[...]

From the year of the increase in class size - 1971 - through 1974, the special program resulted in the admission
of 21 black students, 30 Mexican-Americans, and 12 Asians, for a total of 63 minority students. Over the same
period, the regular admissions program produced 1 black, 6 Mexican-Americans, and 37 Asians, for a total of
44 minority students. Although disadvantaged whites applied to the special program in large numbers, none
received an offer of admission through that process. Indeed, in 1974, at least, the special committee explic-
itly considered only "disadvantaged" special applicants who were members of one of the designated minority
groups.
752 | EDUCATIONAL AFFIRMATIVE ACTION

Allan Bakke is a white male who applied to the Davis Medical School in both 1973 and 1974. In both years,
Bakke's application was considered under the general admissions program, and he received an interview. His
1973 interview was with Dr. Theodore C. West, who considered Bakke "a very desirable applicant to [the] med-
ical school." [Record] at 225. Despite a strong benchmark score of 468 out of 500, Bakke was rejected. His appli-
cation had come late in the year, and no applicants in the general admissions process with scores below 470 were
accepted after Bakke's application was completed ...

Bakke's 1974 application was completed early in the year ... Again, Bakke's application was rejected. In neither
year did the chairman of the admissions committee, Dr. Lowrey, exercise his discretion to place Bakke on the
waiting list. Id. at 64. In both years, applicants were admitted under the special program with grade point aver-
ages, MCT scores, and benchmark scores significantly lower than Bakke's.

After the second rejection, Bakke filed the instant suit in the Superior Court of California. He sought manda-
tory, injunctive, and declaratory relief compelling his admission to the Medical School. He alleged that the Med-
ical School's special admissions program operated to exclude him from the school on the basis of his race, in
violation of his rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment ... The University
cross-complained for a declaration that its special admissions program was lawful. The trial court found that the
special program operated as a racial quota because minority applicants in the special program were rated only
against one another, Record 388, and 16 places in the class of 100 were reserved for them. Id. at 295-296. Declar-
ing that the University could not take race into account in making admissions decisions, the trial court held
the challenged program violative of the Federal Constitution, the State Constitution, and Title VI. The court
refused to order Bakke's admission, however, holding that he had failed to carry his burden of proving that he
would have been admitted but for the existence of the special program.

Bakke appealed from the portion of the trial court judgment denying him admission, and the University
appealed from the decision that its special admissions program was unlawful and the order enjoining it from
considering race in the processing of applications. The Supreme Court of California transferred the case directly
from the trial court, "because of the importance of the issues involved." The California court accepted the find-
ings of the trial court with respect to the University's program ...

Turning to Bakke's appeal, the court ruled that, since Bakke had established that the University had discrimi-
nated against him on the basis of his race, the burden of proof shifted to the University to demonstrate that he
would not have been admitted even in the absence of the special admissions program ... The California court
thereupon amended its opinion to direct that the trial court enter judgment ordering Bakke's admission to the
Medical School. 18 Cal. 3d at 64, 553. P.2d at 1172. That order was stayed pending review in this Court. 429
U.S. 953 (1976). We granted certiorari to consider the important constitutional issue.

[Discussion of Title VI omitted]

The parties do disagree as to the level of judicial scrutiny to be applied to the special admissions program. Peti-
tioner argues that the court below erred in applying strict scrutiny, as this inexact term has been applied in our
cases. That level of review, petitioner asserts, should be reserved for classifications that disadvantage "discrete and
insular minorities." See United States v. Carolene Products Co., (1938). Respondent, on the other hand, contends
                                                                                              EDUCATIONAL AFFIRMATIVE ACTION | 753

that the California court correctly rejected the notion that the degree of Judicial scrutiny accorded a particular
racial or ethnic classification hinges upon membership in a discrete and insular minority and duly recognized
that the "[r]ights established [by the Fourteenth Amendment] are personal rights." Shelley v. Kraemer (1948).

...

The guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment extend to all persons. Its language is explicit: "No State shall ...
deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." It is settled beyond question that the

      "rights created by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment are, by its terms, guaranteed to the individual.
      The rights established are personal rights,"

Shelley v. Kraemer, supra ... The guarantee of equal protection cannot mean one thing when applied to one indi-
vidual and something else when applied to a person of another color. If both are not accorded the same protec-
tion, then it is not equal.

...

[Discussion of precedent history omitted]

The special admissions program purports to serve the purposes of: (i) "reducing the historic deficit of tradi-
tionally disfavored minorities in medical schools and in the medical profession," Brief for Petitioner 32; (ii)
countering the effects of societal discrimination; (iii) increasing the number of physicians who will practice in
communities currently underserved; and (iv) obtaining the educational benefits that flow from an ethnically
diverse student body. It is necessary to decide which, if any, of these purposes is substantial enough to support
the use of a suspect classification.

... If petitioner's purpose is to assure within its student body some specified percentage of a particular group
merely because of its race or ethnic origin, such a preferential purpose must be rejected not as insubstantial, but
as facially invalid. Preferring members of any one group for no reason other than race or ethnic origin is discrim-
ination for its own sake. This the Constitution forbids.

... [T]he purpose of helping certain groups whom the faculty of the Davis Medical School perceived as victims of
"societal discrimination" does not justify a classification that imposes disadvantages upon persons like respon-
dent, who bear no responsibility for whatever harm the beneficiaries of the special admissions program are
thought to have suffered. To hold otherwise would be to convert a remedy heretofore reserved for violations of
legal rights into a privilege that all institutions throughout the Nation could grant at their pleasure to whatever
groups are perceived as victims of societal discrimination. That is a step we have never approved.

... Petitioner simply has not carried its burden of demonstrating that it must prefer members of particular ethnic
groups over all other individuals in order to promote better health care delivery to deprived citizens. Indeed,
petitioner has not shown that its preferential classification is likely to have any significant effect on the problem.
754 | EDUCATIONAL AFFIRMATIVE ACTION

The fourth goal asserted by petitioner is the attainment of a diverse student body. This clearly is a constitution-
ally permissible goal for an institution of higher education. Academic freedom, though not a specifically enu-
merated constitutional right, long has been viewed as a special concern of the First Amendment. The freedom
of a university to make its own judgments as to education includes the selection of its student body ...

...

Ethnic diversity, however, is only one element in a range of factors a university properly may consider in attaining
the goal of a heterogeneous student body. Although a university must have wide discretion in making the sensi-
tive judgments as to who should be admitted, constitutional limitations protecting individual rights may not be
disregarded. Respondent urges -- and the courts below have held -- that petitioner's dual admissions program
is a racial classification that impermissibly infringes his rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. As the interest
of diversity is compelling in the context of a university's admissions program, the question remains whether the
program's racial classification is necessary to promote this interest.

...

It has been suggested that an admissions program which considers race only as one factor is simply a subtle and
more sophisticated -- but no less effective -- means of according racial preference than the Davis program. A
facial intent to discriminate, however, is evident in petitioner's preference program, and not denied in this case.
No such facial infirmity exists in an admissions program where race or ethnic background is simply one element
-- to be weighed fairly against other elements -- in the selection process.

[...]

In summary, it is evident that the Davis special admissions program involves the use of an explicit racial classifi-
cation never before countenanced by this Court. It tells applicants who are not Negro, Asian, or Chicano that
they are totally excluded from a specific percentage of the seats in an entering class. No matter how strong their
qualifications, quantitative and extracurricular, including their own potential for contribution to educational
diversity, they are never afforded the chance to compete with applicants from the preferred groups for the special
admissions seats. At the same time, the preferred applicants have the opportunity to compete for every seat in
the class.

The fatal flaw in petitioner's preferential program is its disregard of individual rights as guaranteed by the Four-
teenth Amendment. Shelley v. Kraemer. Such rights are not absolute. But when a State's distribution of benefits
or imposition of burdens hinges on ancestry or the color of a person's skin, that individual is entitled to a demon-
stration that the challenged classification is necessary to promote a substantial state interest. Petitioner has failed
to carry this burden. For this reason, that portion of the California court's judgment holding petitioner's special
admissions program invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment must be affirmed.

In enjoining petitioner from ever considering the race of any applicant, however, the courts below failed to
recognize that the State has a substantial interest that legitimately may be served by a properly devised admis-
§                                                                                             EDUCATIONAL AFFIRMATIVE ACTION | 755

sions program involving the competitive consideration of race and ethnic origin. For this reason, so much of the
California court's judgment as enjoins petitioner from any consideration of the race of any applicant must be
reversed.

With respect to respondent's entitlement to an injunction directing his admission to the Medical School, peti-
tioner has conceded that it could not carry its burden of proving that, but for the existence of its unlawful spe-
cial admissions program, respondent still would not have been admitted. Hence, respondent is entitled to the
injunction, and that portion of the judgment must be affirmed.

Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court.

We granted certiorari in this case to decide whether "the University of Michigan's use of racial preferences in
undergraduate admissions violate[s] the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Title VI of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. § 2000d), or 42 U.S.C. § 1981." Brief for Petitioners i. Because we find that
the manner in which the University considers the race of applicants in its undergraduate admissions guidelines
violates these constitutional and statutory provisions, we reverse that portion of the District Court's decision
upholding the guidelines.

Petitioners Jennifer Gratz and Patrick Hamacher both applied for admission to the University of Michigan's
(University) College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA) as residents of the State of Michigan. Both peti-
tioners are Caucasian. Gratz, who applied for admission for the fall of 1995, was notified in January of that year
that a final decision regarding her admission had been delayed until April. This delay was based upon the Uni-
versity's determination that, although Gratz was" `well qualified,'" she was" `less competitive than the students
756 | EDUCATIONAL AFFIRMATIVE ACTION

who ha[d] been admitted on first review.'" App. to Pet. for Cert. 109a. Gratz was notified in April that the LSA
was unable to offer her admission. She enrolled in the University of Michigan at Dearborn, from which she grad-
uated in the spring of 1999.

Hamacher applied for admission to the LSA for the fall of 1997. A final decision as to his application was also
postponed because, though his "`academic credentials [were] in the qualified range, they [were] not at the level
needed for first review admission.'" Ibid. Hamacher's application was subsequently denied in April 1997, and
he enrolled at Michigan State University.

In October 1997, Gratz and Hamacher filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District
of Michigan against the University, the LSA. James Duderstadt, and Lee Bollinger. Petitioners' complaint was
a class-action suit alleging "violations and threatened violations of the rights of the plaintiffs and the class they
represent to equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment ..., and for racial discrimination in
violation of 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981, 1983 and 2000d et seq." App. 33. The liability phase was to determine "whether
[respondents'] use of race as a factor in admissions decisions violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Four-
teenth Amendment to the Constitution." Id., at 70.

The University has changed its admissions guidelines a number of times during the period relevant to this litiga-
tion, and we summarize the most significant of these changes briefly.

...

During 1995 and 1996, OUA counselors evaluated applications according to grade point average combined with
what were referred to as the "SCUGA" factors. These factors included the quality of an applicant's high school
(S), the strength of an applicant's high school curriculum (C), an applicant's unusual circumstances (U), an
applicant's geographical residence (G), and an applicant's alumni relationships (A). After these scores were com-
bined to produce an applicant's "GPA 2" score, the reviewing admissions counselors referenced a set of "Guide-
lines" tables, which listed GPA 2 ranges on the vertical axis, and American College Test/Scholastic Aptitude Test
(ACT/SAT) scores on the horizontal axis. Each table was divided into cells that included one or more courses of
action to be taken, including admit, reject, delay for additional information, or postpone for reconsideration.

In both years, applicants with the same GPA 2 score and ACT/SAT score were subject to different admissions
outcomes based upon their racial or ethnic status. For example, as a Caucasian in-state applicant, Gratz's GPA 2
score and ACT score placed her within a cell calling for a postponed decision on her application. An in-state or
out-of-state minority applicant with Gratz's scores would have fallen within a cell calling for admission.

In 1997, the University modified its admissions procedure ... Under the 1997 procedures, Hamacher's GPA 2
score and ACT score placed him in a cell on the in-state applicant table calling for postponement of a final
admissions decision. An underrepresented minority applicant placed in the same cell would generally have been
admitted.

... [F]rom 1995 through 1998, the University carefully managed its rolling admissions system to permit con-
sideration of certain applications submitted later in the academic year through the use of "protected seats."
                                                                                              EDUCATIONAL AFFIRMATIVE ACTION | 757

Specific groups-including athletes, foreign students, ROTC candidates, and underrepresented minorities-were
"protected categories" eligible for these seats. A committee called the Enrollment Working Group (EWG) pro-
jected how many applicants from each of these protected categories the University was likely to receive after a
given date and then paced admissions decisions to permit full consideration of expected applications from these
groups. If this space was not filled by qualified candidates from the designated groups toward the end of the
admissions season, it was then used to admit qualified candidates remaining in the applicant pool, including
those on the waiting list.

During 1999 and 2000, the OUA used the selection index, under which every applicant from an underrep-
resented racial or ethnic minority group was awarded 20 points. Starting in 1999, however, the University
established an Admissions Review Committee (ARC), to provide an additional level of consideration for some
applications. Under the new system, counselors may, in their discretion, "flag" an application for the ARC to
review after determining that the applicant (1) is academically prepared to succeed at the University, (2) has
achieved a minimum selection index score, and (3) possesses a quality or characteristic important to the Uni-
versity's composition of its freshman class, such as high class rank, unique life experiences, challenges, circum-
stances, interests or talents, socioeconomic disadvantage, and underrepresented race, ethnicity, or geography.
After reviewing "flagged" applications, the ARC determines whether to admit, defer, or deny each applicant.

[...]

Petitioners argue, first and foremost, that the University's use of race in undergraduate admissions violates the
Fourteenth Amendment. Specifically, they contend that this Court has only sanctioned the use of racial classi-
fications to remedy identified discrimination, a justification on which respondents have never relied. Brief for
Petitioners 15-16. Petitioners further argue that "diversity as a basis for employing racial preferences is simply
too open-ended, illdefined, and indefinite to constitute a compelling interest capable of supporting narrowly-
tailored means." Id., at 17-18, 40-41. But for the reasons set forth today in Grutter v. Bollinger, post, at 327-333,
the Court has rejected these arguments of petitioner.

Petitioners alternatively argue that even if the University's interest in diversity can constitute a compelling state
interest, the District Court erroneously concluded that the University's use of race in its current freshman
admissions policy is narrowly tailored to achieve such an interest. Petitioners argue that the guidelines the Uni-
versity began using in 1999 do not "remotely resemble the kind of consideration of race and ethnicity that
Justice Powell endorsed in Bakke." Brief for Petitioners 18. Respondents reply that the University's current
admissions program is narrowly tailored and avoids the problems of the Medical School of the University of Cal-
ifornia at Davis program CD. C. Davis) rejected by Justice Powell. They claim that their program "hews closely"
to both the admissions program described by Justice Powell as well as the Harvard College admissions program
that he endorsed ...

It is by now well established that "all racial classifications reviewable under the Equal Protection Clause must be
strictly scrutinized." Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, (1995) ...

To withstand our strict scrutiny analysis, respondents must demonstrate that the University's use of race in its
current admissions program employs "narrowly tailored measures that further compelling governmental inter-
758 | EDUCATIONAL AFFIRMATIVE ACTION

ests." Id., at 227. Because "[r]acial classifications are simply too pernicious to permit any but the most exact con-
nection between justification and classification," Fullilove v. Klutznick, (1980) (STEVENS, J., dissenting), our
review of whether such requirements have been met must entail "`a most searching examination.'" Adarand,
supra, at 223 ... We find that the University's policy, which automatically distributes 20 points, or one-fifth of
the points needed to guarantee admission, to every single "underrepresented minority" applicant solely because
of race, is not narrowly tailored to achieve the interest in educational diversity that respondents claim justifies
their program.

...

Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke emphasized the importance of considering each particular applicant as an indi-
vidual, assessing all of the qualities that individual possesses, and in turn, evaluating that individual's ability to
contribute to the unique setting of higher education ...

The current LSA policy does not provide such individualized consideration. The LSA's policy automatically dis-
tributes 20 points to every single applicant from an "underrepresented minority" group, as defined by the Uni-
versity. The only consideration that accompanies this distribution of points is a factual review of an application
to determine whether an individual is a member of one of these minority groups. Moreover ... the LSA's auto-
matic distribution of 20 points has the effect of making "the factor of race ... decisive" for virtually every mini-
mally qualified underrepresented minority applicant.

...

Respondents contend that "[t]he volume of applications and the presentation of applicant information make it
impractical for [LSA] to use the ... admissions system" upheld by the Court today in Grutter. Brief for Respon-
dent Bollinger et al. 6, n. 8. But the fact that the implementation of a program capable of providing indi-
vidualized consideration might present administrative challenges does not render constitutional an otherwise
problematic system ... Nothing in Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke signaled that a university may employ what-
ever means it desires to achieve the stated goal of diversity without regard to the limits imposed by our strict
scrutiny analysis.

We conclude, therefore, that because the University's use of race in its current freshman admissions policy is not
narrowly tailored to achieve respondents' asserted compelling interest in diversity, the admissions policy violates
the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. We further find that the admissions policy also vio-
lates Title VI and 42 U.S.C. § 1981.
§                                                                                            EDUCATIONAL AFFIRMATIVE ACTION | 759

Accordingly, we reverse that portion of the District Court's decision granting respondents summary judgment
with respect to liability and remand the case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.

The Court is asked once again to consider whether the race-conscious admissions program at the University of
Texas is lawful under the Equal Protection Clause.

...

The University's program is sui generis [unique]. Unlike other approaches to college admissions considered by
this Court, it combines holistic review with a percentage plan. This approach gave rise to an unusual conse-
quence in this case: The component of the University's admissions policy that had the largest impact on peti-
tioner's chances of admission was not the school's consideration of race under its holistic-review process but
rather the Top Ten Percent Plan. Because petitioner did not graduate in the top 10 percent of her high school
class, she was categorically ineligible for more than three-fourths of the slots in the incoming freshman class. It
seems quite plausible, then, to think that petitioner would have had a better chance of being admitted to the
University if the school used race-conscious holistic review to select its entire incoming class, as was the case
in Grutter.

Despite the Top Ten Percent Plan's outsized effect on petitioner's chances of admission, she has not challenged
it ...

Furthermore, as discussed above, the University lacks any authority to alter the role of the Top Ten Percent Plan
in its admissions process ...
760 | EDUCATIONAL AFFIRMATIVE ACTION

That does not diminish, however, the University's continuing obligation to satisfy the burden of strict scrutiny
in light of changing circumstances ...

Here, however, the Court is necessarily limited to the narrow question before it: whether, drawing all reasonable
inferences in her favor, petitioner has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that she was denied equal treat-
ment at the time her application was rejected.

In seeking to reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, petitioner makes four arguments. First, she argues
that the University has not articulated its compelling interest with sufficient clarity. According to petitioner, the
University must set forth more precisely the level of minority enrollment that would constitute a "critical mass."
Without a clearer sense of what the University's ultimate goal is, petitioner argues, a reviewing court cannot
assess whether the University's admissions program is narrowly tailored to that goal.

As this Court's cases have made clear, however, the compelling interest that justifies consideration of race in col-
lege admissions is not an interest in enrolling a certain number of minority students. Rather, a university may
institute a race-conscious admissions program as a means of obtaining "the educational benefits that flow from
student body diversity." Fisher I, see also Grutter ... Equally important, "student body diversity promotes learn-
ing outcomes, and better prepares students for an increasingly diverse workforce and society." Ibid.

Increasing minority enrollment may be instrumental to these educational benefits, but it is not, as petitioner
seems to suggest, a goal that can or should be reduced to pure numbers. Indeed, since the University is prohibited
from seeking a particular number or quota of minority students, it cannot be faulted for failing to specify the
particular level of minority enrollment at which it believes the educational benefits of diversity will be obtained.

On the other hand, asserting an interest in the educational benefits of diversity writ large is insufficient. A uni-
versity's goals cannot be elusory or amorphous--they must be sufficiently measurable to permit judicial scrutiny
of the policies adopted to reach them.

The record reveals that in first setting forth its current admissions policy, the University articulated concrete
and precise goals ... All of these objectives, as a general matter, mirror the "compelling interest" this Court has
approved in its prior cases.

The University has provided in addition a "reasoned, principled explanation" for its decision to pursue these
goals. Fisher I. The University's 39-page proposal was written following a year-long study, which concluded that
"[t]he use of race-neutral policies and programs ha[d] not been successful" in "provid[ing] an educational set-
ting that fosters cross-racial understanding, provid[ing] enlightened discussion and learning, [or] prepar[ing]
students to function in an increasingly diverse workforce and society." Further support for the University's con-
clusion can be found in the depositions and affidavits from various admissions officers, all of whom articulate
the same, consistent "reasoned, principled explanation." Petitioner's contention that the University's goal was
insufficiently concrete is rebutted by the record.

...
                                                                                              EDUCATIONAL AFFIRMATIVE ACTION | 761

The record itself contains significant evidence, both statistical and anecdotal, in support of the University's posi-
tion. To start, the demographic data the University has submitted show consistent stagnation in terms of the
percentage of minority students enrolling at the University from 1996 to 2002 ... Although demographics alone
are by no means dispositive, they do have some value as a gauge of the University's ability to enroll students who
can offer underrepresented perspectives.

In addition to this broad demographic data, the University put forward evidence that minority students admit-
ted under the Hopwood regime experienced feelings of loneliness and isolation. This anecdotal evidence is, in
turn, bolstered by further, more nuanced quantitative data ... Though a college must continually reassess its need
for race-conscious review, here that assessment appears to have been done with care, and a reasonable determi-
nation was made that the University had not yet attained its goals.

Third, petitioner argues that considering race was not necessary because such consideration has had only a
"`minimal impact' in advancing the [University's] compelling interest." Brief for Petitioner 46 ... Again, the
record does not support this assertion. In 2003, 11 percent of the Texas residents enrolled through holistic
review were Hispanic and 3.5 percent were African-American. In 2007, by contrast, 16.9 percent of the Texas
holistic-review freshmen were Hispanic and 6.8 percent were African-American. Those increases--of 54 percent
and 94 percent, respectively--show that consideration of race has had a meaningful, if still limited, effect on the
diversity of the University's freshman class.

In any event, it is not a failure of narrow tailoring for the impact of racial consideration to be minor. The fact
that race consciousness played a role in only a small portion of admissions decisions should be a hallmark of nar-
row tailoring, not evidence of unconstitutionality.

Petitioner's final argument is that "there are numerous other available race-neutral means of achieving" the Uni-
versity's compelling interest. A review of the record reveals, however, that, at the time of petitioner's application,
none of her proposed alternatives was a workable means for the University to attain the benefits of diversity it
sought ... Perhaps more significantly, in the wake of Hopwood, the University spent seven years attempting to
achieve its compelling interest using race-neutral holistic review. None of these efforts succeeded, and petitioner
fails to offer any meaningful way in which the University could have improved upon them at the time of her
application.

Petitioner also suggests altering the weight given to academic and socioeconomic factors in the University's
admissions calculus. This proposal ignores the fact that the University tried, and failed, to increase diversity
through enhanced consideration of socioeconomic and other factors. And it further ignores this Court's prece-
dent making clear that the Equal Protection Clause does not force universities to choose between a diverse stu-
dent body and a reputation for academic excellence. Grutter.

Petitioner's final suggestion is to uncap the Top Ten Percent Plan, and admit more--if not all--the University's
students through a percentage plan. As an initial matter, petitioner overlooks the fact that the Top Ten Percent
Plan, though facially neutral, cannot be understood apart from its basic purpose, which is to boost minority
enrollment. Percentage plans are "adopted with racially segregated neighborhoods and schools front and center
762 | EDUCATIONAL AFFIRMATIVE ACTION

stage." Fisher I (Ginsburg, J., dissenting)."It is race consciousness, not blindness to race, that drives such
plans." Ibid. Consequently, petitioner cannot assert simply that increasing the University's reliance on a percent-
age plan would make its admissions policy more race neutral.

Even if, as a matter of raw numbers, minority enrollment would increase under such a regime, petitioner would
be hard-pressed to find convincing support for the proposition that college admissions would be improved if
they were a function of class rank alone. That approach would sacrifice all other aspects of diversity in pursuit of
enrolling a higher number of minority students. A system that selected every student through class rank alone
would exclude the star athlete or musician whose grades suffered because of daily practices and training. It would
exclude a talented young biologist who struggled to maintain above-average grades in humanities classes. And
it would exclude a student whose freshman-year grades were poor because of a family crisis but who got herself
back on track in her last three years of school, only to find herself just outside of the top decile of her class.

These are but examples of the general problem. Class rank is a single metric, and like any single metric, it will
capture certain types of people and miss others. This does not imply that students admitted through holistic
review are necessarily more capable or more desirable than those admitted through the Top Ten Percent Plan.
It merely reflects the fact that privileging one characteristic above all others does not lead to a diverse student
body. Indeed, to compel universities to admit students based on class rank alone is in deep tension with the goal
of educational diversity as this Court's cases have defined it ... At its center, the Top Ten Percent Plan is a blunt
instrument that may well compromise the University's own definition of the diversity it seeks.

...

In short, none of petitioner's suggested alternatives--nor other proposals considered or discussed in the course
of this litigation--have been shown to be "available" and "workable" means through which the University could
have met its educational goals, as it understood and defined them in 2008. Fisher I. The University has thus met
its burden of showing that the admissions policy it used at the time it rejected petitioner's application was nar-
rowly tailored ...

A university is in large part defined by those intangible "qualities which are incapable of objective measurement
but which make for greatness." Sweatt v. Painter (1950). Considerable deference is owed to a university in defin-
ing those intangible characteristics, like student body diversity, that are central to its identity and educational
mission. But still, it remains an enduring challenge to our Nation's education system to reconcile the pursuit of
diversity with the constitutional promise of equal treatment and dignity.

In striking this sensitive balance, public universities, like the States themselves, can serve as "laboratories for
experimentation." The University of Texas at Austin has a special opportunity to learn and to teach. The Uni-
versity now has at its disposal valuable data about the manner in which different approaches to admissions may
foster diversity or instead dilute it. The University must continue to use this data to scrutinize the fairness of its
admissions program; to assess whether changing demographics have undermined the need for a race-conscious
policy; and to identify the effects, both positive and negative, of the affirmative-action measures it deems neces-
sary.

The Court's affirmance of the University's admissions policy today does not necessarily mean the University
may rely on that same policy without refinement. It is the University's ongoing obligation to engage in constant
deliberation and continued reflection regarding its admissions policies. The judgment of the Court of Appeals
is affirmed.

Justice Kennedy announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which the Chief Justice
and Justice Alito join.

The Court in this case must determine whether an amendment to the Constitution of the State of Michigan,
approved and enacted by its voters, is invalid under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
to the Constitution of the United States.

In 2003 the Court reviewed the constitutionality of two admissions systems at the University of Michigan,
one for its undergraduate class and one for its law school. The undergraduate admissions plan was addressed
in Gratz v. Bollinger. The law school admission plan was addressed in Grutter v. Bollinger. Each admissions
process permitted the explicit consideration of an applicant's race. In Gratz, the Court invalidated the under-
graduate plan as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. In Grutter, the Court found no constitutional flaw
in the law school admission plan's more limited use of race-based preferences.

In response to the Court's decision in Gratz, the university revised its undergraduate admissions process, but the
revision still allowed limited use of race-based preferences. After a statewide debate on the question of racial pref-
erences in the context of governmental decision making, the voters, in 2006, adopted an amendment to the State
Constitution prohibiting state and other governmental entities in Michigan from granting certain preferences,
764 | EDUCATIONAL AFFIRMATIVE ACTION

including race-based preferences, in a wide range of actions and decisions. Under the terms of the amendment,
race-based preferences cannot be part of the admissions process for state universities. That particular prohibition
is central to the instant case.

The ballot proposal was called Proposal 2 and, after it passed by a margin of 58 percent to 42 percent, the
resulting enactment became Article I, § 26, of the Michigan Constitution. As noted, the amendment is in broad
terms. Section 26 states, in relevant part, as follows:

      "(1) The University of Michigan, Michigan State University, Wayne State University, and any other public college
      or university, community college, or school district shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment
      to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public
      employment, public education, or public contracting.

      "(2) The state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the
      basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or
      public contracting.

      "(3) For the purposes of this section `state' includes, but is not necessarily limited to, the state itself, any city,
      county, any public college, university, or community college, school district, or other political subdivision or gov-
      ernmental instrumentality of or within the State of Michigan not included in sub-section 1."

...

Before the Court addresses the question presented, it is important to note what this case is not about. It is
not about the constitutionality, or the merits, of race-conscious admissions policies in higher education ... The
question here concerns not the permissibility of race-conscious admissions policies under the Constitution but
whether, and in what manner, voters in the States may choose to prohibit the consideration of racial preferences
in governmental decisions, in particular with respect to school admissions.

...

In Michigan, the State Constitution invests independent boards of trustees with plenary authority over public
universities, including admissions policies. Mich. Const., Art. VIII, § 5. Although the members of the boards
are elected, some evidence in the record suggests they delegated authority over admissions policy to the faculty.
But whether the boards or the faculty set the specific policy, Michigan's public universities did consider race as a
factor in admissions decisions before 2006.

In holding § 26 invalid in the context of student admissions at state universities, the Court of Appeals relied in
primary part on Washington v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1 (1982) ... But that determination extends Seattle's hold-
ing in a case presenting quite different issues to reach a conclusion that is mistaken here ...

Seattle is best understood as a case in which the state action in question (the bar on busing enacted by the State's
voters) had the serious risk, if not purpose, of causing specific injuries on account of race ... Although there had
been no judicial finding of de jure segregation with respect to Seattle's school district, it appears as though school
                                                                                             EDUCATIONAL AFFIRMATIVE ACTION | 765

segregation in the district in the 1940's and 1950's may have been the partial result of school board policies that
"permitted white students to transfer out of black schools while restricting the transfer of black students into
white schools." Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School Dist. (2007) (Breyer, J., dissenting) ...

The broad language used in Seattle, however, went well beyond the analysis needed to resolve the case ... Seat­
tle stated that where a government policy "inures primarily to the benefit of the minority" and "minorities
... consider" the policy to be "`in their interest,'" then any state action that "place[s] effective decisionmaking
authority over" that policy "at a different level of government" must be reviewed under strict scrutiny. In essence,
according to the broad reading of Seattle, any state action with a "racial focus" that makes it "more difficult for
certain racial minorities than for other groups" to "achieve legislation that is in their interest" is subject to strict
scrutiny. It is this reading of Seattle that the Court of Appeals found to be controlling here. And that reading
must be rejected.

... The [Sixth Circuit's] expansive reading of Seattle has no principled limitation and raises serious questions of
compatibility with the Court's settled equal protection jurisprudence. To the extent Seattle is read to require the
Court to determine and declare which political policies serve the "interest" of a group defined in racial terms,
that rationale was unnecessary to the decision in Seattle; it has no support in precedent; and it raises serious con-
stitutional concerns. That expansive language does not provide a proper guide for decisions and should not be
deemed authoritative or controlling. The rule that the Court of Appeals elaborated and respondents seek to
establish here would contradict central equal protection principles.

In cautioning against "impermissible racial stereotypes," this Court has rejected the assumption that "members
of the same racial group--regardless of their age, education, economic status, or the community in which they
live--think alike, share the same political interests, and will prefer the same candidates at the polls." Shaw v.
Reno (1993); see also Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC (1990) (Kennedy, J., dissenting) ... It cannot be enter-
tained as a serious proposition that all individuals of the same race think alike. Yet that proposition would be
a necessary beginning point were the Seattle formulation to control, as the Court of Appeals held it did in this
case. And if it were deemed necessary to probe how some races define their own interest in political matters, still
another beginning point would be to define individuals according to race ...

Even assuming these initial steps could be taken in a manner consistent with a sound analytic and judicial frame-
work, the court would next be required to determine the policy realms in which certain groups--groups defined
by race--have a political interest. That undertaking, again without guidance from any accepted legal standards,
would risk, in turn, the creation of incentives for those who support or oppose certain policies to cast the debate
in terms of racial advantage or disadvantage. Thus could racial antagonisms and conflict tend to arise in the con-
text of judicial decisions as courts undertook to announce what particular issues of public policy should be clas-
sified as advantageous to some group defined by race. This risk is inherent in adopting the Seattle formulation.

...

By approving Proposal 2 and thereby adding § 26 to their State Constitution, the Michigan voters exercised
their privilege to enact laws as a basic exercise of their democratic power. In the federal system States "respond,
through the enactment of positive law, to the initiative of those who seek a voice in shaping the destiny of their
766 | EDUCATIONAL AFFIRMATIVE ACTION

own times." Michigan voters used the initiative system to bypass public officials who were deemed not respon-
sive to the concerns of a majority of the voters with respect to a policy of granting race-based preferences that
raises difficult and delicate issues.

...

The respondents in this case insist that a difficult question of public policy must be taken from the reach of the
voters, and thus removed from the realm of public discussion, dialogue, and debate in an election campaign.
Quite in addition to the serious First Amendment implications of that position with respect to any particular
election, it is inconsistent with the underlying premises of a responsible, functioning democracy. One of those
premises is that a democracy has the capacity--and the duty--to learn from its past mistakes; to discover and
confront persisting biases; and by respectful, rationale deliberation to rise above those flaws and injustices. That
process is impeded, not advanced, by court decrees based on the proposition that the public cannot have the
requisite repose to discuss certain issues. It is demeaning to the democratic process to presume that the voters
are not capable of deciding an issue of this sensitivity on decent and rational grounds. The process of public dis-
course and political debate should not be foreclosed even if there is a risk that during a public campaign there
will be those, on both sides, who seek to use racial division and discord to their own political advantage. An
informed public can, and must, rise above this. The idea of democracy is that it can, and must, mature. Freedom
embraces the right, indeed the duty, to engage in a rational, civic discourse in order to determine how best to
form a consensus to shape the destiny of the Nation and its people. These First Amendment dynamics would be
disserved if this Court were to say that the question here at issue is beyond the capacity of the voters to debate
and then to determine.

These precepts are not inconsistent with the well-established principle that when hurt or injury is inflicted on
racial minorities by the encouragement or command of laws or other state action, the Constitution requires
redress by the courts ...

For reasons already discussed, Mulkey, Hunter, and Seattle are not precedents that stand for the conclusion that
Michigan's voters must be disempowered from acting. Those cases were ones in which the political restriction
in question was designed to be used, or was likely to be used, to encourage infliction of injury by reason of race.
What is at stake here is not whether injury will be inflicted but whether government can be instructed not to
follow a course that entails, first, the definition of racial categories and, second, the grant of favored status to
persons in some racial categories and not others. The electorate's instruction to governmental entities not to
embark upon the course of race-defined and race-based preferences was adopted, we must assume, because the
voters deemed a preference system to be unwise, on account of what voters may deem its latent potential to
become itself a source of the very resentments and hostilities based on race that this Nation seeks to put behind
it. Whether those adverse results would follow is, and should be, the subject of debate. Voters might likewise
consider, after debate and reflection, that programs designed to increase diversity--consistent with the Consti-
tution--are a necessary part of progress to transcend the stigma of past racism.

This case is not about how the debate about racial preferences should be resolved. It is about who may resolve
it. There is no authority in the Constitution of the United States or in this Court's precedents for the Judiciary
                                                                                             EDUCATIONAL AFFIRMATIVE ACTION | 767

to set aside Michigan laws that commit this policy determination to the voters. Deliberative debate on sensitive
issues such as racial preferences all too often may shade into rancor. But that does not justify removing certain
court-determined issues from the voters' reach. Democracy does not presume that some subjects are either too
divisive or too profound for public debate.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed.

It is so ordered.

Mr. Chief Justice Burger announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion.

We granted certiorari to consider a facial constitutional challenge to a requirement in a congressional spending
program that, absent an administrative waiver, 10% of the federal funds granted for local public works projects
must be used by the state or local grantee to procure services or supplies from businesses owned and controlled
by members of statutorily identified minority groups.

In May, 1977, Congress enacted the Public Works Employment Act of 1977 which amended the Local Public
Works Capital Development and Investment Act of 1976. The 1977 amendments authorized an additional $4
billion appropriation for federal grants to be made by the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Economic
Development Administration (EDA), to state and local governmental entities for use in local public works pro-
jects. Among the changes made was the addition of the provision that has become the focus of this litigation.
Section 103(f)(2) of the 1977 Act, referred to as the "minority business enterprise" or "MBE" provision, requires
that:

      "Except to the extent that the Secretary determines otherwise, no grant shall be made under this Act for any local
      public works project unless the applicant gives satisfactory assurance to the Secretary that at least 10 per centum
      of the amount of each grant shall be expended for minority business enterprises. For purposes of this paragraph,
      the term `minority business enterprise' means a business at least 50 per centum of which is owned by minority
      group members or, in case of a publicly owned business, at least 51 per centum of the stock of which is owned by
      minority group members. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, minority group members are citizens of the
      United States who are Negroes, Spanish-speaking, Orientals, Indians, Eskimos, and Aleuts."

...

On November 30, 1977, petitioners filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern Dis-
trict of New York seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin enforcement of the MBE provision. Named
                                                                                                  ECONOMIC AFFIRMATIVE ACTION | 769

as defendants were the Secretary of Commerce, as the program administrator, and the State and City of New
York, as actual and potential project grantees. Petitioners are several associations of construction contractors and
subcontractors, and a firm engaged in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning work. Their complaint alleged
that they had sustained economic injury due to enforcement of the 10% MBE requirement, and that the MBE
provision, on its face, violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the equal protection
component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and various statutory antidiscrimination pro-
visions.

...

The MBE provision was enacted as part of the Public Works Employment Act of 1977, which made various
amendments to Title I of the Local Public Works Capital Development and Investment Act of 1976. The 1976
Act was intended as a short-term measure to alleviate the problem of national unemployment and to stimulate
the national economy by assisting state and local governments to build needed public facilities. To accomplish
these objectives, the Congress authorized the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the EDA, to make grants
to state and local governments for construction, renovation, repair, or other improvement of local public works
projects ...

The device of a 10% MBE participation requirement, subject to administrative waiver, was thought to be
required to assure minority business participation; otherwise, it was thought that repetition of the prior expe-
rience could be expected, with participation by minority business accounting for an inordinately small per-
centage of government contracting. The causes of this disparity were perceived as involving the longstanding
existence and maintenance of barriers impairing access by minority enterprises to public contracting opportuni-
ties, or sometimes as involving more direct discrimination ... In the words of its sponsor, the MBE provision was
"designed to begin to redress this grievance that has been extant for so long."

The legislative objectives of the MBE provision must be considered against the background of ongoing efforts
directed toward deliverance of the century-old promise of equality of economic opportunity. The sponsors of
the MBE provision in the House and the Senate expressly linked the provision to the existing administrative pro-
grams promoting minority opportunity in government procurement ...

Civil Rights Commission report discussed at some length the barriers encountered by minority businesses in
gaining access to government contracting opportunities at the federal, state, and local levels ...

Against this backdrop of legislative and administrative programs, it is inconceivable that Members of both
Houses were not fully aware of the objectives of the MBE provision and of the reasons prompting its enactment.

Although the statutory MBE provision itself outlines only the bare bones of the federal program, it makes a
number of critical determinations: the decision to initiate a limited racial and ethnic preference; the specification
of a minimum level for minority business participation; the identification of the minority groups that are to be
encompassed by the program; and the provision for an administrative waiver where application of the program
770 | ECONOMIC AFFIRMATIVE ACTION

is not feasible. Congress relied on the administrative agency to flesh out this skeleton, pursuant to delegated rule-
making authority, and to develop an administrative operation consistent with legislative intentions and objec-
tives.

... A program that employs racial or ethnic criteria, even in a remedial context, calls for close examination; yet
we are bound to approach our task with appropriate deference to the Congress, a coequal branch charged by
the Constitution with the power to "provide for the ... general Welfare of the United States" and "to enforce, by
appropriate legislation," the equal protection guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment. In Columbia Broad­
casting System, Inc. v. Democratic National Committee, (1973), we accorded "great weight to the decisions of
Congress" even though the legislation implicated fundamental constitutional rights guaranteed by the First
Amendment. The rule is not different when a congressional program raises equal protection concerns.

...

Our analysis proceeds in two steps. At the outset, we must inquire whether the objectives of this legislation are
within the power of Congress. If so, we must go on to decide whether the limited use of racial and ethnic cri-
teria, in the context presented, is a constitutionally permissible means for achieving the congressional objectives
and does not violate the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

In enacting the MBE provision, it is clear that Congress employed an amalgam of its specifically delegated pow-
ers. The Public Works Employment Act of 1977, by its very nature, is primarily an exercise of the Spending
Power. U.S. Const., Art. I, 8, cl. 1. This Court has recognized that the power to "provide for the ... general Wel-
fare" is an independent grant of legislative authority, distinct from other broad congressional powers. Buckley v.
Valeo, (1976); United States v. Butler, (1936). Congress has frequently employed the Spending Power to further
broad policy objectives by conditioning receipt of federal moneys upon compliance by the recipient with federal
statutory and administrative directives. This Court has repeatedly upheld against constitutional challenge the
use of this technique to induce governments and private parties to cooperate voluntarily with federal policy ...

... Insofar as the MBE program pertains to the actions of private prime contractors, the Congress could have
achieved its objectives under the Commerce Clause. We conclude that, in this respect, the objectives of the MBE
provision are within the scope of the Spending Power.

...

With respect to the MBE provision, Congress had abundant evidence from which it could conclude that minor-
ity businesses have been denied effective participation in public contracting opportunities by procurement prac-
tices that perpetuated the effects of prior discrimination. Congress, of course, may legislate without compiling
the kind of "record" appropriate with respect to judicial or administrative proceedings. Congress had before it,
among other data, evidence of a long history of marked disparity in the percentage of public contracts awarded
to minority business enterprises. This disparity was considered to result not from any lack of capable and qual-
ified minority businesses, but from the existence and maintenance of barriers to competitive access which had
their roots in racial and ethnic discrimination, and which continue today, even absent any intentional discrim-
ination or other unlawful conduct. Although much of this history related to the experience of minority busi-
                                                                                                   ECONOMIC AFFIRMATIVE ACTION | 771

nesses in the area of federal procurement, there was direct evidence before the Congress that this pattern of
disadvantage and discrimination existed with respect to state and local construction contracting as well. In rela-
tion to the MBE provision, Congress acted within its competence to determine that the problem was national
in scope.

Although the Act recites no preambulary "findings" on the subject, we are satisfied that Congress had abundant
historical basis from which it could conclude that traditional procurement practices, when applied to minority
businesses, could perpetuate the effects of prior discrimination. Accordingly, Congress reasonably determined
that the prospective elimination of these barriers to minority firm access to public contracting opportunities
generated by the 1977 Act was appropriate to ensure that those businesses were not denied equal opportunity
to participate in federal grants to state and local governments, which is one aspect of the equal protection of the
laws.

...

We now turn to the question whether, as a means to accomplish these plainly constitutional objectives, Congress
may use racial and ethnic criteria, in this limited way, as a condition attached to a federal grant ... Congress may
employ racial or ethnic classifications in exercising its Spending or other legislative powers only if those classifi-
cations do not violate the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. We
recognize the need for careful judicial evaluation to assure that any congressional program that employs racial
or ethnic criteria to accomplish the objective of remedying the present effects of past discrimination is narrowly
tailored to the achievement of that goal.

...

Our review of the regulations and guidelines governing administration of the MBE provision reveals that Con-
gress enacted the program as a strictly remedial measure; moreover, it is a remedy that functions prospectively,
in the manner of an injunctive decree. Pursuant to the administrative program, grantees and their prime con-
tractors are required to seek out all available, qualified, bona fide MBE's; they are required to provide technical
assistance as needed, to lower or waive bonding requirements where feasible, to solicit the aid of the Office of
Minority Business Enterprise, the SBA, or other sources for assisting MBE's to obtain required working capital,
and to give guidance through the intricacies of the bidding process ... There is available to the grantee a provision
authorized by Congress for administrative waiver on a case-by-case basis should there be a demonstration that,
despite affirmative efforts, this level of participation cannot be achieved without departing from the objectives of
the program. Supra at 448 U. S. 469-470. There is also an administrative mechanism, including a complaint pro-
cedure, to ensure that only bona fide MBE's are encompassed by the remedial program, and to prevent unjust
participation in the program by those minority firms whose access to public contracting opportunities is not
impaired by the effects of prior discrimination.

As a threshold matter, we reject the contention that, in the remedial context, the Congress must act in a wholly
"color-blind" fashion ...

...
772 | ECONOMIC AFFIRMATIVE ACTION

Here we deal, as we noted earlier, not with the limited remedial powers of a federal court, for example, but with
the broad remedial powers of Congress. It is fundamental that in no organ of government, state or federal, does
there repose a more comprehensive remedial power than in the Congress, expressly charged by the Constitution
with competence and authority to enforce equal protection guarantees. Congress not only may induce volun-
tary action to assure compliance with existing federal statutory or constitutional antidiscrimination provisions,
but also where Congress has authority to declare certain conduct unlawful, it may, as here, authorize and induce
state action to avoid such conduct.

A more specific challenge to the MBE program is the charge that it impermissibly deprives nonminority busi-
nesses of access to at least some portion of the government contracting opportunities generated by the Act. It
must be conceded that, by its objective of remedying the historical impairment of access, the MBE provision can
have the effect of awarding some contracts to MBE's which otherwise might be awarded to other businesses, who
may themselves be innocent of any prior discriminatory actions. Failure of nonminority firms to receive certain
contracts is, of course, an incidental consequence of the program, not part of its objective; similarly, past impair-
ment of minority-firm access to public contracting opportunities may have been an incidental consequence of
"business as usual" by public contracting agencies and among prime contractors.

It is not a constitutional defect in this program that it may disappoint the expectations of nonminority firms.
When effectuating a limited and properly tailored remedy to cure the effects of prior discrimination, such "a
sharing of the burden" by innocent parties is not impermissible. Franks, supra ... The actual "burden" shoul-
dered by nonminority firms is relatively light in this connection when we consider the scope of this public works
program as compared with overall construction contracting opportunities. Moreover, although we may assume
that the complaining parties are innocent of any discriminatory conduct, it was within congressional power to
act on the assumption that in the past some nonminority businesses may have reaped competitive benefit over
the years from the virtual exclusion of minority firms from these contracting opportunities.

Another challenge to the validity of the MBE program is the assertion that it is underinclusive -- that it limits
its benefit to specified minority groups, rather than extending its remedial objectives to all businesses whose
access to government contracting is impaired by the effects of disadvantage or discrimination. Such an extension
would, of course, be appropriate for Congress to provide; it is not a function for the courts.

...

It is also contended that the MBE program is overinclusive -- that it bestows a benefit on businesses identified
by racial or ethnic criteria which cannot be justified on the basis of competitive criteria or as a remedy for the
present effects of identified prior discrimination. It is conceivable that a particular application of the program
may have this effect; however, the peculiarities of specific applications are not before us in this case. We are not
presented here with a challenge involving a specific award of a construction contract or the denial of a waiver
request; such questions of specific application must await future cases.

...
§                                                                                                 ECONOMIC AFFIRMATIVE ACTION | 773

That the use of racial and ethnic criteria is premised on assumptions rebuttable in the administrative process
gives reasonable assurance that application of the MBE program will be limited to accomplishing the remedial
objectives contemplated by Congress, and that misapplications of the racial and ethnic criteria can be remedied.
In dealing with this facial challenge to the statute, doubts must be resolved in support of the congressional judg-
ment that this limited program is a necessary step to effectuate the constitutional mandate for equality of eco-
nomic opportunity. The MBE provision may be viewed as a pilot project, appropriately limited in extent and
duration, and subject to reassessment and reevaluation by the Congress prior to any extension or reenactment.
Miscarriages of administration could have only a transitory economic impact on businesses not encompassed by
the program, and would not be irremediable.

Any preference based on racial or ethnic criteria must necessarily receive a most searching examination to make
sure that it does not conflict with constitutional guarantees. This case is one which requires, and which has
received, that kind of examination. This opinion does not adopt, either expressly or implicitly, the formulas
of analysis articulated in such cases as University of California Regents v. Bakke, (1978). However, our analysis
demonstrates that the MBE provision would survive judicial review under either "test" articulated in the sev-
eral Bakke opinions. The MBE provision of the Public Works Employment Act of 1977 does not violate the
Constitution.

Affirmed.

Justice Powell announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion.

This case presents the question whether a school board, consistent with the Equal Protection Clause, may
extend preferential protection against layoffs to some of its employees because of their race or national origin.
774 | ECONOMIC AFFIRMATIVE ACTION

In 1972, the Jackson Board of Education, because of racial tension in the community that extended to its
schools, considered adding a layoff provision to the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between the Board
and the Jackson Education Association (Union) that would protect employees who were members of certain
minority groups against layoffs. The Board and the Union eventually approved a new provision, Article XII of
the CBA, covering layoffs. It stated:

      "In the event that it becomes necessary to reduce the number of teachers through layoff from employment by the
      Board, teachers with the most seniority in the district shall be retained, except that at no time will there be a greater
      percentage of minority personnel laid off than the current percentage of minority personnel employed at the time
      of the layoff. In no event will the number given notice of possible layoff be greater than the number of positions to
      be eliminated. Each teacher so affected will be called back in reverse order for position for which he is certificated
      maintaining the above minority balance."

When layoffs became necessary in 1974, it was evident that adherence to the CBA would result in the layoff of
tenured nonminority teachers while minority teachers on probationary status were retained. Rather than com-
plying with Article XII, the Board retained the tenured teachers and laid off probationary minority teachers,
thus failing to maintain the percentage of minority personnel that existed at the time of the layoff. The Union,
together with two minority teachers who had been laid off, brought suit in federal court, id. at 30 (Jackson Edu­
cation Assn. v. Board of Education (Jackson I) (mem. op.)), claiming that the Board's failure to adhere to the layoff
provision violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment ... Following trial, the District
Court sua sponte concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over the case ...

Rather than taking an appeal, the plaintiffs instituted a suit in state court, Jackson Education Assn. v. Board of
Education, No. 77-011484CZ (Jackson Cty. Cir. Ct.1979) (Jackson II), raising in essence the same claims that
had been raised in Jackson I ... In entering judgment for the plaintiffs, the state court found that the Board had
breached its contract with the plaintiffs ...

... As a result, during the 1976-1977 and 1981-1982 school years, nonminority teachers were laid off, while
minority teachers with less seniority were retained. The displaced nonminority teachers, petitioners here,
brought suit in Federal District Court, alleging violations of the Equal Protection Clause ...

With respect to the equal protection claim, the District Court held that the racial preferences granted by the
Board need not be grounded on a finding of prior discrimination. Instead, the court decided that the racial pref-
erences were permissible under the Equal Protection Clause as an attempt to remedy societal discrimination by
providing "role models" for minority schoolchildren, and upheld the constitutionality of the layoff provision.

The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed, largely adopting the reasoning and language of the District
Court. 746 F.2d 1152 (1984). We granted certiorari, 471 U.S. 1014 (1985), to resolve the important issue of the
constitutionality of race-based layoffs by public employers. We now reverse.

Petitioners' central claim is that they were laid off because of their race in violation of the Equal Protection
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Decisions by faculties and administrators of public schools based on race
or ethnic origin are reviewable under the Fourteenth Amendment.

...

The Court has recognized that the level of scrutiny does not change merely because the challenged classification
operates against a group that historically has not been subject to governmental discrimination. Mississippi Uni­
versity for Women v. Hogan, (1982); Bakke, supra; see Shelley v. Kraemer, (1948) ...

"Any preference based on racial or ethnic criteria must necessarily receive a most searching examination to
make sure that it does not conflict with constitutional guarantees." Fullilove v. Klutznick, (1980) (opinion of
BURGER, C.J.). There are two prongs to this examination. First, any racial classification "must be justified
by a compelling governmental interest." Palmore v. Sidoti, (1984); see Loving v. Virginia, supra, cf. Graham v.
Richardson, (1971) (alienage). Second, the means chosen by the State to effectuate its purpose must be "nar-
rowly tailored to the achievement of that goal." Fullilove, supra. We must decide whether the layoff provision
is supported by a compelling state purpose and whether the means chosen to accomplish that purpose are nar-
rowly tailored.

This Court never has held that societal discrimination alone is sufficient to justify a racial classification. Rather,
the Court has insisted upon some showing of prior discrimination by the governmental unit involved before
allowing limited use of racial classifications in order to remedy such discrimination ...

Societal discrimination, without more, is too amorphous a basis for imposing a racially classified remedy ... No
one doubts that there has been serious racial discrimination in this country. But as the basis for imposing dis-
criminatory legal remedies that work against innocent people, societal discrimination is insufficient and overex-
pansive. In the absence of particularized findings, a court could uphold remedies that are ageless in their reach
into the past, and timeless in their ability to affect the future.

...

Respondents also now argue that their purpose in adopting the layoff provision was to remedy prior discrimina-
tion against minorities by the Jackson School District in hiring teachers.

Evidentiary support for the conclusion that remedial action is warranted becomes crucial when the remedial
program is challenged in court by nonminority employees. In this case, for example, petitioners contended at
trial that the remedial program -- Article XII -- had the purpose and effect of instituting a racial classification
that was not justified by a remedial purpose. 546 F. Supp. at 1199. In such a case, the trial court must make a
factual determination that the employer had a strong basis in evidence for its conclusion that remedial action
was necessary. The ultimate burden remains with the employees to demonstrate the unconstitutionality of an
affirmative action program. But unless such a determination is made, an appellate court reviewing a challenge
by nonminority employees to remedial action cannot determine whether the race-based action is justified as a
remedy for prior discrimination.

Despite the fact that Article XII has spawned years of litigation and three separate lawsuits, no such determi-
nation ever has been made. Although its litigation position was different, the Board in Jackson I and Jackson
II denied the existence of prior discriminatory hiring practices. App. 33. This precise issue was litigated in both
776 | ECONOMIC AFFIRMATIVE ACTION

those suits. Both courts concluded that any statistical disparities were the result of general societal discrimina-
tion, not of prior discrimination by the Board. The Board now contends that, given another opportunity, it
could establish the existence of prior discrimination. Although this argument seems belated at this point in the
proceedings, we need not consider the question, since we conclude below that the layoff provision was not a
legally appropriate means of achieving even a compelling purpose.

...

While hiring goals impose a diffuse burden, often foreclosing only one of several opportunities, layoffs impose
the entire burden of achieving racial equality on particular individuals, often resulting in serious disruption of
their lives. That burden is too intrusive. We therefore hold that, as a means of accomplishing purposes that oth-
erwise may be legitimate, the Board's layoff plan is not sufficiently narrowly tailored. Other less intrusive means
of accomplishing similar purposes -- such as the adoption of hiring goals -- are available. For these reasons, the
Board's selection of layoffs as the means to accomplish even a valid purpose cannot satisfy the demands of the
Equal Protection Clause.

We accordingly reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.

It is so ordered.

Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.

In this case, we confront once again the tension between the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of equal treat-
ment to all citizens, and the use of race-based measures to ameliorate the effects of past discrimination on the
opportunities enjoyed by members of minority groups in our society.

On April 11, 1983, the Richmond City Council adopted the Minority Business Utilization Plan (the Plan). The
Plan required prime contractors to whom the city awarded construction contracts to subcontract at least 30%
of the dollar amount of the contract to one or more Minority Business Enterprises (MBE's). Ordinance No.
83-69-59, codified in Richmond, Va., City Code, 12-156(a) (1985). The 30% set-aside did not apply to city con-
tracts awarded to minority-owned prime contractors.

... The Plan expired on June 30, 1988, and was in effect for approximately five years.

The Plan authorized the Director of the Department of General Services to promulgate rules which "shall allow
waivers in those individual situations where a contractor can prove to the satisfaction of the director that the
requirements herein cannot be achieved." ...

The Director also promulgated "purchasing procedures" to be followed in the letting of city contracts in accor-
dance with the Plan. Bidders on city construction contracts were provided with a "Minority Business Utilization
Plan Commitment Form." Within 10 days of the opening of the bids, the lowest otherwise responsive bidder
was required to submit a commitment form naming the MBE's to be used on the contract and the percentage
of the total contract price awarded to the minority firm or firms ...

...

The parties and their supporting amici fight an initial battle over the scope of the city's power to adopt legisla-
tion designed to address the effects of past discrimination. Relying on our decision in Wygant, appellee argues
778 | ECONOMIC AFFIRMATIVE ACTION

that the city must limit any race-based remedial efforts to eradicating the effects of its own prior discrimina-
tion. This is essentially the position taken by the Court of Appeals below. Appellant argues that our decision
in Fullilove is controlling, and that as a result the city of Richmond enjoys sweeping legislative power to define
and attack the effects of prior discrimination in its local construction industry. We find that neither of these two
rather stark alternatives can withstand analysis.

...

The principal opinion in Fullilove, written by Chief Justice Burger, did not employ "strict scrutiny" or any other
traditional standard of equal protection review. The Chief Justice noted at the outset that although racial classi-
fications call for close examination, the Court was at the same time "bound to approach [its] task with appropri-
ate deference to the Congress, a co-equal branch charged by the Constitution with the power to `provide for the
... general Welfare of the United States' and `to enforce by appropriate legislation,' the equal protection guaran-
tees of the Fourteenth Amendment." ...

Because of [Congress's] unique powers, the Chief Justice concluded that "Congress not only may induce volun-
tary action to assure compliance with existing federal statutory or constitutional antidiscrimination provisions,
but also, where Congress has authority to declare certain conduct unlawful, it may, as here, authorize and induce
state action to avoid such conduct."

In reviewing the legislative history behind the Act, the principal opinion focused on the evidence before Con-
gress that a nationwide history of past discrimination had reduced minority participation in federal construc-
tion grants. The Chief Justice also noted that Congress drew on its experience under 8(a) of the Small Business
Act of 1953, which had extended aid to minority businesses. The Chief Justice concluded that "Congress had
abundant historical basis from which it could conclude that traditional procurement practices, when applied to
minority businesses, could perpetuate the effects of prior discrimination."

The second factor emphasized by the principal opinion in Fullilove was the flexible nature of the 10% set-aside.
[...]The Chief Justice indicated that without this fine tuning to remedial purpose, the statute would not have
"pass[ed] muster."

...

Appellant and its supporting amici rely heavily on Fullilove for the proposition that a city council, like Con-
gress, need not make specific findings of discrimination to engage in race-conscious relief ...

That Congress may identify and redress the effects of society-wide discrimination does not mean that, a fortiori,
the States and their political subdivisions are free to decide that such remedies are appropriate. Section 1 of the
Fourteenth Amendment is an explicit constraint on state power, and the States must undertake any remedial
efforts in accordance with that provision ... The mere recitation of a benign or compensatory purpose for the
use of a racial classification would essentially entitle the States to ... insulate any racial classification from judicial
                                                                                                  ECONOMIC AFFIRMATIVE ACTION | 779

scrutiny ... We believe that such a result would be contrary to the intentions of the Framers of the Fourteenth
Amendment, who desired to place clear limits on the States' use of race as a criterion for legislative action, and
to have the federal courts enforce those limitations ...

It would seem equally clear, however, that a state or local subdivision (if delegated the authority from the State)
has the authority to eradicate the effects of private discrimination within its own legislative jurisdiction. This
authority must, of course, be exercised within the constraints of 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment ...

Thus, if the city could show that it had essentially become a "passive participant" in a system of racial exclusion
practiced by elements of the local construction industry, we think it clear that the city could take affirmative
steps to dismantle such a system. It is beyond dispute that any public entity, state or federal, has a compelling
interest in assuring that public dollars, drawn from the tax contributions of all citizens, do not serve to finance
the evil of private prejudice.

...

The Richmond Plan denies certain citizens the opportunity to compete for a fixed percentage of public con-
tracts based solely upon their race. To whatever racial group these citizens belong, their "personal rights" to be
treated with equal dignity and respect are implicated by a rigid rule erecting race as the sole criterion in an aspect
of public decision-making.

Absent searching judicial inquiry into the justification for such race-based measures, there is simply no way of
determining what classifications are "benign" or "remedial" and what classifications are in fact motivated by ille-
gitimate notions of racial inferiority or simple racial politics. Indeed, the purpose of strict scrutiny is to "smoke
out" illegitimate uses of race by assuring that the legislative body is pursuing a goal important enough to warrant
use of a highly suspect tool. The test also ensures that the means chosen "fit" this compelling goal so closely that
there is little or no possibility that the motive for the classification was illegitimate racial prejudice or stereotype.

Classification based on race carry a danger of stigmatic harm. Unless they are strictly reserved for remedial set-
tings, they may in fact promote notions of racial inferiority and lead to a politics of racial hostility. We thus
reaffirm the view expressed by the plurality in Wygant that the standard of review under the Equal Protection
Clause is not dependent on the race of those burdened or benefited by a particular classification.

...

In Bakke, supra, the Court confronted a racial quota employed by the University of California at Davis Medical
School. Under the plan, 16 out of 100 seats in each entering class at the school were reserved exclusively for cer-
tain minority groups ... His opinion decisively rejected the first justification for the racially segregated admissions
plan. The desire to have more black medical students or doctors, standing alone, was not merely insufficiently
compelling to justify a racial classification, it was "discrimination for its own sake," forbidden by the Constitu-
tion. Id. Nor could the second concern, the history of discrimination in society at large, justify a racial quota in
medical school admissions.
780 | ECONOMIC AFFIRMATIVE ACTION

Justice Powell's opinion applied heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause to the racial classifica-
tion at issue ...

In Wygant, (1986), four Members of the Court applied heightened scrutiny to a race-based system of employee
layoffs. Justice Powell, writing for the plurality, again drew the distinction between "societal discrimination"
which is an inadequate basis for race-conscious classifications, and the type of identified discrimination that can
support and define the scope of race-based relief ...

We think it clear that the factual predicate offered in support of the Richmond Plan suffers from the same two
defects identified as fatal in Wygant. The District Court found the city council's "findings sufficient to ensure
that, in adopting the Plan, it was remedying the present effects of past discrimination in the construction indus-
try." Like the "role model" theory employed in Wygant, a generalized assertion that there has been past discrim-
ination in an entire industry provides no guidance for a legislative body to determine the precise scope of the
injury it seeks to remedy. It "has no logical stopping point." Wygant (plurality opinion)."Relief" for such an ill-
defined wrong could extend until the percentage of public contracts awarded to MBE's in Richmond mirrored
the percentage of minorities in the population as a whole ...

While there is no doubt that the sorry history of both private and public discrimination in this country has con-
tributed to a lack of opportunities for black entrepreneurs, this observation, standing alone, cannot justify a
rigid racial quota in the awarding of public contracts in Richmond, Virginia. Like the claim that discrimination
in primary and secondary schooling justifies a rigid racial preference in medical school admissions, an amorphous
claim that there has been past discrimination in a particular industry cannot justify the use of an unyielding
racial quota.

It is sheer speculation how many minority firms there would be in Richmond absent past societal discrimina-
tion, just as it was sheer speculation how many minority medical students would have been admitted to the
medical school at Davis absent past discrimination in educational opportunities. Defining these sorts of injuries
as "identified discrimination" would give local governments license to create a patchwork of racial preferences
based on statistical generalizations about any particular field of endeavor ...

...

In sum, none of the evidence presented by the city points to any identified discrimination in the Richmond
construction industry. We, therefore, hold that the city has failed to demonstrate a compelling interest in appor-
tioning public contracting opportunities on the basis of race. To accept Richmond's claim that past societal
discrimination alone can serve as the basis for rigid racial preferences would be to open the door to competing
claims for "remedial relief" for every disadvantaged group. The dream of a Nation of equal citizens in a society
where race is irrelevant to personal opportunity and achievement would be lost in a mosaic of shifting prefer-
ences based on inherently unmeasurable claims of past wrongs. We think such a result would be contrary to both
the letter and spirit of a constitutional provision whose central command is equality.

...
                                                                                                   ECONOMIC AFFIRMATIVE ACTION | 781

As noted by the court below, it is almost impossible to assess whether the Richmond Plan is narrowly tailored to
remedy prior discrimination since it is not linked to identified discrimination in any way. We limit ourselves to
two observations in this regard.

First, there does not appear to have been any consideration of the use of race-neutral means to increase minority
business participation in city contracting ... The principal opinion in Fullilove found that Congress had carefully
examined and rejected race-neutral alternatives before enacting the MBE set-aside. There is no evidence in this
record that the Richmond City Council has considered any alternatives to a race-based quota.

Second, the 30% quota cannot be said to be narrowly tailored to any goal, except perhaps outright racial bal-
ancing. It rests upon the "completely unrealistic" assumption that minorities will choose a particular trade in
lockstep proportion to their representation in the local population.

Since the city must already consider bids and waivers on a case-by-case basis, it is difficult to see the need for
a rigid numerical quota. Unlike the program upheld in Fullilove, the Richmond Plan's waiver system focuses
solely on the availability of MBE's; there is no inquiry into whether or not the particular MBE seeking a racial
preference has suffered from the effects of past discrimination by the city or prime contractors.

Given the existence of an individualized procedure, the city's only interest in maintaining a quota system rather
than investigating the need for remedial action in particular cases would seem to be simple administrative conve-
nience. But the interest in avoiding the bureaucratic effort necessary to tailor remedial relief to those who truly
have suffered the effects of prior discrimination cannot justify a rigid line drawn on the basis of a suspect clas-
sification. Under Richmond's scheme, a successful black, Hispanic, or Oriental entrepreneur from anywhere in
the country enjoys an absolute preference over other citizens based solely on their race. We think it obvious that
such a program is not narrowly tailored to remedy the effects of prior discrimination.

Nothing we say today precludes a state or local entity from taking action to rectify the effects of identified dis-
crimination within its jurisdiction ...

Because the city of Richmond has failed to identify the need for remedial action in the awarding of its public
construction contracts, its treatment of its citizens on a racial basis violates the dictates of the Equal Protection
Clause. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is

Affirmed.

Justice O'Connor announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion with respect to Parts I, II, III-
A, III-B, III-D, and IV, which is for the Court except insofar as it might be inconsistent with the views expressed
in JUSTICE SCALIA'S concurrence, and an opinion with respect to Part III-C in which JUSTICE KENNEDY
joins.

Petitioner Adarand Constructors, Inc., claims that the Federal Government's practice of giving general contrac-
tors on government projects a financial incentive to hire subcontractors controlled by "socially and economically
disadvantaged individuals," and, in particular, the Government's use of race-based presumptions in identifying
such individuals, violates the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause ...

In 1989, the Central Federal Lands Highway Division (CFLHD), which is part of the United States Department
of Transportation (DOT), awarded the prime contract for a highway construction project in Colorado to
Mountain Gravel & Construction Company. Mountain Gravel then solicited bids from subcontractors for the
guardrail portion of the contract. Adarand, a Colorado-based highway construction company specializing in
guardrail work, submitted the low bid. Gonzales Construction Company also submitted a bid.

The prime contract's terms provide that Mountain Gravel would receive additional compensation if it hired
subcontractors certified as small businesses controlled by "socially and economically disadvantaged individuals."
Gonzales is certified as such a business; Adarand is not. Mountain Gravel awarded the subcontract to Gonzales,
despite Adarand's low bid, and Mountain Gravel's Chief Estimator has submitted an affidavit stating that
Mountain Gravel would have accepted Adarand's bid had it not been for the additional payment it received
by hiring Gonzales instead. Federal law requires that a subcontracting clause similar to the one used here must
appear in most federal agency contracts, and it also requires the clause to state that [t]he contractor shall presume
that socially and economically disadvantaged individuals include Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native
Americans, Asian Pacific Americans, and other minorities, or any other individual found to be disadvantaged by
the [Small Business] Administration pursuant to section 8(a) of the Small Business Act.15 U.S.C. §§ 637(d)(2),
(3). Adarand claims that the presumption set forth in that statute discriminates on the basis of race in violation
of the Federal Government's Fifth Amendment obligation not to deny anyone equal protection of the laws.

...
                                                                                                  ECONOMIC AFFIRMATIVE ACTION | 783

Adarand's claim arises under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, which provides that "No person shall
... be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law." Although this Court has always under-
stood that Clause to provide some measure of protection against arbitrary treatment by the Federal Govern-
ment, it is not as explicit a guarantee of equal treatment as the Fourteenth Amendment, which provides that
"No State shall ... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws" (emphasis added).
Our cases have accorded varying degrees of significance to the difference in the language of those two Clauses.
We think it necessary to revisit the issue here.

...

In Bolling v. Sharpe, (1954), the Court for the first time explicitly questioned the existence of any difference
between the obligations of the Federal Government and the States to avoid racial classifications. Bolling did note
that "[t]he `equal protection of the laws' is a more explicit safeguard of prohibited unfairness than `due process
of law,'" id., at 499. But Bolling then concluded that, "[i]n view of [the] decision that the Constitution prohibits
the states from maintaining racially segregated public schools, it would be unthinkable that the same Constitu-
tion would impose a lesser duty on the Federal Government." Id.

...

Later cases in contexts other than school desegregation did not distinguish between the duties of the States and
the Federal Government to avoid racial classifications ...

Most of the cases discussed above involved classifications burdening groups that have suffered discrimination
in our society. In 1978, the Court confronted the question whether race-based governmental action designed
to benefit such groups should also be subject to "the most rigid scrutiny." Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke,
involved an equal protection challenge to a state-run medical school's practice of reserving a number of spaces in
its entering class for minority students ... In a passage joined by Justice White, Justice Powell wrote that "[t]he
guarantee of equal protection cannot mean one thing when applied to one individual and something else when
applied to a person of another color." 438 U. S., at 289-290. He concluded that "[r]acial and ethnic distinctions
of any sort are inherently suspect and thus call for the most exacting judicial examination." Id ...

Two years after Bakke, the Court faced another challenge to remedial race-based action, this time involving
action undertaken by the Federal Government. In Fullilove v. Klutznick, (1980), the Court upheld Congress'
inclusion of a 10% set-aside for minority-owned businesses in the Public Works Employment Act of 1977. As
in Bakke, there was no opinion for the Court. Chief Justice Burger, in an opinion joined by Justices White and
Powell, observed that "[a]ny preference based on racial or ethnic criteria must necessarily receive a most search-
ing examination to make sure that it does not conflict with constitutional guarantees." Id. That opinion, how-
ever, "d[id] not adopt, either expressly or implicitly, the formulas of analysis articulated in such cases as [Bakke]."
Id. It employed instead a two-part test which asked, first, "whether the objectives of thee] legislation are within
the power of Congress," and second, "whether the limited use of racial and ethnic criteria, in the context pre-
sented, is a constitutionally permissible means for achieving the congressional objectives." Id ...
784 | ECONOMIC AFFIRMATIVE ACTION

In Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., (1986), the Court considered a Fourteenth Amendment challenge to another
form of remedial racial classification ..."racial classifications of any sort must be subjected to `strict scrutiny.'" Id
...

The Court's failure to produce a majority opinion in Bakke, Fullilove, and Wygant left unresolved the proper
analysis for remedial race-based governmental action ...

With Croson, the Court finally agreed that the Fourteenth Amendment requires strict scrutiny of all race-based
action by state and local governments. But Croson of course had no occasion to declare what standard of review
the Fifth Amendment requires for such action taken by the Federal Government ...

Despite lingering uncertainty in the details, however, the Court's cases through Croson had established three
general propositions with respect to governmental racial classifications. First, skepticism: "`[a]ny preference
based on racial or ethnic criteria must necessarily receive a most searching examination,'" Wygant ... Second,
consistency: "the standard of review under the Equal Protection Clause is not dependent on the race of those
burdened or benefited by a particular classification," Croson ... And third, congruence: "[e]qual protection
analysis in the Fifth Amendment area is the same as that under the Fourteenth Amendment," Buckley v. Valeo,
(1976) ... Taken together, these three propositions lead to the conclusion that any person, of whatever race, has
the right to demand that any governmental actor subject to the Constitution justify any racial classification sub-
jecting that person to unequal treatment under the strictest judicial scrutiny ...

A year later [after Croson], however, the Court took a surprising turn. Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC (1990),
involved a Fifth Amendment challenge to two race-based policies of the Federal Communications Commission.
In Metro Broadcasting, the Court repudiated the long-held notion that "it would be unthinkable that the same
Constitution would impose a lesser duty on the Federal Government" than it does on a State to afford equal pro-
tection of the laws, Bolling. It did so by holding that "benign" federal racial classifications need only satisfy inter-
mediate scrutiny, even though Croson had recently concluded that such classifications enacted by a State must
satisfy strict scrutiny."[B]enign" federal racial classifications, the Court said,

--even if those measures are not "remedial" in the sense of being designed to compensate victims of past gov-
ernmental or societal discrimination--are constitutionally permissible to the extent that they serve important
governmental objectives within the power of Congress and are substantially related to achievement of those
objectives. The Court did not explain how to tell whether a racial classification should be deemed "benign,"
other than to express confiden[ce] that an "examination of the legislative scheme and its history" will separate
benign measures from other types of racial classifications.

...

The three propositions undermined by Metro Broadcasting all derive from the basic principle that the Fifth
and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution protect persons, not groups. It follows from that principle that
all governmental action based on race - - - a group classification long recognized as "in most circumstances
irrelevant and therefore prohibited," Hirabayashi [v. US, (1943)] - - - should be subjected to detailed judicial
inquiry to ensure that the personal right to equal protection of the laws has not been infringed. These ideas have
                                                                                                  ECONOMIC AFFIRMATIVE ACTION | 785

long been central to this Court's understanding of equal protection, and holding "benign" state and federal
racial classifications to different standards does not square with them ... Accordingly, we hold today that all racial
classifications, imposed by whatever federal, state, or local governmental actor, must be analyzed by a reviewing
court under strict scrutiny. In other words, such classifications are constitutional only if they are narrowly tai-
lored measures that further compelling governmental interests.

Finally, we wish to dispel the notion that strict scrutiny is "strict in theory, but fatal in fact." Fullilove (Marshall,
J., concurring in judgment). The unhappy persistence of both the practice and the lingering effects of racial dis-
crimination against minority groups in this country is an unfortunate reality, and government is not disqualified
from acting in response to it ... When race-based action is necessary to further a compelling interest, such action
is within constitutional constraints if it satisfies the "narrow tailoring" test this Court has set out in previous
cases.

Because our decision today alters the playing field in some important respects, we think it best to remand the
case to the lower courts for further consideration in light of the principles we have announced ...

The question whether any of the ways in which the Government uses subcontractor compensation clauses
can survive strict scrutiny, and any relevance distinctions such as these may have to that question, should be
addressed in the first instance by the lower courts.

Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Mr. Justice MILLER delivered the opinion of the court.

The record in this case is not very perfect, but it may be fairly taken that the plaintiff asserted her right to a license
on the grounds, among others, that she was a citizen of the United States ...

The fourteenth amendment declares that citizens of the United States are citizens of the State within which they
reside; therefore the plaintiff was, at the time of making her application, a citizen of the United States and a citi-
zen of the State of Illinois.

...

In regard to that amendment counsel for the plaintiff in this court truly says that there are certain privileges and
immunities which belong to a citizen of the United States as such; otherwise it would be nonsense for the four-
teenth amendment to prohibit a State from abridging them, and he proceeds to argue that admission to the bar
of a State of a person who possesses the requisite learning and character is one of those which a State may not
deny.

In this latter proposition we are not able to concur with counsel. We agree with him that there are privileges
and immunities belonging to citizens of the United States, in that relation and character, and that it is these and
these alone which a State is forbidden to abridge. But the right to admission to practice in the courts of a State is
not one of them. This right in no sense depends on citizenship of the United States. It has not, as far as we know,
ever been made in any State, or in any case, to depend on citizenship at all. Certainly many prominent and dis-
tinguished lawyers have been admitted to practice, both in the State and Federal courts, who were not citizens of
the United States or of any State. But, on whatever basis this right may be placed, so far as it can have any relation
to citizenship at all, it would seem that, as to the courts of a State, it would relate to citizenship of the State, and
as to Federal courts, it would relate to citizenship of the United States.

The opinion just delivered in the Slaughter-House Cases* renders elaborate argument in the present case unnec-
essary; for, unless we are wholly and radically mistaken in the principles on which those cases are decided, the
                                                                                            HISTORICAL TREATMENT OF GENDER | 789

right to control and regulate the granting of license to practice law in the courts of a State is one of those powers
which are not transferred for its protection to the Federal government, and its exercise is in no manner governed
or controlled by citizenship of the United States in the party seeking such license. It is unnecessary to repeat the
argument on- which the judgment in those cases is founded. It is sufficient to say they are conclusive of the pre-
sent case.

JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.

Mr. Justice Bradley:

I concur in the judgment of the Court in this case, by which the judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois is
affirmed, but not for the reasons specified in the opinion just read.

The claim of the plaintiff, who is a married woman, to be admitted to practice as an attorney and counselor at
law is based upon the supposed right of every person, man or woman, to engage in any lawful employment for a
livelihood. The Supreme Court of Illinois denied the application on the ground that, by the common law, which
is the basis of the laws of Illinois, only men were admitted to the bar ...

The claim that under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution, which declares that no state shall make
or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, the statute
law of Illinois, or the common law prevailing in that state, can no longer be set up as a barrier against the right
of females to pursue any lawful employment for a livelihood (the practice of law included), assumes that it is
one of the privileges and immunities of women as citizens to engage in any and every profession, occupation, or
employment in civil life.

It certainly cannot be affirmed, as an historical fact, that this has ever been established as one of the fundamental
privileges and immunities of the sex. On the contrary, the civil law, as well as nature herself, has always recognized
a wide difference in the respective spheres and destinies of man and woman. Man is, or should be, woman's pro-
tector and defender. The natural and proper timidity and delicacy which belongs to the female sex evidently
unfits it for many of the occupations of civil life. The Constitution of the family organization, which is founded
in the divine ordinance as well as in the nature of things, indicates the domestic sphere as that which properly
belongs to the domain and functions of womanhood. The harmony, not to say identity, of interest and views
which belong, or should belong, to the family institution is repugnant to the idea of a woman adopting a dis-
tinct and independent career from that of her husband. So firmly fixed was this sentiment in the founders of the
common law that it became a maxim of that system of jurisprudence that a woman had no legal existence sepa-
rate from her husband, who was regarded as her head and representative in the social state, and, notwithstanding
some recent modifications of this civil status, many of the special rules of law flowing from and dependent upon
this cardinal principle still exist in full force in most states. One of these is that a married woman is incapable,
without her husband's consent, of making contracts which shall be binding on her or him. This very incapacity
was one circumstance which the Supreme Court of Illinois deemed important in rendering a married woman
incompetent fully to perform the duties and trusts that belong to the office of an attorney and counselor.
§790 | HISTORICAL TREATMENT OF GENDER

... The paramount destiny and mission of woman are to fulfill the noble and benign offices of wife and mother.
This is the law of the Creator. And the rules of civil society must be adapted to the general constitution of things,
and cannot be based upon exceptional cases.

The humane movements of modern society, which have for their object the multiplication of avenues for
woman's advancement, and of occupations adapted to her condition and sex, have my heartiest concurrence.
But I am not prepared to say that it is one of her fundamental rights and privileges to be admitted into every
office and position, including those which require highly special qualifications and demanding special responsi-
bilities. In the nature of things, it is not every citizen of every age, sex, and condition that is qualified for every
calling and position. It is the prerogative of the legislator to prescribe regulations founded on nature, reason,
and experience for the due admission of qualified persons to professions and callings demanding special skill
and confidence. This fairly belongs to the police power of the state, and, in my opinion, in view of the peculiar
characteristics, destiny, and mission of woman, it is within the province of the legislature to ordain what offices,
positions, and callings shall be filled and discharged by men, and shall receive the benefit of those energies and
responsibilities, and that decision and firmness which are presumed to predominate in the sterner sex.

For these reasons, I think that the laws of Illinois now complained of are not obnoxious to the charge of abridg-
ing any of the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States.

    Vote: 9-0
    Opinion: J. Brewer
    Decision: Affirmed
    Majority: Brewer, joined by Fuller, Harlan, White, Peckham, McKenna, Holmes, Day and Moody

MR. JUSTICE BREWER delivered the opinion of the court.

On February 19, 1903, the legislature of The State of Oregon passed an act ... the first section of which is in these
words:

"SEC. 1. That no female (shall) be employed in any mechanical establishment, or factory, or laundry in this State
more than ten hours during any one day. The hours of work may be so arranged as to permit, the employment
of females at any time so that they shall not work more than ten hours during the twenty-four hours of any one
day." ...
                                                                                             HISTORICAL TREATMENT OF GENDER | 791

On September 18, 1905, an information was filed in the Circuit Court of the State for the county of Mult-
nomah, charging that the defendant "on the 4th day of September, A. D. 1905, in the county of' Multnomah
and State of Oregon, then and there being the-owner of a laundry, known as the Grand Laundry, in the city of
Portland, and the employer of females therein, did then and there unlawfully permit and suffer one Joe Hasel-
bock, he, the said Joe Haselbock, then and there being an overseer, superintendent and agent of said Curt
Muller, in the said Grand Laundry, to require a female ... to work more than ten hours in said laundry on said
4th day of September, A. D. 1905, contrary to the statutes in such cases made and provided, and against the
peace and dignity of the State of Oregon." A trial resulted in a verdict against the defendant, who was sentenced
to pay a fine of $10. The Supreme Court of the State affirmed the conviction, State v. Muller, 48 Oregon, 252,
whereupon the case was brought here on writ of error.

The single question is the constitutionality of the statute under which the defendant was convicted so far as it
affects the work of a female in a laundry ...

It is the law of Oregon that women, whether married or single, have equal contractual and personal rights with
men ...

It thus appears that, putting to one side the elective franchise, in the matter of personal and contractual rights,
they stand on the same plane as the other sex. Their rights in these respects can no more be infringed than the
equal rights of their brothers. We held in Lochner v. New York ... that a law providing that no laborer shall be
required or permitted to work in bakeries more than sixty hours in a week or ten hours in a day was not, as
to men, a legitimate exercise of the police power of the State, but an unreasonable, unnecessary, and arbitrary
interference with the right and liberty of the individual to contract in relation to his labor, and, as such, was in
conflict with, and void under, the Federal Constitution. That decision is invoked by plaintiff in error as decisive
of the question before us. But this assumes that the difference between the sexes does not justify a different rule
respecting a restriction of the hours of labor.

...

While there have been but few decisions bearing directly upon the question, the following sustain the constitu-
tionality of such legislation ...

The legislation and opinions referred to in the margin may not be, technically speaking, authorities, and in them
is little or no discussion of the constitutional question presented to us for determination, yet they are significant
of a widespread belief that woman's physical structure, and the functions she performs in consequence thereof,
justify special legislation restricting or qualifying the conditions under which she should be permitted to toil.
Constitutional questions, it is true, are not settled by even a consensus of present public opinion, for it is the
peculiar value of a written constitution that it places in unchanging form limitations upon legislative action, and
thus gives a permanence and stability to popular government which otherwise would be lacking. At the same
time, when a question of fact is debated and debatable, and the extent to which a special constitutional limita-
tion goes is affected by the truth in respect to that fact, a widespread and long-continued belief concerning it is
worthy of consideration. We take judicial cognizance of all matters of general knowledge.
792 | HISTORICAL TREATMENT OF GENDER

It is undoubtedly true, as more than once declared by this Court, that the general right to contract in relation
to one's business is part of the liberty of the individual, protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal
Constitution; yet it is equally well settled that this liberty is not absolute, and extending to all contracts, and that
a State may, without conflicting with the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, restrict in many respects
the individual's power of contract ...

That woman's physical structure and the performance of maternal functions place her at a disadvantage in the
struggle for subsistence is obvious. This is especially true wherein the burdens of motherhood are upon her.
Even when they are not, by abundant testimony of the medical fraternity continuance for a long time on her
feet at work, repeating this from day to day, tends to injurious effects upon the body, and as healthy mothers are
essential to vigorous offspring, the physical well-being of woman becomes an object of public interest. and care
in order to preserve the strength and vigor of the race.

Still again, history discloses the fact that woman has always been dependent upon man. He established his con-
trol at the outset by superior physical strength, and this control in various forms, with diminishing intensity has
continued to the present. As minors, though not to the same extent, she has been looked upon in the courts
as needing especial care, that her rights may be preserved. Education was long denied her, and while now the
doors of the school room are opened and her opportunities for acquiring knowledge are great, yet even with that
and the consequent increase of capacity for business affairs it is still true that in the struggle for subsistence she
is not an equal competitor with her brother. Though limitations upon personal and contractual rights may be
removed by legislation, there is that in her disposition and habits of life which will operate against a full assertion
of those rights. She will still be where some legislation to protect her seems necessary. To secure a real equality of
right doubtless there are individual exceptions, arid there are many respects in which she has an advantage over
him; but looking at it from the viewpoint of the effort to maintain an independent position in life, she is not
upon an equality. Differentiated by these matters from the other sex, she is properly placed in a class by herself,
and legislation designed for her protection may be sustained, even when like legislation is not necessary for men
and could not be sustained. It is impossible to close one's eyes to the fact that she still looks to her brother and
depends upon him. Even though all restrictions on political, personal and contractual rights were taken away,
and she stood, so far as statutes are concerned, upon an absolutely equal plane with him, it would still be true
that she is so constituted that she will rest upon and look to him for protection; that her physical structure and
a proper discharge of her maternal functions having in view not merely her own health, but the well-being of
the race justify legislation to protect her from the greed as well as the passion of man. The limitations which this
statute places upon her contractual powers upon her right to agree with her employer as to the' time she shall
labor, are not imposed solely for her benefit, but also largely for the benefit of all.

We have not referred in this discussion to the denial of the elective franchise in the State of Oregon, for while
it may disclose a lack of political equality in all things with her brother, that is not of itself decisive. The rea-
son runs deeper, and rests in the inherent difference between the two sexes, and in different the functions in life
which they perform.
§                                                                                            HISTORICAL TREATMENT OF GENDER | 793

For these reasons, and without questioning in any respect the decision in Lochner v. New York, we are of the
opinion that it cannot be adjudged, that the, act in question is in conflict with the Federal Constitution, so far
as it respects the work of a female in a laundry, and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Oregon is

Affirmed.

MR. JUSTICE. FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.

As part of the Michigan system for controlling the sale of liquor, bartenders are required to be licensed in all
cities having a population of 50,000 or more, but no female may be so licensed unless she be "the wife or daugh-
ter of the male owner" of a licensed liquor establishment ... The case is here on direct appeal from an order of
the District Court ... denying an injunction to restrain the enforcement of the Michigan law. The claim, denied
below ... and renewed here, is that Michigan cannot forbid females generally from being barmaids and at the
same time make an exception in favor of the wives and daughters of the owners of liquor establishments. Beguil-
ing as the subject is, it need not detain us long. To ask whether or not the Equal Protection of the Laws Clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment barred Michigan from making the classification the State has made between wives
and daughters of owners of liquor places and wives and daughters of non-owners, is one of those rare instances
where to state the question is in effect to answer it.

...

While Michigan may deny to all women opportunities for bartending, Michigan cannot play favorites among
women without rhyme or reason. The Constitution in enjoining the equal protection of the laws upon States
precludes irrational discrimination as between persons or groups of persons in the incidence of a law. But the
Constitution does not require situations "which are different in fact or opinion to be treated in law as though
they were the same." Tigner v. Texas. Since bartending by women may, in the allowable legislative judgment, give
rise to moral and social problems against which it may devise preventive measures, the legislature need not go to
the full length of prohibition if it believes that as to a defined group of females other factors are operating which
794 | HISTORICAL TREATMENT OF GENDER

either eliminate or reduce the moral and social problems otherwise calling for prohibition. Michigan evidently
believes that the oversight assured through ownership of a bar by a barmaid's husband or father minimizes haz-
ards that may confront a barmaid without such protecting oversight. This Court is certainly not in a position to
gainsay such belief by the Michigan legislature. If it is entertainable, as we think it is, Michigan has not violated
its duty to afford equal protection of its laws ...

It would be an idle parade of familiar learning to review the multitudinous cases in which the constitutional
assurance of the equal protection of the laws has been applied. The generalities on this subject are not in dispute;
their application turns peculiarly on the particular circumstances of a case. Thus, it would be a sterile inquiry to
consider whether this case is nearer to the nepotic pilotage law of Louisiana, Kotch v. River Port Pilot Commis­
sioners, than it is to the Oklahoma sterilization law, Skinner v. Oklahoma. Suffice it to say that "A statute is not
invalid under the Constitution because it might have gone farther than it did, or because it may not succeed in
bringing about the result that it tends to produce." ...

Nor is it unconstitutional for Michigan to withdraw from women the occupation of bartending because it
allows women to serve as waitresses where liquor is dispensed. The District Court has sufficiently indicated the
reasons that may have influenced the legislature in allowing women to be waitresses in a liquor establishment
over which a man's ownership provides control. Nothing need be added to what was said below as to the other
grounds on which the Michigan law was assailed.

Judgment affirmed.

MR. JUSTICE RUTLEDGE, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and MR. JUSTICE MURPHY join,
dissenting

While the equal protection clause does not require a legislature to achieve "abstract symmetry" or to classify
with `"mathematical nicety,"` that clause does require lawmakers to refrain from invidious distinctions of the
sort drawn by the statute challenged in this case ...

The statute arbitrarily discriminates between male and female owners of liquor establishments. A male owner,
although he himself is always absent from his bar, but may employ his wife and daughter as barmaids. A female
owner may neither work as a barmaid herself nor employ her daughter in that position, even if a man is always
present in the establishment to keep order. This inevitable result of the classification belies the assumption that
the statute was motivated by a legislative solicitude for the moral and physical well-being of women who, but for
the law, would be employed as barmaids. Since there could be no other conceivable justification for such discrim-
ination against women owners of liquor establishments, the statute should be held invalid as a denial of equal
protection.

404 U.S. 71 (1971)

    Vote: 7-0
    Opinion: Burger, joined by Douglas, Brennan, Stewart, White, Marshall and Blackmun
    Decision: Reversed

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER delivered the opinion of the Court.

Richard Lynn Reed, a minor, died intestate in Ada County, Idaho, on March 29, 1967. His adoptive parents,
who had separated sometime prior to his death, are the parties to this appeal. Approximately seven months after
Richard's death, his mother, appellant Sally Reed, filed a petition in the Probate Court of Ada County, seeking
appointment as administratrix of her son's estate. Prior to the date set for a hearing on the mother's petition,
appellee Cecil Reed, the father of the decedent, filed a competing petition seeking to have himself appointed
administrator of the son's estate. The probate court held a joint hearing on the two petitions and thereafter
ordered that letters of administration be issued to appellee Cecil Reed upon his taking the oath and filing the
bond required by law. The court treated §§ 15-312 and 15-314 of the Idaho Code as the controlling statutes and
read those sections as compelling a preference for Cecil Reed because he was a male ...

In issuing its order, the probate court implicitly recognized the equality of entitlement of the two applicants
under § 15-312 and noted that neither of the applicants was under any legal disability; the court ruled, however,
that appellee, being a male, was to be preferred to the female appellant "by reason of Section 15-314 of the Idaho
Code." In stating this conclusion, the probate judge gave no indication that he had attempted to determine the
relative capabilities of the competing applicants to perform the functions incident to the administration of an
estate. It seems clear the probate judge considered himself bound by statute to give preference to the male candi-
date over the female, each being otherwise "equally entitled."

Sally Reed appealed from the probate court order, and her appeal was treated by the District Court of the Fourth
Judicial District of Idaho as a constitutional attack on § 15-314. In dealing with the attack, that court held that
the challenged section violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment ...

In applying that clause, this Court has consistently recognized that the Fourteenth Amendment does not deny
to States the power to treat different classes of persons in different ways ... The Equal Protection Clause of that
amendment does, however, deny to States the power to legislate that different treatment be accorded to persons
placed by a statute into different classes on the basis of criteria wholly unrelated to the objective of that statute. A
796 | SETTING THE STANDARD

classification "must be reasonable, not arbitrary, and must rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and
substantial relation to the object of the legislation, so that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated
alike." ...

In upholding the latter section, the Idaho Supreme Court concluded that its objective was to eliminate one area
of controversy when two or more persons, equally entitled under § 15-312, seek letters of administration, and
thereby present the probate court "with the issue of which one should be named." The court also concluded
that, where such persons are not of the same sex, the elimination of females from consideration

"is neither an illogical nor arbitrary method devised by the legislature to resolve an issue that would otherwise
require a hearing as to the relative merits ... of the two or more petitioning relatives. ..."

Clearly the objective of reducing the workload on probate courts by eliminating one class of contests is not with-
out some legitimacy. The crucial question, however, is whether § 15-314 advances that objective in a manner
consistent with the command of the Equal Protection Clause. We hold that it does not. To give a mandatory
preference to members of either sex over members of the other, merely to accomplish the elimination of hearings
on the merits, is to make the very kind of arbitrary legislative choice forbidden by the Equal Protection Clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment; and whatever may be said as to the positive values of avoiding intrafamily con-
troversy, the choice in this context may not lawfully be mandated solely on the basis of sex.

We note finally that if § 15-314 is viewed merely as a modifying appendage to § 15-312 and as aimed at the same
objective, its constitutionality is not thereby saved. The objective of § 15-312 clearly is to establish degrees of
entitlement of various classes of persons in accordance with their varying degrees and kinds of relationship to
the intestate. Regardless of their sex, persons within any one of the enumerated classes of that section are simi-
larly situated with respect to that objective. By providing dissimilar treatment for men and women who are thus
similarly situated, the challenged section violates the Equal Protection Clause ...

The judgment of the Idaho Supreme Court is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings not incon-
sistent with this opinion.

Reversed and remanded.

MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN announced the judgment of the Court and an opinion in which MR. JUSTICE
DOUGLAS, MR. JUSTICE WHITE, and MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL join.

The question before us concerns the right of a female member of the uniformed services to claim her spouse
as a "dependent" for the purposes of obtaining increased quarters allowances and medical and dental ... on an
equal footing with male members. Under these statutes, a serviceman may claim his wife as a "dependent" with-
out regard to whether she is in fact, dependent upon him for any part of her support ... A servicewoman, on
the other hand, may not claim her husband as a "dependent" under these programs unless he is in fact, depen-
dent upon her for over one-half of his support ... Thus, the question for decision is whether this difference in
treatment constitutes an unconstitutional discrimination against servicewomen in violation of the Due Process
Clause of the Fifth Amendment. A three-judge District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, one judge
dissenting, rejected this contention and sustained the constitutionality of the provisions of the statutes making

Appellant Sharron Frontiero, a lieutenant in the United States Air Force, sought increased quarters allowances,
and housing and medical benefits for her husband, appellant Joseph Frontiero, on the ground that he was her
"dependent." Although such benefits would automatically have been granted with respect to the wife of a male
member of the uniformed services, appellant's application was denied because she failed to demonstrate that her
husband was dependent on her for more than one half of his support. Appellants then commenced this suit,
contending that, by making this distinction, the statutes unreasonably discriminate on the basis of sex in vio-
lation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. In essence, appellants asserted that the discrimina-
tory impact of the statutes is twofold: first, as a procedural matter, a female member is required to demonstrate
her spouse's dependency, while no such burden is imposed upon male members; and, second, as a substantive
matter, a male member who does not provide more than one-half of his wife's support receives benefits, while a
similarly situated female member is denied such benefits ...

Although the legislative history of these statutes sheds virtually no light on the purposes underlying the differ-
ential treatment accorded male and female members, a majority of the three-judge District Court surmised that
Congress might reasonably have concluded that, since the, husband in our society is generally the "breadwinner"
in the family-and the wife typically the "dependent" partner-"it would be more economical to require married
798 | SETTING THE STANDARD

female members claiming husbands to prove actual dependency than to extend the presumption of dependency
to such members." ... Indeed, given the fact Court speculated that such differential treatment might conceivably
lead to a "considerable saving of administrative expense and manpower." ...

...

There can be no doubt that our Nation has had a long and unfortunate history of sex discrimination. Tradi-
tionally, such discrimination was rationalized by an attitude of "romantic paternalism" which, in practical effect,
put, women, not on a pedestal, but in a cage ...

As a result of notions such as these, our statute books gradually became laden with gross, stereotyped distinc-
tions between the sexes, and, indeed, throughout much of the 19th century, the position of women in our soci-
ety was, in many respects, comparable to that of blacks under the pre-Civil War slave codes. Neither slaves nor
women could hold office, serve on juries, or bring suit in their own names, and married women traditionally
were denied the legal capacity to hold or convey property or to serve as legal guardians of their own children ...

It is true, of course, that the position of women in America has improved markedly in recent decades. Neverthe-
less, it can hardly be doubted that, in part because of the high visibility of the sex characteristic, women still face
pervasive, although at times more subtle, discrimination in our educational institutions, in the job market and,
perhaps most conspicuously, in the political arena.

Moreover, since sex, like race and national origin, is an immutable characteristic determined solely by the acci-
dent of birth, the imposition of special disabilities upon the members of a particular sex because of their sex
would seem to violate "the basic concept of our system that legal burdens should bear some relationship to indi-
vidual responsibility. ..." Weber v. Aetna Casualty and Surety Co. (1972). And what differentiates sex from such
nonsuspect statuses as intelligence or physical disability, and aligns it with the recognized suspect criteria, is that
the sex characteristic frequently bears no relation to ability to perform or contribute to society. As a result, statu-
tory distinctions between the sexes often have the effect of invidiously relegating the entire class of females to
inferior legal status without regard to the actual capabilities of its individual members.

We might also note that, over the past decade, Congress has itself manifested an increasing sensitivity to sex-
based classifications. In Tit. VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, for example, Congress expressly declared that
no employer, labor union, or other organization subject to the provisions of the Act shall discriminate against
any individual on the basis of "race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." Similarly, the Equal Pay Act of 1963
provides that no employer covered by the Act "shall discriminate ... between employees on the basis of sex." And
§ 1 of the Equal Rights Amendment, passed by Congress on March 22, 1972, and submitted to the legislatures
of the States for ratification, declares that "[e]quality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by
the United States or by any State on account of sex." Thus, Congress itself has concluded that classifications
based upon sex are inherently invidious, and this conclusion of a coequal branch of Government is not without
significance to the question presently under consideration. Oregon v. Mitchell (1970) (opinion of BRENNAN,
WHITE, and MARSHALL).
                                                                                                              SETTING THE STANDARD | 799

With these considerations in mind, we can only conclude that classifications based upon sex, like classifications
based upon race, alienage, or national origin, are inherently suspect, and must therefore be subjected to strict
judicial scrutiny. Applying the analysis mandated by that stricter standard of review, it is clear that the statutory
scheme now before us is constitutionally invalid.

... Thus, to this extent, at least, it may fairly be said that these statutes command "dissimilar treatment for men
and women who are ... similarly situated." Reed v. Reed.

Moreover, the Government concedes that the differential treatment accorded men and women under these
statutes serves no purpose other than mere "administrative convenience." In essence, the Government maintains
that, as an empirical matter, wives in our society frequently are dependent upon their husbands, while husbands
rarely are dependent upon their wives. Thus, the Government argues that Congress might reasonably have con-
cluded that it would be both cheaper and easier simply conclusively to presume that wives of male members
are financially dependent upon their husbands, while burdening female members with the task of establishing
dependency in fact.

The Government offers no concrete evidence, however, tending to support its view that such differential treat-
ment in fact saves the Government any money. In order to satisfy the demands of strict judicial scrutiny, the
Government must demonstrate, for example, that it is actually cheaper to grant increased benefits with respect
to all male members, than it is to determine which male members are in fact entitled to such benefits and to
grant increased benefits only to those members whose wives actually meet the dependency requirement. Here,
however, there is substantial evidence that, if put to the test, many of the wives of male members would fail to
qualify for benefits. And in light of the fact that the dependency determination with respect to the husbands of
female members is presently made solely on the basis of affidavits, rather than through the more costly hearing
process, the Government's explanation of the statutory scheme is, to say the least, questionable ... And when
we enter the realm of "strict judicial scrutiny," there can be no doubt that "administrative convenience" is not a
shibboleth, the mere recitation of which dictates constitutionality. Shapiro v. Thompson (1970).

... We therefore conclude that, by according differential treatment to male and female members of the uniformed
services for the sole purpose of achieving administrative convenience, the challenged statutes violate the Due
Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment insofar as they require a female member to prove the dependency of her
husband."

    Vote: 6-3
    Decision: Affirmed
    Majority: Douglas joined by Powell, Blackmun, Rehnquist, Burger, Stewart
    Dissenting: Marshall, joined by White, Brennan

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.

Since at least 1885, Florida has provided for some form of property tax exemption for widows.1 The current law
granting all widows an annual $500 exemption ... has been essentially unchanged since 1941. Appellant Kahn is
a widower who lives in Florida and applied for the exemption to the Dade County Tax Assessor's Office. It was
denied because the statute offers no analogous benefit for widowers. Kahn then sought a declaratory judgment
in the Circuit Court for Dade County, Florida, and that court held the statute violative of the Equal Protection
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because the classification "widow" was based upon gender ...

This is not a case like Frontiero v. Richardson ... where the Government denied its female employees both sub-
stantive and procedural benefits granted males "solely ... for administrative convenience." ... We deal here with
a state tax law reasonably designed to further the state policy of cushioning the financial impact of spousal loss
upon the sex for which that loss imposes a disproportionately heavy burden. We have long held that "[w]here
taxation is concerned and no specific federal right, apart from equal protection, is imperiled, the States have large
leeway in making classifications and drawing lines which in their judgment produce reasonable systems of tax-
ation." Lehnhausen v. Lake Shore Auto Parts Co. A state tax law is not arbitrary although it "discriminate[s] in
favor of a certain class ... if the discrimination is founded upon a reasonable distinction, or difference in state pol-
icy," not in conflict with the Federal Constitution. Allied Stores v. Bowers. This principle has weathered nearly
a century of Supreme Court adjudication, and it applies here as well. The statute before us is well within those
limits.

Affirmed.

MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL joins, dissenting.

The Court rejects widower Kahn's claim of denial of equal protection on the ground that the limitation in
Fla.Stat. § 196.191(7) (1971), which provides an annual $500 property tax exemption to widows, is a legislative
classification that bears a fair and substantial relation to

"the state policy of cushioning the financial impact of spousal loss upon the sex for which that loss imposes a
disproportionately heavy burden."

... In my view, however, a legislative classification that distinguishes potential beneficiaries solely by reference
to their gender-based status as widows or widowers, like classifications based upon race, alienage, and national
origin, must be subjected to close judicial scrutiny, because it focuses upon generally immutable characteristics
                                                                                                               SETTING THE STANDARD | 801

over which individuals have little or no control, and also because gender-based classifications too often have been
inexcusably utilized to stereotype and stigmatize politically powerless segments of society. Frontiero v. Richard­
son (1973). The Court is not, therefore, free to sustain the statute on the ground that it rationally promotes legit-
imate governmental interests; rather, such suspect classifications can be sustained only when the State bears the
burden of demonstrating that the challenged legislation serves overriding or compelling interests that cannot be
achieved either by a more carefully tailored legislative classification or by the use of feasible, less drastic means.
While, in my view, the statute serves a compelling governmental interest by "cushioning the financial impact of
spousal loss upon the sex for which that loss imposes a disproportionately heavy burden," I think that the statute
is invalid because the State's interest can be served equally well by a more narrowly drafted statute.

I agree that, in providing special benefits for a needy segment of society long the victim of purposeful discrim-
ination and neglect, the statute serves the compelling state interest of achieving equality for such groups. No
one familiar with this country's history of pervasive sex discrimination against women can doubt the need for
remedial measures to correct the resulting economic imbalances. Indeed, the extent of the economic disparity
between men and women is dramatized by the data cited by the Court ... By providing a property tax exemp-
tion for widows, § 196.191(7) assists in reducing that economic disparity for a class of women particularly disad-
vantaged by the legacy of economic discrimination. In that circumstance, the purpose and effect of the suspect
classification are ameliorative; the statute neither stigmatizes nor denigrates widowers not also benefited by the
legislation. Moreover, inclusion of needy widowers within the class of beneficiaries would not further the State's
overriding interest in remedying the economic effects of past sex discrimination for needy victims of that dis-
crimination. While doubtless some widowers are in financial need, no one suggests that such need results from
sex discrimination as in the case of widows.

The statute nevertheless fails to satisfy the requirements of equal protection, since the State has not borne its
burden of proving that its compelling interest could not be achieved by a more precisely tailored statute or by
use of feasible, less drastic means ...

MR. JUSTICE WHITE, dissenting.

The Florida tax exemption at issue here is available to all widows, but not to widowers. The presumption is
that all widows are financially more needy and less trained or less ready for the job market than men. It may be
that most widows have been occupied as housewife, mother, and homemaker, and are not immediately prepared
for employment. But there are many rich widows who need no largess from the State; many others are highly
trained, and have held lucrative positions long before the death of their husbands. At the same time, there are
many widowers who are needy and who are in more desperate financial straits and have less access to the job mar-
ket than many widows. Yet none of them qualifies for the exemption.
§802 | SETTING THE STANDARD

I find the discrimination invidious, and violative of the Equal Protection Clause. There is merit in giving poor
widows a tax break, but gender-based classifications are suspect, and require more justification than the State has
offered.

MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.

Social Security Act benefits based on the earnings of a deceased husband and father covered by the Act are
payable, with some limitations, both to the widow and to the couple's minor children in her care. § 202(g) of
the Social Security Act ... Such benefits are payable on the basis of the earnings of a deceased wife and mother
covered by the Act, however, only to the minor children, and not to the widower. The question in this case is
whether this gender-based distinction violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

...

Appellee Stephen C. Wiesenfeld and Paula Polatschek were married on November 15, 1970. Paula, who worked
as a teacher for five years before her marriage, continued teaching after her marriage. Each year she worked, max-
imum social security contributions were deducted from her salary. Paula's earnings were the couple's princi-
pal source of support during the marriage, being substantially larger than those of appellee. On June 5, 1972,
Paula died in childbirth. Appellee was left with the sole responsibility for the care of their infant son, Jason Paul.
Shortly after his wife's death, Stephen Wiesenfeld applied at the Social Security office in New Brunswick, N. J.,
for social security survivors' benefits for himself and his son. He did obtain benefits for his son ... and received
for Jason $206.90 per month until September 1972, and $248.30 per month thereafter. However, appellee was
told that he was not eligible for benefits for himself, because ... benefits were available only to women. If he had
been a woman, he would have received the same amount as his son as long as he was not working ... if working,
that amount reduced by $1 for every $2 earned annually above $2,400 ...
                                                                                                              SETTING THE STANDARD | 803

Appellee filed this suit in February 1973 ... on behalf of himself and of all widowers similarly situated. He sought
a declaration that [the law] is unconstitutional to the extent that men and women are treated differently, an
injunction restraining appellant from denying benefits ... solely on the basis of sex, and payment of past benefits
commencing with June 1972, the month of the original application ...

...

Obviously, the notion that men are more likely than women to be the primary supporters of their spouses and
children is not entirely without empirical support. Kahn v. Shevin. But such a gender-based generalization can-
not suffice to justify the denigration of the efforts of women who do work and whose earnings contribute signif-
icantly to their families' support ...

... Since OASDI benefits do depend significantly upon the participation in the work force of a covered employee,
and since only covered employees and not others are required to pay taxes toward the system, benefits must be
distributed according to classifications which do not without sufficient justification differentiate among covered
employees solely on the basis of sex.

... Here, it is apparent both from the statutory scheme itself and from the legislative history ... that Congress'
purpose in providing benefits to young widows with children was not to provide an income to women who
were, because of economic discrimination, unable to provide for themselves. Rather, [the law], linked as it is
directly to responsibility for minor children, was intended to permit women to elect not to work and to devote
themselves to the care of children. Since this purpose in no way is premised upon any special disadvantages of
women, it cannot serve to justify a gender-based distinction which diminishes the protection afforded to women
who do work ...

Given the purpose of enabling the surviving parent to remain at home to care for a child, the gender-based dis-
tinction of [the law] is entirely irrational. The classification discriminates among surviving children solely on the
basis of the sex of the surviving parent. Even in the typical family hypothesized by the Act, in which the husband
is supporting the family and the mother is caring for the children, this result makes no sense ...

Since the gender-based classification of [the law] cannot be explained as an attempt to provide for the special
problems of women, it is indistinguishable from the classification held invalid in Frontiero. Like the statutes
there, "[b]y providing dissimilar treatment for men and women who are ... similarly situated, the challenged sec-
tion violates the [Due Process] Clause." Reed v. Reed (1971).

    Decision: Reversed
    Majority: Blackmun, joined by Burger, Douglas, Brennan, Stewart, White, Marshall, Powell
    Dissent: Rehnquist

MR. JUSTICE. BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case presents the issue whether a state statute specifying for males a greater age of majority than it specifies
for females denies, in the context of a parent's obligation for support payments for his children, the equal pro-
tection of the laws guaranteed by § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Appellant Thelma B. Stanton and appellee James Lawrence Stanton, Jr., were married at Elko, Nev., in February
1951. At the suit of the appellant, they were divorced in Utah on November 29, 1960. They have a daughter,
Sherri Lyn, born in February 1953, and a son, Rick Arlund, born in January 1955. Sherri became 18 on February
12, 1971, and Rick on January 29, 1973. During the divorce proceedings in the District Court of Salt Lake
County, the parties entered into a stipulation as to property, child support, and alimony. The court awarded
custody of the children to their mother and incorporated provisions of the stipulation into its findings and con-
clusions and into its decree of divorce ...

When Sherri attained 18 the appellee discontinued payments for her support. In May 1973 the appellant moved
the divorce court for entry of judgment in her favor and against the appellee for, among other things, support
for the children for the periods after each respectively attained the age of 18 years. The court concluded that on
February 12, 1971, Sherri "became 18 years of age, and under the provisions of [§] 15-2-1 Utah Code Anno-
tated 1953, thereby attained her majority. Defendant is not obligated to plaintiff for maintenance and support
of Sherri Lyn Stanton since that date." ...

The appellant appealed to the Supreme Court of Utah. She contended, among other things, that Utah Code
Ann. 15-2-1 (1953) to the effect that the period of minority for males extends to age 21 and for females to age
18, is invidiously discriminatory, and serves to deny due process and equal protection of the laws in violation of
the Fourteenth Amendment ... On this issue, the Utah court affirmed ...

We noted probable jurisdiction.

We turn to the merits. The appellant argues that Utah's statutory prescription establishing different ages of
majority for males and females denies equal protection; that it is a classification based solely on sex and affects
a child's "fundamental right" to be fed, clothed, and sheltered by its parents; that no compelling state interest
supports the classification; and that the statute can withstand no judicial scrutiny, "close" or otherwise, for it has
no relationship to any ascertainable legislative objective. The appellee contends that the test is that of rationality,
and that the age classification has a rational basis, and endures any attack based on equal protection.
                                                                                                              SETTING THE STANDARD | 805

We find it unnecessary in this case to decide whether a classification based on sex is inherently suspect. Wein­
berger v. Wiesenfeld (1975) [other citations omitted].

Reed, we feel, is controlling here ...

The test here, then, is whether the difference in sex between children warrants the distinction in the appellee's
obligation to support that is drawn by the Utah statute. We conclude that it does not. It may be true, as the Utah
court observed and as is argued here, that it is the man's primary responsibility to provide a home and that it is
salutary for him to have education and training before he assumes that responsibility; that girls tend to mature
earlier than boys; and that females tend to marry earlier than males. The last mentioned factor, however, under
the Utah statute loses whatever weight it otherwise might have, for the statute states that "all minors obtain their
majority by marriage"; thus minority, and all that goes with it, is abruptly lost by marriage of a person of either
sex at whatever tender age the marriage occurs.

Notwithstanding the "old notions" to which the Utah court referred, we perceive nothing rational in the dis-
tinction drawn by § 15-2-1 which, when related to the divorce decree, results in the appellee's liability for sup-
port for Sherri only to age 18 but for Rick to age 21. This imposes "criteria wholly unrelated to the objective
of that statute." A child, male or female, is still a child. No longer is the female destined solely for the home
and the rearing of the family, and only the male for the marketplace and the world of ideas. Taylor v. Louisiana
(1975). Women's activities and responsibilities are increasing and expanding. Coeducation is a fact, not a rarity.
The presence of women in business, in the professions, in government and, indeed, in all walks of life where
education is a desirable, if not always a necessary, antecedent is apparent and a proper subject of judicial notice.
If a specified age of minority is required for the boy in order to assure him parental support while he attains his
education and training, so, too, is it for the girl. To distinguish between the two on educational grounds is to be
self-serving: if the female is not to be supported so long as the male, she hardly can be expected to attend school
as long as he does, and bringing her education to an end earlier coincides with the role-typing society has long
imposed. And if any weight remains in this day to the claim of earlier maturity of the female, with a concomitant
inference of absence of need for support beyond 18, we fail to perceive its unquestioned truth or its significance,
particularly when marriage, as the statute provides, terminates minority for a person of either sex.

...

Our conclusion that in the context of child support the classification effectuated by § 15-2-1 denies the equal
protection of the laws, as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, does not finally resolve the controversy as
between this appellant and this appellee. With the age differential held invalid, it is not for this Court to deter-
mine when the appellee's obligation for his children's support, pursuant to the divorce decree, terminates under
Utah law. The appellant asserts that, with the classification eliminated, the common law applies and that at com-
mon law the age of majority for both males and females is 21. The appellee claims that any unconstitutional
inequality between males and females is to be remedied by treating males as adults at age 18, rather than by with-
holding the privileges of adulthood from women until they reach 21. This plainly is an issue of state law to be

resolved by the Utah courts on remand; the issue was noted, incidentally, by the Supreme Court of Utah ... The
appellant, although prevailing here on the federal constitutional issue, may or may not ultimately win her law-
suit. Harrigfeld v. District Court (1973) [other citations omitted].

MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.

The interaction of two sections of an Oklahoma statute ... prohibits the sale of "nonintoxicating" 3.2% beer to
males under the age of 21 and to females under the age of 18. The question to be decided is whether such a
gender-based differential constitutes a denial to males 18-20 years of age of the equal protection of the laws in
violation of the Fourteenth Amendment ...

... The question thus arises whether appellant Whitener, the licensed vendor of 3.2% beer, who has a live contro-
versy against enforcement of the statute, may rely upon the equal protection objections of males 18-20 years of
age to establish her claim of unconstitutionality of the age-sex differential. We conclude that she may ...

...

Analysis may appropriately begin with the reminder that Reed emphasized that statutory classifications that dis-
tinguish between males and females are "subject to scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause." ... To withstand
constitutional challenge, previous cases establish that classifications by gender must serve important governmen-
tal objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives ... Decisions following Reed
similarly have rejected administrative ease and convenience as sufficiently important objectives to justify gender-
based classifications. Stanley v. Illinois (1972) [other citations omitted]. And only two Terms ago, Stanton v.
Stanton (1975), expressly stating that Reed v. Reed was "controlling," ... held that Reed required invalidation of a
                                                                                                              SETTING THE STANDARD | 807

Utah differential age-of-majority statute, notwithstanding the statute's coincidence with and furtherance of the
State's purpose of fostering "old notions" of role typing and preparing boys for their expected performance in
the economic and political worlds ...

... We turn then to the question whether, under Reed, the difference between males and females with respect to
the purchase of 3.2% beer warrants the differential in age drawn by the Oklahoma statute. We conclude that it
does not.

...

We accept for purposes of discussion the District Court's identification of the objective underlying §§ 241 and
245 as the enhancement of traffic safety. Clearly, the protection of public health and safety represents an impor-
tant function of state and local governments. However, appellees' statistics, in our view, cannot support the con-
clusion that the gender-based distinction closely serves to achieve that objective, and therefore the distinction
cannot, under Reed, withstand equal protection challenge.

The appellees introduced a variety of statistical surveys ... Conceding that "the case is not free from doubt," ...
the District Court nonetheless concluded that this statistical showing substantiated "a rational basis for the leg-
islative judgment underlying the challenged classification.

Even were this statistical evidence accepted as accurate, it nevertheless offers only a weak answer to the equal pro-
tection question presented here. The most focused and relevant of the statistical surveys, arrests of 18-20-year-
olds for alcohol-related driving offenses, exemplifies the ultimate unpersuasiveness of this evidentiary record.
Viewed in terms of the correlation between sex and the actual activity that Oklahoma seeks to regulate-driving
while under the influence of alcohol-the statistics broadly establish that .18% of females and 2% of males in that
age group were arrested for that offense. While such a disparity is not trivial in a statistical sense, it hardly can
form the basis for employment of a gender line as a classifying device. Certainly if maleness is to serve as a proxy
for drinking and driving, a correlation of 2% must be considered an unduly tenuous "fit." Indeed, prior cases
have consistently rejected the use of sex as a decision making factor even though the statutes in question certainly
rested on far more predictive empirical relationships than this ...

... Suffice to say that the showing offered by the appellees does not satisfy us that sex represents a legitimate,
accurate proxy for the regulation of drinking and driving. In fact, when it is further recognized that Oklahoma's
statute prohibits only the selling of 3.2% beer to young males and not their drinking the beverage once acquired
(even after purchase by their 18-20-year-old female companions), the relationship between gender and traffic
safety becomes far too tenuous to satisfy Reed's requirement that the gender based difference be substantially
related to achievement of the statutory objective.

We hold, therefore, that under Reed, Oklahoma's 3.2% beer statute invidiously discriminates against males 18-20
years of age ...

... Even when state officials have posited sociological or empirical justifications for these gender-based differen-
tiations, the courts have struck down discriminations aimed at an entire class under the guise of alcohol regula-
808 | SETTING THE STANDARD

tion. In fact, social science studies that have uncovered quantifiable differences in drinking tendencies dividing
along both racial and ethnic lines strongly suggest the need for application of the Equal Protection Clause in
preventing discriminatory treatment that almost certainly would be perceived as invidious. In sum, the princi-
ples embodied in the Equal Protection Clause are not to be rendered inapplicable by statistically measured but
loose-fitting generalities concerning the drinking tendencies of aggregate groups. We thus hold that the opera-
tion of the Twenty-first Amendment does not alter the application of equal protection standards that otherwise
govern this case.

It is so ordered.

MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, dissenting.

The Court's disposition of this case is objectionable on two grounds. First is its conclusion that men challenging
a gender-based statute which treats them less favorably than women may invoke a more stringent standard of
judicial review than pertains to most other types of classifications. Second is the Court's enunciation of this stan-
dard, without citation to any source, as being that

"classifications by gender must serve important governmental objectives, and must be substantially related to
achievement of those objectives." (emphasis added).

The only redeeming feature of the Court's opinion, to my mind, is that it apparently signals a retreat by those
who joined the plurality opinion in Frontiero v. Richardson (1973) ... from their view that sex is a "suspect" clas-
sification for purposes of equal protection analysis. I think the Oklahoma statute challenged here need pass only

MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.

The question presented is the constitutionality of Alabama alimony statutes which provide that husbands, but
not wives, may be required to pay alimony upon divorce.

On February 26, 1974, a final decree of divorce was entered, dissolving the marriage of William and Lillian Orr.
That decree directed appellant, Mr. Orr, to pay appellee, Mrs. Orr, $1,240 per month in alimony. On July 28,
1976, Mrs. Orr initiated a contempt proceeding in the Circuit Court of Lee County, Ala., alleging that Mr.
Orr was in arrears in his alimony payments. On August 19, 1976, at the hearing on Mrs. Orr's petition, Mr.
Orr submitted in his defense a motion requesting that Alabama's alimony statutes be declared unconstitutional
because they authorize courts to place an obligation of alimony upon husbands but never upon wives. The Cir-
cuit Court denied Mr. Orr's motion and entered judgment against him for $5,524, covering back alimony and
attorney fees. Relying solely upon his federal constitutional claim, Mr. Orr appealed the judgment ... We noted
probably jurisdiction ... We now hold the challenged Alabama statutes unconstitutional and reverse.

...

In authorizing the imposition of alimony obligations on husbands, but not on wives, the Alabama statutory
scheme "provides that different treatment be accorded ... on the basis of ... sex; it thus establishes a classification
subject to scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause," Reed v. Reed (1971). The fact that the classification
expressly discriminates against men rather than women does not protect it from scrutiny. Craig v. Boren (1976).
"To withstand scrutiny" under the Equal Protection Clause, "`classifications by gender must serve important
governmental objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives.'" Califano v. Web­
ster (1977). We shall, therefore, examine the three governmental objectives that might arguably be served by
Alabama's statutory scheme.
810 | APPLYING THE NEW STANDARD

Appellant views the Alabama alimony statutes as effectively announcing the State's preference for an allocation
of family responsibilities under which the wife plays a dependent role, and as seeking for their objective the rein-
forcement of that model among the State's citizens. Cf. Stern v. Stern (1973). We agree, as he urges, that prior
cases settle that this purpose cannot sustain the statutes. Stanton v. Stanton ... held that the "old notio[n]" that
"generally it is the man's primary responsibility to provide a home and its essentials," can no longer justify a
statute that discriminates on the basis of gender ...

The opinion of the Alabama Court of Civil Appeals suggests other purposes that the statute may serve. Its opin-
ion states that the Alabama statutes were "designed" for "the wife of a broken marriage who needs financial assis-
tance," 351 So. 2d at 905. This may be read as asserting either of two legislative objectives. One is a legislative
purpose to provide help for needy spouses, using sex as a proxy for need. The other is a goal of compensating
women for past discrimination during marriage, which assertedly has left them unprepared to fend for them-
selves in the working world following divorce. We concede, of course, that assisting needy spouses is a legitimate
and important governmental objective ...

Ordinarily, we would begin the analysis of the "needy spouse" objective by considering whether sex is a suffi-
ciently "accurate proxy," ... for dependency to establish that the gender classification rests " `upon some ground
of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation,' Reed v. Reed." ... Similarly, we
would initially approach the "compensation" rationale by asking whether women had in fact been significantly
discriminated against in the sphere to which the statute applied a sex-based classification, leaving the sexes "not
similarly situated with respect to opportunities" in that sphere. Schlesinger v. Ballard (1975).

But in this case, even if sex were a reliable proxy for need, and even if the institution of marriage did discriminate
against women, these factors still would "not adequately justify the salient features of" Alabama's statutory
scheme. Craig v. Boren. Under the statute, individualized hearings at which the parties' relative financial cir-
cumstances are considered already occur. Russell v. Russell (1945) [other citations omitted]. There is no reason,
therefore, to use sex as a proxy for need. Needy males could be helped along with needy females with little if any
additional burden on the State. In such circumstances, not even an administrative convenience rationale exists to
justify operating by generalization or proxy. Similarly, since individualized hearings can determine which women
were in fact discriminated against vis-a-vis their husbands, as well as which family units defied the stereotype and
left the husband dependent on the wife, Alabama's alleged compensatory purpose may be effectuated without
placing burdens solely on husbands. Progress toward fulfilling such a purpose would not be hampered, and it
would cost the State nothing more, if it were to treat men and women equally by making alimony burdens inde-
pendent of sex ...

Legislative classifications which distribute benefits and burdens on the basis of gender carry the inherent risk of
reinforcing stereotypes about the "proper place" of women and their need for special protection. United Jewish
Organizations v. Carey (1977) (opinion concurring in part). Thus, even statutes purportedly designed to com-
pensate for and ameliorate the effects of past discrimination must be carefully tailored. Where, as here, the State's
compensatory and ameliorative purposes are as well served by a gender-neutral classification as one that gender
§                                                                                                    APPLYING THE NEW STANDARD | 811

classifies and therefore carries with it the baggage of sexual stereotypes, the State cannot be permitted to classify
on the basis of sex. And this is doubly so where the choice made by the State appears to redound-if only indi-
rectly-to the benefit of those without need for special solicitude ...

Therefore, it is open to the Alabama courts on remand to consider whether Mr. Orr's stipulated agreement to
pay alimony, or other grounds of gender-neutral state law, bind him to continue his alimony payments."

Reversed and remanded.

MR. JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case presents a challenge to the constitutionality of the Massachusetts veterans' preference statute ... on
the ground that it discriminates against women in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment ... [A]ll veterans who qualify for state civil service positions must be considered for appointment
ahead of any qualifying nonveterans. The preference operates overwhelmingly to the advantage of males ...

The Federal Government and virtually all of the States grant some sort of hiring preference to veterans. The
Massachusetts preference, which is loosely termed an "absolute lifetime" preference, is among the most generous
It applies to all positions in the State's classified civil service, which constitute approximately 60% of the public
jobs in the State. It is available to "any person, male or female, including a nurse," who was honorably discharged
from the United States Armed Forces after at least 90 days of active service, at least one day of which was during
"wartime." Persons who are deemed veterans and who are otherwise qualified for a particular civil service job
may exercise the preference at any time and as many times as they wish.

Civil service positions in Massachusetts fall into two general categories, labor and official. For jobs in the official
service, with which the proofs in this action were concerned, the preference mechanics are uncomplicated. All
applicants for employment must take competitive examinations. Grades are based on a formula that gives weight
both to objective test results and to training and experience. Candidates who pass are then ranked in the order of
812 | APPLYING THE NEW STANDARD

their respective scores on an "eligible list." Chapter 31, § 23, requires, however, that disabled veterans, veterans,
and surviving spouses and surviving parents of veterans be ranked -- in the order of their respective scores --
above all other candidates.

Rank on the eligible list and availability for employment are the sole factors that determine which candidates are
considered for appointment to an official civil service position. When a public agency has a vacancy, it requisi-
tions a list of "certified eligibles" from the state personnel division. Under formulas prescribed by civil service
rules, a small number of candidates from the top of an appropriate list, three if there is only one vacancy, are
certified. The appointing agency is then required to choose from among these candidates. Although the veter-
ans' preference thus does not guarantee that a veteran will be appointed, it is obvious that the preference gives to
veterans who achieve passing scores a well nigh absolute advantage.

...

During her 12-year tenure as a public employee, Ms. Feeney took and passed a number of open competitive civil
service examinations. On several she did quite well, receiving in 1971 the second highest score on an examina-
tion for a job with the Board of Dental Examiners, and in 1973 the third highest on a test for an Administrative
Assistant position with a mental health center. Her high scores, however, did not win her a place on the certified
eligible list. Because of the veterans' preference, she was ranked sixth behind five male veterans on the Dental
Examiner list. She was not certified, and a lower scoring veteran was eventually appointed. On the 1973 exami-
nation, she was placed in a position on the list behind 12 male veterans, 11 of whom had lower scores. Following
the other examinations that she took, her name was similarly ranked below those of veterans who had achieved
passing grades.

...

The veterans' hiring preference in Massachusetts, as in other jurisdictions, has traditionally been justified as a
measure designed to reward veterans for the sacrifice of military service, to ease the transition from military to
civilian life, to encourage patriotic service, and to attract loyal and well disciplined people to civil service occupa-
tions.

...

Notwithstanding the apparent attempts by Massachusetts to include as many military women as possible within
the scope of the preference, the statute today benefits an overwhelmingly male class. This is attributable in some
measure to the variety of federal statutes, regulations, and policies that have restricted the number of women
who could enlist in the United States Armed Forces, and largely to the simple fact that women have never been
subjected to a military draft.

When this litigation was commenced, then, over 98% of the veterans in Massachusetts were male; only 1.8% were
female. And over one-quarter of the Massachusetts population were veterans. During the decade between 1963
                                                                                                     APPLYING THE NEW STANDARD | 813

and 1973, when the appellee was actively participating in the State's merit selection system, 47,005 new perma-
nent appointments were made in the classified official service. Forty-three percent of those hired were women,
and 57% were men. Of the women appointed, 1.8% were veterans, while 54% of the men had veteran status ...

The sole question for decision on this appeal is whether Massachusetts, in granting an absolute lifetime prefer-
ence to veterans, has, discriminated against women in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment ...

The equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment does not take from the States all power of classi-
fication. Massachusetts Bd. Of Retirement v. Muria. Most laws classify, and many affect certain groups unevenly,
even though the law itself treats them no differently from all other members of the class described by the law.
When the basic classification is rationally based, uneven effects upon particular groups within a class are ordinar-
ily of no constitutional concern. New York City Transit Authority v. Beazer (other citations omitted).

When a statute gender-neutral on its face is challenged on the ground that its effects upon women are dispropor-
tionably adverse, a twofold inquiry is thus appropriate. The first question is whether the statutory classification
is indeed neutral in the sense that it is not gender based. If the classification itself, covert or overt, is not based
upon gender, the second question is whether the adverse effect reflects invidious gender-based discrimination ...

Apart from the facts that the definition of "veterans" in the statute has always been neutral as to gender and that
Massachusetts has consistently defined veteran status in a way that has been inclusive of women who have served
in the military, this is not a law that can plausibly be explained only as a gender-based classification. Indeed, it
is not a law that can rationally be explained on that ground. Veteran status is not uniquely male. Although few
women benefit from the preference, the nonveteran class is not substantially all female. To the contrary, signif-
icant numbers of nonveterans are men, and all nonveterans-male as well as female-are placed at a disadvantage.
Too many men are affected ... to permit the inference that the statute is but a pretext for preferring men over
women ...

Veterans' hiring preferences represent an awkward-and, many argue, unfair-exception to the widely shared view
that merit and merit alone should prevail in the employment policies of government. After a war, such laws have
been enacted virtually without opposition. During peacetime, they inevitably have come to be viewed in many
quarters as undemocratic and unwise. Absolute and permanent preferences, as the troubled history of this law
demonstrates, have always been subject to the objection that they give the veteran more than a square deal. But
the Fourteenth Amendment "cannot be made a refuge from ill-advised ... laws." . District of Columbia v. Brooke.
The substantial edge granted to veterans ... may reflect unwise policy. The appellee, however, has simply failed to
demonstrate that the law in any way reflects a purpose to discriminate on the basis of sex.

JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.

The question presented is whether the Military Selective Service Act ... violates the Fifth Amendment to the
United States Constitution in authorizing the President to require the registration of males and not female ...

On July 2, 1980, the President, by Proclamation, ordered the registration of specified groups of young men pur-
suant to the authority ... of the Act. Registration was to commence on July 21, 1980. Proclamation No. 4771, 3
CFR 82 (1980).

These events of last year breathed new life into a lawsuit which had been essentially dormant in the lower courts
for nearly a decade. It began in 1971 when several men subject to registration for the draft and subsequent induc-
tion into the Armed Services filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Pennsylvania challenging the MSSA on several grounds. A three-judge District Court was convened in 1974 to
consider the claim of unlawful gender-based discrimination which is now before us ...

Whenever called upon to judge the constitutionality of an Act of Congress-"the gravest and most delicate duty
that this Court is called upon to perform," Blodett v. Holden (1927), the Court accords "great weight to the deci-
sions of Congress." Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Democratic National Committee (1973).

The operation of a healthy deference to legislative and executive judgments in the area of military affairs is evi-
dent in several recent decisions of this Court.

The Solicitor General argues ... emphasizing the deference due Congress in the area of military affairs and
national security, that this Court should scrutinize the MSSA only to determine if the distinction drawn
                                                                                                     APPLYING THE NEW STANDARD | 815

between men and women bears a rational relation to some legitimate Government purpose, United States Rail­
road Retirement Bd. V. Fritz (1980), and should not examine the Act under the heightened scrutiny with which
we have approached gender-based discrimination. Michael M. v. Superior Court of Sonoma County (1981) [other
citations omitted]. . We do not think that the substantive guarantee of due process or certainty in the law will be
advanced by any further "refinement" in the applicable tests as suggested by the Government ... In this case the
courts are called upon to decide whether Congress, acting under an explicit constitutional grant of authority,
has by that action transgressed an explicit guarantee of individual rights which limits the authority so conferred.
Simply labeling the legislative decision "military" on the one hand or "gender-based" on the other does not auto-
matically guide a court to the correct constitutional result.

No one could deny that under the test of Craig v. Boren ... the Government's interest in raising and supporting
armies is an "important governmental interest." Congress and its Committees carefully considered and debated
two alternative means of furthering that interest: the first was to register only males for potential conscription,
and the other was to register both sexes. Congress chose the former alternative. When that decision is challenged
on equal protection grounds, the question a court must decide is not which alternative it would have chosen,
had it been the primary decision- maker, but whether that chosen by Congress denies equal protection of the
laws.

The question of registering women for the draft not only received considerable national attention and was the
subject of wide-ranging public debate, but also was extensively considered by Congress in hearings, floor debate,
and in committee. Hearings held by both Houses of Congress in response to the President's request for autho-
rization to register women adduced extensive testimony and evidence concerning the issue.

Women as a group, however, unlike men as a group, are not eligible for combat. The restrictions on the partic-
ipation of women in combat in the Navy and Air Force are statutory ... The Senate Report specifically found
that "[w]omen should not be intentionally or routinely placed in combat positions in our military services." ...
The President expressed his intent to continue the current military policy precluding women from combat ...
and appellees present their argument concerning registration against the background of such restrictions on the
use of women in combat." ... we must examine appellees' constitutional claim concerning registration with these
combat restrictions firmly in mind.

The existence of the combat restrictions clearly indicates the basis for Congress' decision to exempt women from
registration. The purpose of registration was to prepare for a draft of combat troops. Since women are excluded
from combat, Congress concluded that they would not be needed in the event of a draft, and therefore decided
not to register them ...

The reason women are exempt from registration is not because military needs can be met by drafting men. This
is not a case of Congress arbitrarily choosing to burden one of two similarly situated groups, such as would be
the case with an all-black or all-white, or an all-Catholic or all-Lutheran, or an all-Republican or all-Democratic
registration. Men and women, because of the combat restrictions on women, are simply not similarly situated
for purposes of a draft or registration for a draft.
816 | APPLYING THE NEW STANDARD

Congress' decision to authorize the registration of only men therefore, does not violate the Due Process Clause.
The exemption of women from registration is not only sufficiently but also closely related to Congress' purpose
in authorizing registration. Craig v. Boren (1976) [other citations omitted]. The fact that Congress and the Exec-
utive have decided that women should not serve in combat fully justifies Congress in not authorizing their reg-
istration, since the purpose of registration is to develop a pool of potential combat troops. As was the case in
Schlesinger v. Ballard ..."the gender classification is not invidious, but rather realistically reflects the fact that the
sexes are not similarly situated" in this case ... The Constitution requires that Congress treat similarly situated
persons similarly, not that it engage in gestures of superficial equality ...

... As the Senate Committee recognized a year before, "training would be needlessly burdened by women recruits
who could not be used in combat." ... It is not for this Court to dismiss such problems as insignificant in the
context of military preparedness and the exigencies of a future mobilization.

Congress also concluded that whatever the need for women for noncombat roles during mobilization, whether
80,000 or less, it could be met by volunteers ...

In sum, Congress carefully evaluated the testimony that 80,000 women conscripts could be usefully employed
in the event of a draft and rejected it in the permissible exercise of its constitutional responsibility. The District
Court was quite wrong in undertaking an independent evaluation of this evidence, rather than adopting an
appropriately deferential examination of Congress' evaluation of that evidence.

Reversed.

JUSTICE REHNQUIST announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which THE
CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE STEWART, and JUSTICE POWELL joined.

The question presented in this case is whether California's "statutory rape" law ... violates the Equal Protection
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Section 261.5 defines unlawful sexual intercourse as "an act of sexual
intercourse accomplished with a female not the wife of the perpetrator, where the female is under the age of 18
years." The statute thus makes men alone criminally liable for the act of sexual intercourse.

In July 1978, a complaint was filed in the Municipal Court of Sonoma County, Cal., alleging that petitioner,
then a 17-year-old male, had had unlawful sexual intercourse with a female under the age of 18, in violation of §
261.5. The evidence adduced at a preliminary hearing showed that at approximately midnight on June 3, 1978,
petitioner and two friends approached Sharon, a 16-year-old female, and her sister as they waited at a bus stop.
Petitioner and Sharon, who had already been drinking, moved away from the others and began to kiss. After
being struck in the face for rebuffing petitioner's initial advances, Sharon submitted to sexual intercourse with
petitioner. Prior to trial, petitioner sought to set aside the information on both state and federal constitutional
grounds, asserting that §261.5 unlawfully discriminated on the basis of gender. The trial court and the Califor-
nia Court of Appeal denied petitioner's request for relief and petitioner sought review in the Supreme Court of
California ...

As is evident from our opinions, the Court has had some difficulty in agreeing upon the proper approach and
analysis in cases involving challenges to gender-based classifications ... Unlike the California Supreme Court, we
have not held that gender-based classifications are "inherently suspect" and thus we do not apply so-called "strict
scrutiny" to those classifications. Stanton v. Stanton (1975). Our cases have held, however, that the traditional
minimum rationality test takes on a somewhat "sharper focus" when gender-based classifications are challenged.
Craig v. Boren (1976) (POWELL, concurring). In Reed v. Reed (1971) for example, the Court stated that gen-
der-based classification will be upheld if it bears a "fair and substantial relationship" to legitimate state ends,
while in Craig v. Boren ... the Court restated the test to require the classification to bear a "substantial relation-
ship" to "important governmental objectives."

Underlying these decisions is the principle that a legislature may not
818 | APPLYING THE NEW STANDARD

"make overbroad generalizations based on sex which are entirely unrelated to any differences between men and
women or which demean the ability or social status of the affected class."

Parham v. Hughes (1979) (plurality opinion of STEWART). Applying those principles to this case, the fact that
the California Legislature criminalized the act of illicit sexual intercourse with a minor female is a sure indica-
tion of its intent or purpose to discourage that conduct ... The justification for the statute offered by the State,
and accepted by the Supreme Court of California, is that the legislature sought to prevent illegitimate teenage
pregnancies ...

We are satisfied not only that the prevention of illegitimate pregnancy is at least one of the "purposes" of the
statute, but also that the State has a strong interest in preventing such pregnancy. At the risk of stating the obvi-
ous, teenage pregnancies, which have increased dramatically over the last two decades, have significant social,
medical, and economic consequences for both the mother and her child, and the State.

Of particular concern to the State is that approximately half of all teenage pregnancies end in abortion. And of
those children who are born, their illegitimacy makes them likely candidates to become wards of the State.

We need not be medical doctors to discern that young men and young women are not similarly situated with
respect to the problems and the risks of sexual intercourse. Only women may become pregnant, and they suffer
disproportionately the profound physical, emotional, and psychological consequences of sexual activity ...

The question thus boils down to whether a State may attack the problem of sexual intercourse and teenage preg-
nancy directly by prohibiting a male from having sexual intercourse with a minor female. We hold that such a
statute is sufficiently related to the State's objectives to pass constitutional muster ...

In any event, we cannot say that a gender-neutral statute would be as effective as the statute California has chosen
to enact. The State persuasively contends that a gender-neutral statute would frustrate its interest in effective
enforcement. Its view is that a female is surely less likely to report violations of the statute if she herself would
be subject to criminal prosecution. In an area already fraught with prosecutorial difficulties, we decline to hold
that the Equal Protection Clause requires a legislature to enact a statute so broad that it may well be incapable of
enforcement ...

But we find nothing to suggest that men, because of past discrimination or peculiar disadvantages, are in need of
the special solicitude of the courts. Nor is this a case where the gender classification is made "solely for ... admin-
istrative convenience," Frontiero v. Richardson (1973), or rests on "the baggage of sexual stereotypes" as in Orr v.
Orr.
§                                                                                                    APPLYING THE NEW STANDARD | 819

As we have held, the statute instead reasonably reflects the fact that the consequences of sexual intercourse and
pregnancy fall more heavily on the female than on the male.

Accordingly the judgment of the California Supreme Court is

Affirmed.

JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case concerns a gender-based differential in the law governing acquisition of U. S. citizenship by a child
born abroad, when one parent is a U. S. citizen, the other, a citizen of another nation. The main rule appears in
8 U. S. C. §1401(a)(7) (1958 ed.), now §1401(g) (2012 ed.). Applicable to married couples, §1401(a)(7) requires
a period of physical presence in the United States for the U. S.-citizen parent. The requirement, as initially pre-
scribed, was ten years' physical presence prior to the child's birth, §601(g) (1940 ed.); currently, the requirement
is five years prebirth, §1401(g) (2012 ed.). That main rule is rendered applicable to unwed U. S.-citizen fathers
by §1409(a). Congress ordered an exception, however, for unwed U. S.-citizen mothers. Contained in §1409(c),
the exception allows an unwed mother to transmit her citizenship to a child born abroad if she has lived in the
United States for just one year prior to the child's birth.

The respondent in this case, Luis Ramón Morales-Santana, was born in the Dominican Republic when his
father was just 20 days short of meeting §1401(a)(7)'s physical-presence requirement. Opposing removal to the
Dominican Republic, Morales-Santana asserts that the equal protection principle implicit in the Fifth Amend-
ment entitles him to citizenship stature ...

Santana does not suffer discrimination on the basis of his gender. He complains, instead, of gender-based dis-
crimination against his father, who was unwed at the time of Morales-Santana's birth and was not accorded the
820 | APPLYING THE NEW STANDARD

right an unwed U. S.-citizen mother would have to transmit citizenship to her child. Although the Government
does not contend otherwise, we briefly explain why Morales Santana may seek to vindicate his father's right to
the equal protection of the laws ...

But we recognize an exception where, as here, "the party asserting the right has a close relationship with the per-
son who possesses the right [and] there is a hindrance to the possessor's ability to protect his own interests." Pow­
ers v. Ohio (1991). José Morales' ability to pass citizenship to his son, respondent Morales-Santana, easily satisfies
the "close relationship" requirement. So, too, is the "hindrance" requirement well met. José Morales' failure to
assert a claim in his own right "stems from disability," not "disinterest,". Miller v. Albright (1998) (O'Connor,
concurring in judgment).

Sections 1401 and 1409, we note, date from an era when the lawbooks of our Nation were rife with overbroad
generalizations about the way men and women are. Hoyt v. Florida (1961). Today, laws of this kind are subject
to review under the heightened scrutiny that now attends "all gender-based classifications." J.E.B. v. Alabama ex
rel. T. B. (1994).

Prescribing one rule for mothers, another for fathers, §1409 is of the same genre as the classifications we declared
unconstitutional in Reed, Frontiero, Wiesenfeld, Goldfarb, and Westcott. As in those cases, heightened scrutiny
is in order. Successful defense of legislation that differentiates on the basis of gender, we have reiterated, requires
an "exceedingly persuasive justification." Kirchberg v. Feenstra (1981).

The defender of legislation that differentiates on the basis of gender must show "at least that the [challenged]
classification serves important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed are substan-
tially related to the achievement of those objectives." Mississippi Univ. For Women v. Hogan (1982).

History reveals what lurks behind §1409. Enacted in the Nationality Act of 1940 (1940 Act) ... ended a century
and a half of congressional silence on the citizenship of children born abroad to unwed parents. During this era,
two once habitual, but now untenable, assumptions pervaded our Nation's citizenship laws and underpinned
judicial and administrative rulings: In marriage, husband is dominant, wife subordinate; unwed mother is the
natural and sole guardian of a non-marital child ...

In accord with this eventual understanding, the Court has held that no "important [governmental] interest" is
served by laws grounded, as §1409(a) and (c) are, in the obsolescing view that "unwed fathers [are] invariably
less qualified and entitled than mothers" to take responsibility for nonmarital children. Caban v. Mohammed.
Overbroad generalizations of that order, the Court has come to comprehend, have a constraining impact ...

Infecting the Government's risk-of-statelessness argument is an assumption without foundation."[F]oreign laws
that would put the child of the U. S.-citizen mother at risk of statelessness (by not providing for the child to
acquire the father's citizenship at birth)," the Government asserts, "would protect the child of the U. S.-citizen
father against statelessness by providing that the child would take his mother's citizenship." ... The Government,
however, neglected to expose this supposed "protection" to a reality check. Had it done so, it would have recog-
nized the formidable impediments placed by foreign laws on an unwed mother's transmission of citizenship to
her child ...

One can hardly characterize as gender neutral a scheme allegedly attending to the risk of statelessness for children
of unwed U. S.-citizen mothers while ignoring the same risk for children of unwed U. S.-citizen fathers ...

The gender-based distinction infecting §§1401(a)(7) and1409(a) and (c), we hold, violates the equal protection
principle, as the Court of Appeals correctly ruled. For the reasons stated, however, we must adopt the remedial
course Congress likely would have chosen "had it been apprised of the constitutional infirmity." Levin v. Com­
merce Energy, Inc., (2010). Although the preferred rule in the typical case is to extend favorable treatment ... this
is hardly the typical case. Extension here would render the special treatment Congress prescribed in §1409(c),
the one-year physical-presence requirement for U. S.-citizen mothers, the general rule, no longer an exception.
Section 1401(a)(7)'s longer physical-presence requirement, applicable to a substantial majority of children born
abroad to one U. S.-citizen parent and one foreign-citizen parent, therefore, must hold sway. Going forward,
Congress may address the issue and settle on a uniform prescription that neither favors nor disadvantages any
person on the basis of gender. In the interim, as the Government suggests, §1401(a)(7)'s now-five- year require-
ment should apply, prospectively, to children born to unwed U. S.-citizen mothers ...

The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the
case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

JOSEPH F. WEIS, Jr., Circuit Judge.
822 | APPLYING THE NEW STANDARD

Do the Constitution and laws of the United States require that every public school, in every public school system
in the Nation, be coeducational? Stated another way, do our Constitution and laws forbid the maintenance by
a public school board, in a system otherwise coeducational, of a limited number of single-sex high schools in
which enrollment is voluntary and the educational opportunities offered to girls and boys are essentially equal?
This appeal presents those questions and, after careful consideration, we answer negatively. Accordingly, we
vacate the district court's judgment which held that the school board policy was impermissible.

Plaintiff is a teen-age girl who graduated with honors from a junior high school in Philadelphia. She then
applied to Central High School, a public school in the city, but was refused admission because that institution is
restricted to male students. After that setback, she filed this class action in the United States District Court seek-
ing relief ... from alleged unconstitutional discrimination. After a trial, the district court granted an injunction,
ordering that she and other qualified female students be admitted to Central ...

The plaintiff has stipulated that "the practice of educating the sexes separately is a technique that has a long his-
tory and world-wide acceptance." Moreover, she agrees that "there are educators who regard education in a sin-
gle-sex school as a natural and reasonable educational approach." In addition to this stipulation, the defendants
presented the testimony of Dr. J. Charles Jones, an expert in the field of education. Dr. Jones expressed a belief,
based on his study of New Zealand's sex-segregated schools, that students in that educational environment had
a higher regard for scholastic achievement and devoted more time to homework than those in co-ed institutions.
The district judge commented that even had the parties not stipulated to the educational value of the practice,
"this Court would probably have felt compelled to validate the sex-segregated school on the basis of Dr. Jones'
hypotheses concerning the competition for adolescent energies in a coed school and its detrimental effect on stu-
dent learning and academic achievement" ...

An analysis of the statutory language, which recognizes the background to the legislative effort, is helpful. Con-
gress' finding as to "the maintenance of dual school systems in which students are assigned to schools solely on
the basis of race, color, sex ..." should be read in the light of the policies followed by many communities to avoid
racial integration. It is at least questionable that Philadelphia maintains a "dual school system" and the applica-
tion of this phraseology to the case at bar is dubious ...

The Act's policy declaration is that children are entitled to "equal educational opportunity" without regard to
race, color, or sex. The finding of the district court discloses no inequality in opportunity for education between
Central and Girls High Schools. We cannot, therefore, find that language applicable here.

We conclude the legislation is so equivocal that it cannot control the issue in this case. Our research into the
legislative history reveals no indication of Congressional intent to order that every school in the land be coeduca-
tional and that educators be denied alternatives. That drastic step should require clear and unequivocal expres-
sion. Judicial zeal for identity of educational methodology should not lead us to presume that Congress would
impose such limitations upon the nationwide teaching community by equivocation or innuendo. Congress
spoke clearly enough on single-sex schools in 1972 when it chose to defer action in order to secure the date
                                                                                                     APPLYING THE NEW STANDARD | 823

needed for an intelligent judgment. We do not believe that the ambiguous wording of the Equal Educational
Opportunities Act of 1974 represented an abandonment of the clearly expressed desire to wait for more infor-
mation before making a decision ...

We need not decide whether this case requires application of the rational or substantial relationship tests
because, using either, the result is the same. We conclude that the regulations establishing admission require-
ments to Central and Girls High School based on gender classification do not offend the Equal Protection
Clause of the United States Constitution ...

GIBBONS, Circuit Judge (dissenting).

...

... No doubt had the issue in this case been presented to the Court at any time from 1896 to 1954, a "separate
but equal" analysis would have carried the day. I was under the distinct impression, however, that "separate but
equal" analysis, especially in the field of public education, passed from the fourteenth amendment jurispruden-
tial scene over twenty years ago ... The majority opinion, in establishing a twentieth-century sexual equivalent
to the Plessy decision, reminds us that the doctrine can and will be invoked to support sexual discrimination in
the same manner that it supported racial discrimination prior to Brown. But the resurrection of the "separate
but equal" analysis is not my most serious quarrel with the majority opinion. What I find most disturbing is the
majority's deliberate disregard of an express Congressional finding that the maintenance of dual school systems
in which students are assigned to schools solely on the basis of sex violates the equal protection clause of the
fourteenth amendment ... So long as Congress has acted within the sphere of its legislative competence in mak-
ing such a finding, I submit, we are not free to substitute a "separate but equal" legislative judgment of our own.
Because I conclude that Congress has acted to prohibit the maintenance of single-sex public schools pursuant to
its powers under § 5 of the fourteenth amendment, I dissent from the majority's substitution of a "separate but
equal" legislative judgment. I would affirm the decision below ...

JUSTICE O'CONNOR delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case presents the narrow issue of whether a state statute that excludes males from enrolling in a state-sup-
ported professional nursing school violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

The facts are not in dispute. In 1884, the Mississippi Legislature created the Mississippi Industrial Institute and
College for the Education of White Girls of the State of Mississippi, now the oldest state-supported all-female
college in the United States ... The school, known today as Mississippi University for Women (MUW), has from
its inception limited its enrollment to women ...

Respondent, Joe Hogan, is a registered nurse but does not hold a baccalaureate degree in nursing. Since 1974,
he has worked as a nursing supervisor in a medical center in Columbus, the city in which MUW is located. In
1979, Hogan applied for admission to the MUW School of Nursing's baccalaureate program.' Although he was
otherwise qualified, he was denied admission to the School of Nursing solely because of his sex. School officials
informed him that he could audit the courses in which he was interested, but could not enroll for credit.

Hogan filed an action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi, claiming the
single sex admissions policy of MUW's School of Nursing violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Four-
teenth Amendment. Hogan sought injunctive and declaratory relief, as well as compensatory damages.

...

We begin our analysis aided by several firmly established principles. Because the challenged policy expressly dis-
criminates among applicants on the basis of gender, it is subject to scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment. Reed v. Reed (1971). That this statutory policy discriminates against males rather
than against females does not exempt it from scrutiny or reduce the standard of review. Caban v. Mohammed
(1979) [other citations omitted].

Although the test for determining the validity of a gender-based classification is straightforward, it must be
applied free of fixed notions concerning the roles and abilities of males and females. Care must be taken in
ascertaining whether the statutory objective itself reflects archaic and stereotypic notions. Thus, if the statutory
                                                                                                     APPLYING THE NEW STANDARD | 825

objective is to exclude or "protect" members of one gender because they are presumed to suffer from an inherent
handicap or to be innately inferior, the objective itself is illegitimate. Frontiero v. Richardson (1973) (plurality
opinion).

The State's primary justification for maintaining the single-sex admissions policy of MUW's School of Nursing
is that it compensates for discrimination against women and, therefore, constitutes educational affirmative
action ... As applied to the School of Nursing, we find the State's argument unpersuasive ...

It is readily apparent that a State can evoke a compensatory purpose to justify an otherwise discriminatory classi-
fication only if members of the gender benefited by the classification actually suffer a disadvantage related to the
classification ...

In sharp contrast, Mississippi has made no showing that women lacked opportunities to obtain training in the
field of nursing or to attain positions of leadership in that field when the MUW School of Nursing opened its
door or that women currently are deprived of such opportunities. In fact, in 1970, the year before the School of
Nursing's first class enrolled, women earned 94 percent of the nursing baccalaureate degrees conferred in Missis-
sippi and 98.6 percent of the degrees earned nationwide ... That year was not an aberration; one decade earlier,
women had earned all the nursing degrees conferred in Mississippi and 98.9 percent of the degrees conferred
nationwide ...

Rather than compensate for discriminatory barriers faced by women, MUW's policy of excluding males from
admission to the School of Nursing tends to perpetuate the stereotyped view of nursing as an exclusively
woman's job ...

The policy is invalid also because it fails the second part of the equal protection test, for the State has made no
showing that the gender-based classification is substantially and directly related to its proposed compensatory
objective. To the contrary, MUW's policy of permitting men to attend classes as auditors fatally undermines its
claim that women, at least those in the School of Nursing, are adversely affected by the presence of men ...

Because we conclude that the State's policy of excluding males from MUW's School of Nursing violates the
Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

It is so ordered.

JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.

...

In 1990, prompted by a complaint filed with the Attorney General by a female high-school student seeking
admission to VMI, the United States sued the Commonwealth of Virginia and VMI, alleging that VMI's exclu-
sively male admission policy violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment ...

In the two years preceding the lawsuit, the District Court noted, VMI had received inquiries from 347 women,
but had responded to none of them ..."[S]ome women, at least," the court said, "would want to attend the
school if they had the opportunity." ... The court further recognized that, with recruitment, VMI could "achieve
at least 10% female enrollment"-"a sufficient `critical mass' to provide the female cadets with a positive educa-
tional experience." ... And it was also established that "some women are capable of all of the individual activities
required of VMI cadets." ... In addition, experts agreed that if VMI admitted women, "the VMI ROTC experi-
ence would become a better training program from the perspective of the armed forces, because it would provide
training in dealing with a mixed-gender army." ...

"Women are [indeed] denied a unique educational opportunity that is available only at VMI," the District Court
acknowledged ... But "[VMI's] single-sex status would be lost, and some aspects of the [school's] distinctive
method would be altered," if women were admitted ..."Allowance for personal privacy would have to be made,"
..."[p]hysical education requirements would have to be altered, at least for the women," ... the adversative envi-
ronment could not survive unmodified ... Thus, "sufficient constitutional justification" had been shown, the
District Court held, "for continuing [VMI's] single-sex policy." ...

The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit disagreed and vacated the District Court's judgment. The appel-
late court held: "The Commonwealth of Virginia has not ... advanced any state policy by which it can justify its
determination, under an announced policy of diversity, to afford VMI's unique type of program to men and not
to women."

...

In response to the Fourth Circuit's ruling, Virginia proposed a parallel program for women: Virginia Women's
Institute for Leadership (VWIL). The 4-year, state-sponsored undergraduate program would be located at Mary
                                                                                                     APPLYING THE NEW STANDARD | 827

Baldwin College, a private liberal arts school for women, and would be open, initially, to about 25 to 30 stu-
dents. Although VWIL would share VMI's mission-to produce "citizensoldiers" -the VWIL program would
differ, as does Mary Baldwin College, from VMI in academic offerings, methods of education, and financial
resources.

The average combined SAT score of entrants at Mary Baldwin is about 100 points lower than the score for VMI
freshmen ... Mary Baldwin's faculty holds "significantly fewer Ph. D.'s than the faculty at VMI," ... and receives
significantly lower salaries ... While VMI offers degrees in liberal arts, the sciences, and engineering, Mary Bald-
win, at the time of trial, offered only bachelor of arts degrees ... A VWIL student seeking to earn an engineering
degree could gain one, without public support, by attending Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, for
two years, paying the required private tuition.

Experts in educating women at the college level composed the Task Force charged with designing the VWIL pro-
gram; Task Force members were drawn from Mary Baldwin's own faculty and staff ... Training its attention on
methods of instruction appropriate for "most women," the Task Force determined that a military model would
be "wholly inappropriate" for VWIL.

VWIL students would participate in ROTC programs and a newly established, "largely ceremonial" Virginia
Corps of Cadets, ... but the VWIL House would not have a military format ... and VWIL would not require its
students to eat meals together or to wear uniforms during the schoolday ... In lieu of VMI's adversative method,
the VWIL Task Force favored "a cooperative method which reinforces self-esteem ... In addition to the standard
bachelor of arts program offered at Mary Baldwin, VWIL students would take courses in leadership, complete
an off-campus leadership externship, participate in community service projects, and assist in arranging a speaker
series.

Virginia represented that it will provide equal financial support for in-state VWIL students and VMI cadets ...
and the VMI Foundation agreed to supply a $5.4625 million endowment for the VWIL program ... Mary Bald-
win's own endowment is about $19 million; VMI's is $131 million ... Mary Baldwin will add $35 million to its
endowment based on future commitments; VMI will add $220 million ... The VMI Alumni Association has
developed a network of employers interested in hiring VMI graduates. The Association has agreed to open its
network to VWIL graduates ... but those graduates will not have the advantage afforded by a VMI degree.

Virginia returned to the District Court seeking approval of its proposed remedial plan, and the court decided the
plan met the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause ... A divided Court of Appeals affirmed the District
Court's judgment.

...

The cross-petitions in this suit present two ultimate issues. First, does Virginia's exclusion of women from the
educational opportunities provided by VMI -extraordinary opportunities for military training and civilian lead-
ership development-deny to women "capable of all of the individual activities required of VMI cadets," ... the
828 | APPLYING THE NEW STANDARD

equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment? Second, if VMI's "unique" situation
... as Virginia's sole single-sex public institution of higher education-offends the Constitution's equal protection
principle, what is the remedial requirement?

... To summarize the Court's current directions for cases of official classification based on gender: Focusing on
the differential treatment or denial of opportunity for which relief is sought, the reviewing court must deter-
mine whether the proffered justification is "exceedingly persuasive." The burden of justification is demand-
ing and it rests entirely on the State ... The State must show "at least that the [challenged] classification serves
`important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed' are `substantially related to
the achievement of those objectives.'" ... The justification must be genuine, not hypothesized or invented post
hoc in response to litigation. And it must not rely on overbroad generalizations about the different talents, capac-
ities, or preferences of males and females ...

The heightened review standard our precedent establishes does not make sex a proscribed classification. Sup-
posed "inherent differences" are no longer accepted as a ground for race or national origin classification. Loving
v. Virginia (1967). Physical differences between men and women, however, are enduring: "[T]he two sexes are
not fungible; a community made up exclusively of one [sex] is different from a community composed of both."

...

Measuring the record in this case against the review standard just described, we conclude that Virginia has shown
no "exceedingly persuasive justification" for excluding all women from the citizen-soldier training afforded by
VMI. We therefore affirm the Fourth Circuit's initial judgment, which held that Virginia had violated the Four-
teenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. Because the remedy proffered by Virginia-the Mary Baldwin
VWIL program-does not cure the constitutional violation, i. e., it does not provide equal opportunity, we reverse
the Fourth Circuit's final judgment in this case.

...

The Fourth Circuit initially held that Virginia had advanced no state policy by which it could justify, under
equal protection principles, its determination "to afford VMI's unique type of program to men and not to
women." ... Virginia challenges that "liability" ruling and asserts two justifications in defense of VMI's exclu-
sion of women. First, the Commonwealth contends, "single-sex education provides important educational ben-
efits," ... and the option of single-sex education contributes to "diversity in educational approaches," ... Second,
the Commonwealth argues, "the unique VMI method of character development and leadership training," the
school's adversative approach, would have to be modified were VMI to admit women ... We consider these two
justifications in turn.

Single-sex education affords pedagogical benefits to at least some students, Virginia emphasizes, and that reality
is uncontested in this litigation. Similarly, it is not disputed that diversity among public educational institutions
can serve the public good. But Virginia has not shown that VMI was established, or has been maintained, with
                                                                                                    APPLYING THE NEW STANDARD | 829

a view to diversifying, by its categorical exclusion of women, educational opportunities within the Common-
wealth ... Neither recent nor distant history bears out Virginia's alleged pursuit of diversity through single-sex
educational options.

...

Virginia next argues that VMI's adversative method of training provides educational benefits that cannot be
made available, unmodified, to women. Alterations to accommodate women would necessarily be "radical," so
"drastic," Virginia asserts, as to transform, indeed "destroy," VMI's program ... Neither sex would be favored by
the transformation, Virginia maintains:

Men would be deprived of the unique opportunity currently available to them; women would not gain that
opportunity because their participation would "eliminat[e] the very aspects of [the] program that distinguish
[VMI] from ... other institutions of higher education in Virginia."

...

The notion that admission of women would downgrade VMI's stature, destroy the adversative system and,
with it, even the school, is a judgment hardly proved, a prediction hardly different from other "self-fulfilling
prophec[ies]," ... once routinely used to deny rights or opportunities ... Women's successful entry into the federal
military academies, and their participation in the Nation's military forces, indicate that Virginia's fears for the
future of VMI may not be solidly grounded ...

Virginia and VMI trained their argument on "means" rather than "end," and thus misperceived our precedent.
Single-sex education at VMI serves an "important governmental objective," they maintained, and exclusion of
women is not only "substantially related," it is essential to that objective. By this notably circular argument, the
"straightforward" test Mississippi Univ. for Women described ... was bent and bowed ... Virginia, in sum, "has
fallen far short of establishing the `exceedingly persuasive justification,'" ... that must be the solid base for any
gender-defined classification.

...

In the second phase of the litigation, Virginia presented its remedial plan-maintain VMI as a male-only college
and create VWIL as a separate program for women. The plan met District Court approval. The Fourth Circuit,
in turn, deferentially reviewed the Commonwealth's proposal and decided that the two single-sex programs
directly served Virginia's reasserted purposes ... the Court of Appeals concluded that Virginia had arranged for
men and women opportunities "sufficiently comparable" to survive equal protection evaluation ... The United
States challenges this "remedial" ruling as pervasively misguided.

A remedial decree, this Court has said, must closely fit the constitutional violation; it must be shaped to place
persons unconstitutionally denied an opportunity or advantage in "the position they would have occupied in
the absence of [discrimination]." ... A remedial decree, this Court has said, must closely fit the constitutional vio-
lation; it must be shaped to place persons unconstitutionally denied an opportunity or advantage in "the posi-
tion they would have occupied in the absence of [discrimination]." ...
830 | APPLYING THE NEW STANDARD

Virginia chose not to eliminate, but to leave untouched, VMI's exclusionary policy. For women only, however,
Virginia proposed a separate program, different in kind from VMI and unequal in tangible and intangible facil-
ities ...

VWIL affords women no opportunity to experience the rigorous military training for which VMI is famed ...
Virginia deliberately did not make VWIL a military institute ... VWIL students thus do not experience the "bar-
racks" life "crucial to the VMI experience," the spartan living arrangements designed to foster an "egalitarian
ethic."

VWIL students receive their "leadership training" in seminars, externships, and speaker series ... episodes and
encounters lacking the "[p]hysical rigor, mental stress, ... minute regulation of behavior, and indoctrination in
desirable values" made hallmarks of VMI's citizen-soldier training ... Kept away from the pressures, hazards, and
psychological bonding characteristic of VMI's adversative training ... VWIL students will not know the "feeling
of tremendous accomplishment" commonly experienced by VMI's successful cadets ...

As earlier stated ... generalizations about "the way women are," estimates of what is appropriate for most
women, no longer justify denying opportunity to women whose talent and capacity place them outside the
average description. Notably, Virginia never asserted that VMI's method of education suits most men. It is also
revealing that Virginia accounted for its failure to make the VWIL experience "the entirely militaristic experience
of VMI" on the ground that VWIL "is planned for women who do not necessarily expect to pursue military
careers ... By that reasoning, VMI's "entirely militaristic" program would be inappropriate for men in general
or as a group, for "[o]nly about 15% of VMI cadets enter career military service."

...

In myriad respects other than military training, VWIL does not qualify as VMI's equal. VWIL's student body,
faculty, course offerings, and facilities hardly match VMI's. Nor can the VWIL graduate anticipate the benefits
associated with VMI's 157-year history, the school's prestige, and its influential alumni network ... Mary Bald-
win does not offer a VWIL student the range of curricular choices available to a VMI cadet ... The VWIL stu-
dent does not graduate with the advantage of a VMI degree. Her diploma does not unite her with the legions of
VMI "graduates [who] have distinguished themselves" in military and civilian life ...

Virginia, in sum, while maintaining VMI for men only, has failed to provide any "comparable single-gender
women's institution ...

Virginia's VWIL solution is reminiscent of the remedy Texas proposed 50 years ago, in response to a state trial
court's 1946 ruling that, given the equal protection guarantee, African-Americans could not be denied a legal
education at a state facility ... Reluctant to admit African-Americans to its flagship University of Texas Law
School, the State set up a separate school for Heman Sweatt and other black law students ... As originally opened,
the new school had no independent faculty or library, and it lacked accreditation ... Nevertheless, the state trial
and appellate courts were satisfied that the new school offered Sweatt opportunities for the study of law "sub-
stantially equivalent to those offered by the State to white students at the University of Texas." ...
                                                                                                     APPLYING THE NEW STANDARD | 831

There is no reason to believe that the admission of women capable of all the activities required of VMI cadets
would destroy the Institute rather than enhance its capacity to serve the "more perfect Union."

For the reasons stated, the initial judgment of the Court of Appeals, 976 F. 2d 890 (CA4 1992), is affirmed, the
final judgment of the Court of Appeals, 44 F. 3d 1229 (CA4 1995), is reversed, and the case is remanded for

    Decision: Reversed
    Majority: Warren, joined by Black, Reed, Frankfurter, Douglas, Jackson, Burton, Clark and Minton

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.

The petitioner, Pete Hernandez, was indicted for the murder of one Joe Espinosa by a grand jury in Jackson
County, Texas. He was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
affirmed the judgment of the trial court ... Prior to the trial, the petitioner, by his counsel, offered timely motions
to quash the indictment and the jury panel. He alleged that persons of Mexican descent were systematically
excluded from service as jury commissioners,' grand jurors, and petit jurors, although there were such persons
fully qualified to serve residing in Jackson County. The petitioner asserted that exclusion of this class deprived
him, as a member of the class, of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment
of the Constitution. After a hearing, the trial court denied the motions. At the trial, the motions were renewed,
further evidence taken, and the motions again denied. An allegation that the trial court erred in denying the
motions was the sole basis of petitioner's appeal. In affirming the judgment of the trial court, the Texas Court of
Criminal Appeals considered and passed upon the substantial federal question raised by the petitioner ...

Throughout our history differences in race and color have defined easily identifiable groups which have at times
required the aid of the courts in securing equal treatment under the laws. But community prejudices are not
static, and from time to time other differences from the community norm may define other groups which need
the same protection. Whether such a group exists within a community is a question of fact. When the existence
of a distinct class is demonstrated, and it is further shown that the laws, as written or as applied, single out that
class for different treatment not based on some reasonable classification, the guarantees of the Constitution have
been violated. The Fourteenth Amendment is not directed solely against discrimination due to a "two-class the-
ory"-that is, based upon differences between "white" and Negro ...

The petitioner established that 14% of the population of Jackson County were persons with Mexican or Latin-
American surnames, and that 11% of the males over 21 bore such names. The County Tax Assessor testified
that 6 or 7 percent of the freeholders on the tax rolls of the County were persons of Mexican descent. The State
of Texas stipulated that "for the last twenty-five years there is no record of any person with a Mexican or Latin
American name having served on a jury commission, grand jury or petit jury in Jackson County." The parties
                                                                           EQUAL PROTECTION BEYOND RACE AND GENDER | 833

also stipulated that "there are some male persons of Mexican or Latin American descent in Jackson County who,
by virtue of being citizens, householders, or freeholders, and having all other legal prerequisites to jury service,
are eligible to serve as members of a jury commission, grand jury and/or petit jury." ...

To rebut the strong prima facie case of the denial of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Constitu-
tion thus established, the State offered the testimony of five jury commissioners that they had not discriminated
against persons of Mexican or Latin-American descent in selecting jurors. They stated that their only objective
had been to select those whom they thought were best qualified. This testimony is not enough to overcome the
petitioner's case ...

Circumstances or chance may well dictate that no persons in a certain class will serve on a particular jury or dur-
ing some particular period. But it taxes our credulity to say that mere chance resulted in there being no members
of this class among the over six thousand jurors called in the past 25 years. The result bespeaks discrimination,
whether or not it was a conscious decision on the part of any individual jury commissioner. The judgment of
conviction must be reversed.

To say that this decision revives the rejected contention that the Fourteenth Amendment requires proportional
representation of all the component ethnic groups of the community on every jury 18 ignores the facts. The
petitioner did not seek proportional representation, nor did he claim a right to have persons of Mexican descent
sit on the particular juries which he faced." His only claim is the right to be indicted and tried by juries from
which all members of his class are not systematically excluded juries selected from among all qualified persons
regardless of national origin or descent. To this much, he is entitled by the Constitution.

MR. JUSTICE POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court.

This suit attacking the Texas system of financing public education was initiated by Mexican-American parents
whose children attend the. elementary and secondary schools in the Edgewood Independent School District, an
urban school district in San Antonio, Texas. They brought a class action on behalf of schoolchildren throughout
the State who are members of minority groups or who are poor and reside in school districts having a low prop-
erty tax base ... The complaint was filed in the summer of 1968 and a three-judge court was impaneled in January
1969. In December, 1971, the panel rendered its judgment in a per curiam opinion holding the Texas school
finance system unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The State
appealed, and we noted probable jurisdiction to consider the far-reaching constitutional questions presented ...

Until recent times, Texas was a predominantly rural State, and its population and property wealth were spread
relatively evenly across the State. Sizable differences in the value of assessable property between local school
districts became increasingly evident as the State became more industrialized and as rural-to-urban population
shifts became more pronounced ... Recognizing the need for increased state funding to help offset disparities in
local spending and to meet Texas' changing educational requirements, the state legislature, in the late 1940's,
undertook a thorough evaluation of public education with an eye toward major reform ... The Program calls
for state and local contributions to a fund earmarked specifically for teacher salaries, operating expenses, and
transportation costs. The State, supplying funds from its general revenues, finances approximately 80% of the
Program, and the school districts are responsible -- as a unit -- for providing the remaining 20% ... The district,
in turn, finances its share of the Assignment out of revenues from local property taxation.

...

The school district in which appellees reside, the Edgewood Independent School District, has been compared
throughout this litigation with the Alamo Heights Independent School District. This comparison between the
least and most affluent districts in the San Antonio area serves to illustrate the manner in which the dual system
of finance operates and to indicate the extent to which substantial disparities exist despite the State's impres-
sive progress in recent years. Edgewood is one of seven public school districts in the metropolitan area. Approx-
imately 22,000 students are enrolled in its 25 elementary and secondary schools. The district is situated in the
                                                                           EQUAL PROTECTION BEYOND RACE AND GENDER | 835

core-city sector of San Antonio in a residential neighborhood that has little commercial or industrial property.
The residents are predominantly of Mexican-American descent: approximately 90% of the student population
is Mexican-American and over 6% is Negro. The average assessed property value per pupil is $5,960-the lowest
in the metropolitan area-and the median family income ($4,686) is also the lowest. At an equalized tax rate of
$1.05 per $100 of assessed property-the highest in the metropolitan area-the district contributed $26 to the edu-
cation of each child for the 1967- 1968 school year above its Local Fund Assignment for the Minimum Founda-
tion Program. The Foundation Program contributed $222 per pupil for a state-local total of $248. Federal funds
added another $108 for a total of $356 per pupil.

Alamo Heights is the most affluent school district in San Antonio. Its six schools, housing approximately 5,000
students, are situated in a residential community quite unlike the Edgewood District. The school population is
predominantly "Anglo," having only 18% Mexican-Americans less than 1% Negroes. The assessed property value
per pupil exceeds $49,000, and the median family income is $8,001. In 1967-1968 the local tax rate of $.85 per
$100 of valuation yielded $333 per pupil over and above its contribution to the Foundation Program. Coupled
with the $225 provided from that Program, the district was able to supply $558 per student. Supplemented by a
$36 per-pupil grant from federal sources, Alamo Heights spent $594 per pupil.

... And it was these disparities, largely attributable to differences in the amounts of money collected through local
property taxation, that led the District Court to conclude that Texas' dual system of public school financing vio-
lated the Equal Protection Clause. The District Court held that the Texas system discriminates on the basis of
wealth in the manner in which education is provided for its people. 337 F. Supp. at 282. Finding that wealth is
a "suspect" classification, and that education is a "fundamental" interest, the District Court held that the Texas
system could be sustained only if the State could show that it was premised upon some compelling [st]ate inter-
est ...

Texas virtually concedes that its historically rooted dual system of financing education could not withstand the
strict judicial scrutiny that this Court has found appropriate in reviewing legislative judgments that interfere
with fundamental constitutional rights or that involve suspect classifications. If, as previous decisions have indi-
cated, strict scrutiny means that the State's system is not entitled to the usual presumption of validity, that the
State rather than the complainants must carry a "heavy burden of justification," that the State must demonstrate
that its educational system has been structured with "precision," and is "tailored" narrowly to serve legitimate
objectives and that it has selected the "less drastic means" for effectuating its objectives, the Texas financing sys-
tem and its counterpart in virtually every other State will not pass muster. The State candidly admits that "[n]o
one familiar with the Texas system would contend that it has yet achieved perfection." Apart from its concession
that educational financing in Texas has "defects" and "imperfections," the State defends the systems rationality
with vigor and disputes the District Court's finding that it lacks a "reasonable basis." ...

This, then, establishes the framework for our analysis. We must decide, first, whether the Texas system of financ-
ing public education operates to the disadvantage of some suspect class or impinges upon a fundamental right
explicitly or implicitly protected by the Constitution, thereby requiring strict judicial scrutiny. If so, the judg-
836 | EQUAL PROTECTION BEYOND RACE AND GENDER

ment of the District Court should be affirmed. If not, the Texas scheme must still be examined to determine
whether it rationally furthers some legitimate, articulated state purpose and therefore does not constitute an
invidious discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment ...

The case comes to us with no definitive description of the classifying facts or delineation of the disfavored class.
Examination of the District Court's opinion and of appellees' complaint, briefs, and contentions at oral argu-
ment suggests, however, at least three ways in which the discrimination claimed here might be described. The
Texas system of school financing might be regarded as discriminating (1) against "poor" persons whose incomes
fall below some identifiable level of poverty or who might be characterized as functionally "indigent," or (2)
against those who are relatively poorer than others," or (3) against all those who, irrespective of their personal
incomes, happen to reside in relatively poorer school districts. Our task must be to ascertain whether, in fact,
the Texas system has been shown to discriminate on any of these possible bases and, if so, whether the resulting
classification may be regarded as suspect.

The precedents of this Court provide the proper starting point. The individuals, or groups of individuals, who
constituted the class discriminated against in our prior cases shared two distinguishing characteristics: because
of their impecunity, they were completely unable to pay for some desired benefit, and, as a consequence, they
sustained an absolute deprivation of a meaningful opportunity to enjoy that benefit ...

Only appellees' first possible basis for describing the class disadvantaged by the Texas school financing system --
discrimination against a class of definably "poor" persons -- might arguably meet the criteria established in these
prior cases. Even a cursory examination, however, demonstrates that neither of the two distinguishing character-
istics of wealth classifications can be found here. First, in support of their charge that the system discriminates
against the "poor," appellees have made no effort to demonstrate that it operates to the peculiar disadvantage
of any class fairly definable as indigent, or as composed of persons whose incomes are beneath any designated
poverty level ...

Second, neither appellees nor the District Court addressed the fact that, unlike each of the foregoing cases, lack
of personal resources has not occasioned an absolute deprivation of the desired benefit. The argument here is
not that the children in districts having relatively low assessable property values are receiving no public educa-
tion; rather, it is that they are receiving a poorer quality education than that available to children in districts hav-
ing more assessable wealth. Apart from the unsettled and disputed question whether the quality of education
may be determined by the amount of money expended for it, 6 a sufficient answer to appellees' argument is that,
at least where- wealth is involved, the Equal Protection Clause does not require absolute, equality or precisely
equal advantages. Nor, indeed, in view of the infinite variables affecting the educational process, can any system
assure equal, quality of education except in the most relative sense. Texas asserts that the Minimum Founda-
tion Program provides an "adequate" education for all children in the State. By providing 12 years of free public
school education, and by assuring teachers, books, transportation, and operating funds, the Texas Legislature
has endeavored to "guarantee, for, the welfare of the state as a whole, that all people shall have at least an ade-
quate program of education. This is what is meant by `A Minimum Foundation Program of Education.'" The
                                                                           EQUAL PROTECTION BEYOND RACE AND GENDER | 837

State repeatedly asserted in its briefs in this Court that it has fulfilled this desire and that it now assures "every
child in every school district an adequate education." No proof was offered at trial persuasively discrediting or
refuting the State's assertion ...

For these two reasons-the absence of any evidence that the financing system discriminates against any definable
category of "poor" people or that it results in the absolute deprivation of education-the disadvantaged class is
not susceptible of identification in traditional terms ...

However described, it is clear that appellees' suit asks this Court to extend its most exacting scrutiny to review
a system that allegedly discriminates against a large, diverse, and amorphous class, unified only by the common
factor of residence in districts that happen to have less taxable wealth than other districts. The system of alleged
discrimination and the class it defines have none of the traditional indicia of suspectness: the class is not saddled
with such disabilities, or subjected to such a history of purposeful unequal treatment, or relegated to such a posi-
tion of political powerlessness as to command extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process.

We thus conclude that the Texas system does not operate to the peculiar disadvantage of any suspect class ...

But in recognition of the fact that this Court has never heretofore held that wealth discrimination alone provides
an adequate basis for invoking strict scrutiny, appellees have not relied solely on this contention. They also assert
that the State's system impermissibly interferes with the exercise of a "fundamental" right, and that, accord-
ingly, the prior decisions of this Court require the application of the strict standard of judicial review. Graham
v. Richardson (1971) [other citations omitted].

This theme, expressing an abiding respect for the vital role of education in a free society, may be found in numer-
ous opinions of Justices of this Court writing both before and after Brown was decided. Wisconsin v. Yoder
(BURGER), (WHITE), (1972) [other citations omitted].

Nothing this Court holds today in any way detracts from our historic dedication to public education. We are in
complete agreement with the conclusion of the three-judge panel below that "the grave significance of education
both to the individual and to our society" cannot be doubted." But the importance of a service performed by
the State does not determine whether it must be regarded as fundamental for purposes of examination under the
Equal Protection Clause. Mr. Justice Harlan, dissenting from the Court's application of strict scrutiny to a law
impinging upon the right of interstate travel, admonished that ... if the degree of judicial scrutiny of state legis-
lation fluctuated, depending on a majority's view of the importance of the interest affected, we would have gone
"far toward making this Court a super-legislature.'" We would, indeed, then be assuming a legislative role, and one
for which the Court lacks both authority and competence. But MR. JUSTICE STEWART s response in Shapiro to
Mr. Justice Harlan's concern correctly articulates the limits of the fundamental rights rationale employed in the
Court's equal protection decisions:

"The Court today does not `pick out particular human activities, characterize them as fundamental,' and give
them added protection. ... To the contrary, the Court simply recognizes, as it must, an established constitutional
right, and gives to that right no less protection than the Constitution itself demands." (Emphasis in original.)
838 | EQUAL PROTECTION BEYOND RACE AND GENDER

The lesson of these cases in addressing the question now before the Court is plain. It is not the province of this
Court to create substantive constitutional rights in the name of guaranteeing equal protection of the laws. Thus,
the key to discovering whether education is "fundamental" is not to be found in comparisons of the relative soci-
etal significance of education, as opposed to subsistence or housing. Nor is it to be found by weighing whether
education is as important as the right to travel. Rather, the answer lies in assessing whether there is a right to edu-
cation explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the Constitution ... Education, of course, is not among the rights
afforded explicit protection under our Federal Constitution. Nor do we find any basis for saying it is implicitly so
protected. As we have said, the undisputed importance of education will not, alone, cause this Court to depart
from the usual standard for reviewing a State's social and economic legislation ...

Even if it were conceded that some identifiable quantum of education is a constitutionally protected prerequisite
to the meaningful exercise of either right, we have no indication that the present levels of educational expendi-
tures in Texas provide an education that falls short ...

While it is no doubt true that reliance on local property taxation for school revenues provides less freedom of
choice with respect to expenditures for some districts than for others the existence of `some inequality' in the
manner in which the State's rationale is achieved is not alone a sufficient basis for striking down the entire sys-
tem. McGowan v. Maryland (1961).

Every step leading to the establishment of the system Texas utilizes today -- including the decisions permitting
localities to tax and expend locally, and creating and continuously expanding state aid -- was implemented in
an effort to extend public education and to improve its quality. Of course, every reform that benefits some more
than others may be criticized for what it fails to accomplish. But we think it plain that, in substance, the thrust
of the Texas system is affirmative and reformatory, and, therefore, should be scrutinized under judicial principles
sensitive to the nature of the State's efforts and to the rights reserved to the States under the Constitution ...

It should be clear, for the reasons stated above and in accord with the prior decisions of this Court, that this is
not a case in which the challenged state action must be subjected to the searching judicial scrutiny reserved for
laws that create suspect classifications or impinge upon constitutionally protected rights ...

In sum, to the extent that the Texas system of school financing results in unequal expenditures between children
who happen to reside in different districts, we cannot say that such disparities are the product of a system that is
so irrational as to be invidiously discriminatory ...

... The consideration and initiation of fundamental reforms with respect to state taxation and education are mat-
ters reserved for the legislative processes of the various States, and we do no violence to the values of federalism
and separation of powers by staying our hand. We hardly need add that this Court's action today is not to be
viewed as placing its judicial imprimatur on the status quo. The need is apparent for reform in. tax systems which
may well have relied too long and too heavily on the local property tax. And certainly innovative thinking as to
public education, its methods, and its funding is necessary to assure both a higher level of quality and greater
uniformity of opportunity.

These matters merit the continued attention of the scholars who already have contributed much their chal-
lenges. But the ultimate solutions must come from the lawmakers and from the democratic pressures of those
who elect them.

JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.

The question presented by these cases is whether, consistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment, Texas may deny to undocumented school-age children the free public education that it provides
to children who are citizens of the United States or legally admitted aliens ...

In May 1975, the Texas Legislature revised its education laws to withhold from local school districts any state
funds for the education of children who were not "legally admitted" into the United States. The 1975 revision
also authorized local school districts to deny enrollment in their public schools to children not "legally admit-
ted" to the country [§ 21.031] ...

This is a class action, filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas in September
1977, on behalf of certain school-age children of Mexican origin residing in Smith County, Tex., who could not
establish that they had been legally admitted into the United States. The action complained of the exclusion of
plaintiff children from the public schools of the Tyler Independent School District ... After certifying a class
consisting of all undocumented school-age children of Mexican origin residing within the School District, the
District Court preliminarily enjoined defendants from denying a free education to members of the plaintiff class
...
840 | EQUAL PROTECTION BEYOND RACE AND GENDER

Whatever his status under the immigration laws, an alien is surely a "person" in any ordinary sense of that term.
Aliens, even aliens whose presence in this country is unlawful, have long been recognized as "persons" guaran-
teed due process of law by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments ... Indeed, we have clearly held that the Fifth
Amendment protects aliens whose presence in this country is unlawful from invidious discrimination by the
Federal Government ...

A legislature must have substantial latitude to establish classifications that roughly approximate the nature of the
problem perceived, that accommodate competing concerns both public and private, and that account for limi-
tations on the practical ability of the State to remedy every ill. In applying the Equal Protection Clause to most
forms of state action, we thus seek only the assurance that the classification at issue bears some fair relationship
to a legitimate public purpose ...

But we would not be faithful to our obligations under the Fourteenth Amendment if we applied so deferential
a standard to every classification. The Equal Protection Clause was intended as a restriction on state legislative
action inconsistent with elemental constitutional premises. Thus we have treated as presumptively invidious
those classifications that disadvantage a "suspect class," or that impinge upon the exercise of a "fundamental
right." With respect to such classifications, it is appropriate to enforce the mandate of equal protection by
requiring the State to demonstrate that its classification has been precisely tailored to serve a compelling govern-
mental interest. In addition, we have recognized that certain forms of legislative classification, while not facially
invidious, nonetheless give rise to recurring constitutional difficulties; in these limited circumstances we have
sought the assurance that the classification reflects a reasoned judgment consistent with the ideal of equal pro-
tection by inquiring whether it may fairly be viewed as furthering a substantial interest of the State. We turn to
a consideration of the standard appropriate for the evaluation of § 21.031 ...

The children who are plaintiffs in these cases are special members of this underclass. Persuasive arguments sup-
port the view that a State may withhold its beneficence from those whose very presence within the United States
is the product of their own unlawful conduct. These arguments do not apply with the same force to classifica-
tions imposing disabilities on the minor children of such illegal entrants. At the least, those who elect to enter
our territory by stealth and in violation of our law should be prepared to bear the consequences, including, but
not limited to, deportation. But the children of those illegal entrants are not comparably situated. Their "parents
have the ability to conform their conduct to societal norms," and presumably the ability to remove themselves
from the State's jurisdiction; but the children who are plaintiffs in these cases "can affect neither their parents'
conduct nor their own status." ... Even if the State found it expedient to control the conduct of adults by acting
against their children, legislation directing the onus of a parent's misconduct against his children does not com-
port with fundamental conceptions of justice ...

In addition to the pivotal role of education in sustaining our political and cultural heritage, denial of education
to some isolated group of children poses an affront to one of the goals of the Equal Protection Clause: the
abolition of governmental barriers presenting unreasonable obstacles to advancement on the basis of individual
merit. Paradoxically, by depriving the children of any disfavored group of an education, we foreclose the means
by which that group might raise the level of esteem in which it is held by the majority. But more directly, "edu-
cation prepares individuals to be self-reliant and self-sufficient participants in society." Wisconsin v. Yoder. Illit-
                                                                           EQUAL PROTECTION BEYOND RACE AND GENDER | 841

eracy is an enduring disability. The inability to read and write will handicap the individual deprived of a basic
education each and every day of his life. The inestimable toll of that deprivation on the social, economic, intel-
lectual, and psychological well-being of the individual, and the obstacle it poses to individual achievement, make
it most difficult to reconcile the cost or the principle of a status-based denial of basic education with the frame-
work of equality embodied in the Equal Protection Clause ...

These well-settled principles allow us to determine the proper level of deference to be afforded § 21.031. Undoc-
umented aliens cannot be treated as a suspect class, because their presence in this country in violation of federal
law is not a "constitutional irrelevancy." Nor is education a fundamental right; a State need not justify by com-
pelling necessity every variation in the manner in which education is provided to its population. San Antonio
Independent School Dist. V. Rodriguez. But more is involved in these cases than the abstract question whether
§ 21.031 discriminates against a suspect class, or whether education is a fundamental right. More is involved in
these cases than the abstract question whether § 21.031 discriminates against a suspect class, or whether edu-
cation is a fundamental right. Section 21.031 imposes a lifetime hardship on a discrete class of children not
accountable for their disabling status. The stigma of illiteracy will mark them for the rest of their lives. By deny-
ing these children a basic education, we deny them the ability to live within the structure of our civic institu-
tions, and foreclose any realistic possibility that they will contribute in even the smallest way to the progress of
our Nation. In determining the rationality of § 21.031, we may appropriately take into account its costs to the
Nation and to the innocent children who are its victims. In light of these countervailing costs, the discrimina-
tion contained in § 21.031 can hardly be considered rational unless it furthers some substantial goal of the State
...

If the State is to deny a discrete group of innocent children the free public education that it offers to other chil-
dren residing within its borders, that denial must be justified by a showing that it furthers some substantial state
interest. No such showing was made here. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals in each of these
cases is

Affirmed.

486 U.S. 456 (1988)

    Vote: 9-0
    Decision: Reversed
    Majority: O'Connor, joined by Rehnquist, White, Marshall, Blackmun, Stevens, Scalia and Kennedy

JUSTICE O'CONNOR delivered the opinion of the Court.

Under Pennsylvania law, an illegitimate child must prove paternity before seeking support from his or her father,
and a suit to establish paternity ordinarily must be brought within six years of an illegitimate child's birth. By
contrast, a legitimate child may seek support from his or her parents at any time. We granted certiorari to con-
sider the constitutionality of this legislative scheme ...

On September 22, 1983, petitioner Cherlyn Clark filed a support complaint in the Allegheny County Court of
Common Pleas on behalf of her minor daughter, Tiffany, who was born out of wedlock on June 11, 1973. Clark
named respondent Gene Jeter as Tiffany's father. The court ordered blood tests, which showed a 99.3% proba-
bility that Jeter is Tiffany's father.

Jeter moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that it was barred by the 6-year statute of limitations for
paternity actions. In her response, Clark contended that this statute is unconstitutional under the Equal Protec-
tion and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. In the alternative, she argued that the statute was
tolled by fraudulent and misleading actions of the welfare department, or by threats and assaults by Jeter.

The trial court upheld the statute of limitations ... Therefore, the trial court entered judgment for Jeter ... Clark
appealed to the Superior Court of Pennsylvania, again raising her constitutional challenges to the 6-year statute
of limitations ... Before the court decided her case, the Pennsylvania Legislature enacted an 18-year statute of
limitations for actions to establish paternity ... The Superior Court concluded, however, that Pennsylvania's new
18-year statute of limitations did not apply retroactively, and that it would not revive Clark's cause of action in
any event ... The Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied her petition for allowance of appeal. We granted Clark's
petition for certiorari.

...

In considering whether state legislation violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,
U.S.Const., Amdt. 14, § 1, we apply different levels of scrutiny to different types of classifications. At a min-
imum, a statutory classification must be rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose. San Antonio
Independent School Dist. V. Rodriguez (1973) [other citations omitted]. Classifications based on race or national
origin, Loving v. Virginia (1967), and classifications affecting fundamental rights, Harper v. Virginia Bd. Of
                                                                           EQUAL PROTECTION BEYOND RACE AND GENDER | 843

Elections (1966), are given the most exacting scrutiny. Between these extremes of rational basis review and strict
scrutiny lies a level of intermediate scrutiny, which generally has been applied to discriminatory classifications
based on sex or illegitimacy. Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan (1982) [other citations omitted].

To withstand intermediate scrutiny, a statutory classification must be substantially related to an important gov-
ernmental objective. Consequently we have invalidated classifications that burden illegitimate children for the
sake of punishing the illicit relations of their parents, because "visiting this condemnation on the head of an
infant is illogical and unjust." Weber v. Aetna Casualty and Surety Co., (1972). Yet, in the seminal case concern-
ing the child's right to support, this Court acknowledged that it might be appropriate to treat illegitimate chil-
dren differently in the support context because of "lurking problems with respect to proof of paternity." Gomez
v. Perez (1973). This Court has developed a particular framework for evaluating equal protection challenges to
statutes of limitations that apply to suits to establish paternity, and thereby limit the ability of illegitimate chil-
dren to obtain support.

"First, the period for obtaining support ... must be sufficiently long in duration to present a reasonable oppor-
tunity for those with an interest in such children to assert claims on their behalf. Second, any time limitation
placed on that opportunity must be substantially related to the State's interest in avoiding the litigation of stale
or fraudulent claims." Mills v. Habluetzel.

In Mills, we held that Texas' 1-year statute of limitations failed both steps of the analysis. We explained that
paternity suits typically will be brought by the child's mother, who might not act swiftly amidst the emotional
and financial complications of the child's first year ... the Court unanimously struck down Tennessee's 2-year
statute of limitations for paternity and child support actions brought on behalf of certain illegitimate children
... the Court first considered whether two years afforded a reasonable opportunity to bring such suits. The Ten-
nessee statute was relatively more generous than the Texas statute ... because it did not limit actions against a
father who had acknowledged his paternity in writing or by furnishing support; nor did it apply if the child was
likely to become a public charge. Nevertheless, the Court concluded that the 2-year period was too short in light
of the persisting financial and emotional problems that are likely to afflict the child's mother. Proceeding to the
second step of the analysis, the Court decided that the 2-year statute of limitations was not substantially related
to Tennessee's asserted interest in preventing stale and fraudulent claims ... this incremental difference would
not create substantially greater proof and fraud problems ...

In light of this authority, we conclude that Pennsylvania's 6-year statute of limitations violates the Equal Protec-
tion Clause. Even six years does not necessarily provide a reasonable opportunity to assert a claim on behalf of
an illegitimate child. "The unwillingness of the `mother to file a paternity action on behalf of her child, which
could stem from her relationship with the natural father or ... from the emotional strain of having an illegitimate
child, or even from the desire to avoid community and family disapproval, may continue years after the child is
born. The problem may be exacerbated if, as often happens, the mother herself is a minor." Mills v. Habluetzel
(O'CONNOR concurring). Not all of these difficulties are likely to abate in six years. A mother might realize
only belatedly "a loss of income attributable to the need to care for the child," ... Furthermore, financial difficul-
§844 | EQUAL PROTECTION BEYOND RACE AND GENDER

ties are likely to increase as the child matures and incurs expenses for clothing, school, and medical care. Moore
v. McNamara (1984). Thus it is questionable whether a State acts reasonably when it requires most paternity
and support actions to be brought within six years of an illegitimate child's birth.

We do not rest our decision on this ground, however, for it is not entirely evident that six years would necessarily
be an unreasonable limitations period for child support actions involving illegitimate children. We are, however,
confident that the 6-year statute of limitations is not substantially related to Pennsylvania's interest in avoiding
the litigation of stale or fraudulent claims. Mills v. Habluetzel [other citations omitted].

The legislative history of the federal Child Support Enforcement Amendments explains why Congress thought
such statutes of limitations are reasonable. Congress adverted to the problem of stale and fraudulent claims,
but recognized that increasingly sophisticated tests for genetic markers permit the exclusion of over 99% of
those who might be accused of paternity, regardless of the age of the child ... This scientific evidence is available
throughout the child's minority, and it is an additional reason to doubt that Pennsylvania had a substantial rea-
son for limiting the time within which paternity and support actions could be brought.

We conclude that the Pennsylvania statute does not withstand heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection
Clause. We therefore find it unnecessary to reach Clark's due process claim. The judgment of the Superior Court
is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Massachusetts Board of Retirement v. Murgia

PER CURIAM.

This case presents the question whether the provision of Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. c. 32, § 26 (3) (a) (1966), that a
uniformed state police officer "shall be retired ... upon his attaining age fifty," denies appellee police officer equal
protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment ...
                                                                          EQUAL PROTECTION BEYOND RACE AND GENDER | 845

Appellee Robert Murgia was an officer in the Uniformed Branch of the Massachusetts State Police. The Mass-
achusetts Board of Retirement retired him upon his 50th birthday. Appellee brought this civil action in the
United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that the operation of § 26 (3) (a) denied
him equal protection of the ... The District Judge dismissed appellee's complaint on the ground that the com-
plaint did not allege a substantial constitutional question ... On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for
the First Circuit, in an unreported memorandum, set aside the District Court judgment and remanded the case
with direction to convene a three-judge court. Upon a record consisting of depositions, affidavits, and other
documentary material submitted by the parties, the three-judge court filed an opinion that declared § 26 (3) (a)
unconstitutional on the ground that "a classification based on age 50 alone lacks a rational basis in furthering
any substantial state interest," and enjoined enforcement of the statute ...

We need state only briefly our reasons for agreeing that strict scrutiny is not the proper test for determining
whether the mandatory retirement provision denies appellee equal protection. San Antonio School District v.
Rodriguez (1973) reaffirmed that equal protection analysis requires strict scrutiny of a legislative classification
only when the classification impermissibly interferes with the exercise of a fundamental right' or operates to
the peculiar disadvantage of a suspect class.' Mandatory retirement at age 50 under the Massachusetts statute
involves neither situation ...

This Court's decisions give no support to the proposition that a right of governmental employment per se is
fundamental ... Accordingly, we have expressly stated that a standard less than strict scrutiny "has consistently
been applied to state legislation restricting the availability of employment opportunities."

Nor does the class of uniformed state police officers over 50 constitute a suspect class for purposes of equal pro-
tection analysis ... While the treatment of the aged in this Nation has not been wholly free of discrimination,
such persons, unlike, say, those who have been discriminated against on the basis of race or national origin, have
not experienced a "history of purposeful unequal treatment" or been subjected to unique disabilities on the basis
of stereotyped characteristics not truly indicative of their abilities. The class subject to the compulsory retire-
ment feature of the Massachusetts statute consists of uniformed state police officers over the age of 50. It cannot
be said to discriminate only against the elderly. Rather, it draws the line at a certain age in middle life. But even
old age does not define a "discrete and insular" group, United States v. Carolene Products Co., (1938), in need of
"extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process." ...

We turn then to examine this state classification under the rational-basis standard. This inquiry employs a rel-
atively relaxed standard reflecting the Court's awareness that the drawing of lines that create distinctions is
peculiarly a legislative task and an unavoidable one. Perfection in making the necessary classifications is neither
possible nor necessary.

In this case, the Massachusetts statute clearly meets the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause, for the
State's classification rationally furthers the purpose identified by the State: Through mandatory retirement at
age 50, the legislature seeks to protect the public by assuring physical preparedness of its uniformed police. Since
physical ability generally declines with age, mandatory retirement at 50 serves to remove from police service those
§846 | EQUAL PROTECTION BEYOND RACE AND GENDER

whose fitness for uniformed work presumptively has diminished with age. This clearly is rationally related to the
State's objective that § 26 (3) (a) has the effect of excluding from service so few officers who are in fact unquali-
fied as to render age 50 a criterion wholly unrelated to the objective of the statute ...

We do not make light of the substantial economic and psychological effects premature and compulsory retire-
ment can have on an individual; nor do we denigrate the ability of elderly citizens to continue to contribute to
society. The problems of retirement have been well documented and are beyond serious dispute. But "[w]e do
not decide today that the [Massachusetts statute] is wise, that it best fulfills the relevant social and economic
objectives that [Massachusetts] might ideally espouse, or that a more just and humane system could not be
devised." ... We decide only that the system enacted by the Massachusetts Legislature does not deny appellee
equal protection of the laws.

The judgment is reversed.

City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center

473 U.S. 432 (1985)

JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.

A Texas city denied a special use permit for the operation of a group home for the mentally retarded, acting pur-
suant to a municipal zoning ordinance requiring permits for such homes. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit held that mental retardation is a "quasi-suspect" classification, and that the ordinance violated the Equal
Protection Clause because it did not substantially further an important governmental purpose. We hold that
a lesser standard of scrutiny is appropriate, but conclude that, under that standard, the ordinance is invalid as
applied in this case.

In July 1980, respondent Jan Hannah purchased a building at 201 Featherston Street in the city of Cleburne,
Texas, with the intention of leasing it to Cleburne Living Center, Inc. (CLC), for the operation of a group home
for the mentally retarded. It was anticipated that the home would house 13 retarded men and women, who
would be under the constant supervision of CLC staff members. The house had four bedrooms and two baths,
with a half bath to be added. CLC planned to comply with all applicable state and federal regulations.
                                                                           EQUAL PROTECTION BEYOND RACE AND GENDER | 847

The city informed CLC that a special use permit would be required for the operation of a group home at the site,
and CLC accordingly submitted a permit application. In response to a subsequent inquiry from CLC, the city
explained that under the zoning regulations applicable to the site, a special use permit, renewable annually, was
required for the construction of "[h]ospitals for the insane or feeble-minded, or alcoholic [sic] or drug addicts,
or penal or correctional institutions." The city determined that the proposed group home should be classified as
a "hospital for the feebleminded." After holding a public hearing on CLC's application, the City Council voted
3 to 1 to deny a special use permit.

CLC then filed suit in Federal District Court against the city and a number of its officials, alleging, inter alia,
that the zoning ordinance was invalid on its face and as applied because it discriminated against the mentally
retarded in violation of the equal protection rights of CLC and its potential residents. The District Court found
that "[i]f the potential residents of the Featherston Street home were not mentally retarded, but the home was
the same in all other respects, its use would be permitted under the city's zoning ordinance," and that the City
Council's decision "was motivated primarily by the fact that the residents of the home would be persons who
are mentally retarded." ...

The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment commands that no State shall "deny to any person
within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws," which is essentially a direction that all persons simi-
larly situated should be treated alike. Plyler v. Doe (1982). Section 5 of the Amendment empowers Congress to
enforce this mandate, but absent controlling congressional direction, the courts have themselves devised stan-
dards for determining the validity of state legislation or other official action that is challenged as denying equal
protection. The general rule is that legislation is presumed to be valid and will be sustained if the classification
drawn by the statute is rationally related to a legitimate state interest. Schweiker v. Wilson (1981) [other citations
omitted].

The general rule gives way, however, when a statute classifies by race, alienage, or national origin. These factors
are so seldom relevant to the achievement of any legitimate state interest that laws grounded in such considera-
tions are deemed to reflect prejudice and antipathy-a view that those in the burdened class are not as worthy or
deserving as others. For these reasons and because such discrimination is unlikely to be soon rectified by legisla-
tive means, these laws are subjected to strict scrutiny and will be sustained only if they are suitably tailored to
serve a compelling state interest. McLaughlin v. Florida (1964) [other citations omitted].

Against this background, we conclude for several reasons that the Court of Appeals erred in holding mental
retardation a quasi-suspect classification calling for a more exacting standard of judicial review than is normally
accorded economic and social legislation. First, it is undeniable, and it is not argued otherwise here, that those
who are mentally retarded have a reduced ability to cope with and function in the everyday world. Nor are they
all cut from the same pattern: as the testimony in this record indicates, they range from those whose disability
is not immediately evident to those who must be constantly cared for. They are thus different, immutably so, in
relevant respects, and the States' interest in dealing with and providing for them is plainly a legitimate one. How
this large and diversified group is to be treated under the law is a difficult and often a technical matter, very much
848 | EQUAL PROTECTION BEYOND RACE AND GENDER

a task for legislators guided by qualified professionals, and not by the perhaps ill-informed opinions of the judi-
ciary. Heightened scrutiny inevitably involves substantive judgments about legislative decisions, and we doubt
that the predicate for such judicial oversight is present where the classification deals with mental retardation.

Second, the distinctive legislative response, both national and state, to the plight of those who are mentally
retarded demonstrates not only that they have unique problems, but also that the lawmakers have been address-
ing their difficulties in a manner that belies a continuing antipathy or prejudice and a corresponding need for
more intrusive oversight by the judiciary ...

Such legislation thus singling out the retarded for special treatment reflects the real and undeniable differences
between the retarded and others ... The relevant inquiry, however, is whether heightened scrutiny is constitution-
ally mandated in the first instance. Even assuming that many of these laws could be shown to be substantially
related to an important governmental purpose, merely requiring the legislature to justify its efforts in these terms
may lead it to refrain from acting at all. Much recent legislation intended to benefit the retarded also assumes the
need for measures that might be perceived to disadvantage them ...

Third, the legislative response, which could hardly have occurred and survived without public support, negates
any claim that the mentally retarded are politically powerless in the sense that they have no ability to attract the
attention of the lawmakers. Any minority can be said to be powerless to assert direct control over the legislature,
but if that were a criterion for higher level scrutiny by the courts, much economic and social legislation would
now be suspect.

Fourth, if the large and amorphous class of the mentally retarded were deemed quasi-suspect for the reasons
given by the Court of Appeals, it would be difficult to find a principled way to distinguish a variety of other
groups who have perhaps immutable disabilities setting them off from others, who cannot themselves mandate
the desired legislative responses, and who can claim some degree of prejudice from at least part of the public at
large ... We are reluctant to set out on that course, and we decline to do so ...

Our refusal to recognize the retarded as a quasi-suspect class does not leave them entirely unprotected from
invidious discrimination. To withstand equal protection review, legislation that distinguishes between the men-
tally retarded and others must be rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose. This standard, we
believe, affords government the latitude necessary both to pursue policies designed to assist the retarded in realiz-
ing their full potential, and to freely and efficiently engage in activities that burden the retarded in what is essen-
tially an incidental manner. The State may not rely on a classification whose relationship to an asserted goal is
so attenuated as to render the distinction arbitrary or irrational. Zobel v. Williams (1982) [other citations omit-
ted].

In the courts below the city also urged that the ordinance is aimed at avoiding concentration of population and
at lessening congestion of the streets. These concerns obviously fail to explain why apartment houses, fraternity
and sorority houses, hospitals and the like, may freely locate in the area without a permit. So, too, the expressed
worry about fire hazards, the serenity of the neighborhood, and the avoidance of danger to other residents fail
rationally to justify singling out a home such as 201 Featherston for the special use permit, yet imposing no such
restrictions on the many other uses freely permitted in the neighborhood ...
§                                                                         EQUAL PROTECTION BEYOND RACE AND GENDER | 849

The short of it is that requiring the permit in this case appears to us to rest on an irrational prejudice against
the mentally retarded, including those who would occupy the Featherston facility and who would live under the
closely supervised and highly regulated conditions expressly provided for by state and federal law.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed insofar as it invalidates the zoning ordinance as applied to the
Featherston home. The judgment is otherwise vacated, and the case is remanded.

It is so ordered.

    Vote: 6-3
    Decision: Affirmed
    Majority: Kennedy, joined by Stevens, O'Connor, Souter, Ginsburg, Breyer
    Dissent: Scalia, joined by Rehnquist, Thomas

JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.

One century ago, the first Justice Harlan admonished this Court that the Constitution "neither knows nor tol-
erates classes among citizens." Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) (dissenting opinion). Unheeded then, those words now
are understood to state a commitment to the law's neutrality where the rights of persons are at stake. The Equal
Protection Clause enforces this principle and today requires us to hold invalid a provision of Colorado's Consti-
tution.

The enactment challenged in this case is an amendment to the Constitution of the State of Colorado, adopted
in a 1992 statewide referendum. The parties and the state courts refer to it as "Amendment 2," its designation
when submitted to the voters. The impetus for the amendment and the contentious campaign that preceded
its adoption came in large part from ordinances that had been passed in various Colorado municipalities. For
example, the cities of Aspen and Boulder and the city and County of Denver each had enacted ordinances which
banned discrimination in many transactions and activities, including housing, employment, education, public
accommodations, and health and welfare services ... What gave rise to the statewide controversy was the protec-
tion the ordinances afforded to persons discriminated against by reason of their sexual orientation ... Amend-
ment 2 repeals these ordinances to the extent they prohibit discrimination on the basis of "homosexual, lesbian
or bisexual orientation, conduct, practices or relationships." Colo. Const., Art. II, § 30b.
850 | EQUAL PROTECTION BEYOND RACE AND GENDER

Yet Amendment 2, in explicit terms, does more than repeal or rescind these provisions. It prohibits all legislative,
executive or judicial action at any level of state or local government designed to protect the named class, a class
we shall refer to as homosexual persons or gays and lesbians. The amendment reads:

"No Protected Status Based on Homosexual, Lesbian or Bisexual Orientation. Neither the State of Colorado,
through any of its branches or departments, nor any of its agencies, political subdivisions, municipalities or
school districts, shall enact, adopt or enforce any statute, regulation, ordinance or policy whereby homosexual,
lesbian or bisexual orientation, conduct, practices or relationships shall constitute or otherwise be the basis of or
entitle any person or class of persons to have or claim any minority status, quota preferences, protected status or
claim of discrimination. This Section of the Constitution shall be in all respects self-executing." Ibid.

Soon after Amendment 2 was adopted, this litigation to declare its invalidity and enjoin its enforcement was
commenced in the District Court for the City and County of Denver. Among the plaintiffs (respondents here)
were homosexual persons, some of them government employees. They alleged that enforcement of Amendment
2 would subject them to immediate and substantial risk of discrimination on the basis of their sexual orienta-
tion. Other plaintiffs (also respondents here) included the three municipalities whose ordinances we have cited
and certain other governmental entities which had acted earlier to protect homosexuals from discrimination but
would be prevented by Amendment 2 from continuing to do so ...

Amendment 2 bars homosexuals from securing protection against the injuries that these public-accommoda-
tions laws address. That in itself is a severe consequence, but there is more. Amendment 2, in addition, nullifies
specific legal protections for this targeted class in all transactions in housing, sale of real estate, insurance, health
and welfare services, private education, and employment ...

If this consequence follows from Amendment 2, as its broad language suggests, it would compound the consti-
tutional difficulties the law creates. The state court did not decide whether the amendment has this effect, how-
ever, and neither need we. In the course of rejecting the argument that Amendment 2 is intended to conserve
resources to fight discrimination against suspect classes, the Colorado Supreme Court made the limited observa-
tion that the amendment is not intended to affect many antidiscrimination laws protecting non suspect classes
... In our view that does not resolve the issue. In any event, even if, as we doubt, homosexuals could find some
safe harbor in laws of general application, we cannot accept the view that Amendment 2's prohibition on spe-
cific legal protections does no more than deprive homosexuals of special rights. To the contrary, the amendment
imposes a special disability upon those persons alone. Homosexuals are forbidden the safeguards that others
enjoy or may seek without constraint. They can obtain specific protection against discrimination only by enlist-
ing the citizenry of Colorado to amend the State Constitution or perhaps, on the State's view, by trying to pass
helpful laws of general applicability. This is so no matter how local or discrete the harm, no matter how pub-
lic and widespread the injury. We find nothing special in the protections Amendment 2 withholds. These are
protections taken for granted by most people either because they already have them or do not need them; these
are protections against exclusion from an almost limitless number of transactions and endeavors that constitute
ordinary civic life in a free society ...
                                                                           EQUAL PROTECTION BEYOND RACE AND GENDER | 851

Amendment 2 fails, indeed defies, even this conventional inquiry. First, the amendment has the peculiar prop-
erty of imposing a broad and undifferentiated disability on a single named group, an exceptional and, as we shall
explain, invalid form of legislation. Second, its sheer breadth is so discontinuous with the reasons offered for it
that the amendment seems inexplicable by anything but animus toward the class it affects; it lacks a rational rela-
tionship to legitimate state interests ...

It is not within our constitutional tradition to enact laws of this sort. Central both to the idea of the rule of
law and to our own Constitution's guarantee of equal protection is the principle that government and each
of its parts remain open on impartial terms to all who seek its assistance. "`Equal protection of the laws is not
achieved through indiscriminate imposition of inequalities." Sweatt v. Painter (1950), (quoting Shelley v. Krae­
mer (1948)).

We must conclude that Amendment 2 classifies homosexuals not to further a proper legislative end but to make
them unequal to everyone else. This Colorado cannot do. A State cannot so deem a class of persons a stranger to
its laws. Amendment 2 violates the Equal Protection Clause, and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Col-
orado is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

    Decision: Affirmed
    Majority: Waite, joined by Clifford, Swayne, Miller, Davis, Field, Strong, Bradley, and Hunt

ERROR to the Supreme Court of Missouri; the case being thus:

The fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States, in its first section, thus ordains:

`All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the
United States, and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law, which shall abridge
the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States. Nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty,
or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction, the equal protection of
the laws.'

And the constitution of the State of Missouri thus ordains:

`Every male citizen of the United States shall be entitled to vote.'

Under a statute of the State all persons wishing to vote at any election, must previously have been registered in
the manner pointed out by the statute, this being a condition precedent to the exercise of the elective franchise.

In this state of things, on the 15th of October, 1872 (one of the days fixed by law for the registration of voters),
Mrs. Virginia Minor, a native born, free, white citizen of the United States, and of the State of Missouri, over the
age of twenty-one years, wishing to vote for electors for President and Vice-President of the United States, and
for a representative in Congress, and for other officers, at the general election held in November, 1872, applied
to one Happersett, the registrar of voters, to register her as a lawful voter, which he refused to do, assigning for
cause that she was not a `male citizen of the United States,' but a woman. She thereupon sued him in one of the
inferior State courts of Missouri, for willfully refusing to place her name upon the list of registered voters, by
which refusal she was deprived of her right to vote.

The registrar demurred, and the court in which the suit was brought sustained the demurrer, and gave judgment
in his favor; a judgment which the Supreme Court affirmed. Mrs. Minor now brought the case here on error.
                                                                                                               ACCESS TO THE BALLOT | 855

Mr. Francis Minor (with whom were Messrs. J. M. Krum and J. B. Henderson), for the plaintiff in error, went
into an elaborate argument, partially based on what he deemed true political views, and partially resting on legal
and constitutional grounds. These last seemed to be thus resolvable:

1st. As a citizen of the United States, the plaintiff was entitled to any and all the `privileges and immunities' that
belong to such position however defined; and as are held, exercised, and enjoyed by other citizens of the United
States.

2d. The elective franchise is a `privilege' of citizenship, in the highest sense of the word. It is the privilege preser-
vative of all rights and privileges; and especially of the right of the citizen to participate in his or her government.

3d. The denial or abridgment of this privilege, if it exist at all, must be sought only in the fundamental charter of
government,--the Constitution of the United States. If not found there, no inferior power or jurisdiction can
legally claim the right to exercise it.

4th. But the Constitution of the United States, so far from recognizing or permitting any denial or abridgment
of the privileges of its citizens, expressly declares that `no State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge
the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.'

5th. If follows that the provisions of the Missouri constitution and registry law before recited, are in conflict
with and must yield to the paramount authority of the Constitution of the United States.

No opposing counsel.

The CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the court.

The question is presented in this case, whether, since the adoption of the fourteenth amendment, a woman,
who is a citizen of the United States and of the State of Missouri, is a voter in that State, notwithstanding the
provision of the constitution and laws of the State, which confine the right of suffrage to men alone. ...

It is contended that the provisions of the constitution and laws of the State of Missouri which confine the right
of suffrage and registration therefor to men, are in violation of the Constitution of the United States, and there-
fore void. The argument is, that as a woman, born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdic-
tion thereof, is a citizen of the United States and of the State in which she resides, she has the right of suffrage
as one of the privileges and immunities of her citizenship, which the State cannot by its laws or constitution
abridge.

There is no doubt that women may be citizens. They are persons, and by the fourteenth amendment "all persons
born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof" are expressly declared to be "cit-
izens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside." ...

If the right of suffrage is one of the necessary privileges of a citizen of the United States, then the constitution
and laws of Missouri confining it to men are in violation of the Constitution of the United States, as amended,
and consequently void. The direct question is, therefore, presented whether all citizens are necessarily voters.
856 | ACCESS TO THE BALLOT

The Constitution does not define the privileges and immunities of citizens. For that definition we must look
elsewhere. In this case we need not determine what they are, but only whether suffrage is necessarily one of them.

It certainly is nowhere made so in express terms. The United States has no voters in the States of its own creation.
The elective officers of the United States are all elected directly or indirectly by State voters. The members of
the House of Representatives are to be chosen by the people of the States, and the electors in each State must
have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislature. Senators are
to be chosen by the legislatures of the States, and necessarily the members of the legislature required to make the
choice are elected by the voters of the State. ...

The amendment did not add to the privileges and immunities of a citizen. It simply furnished an additional
guaranty for the protection of such as he already had. No new voters were necessarily made by it. Indirectly it
may have had that effect, because it may have increased the number of citizens entitled to suffrage under the con-
stitution and laws of the States, but it operates for this purpose, if at all, through the States and the State laws,
and not directly upon the citizen.

It is clear, therefore, we think, that the Constitution has not added the right of suffrage to the privileges and
immunities of citizenship as they existed at the time it was adopted. This makes it proper to inquire whether
suffrage was coextensive with the citizenship of the States at the time of its adoption. If it was, then it may with
force be argued that suffrage was one of the rights which belonged to citizenship, and in the enjoyment of which
every citizen must be protected. But if it was not, the contrary may with propriety be assumed.

When the Federal Constitution was adopted, all the States, with the exception of Rhode Island and Connecti-
cut, had constitutions of their own. These two continued to act under their charters from the Crown. Upon an
examination of those constitutions we find that in no State were all citizens permitted to vote. ...

In this condition of the law in respect to suffrage in the several States it cannot for a moment be doubted that if
it had been intended to make all citizens of the United States voters, the framers of the Constitution would not
have left it to implication. So important a change in the condition of citizenship as it actually existed, if intended,
would have been expressly declared.

...

And still again, after the adoption of the fourteenth amendment, it was deemed necessary to adopt a fifteenth, as
follows: "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States,
or by any State, on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude." The fourteenth amendment had
already provided that no State should make or enforce any law which should abridge the privileges or immuni-
ties of citizens of the United States. If suffrage was one of these privileges or immunities, why amend the Consti-
tution to prevent its being denied on account of race, &c.? Nothing is more evident than that the greater must
include the less, and if all were already protected why go through with the form of amending the Constitution
to protect a part?
                                                                                                               ACCESS TO THE BALLOT | 857

But we have already sufficiently considered the proof found upon the inside of the Constitution. That upon the
outside is equally effective.

The Constitution was submitted to the States for adoption in 1787, and was ratified by nine States in 1788, and
finally by the thirteen original States in 1790. Vermont was the first new State admitted to the Union, and it
came in under a constitution which conferred the right of suffrage only upon men of the full age of twenty-one
years ... The next year, 1792, Kentucky followed with a constitution confining the right of suffrage to free male
citizens of the age of twenty-one years ... Then followed Tennessee, in 1796, with voters of freemen of the age
of twenty-one years and upwards ... But we need not particularize further. No new State has ever been admitted
to the Union which has conferred the right of suffrage upon women, and this has never been considered a valid
objection to her admission. On the contrary, as is claimed in the argument, the right of suffrage was withdrawn
from women as early as 1807 in the State of New Jersey, without any attempt to obtain the interference of the
United States to prevent it. Since then the governments of the insurgent States have been reorganized under a
requirement that before their representatives could be admitted to seats in Congress they must have adopted
new constitutions, republican in form. In no one of these constitutions was suffrage conferred upon women,
and yet the States have all been restored to their original position as States in the Union.

Certainly, if the courts can consider any question settled, this is one. For nearly ninety years the people have
acted upon the idea that the Constitution, when it conferred citizenship, did not necessarily confer the right of
suffrage. If uniform practice long continued can settle the construction of so important an instrument as the
Constitution of the United States confessedly is, most certainly it has been done here. ...

Being unanimously of the opinion that the Constitution of the United States does not confer the right of suf-
frage upon any one, and that the constitutions and laws of the several States which commit that important trust
to men alone are not necessarily void, we

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the court.

...

Suffrage in Oklahoma was regulated by § 1, Article III of the Constitution under which the State was admitted
into the Union. Shortly after the admission there was submitted an amendment to the Constitution making
a radical change in that article which was adopted prior to November 8, 1910. At an election for members of
Congress which followed the adoption of this Amendment certain election officers in enforcing its provisions
refused to allow certain negro citizens to vote who were clearly entitled to vote under the provision of the Con-
stitution under which the State was admitted, that is, before the amendment, and who, it is equally clear, were
not entitled to vote under the provision of the suffrage amendment if that amendment governed. The persons
so excluded based their claim of right to vote upon the original Constitution and upon the assertion that the suf-
frage amendment was void because in conflict with the prohibitions of the Fifteenth Amendment and therefore
afforded no basis for denying them the right guaranteed and protected by that Amendment. ...

... The original clause so far as material was this:

"The qualified electors of the State shall be male citizens of the United States, male citizens of the State, and
male persons of Indian descent native of the United States, who are over the age of twenty-one years, who have
resided in the State one year, in the county six months, and in the election precinct thirty days, next preceding
the election at which any such elector offers to vote."

And this is the amendment:

"No person shall be registered as an elector of this State or be allowed to vote in any election herein, unless he
be able to read and write any section of the constitution of the State of Oklahoma; but no person who was, on
January 1, 1866, or at any time prior thereto, entitled to vote under any form of government, or who at that time
resided in some foreign nation, and no lineal descendant of such person, shall be denied the right to register and
vote because of his inability to so read and write sections of such constitution. ..."

... No question is raised by the Government concerning the validity of the literacy test provided for in the amend-
ment under consideration as an independent standard ... The real question involved, so the argument of the
Government insists, is the repugnancy of the standard which the amendment makes, based upon the conditions
                                                                                                               ACCESS TO THE BALLOT | 859

existing on January 1, 1866, because on its face and inherently considering the substance of things, that standard
is a mere denial of the restrictions imposed by the prohibitions of the Fifteenth Amendment and by necessary
result re-creates and perpetuates the very conditions which the Amendment was intended to destroy. ...

The questions then are: (1) ... [A]ssuming that the suffrage provision has the significance which the Government
assumes it to have, is that provision as a matter of law repugnant to the Fifteenth Amendment? which leads us of
course to consider the operation and effect of the Fifteenth Amendment. (2) If yes, has the assailed amendment
in so far as it fixes a standard for voting as of January 1, 1866, the meaning which the Government attributes
to it? which leads us to analyze and interpret that provision of the amendment. (3) If the investigation as to the
two prior subjects establishes that the standard fixed as of January 1, 1866, is void, what if any effect does that
conclusion have upon the literacy standard otherwise established by the amendment? ... Let us consider these
subjects under separate headings.

1. The operation and effect of the Fifteenth Amendment. This is its text:

"Section 1. The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States
or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.

"Section 2. The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."

(a) Beyond doubt the Amendment does not take away from the state governments in a general sense the power
over suffrage which has belonged to those governments from the beginning ... In fact, the very command of the
Amendment recognizes the possession of the general power by the State, since the Amendment seeks to regulate
its exercise as to the particular subject with which it deals.

(b) But it is equally beyond the possibility of question that the Amendment in express terms restricts the power
of the United States or the States to abridge or deny the right of a citizen of the United States to vote on account
of race, color or previous condition of servitude. The restriction is coincident with the power and prevents its
exertion in disregard of the command of the Amendment. But while this is true, it is true also that the Amend-
ment does not change, modify or deprive the States of their full power as to suffrage except of course as to the
subject with which the Amendment deals and to the extent that obedience to its command is necessary. ...

(c) While in the true sense, therefore, the Amendment gives no right of suffrage, it was long ago recognized that
in operation its prohibition might measurably have that effect; that is to say that as the command of the Amend-
ment was self-executing and reached without legislative action the conditions of discrimination against which
it was aimed the result might arise that as a consequence of the striking down of a discriminating clause a right
of suffrage would be enjoyed by reason of the generic character of the provision which would remain after the
discrimination was stricken out Ex parte Yarbrough (1884); Neal v. Delaware (1880). ...

With these principles before us how can there be room for any serious dispute concerning the repugnancy of the
standard based upon January 1, 1866 (a date which preceded the adoption of the Fifteenth Amendment), if the
suffrage provision fixing that standard is susceptible of the significance which the Government attributes to it?
Indeed, there seems no escape from the conclusion that to hold that there was even possibility for dispute on
860 | ACCESS TO THE BALLOT

the subject would be but to declare that the Fifteenth Amendment not only had not the self-executing power
which it has been recognized to have from the beginning, but that its provisions were wholly inoperative because
susceptible of being rendered inapplicable by mere forms of expression embodying no exercise of judgment and
resting upon no discernible reason other than the purpose to disregard the prohibitions of the Amendment by
creating a standard of voting which on its face was in substance but a revitalization of conditions which when
they prevailed in the past had been destroyed by the self-operative force of the Amendment.

2. The standard of January 1, 1866, fixed in the suffrage amendment and its significance.

The inquiry of course here is, Does the amendment as to the particular standard which this heading embraces
involve the mere refusal to comply with the commands of the Fifteenth Amendment as previously stated? This
leads us for the purpose of the analysis to recur to the text of the suffrage amendment. Its opening sentence fixes
the literacy standard which is all-inclusive since it is general in its expression and contains no word of discrimi-
nation on account of race or color or any other reason. This however is immediately followed by the provisions
creating the standard based upon the condition existing on January 1, 1866, and carving out those coming under
that standard from the inclusion in the literacy test which would have controlled them but for the exclusion thus
expressly provided for. The provision is this:

"But no person who was, on January 1, 1866, or at any time prior thereto, entitled to vote under any form of
government, or who at that time resided in some foreign nation, and no lineal descendant of such person, shall
be denied the right to register and vote because of his inability to so read and write sections of such constitu-
tion."

We have difficulty in finding words to more clearly demonstrate the conviction we entertain that this standard
has the characteristics which the Government attributes to it than does the mere statement of the text. It is true
it contains no express words of an exclusion from the standard which it establishes of any person on account of
race, color, or previous condition of servitude prohibited by the Fifteenth Amendment, but the standard itself
inherently brings that result into existence since it is based purely upon a period of time before the enactment
of the Fifteenth Amendment and makes that period the controlling and dominant test of the right of suffrage.
In other words, we seek in vain for any ground which would sustain any other interpretation but that the provi-
sion, recurring to the conditions existing before the Fifteenth Amendment was adopted and the continuance of
which the Fifteenth Amendment prohibited, proposed by in substance and effect lifting those conditions over
to a period of time after the Amendment to make them the basis of the right to suffrage conferred in direct and
positive disregard of the Fifteenth Amendment. ...

And it will be so certified.

307 U.S. 268 (1939)

    Vote: 6-2
    Decision: Reversed
    Majority: Frankfurter, joined by Hughes, Stone, Roberts, Black, and Reed
    Dissent: McReynolds, joined by Butler

MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.

The constitution under which Oklahoma was admitted into the Union regulated the suffrage by Article III,
whereby its "qualified electors" were to be "citizens of the State ... who are over the age of twenty-one years" with
disqualifications in the case of felons, paupers and lunatics. Soon after its admission the suffrage provisions of
the Oklahoma Constitution were radically amended by the addition of a literacy test from which white voters
were in effect relieved through the operation of a "grandfather clause." The clause was stricken down by this
Court as violative of the prohibition against discrimination "on account of race, color or previous condition of
servitude" of the Fifteenth Amendment. This outlawry occurred on June 21, 1915. In the meantime the Okla-
homa general election of 1914 had been based on the offending "grandfather clause." After the invalidation of
that clause a special session of the Oklahoma legislature enacted a new scheme for registration as a prerequisite to
voting. ... Section 4 of this statute (now § 5654) was obviously directed towards the consequences of the decision
in Guinn v. United States (1915). Those who had voted in the general election of 1914, automatically remained
qualified voters. The new registration requirements affected only others. These had to apply for registration
between April 30, 1916 and May 11, 1916, if qualified at that time, with an extension to June 30, 1916, given
only to those "absent from the county ... during such period of time, or ... prevented by sickness or unavoid-
able misfortune from registering ... within such time." The crux of the present controversy is the validity of this
registration scheme, with its dividing line between white citizens who had voted under the "grandfather clause"
immunity prior to Guinn v. United States (1915), and citizens who were outside it, and the not more than 12
days as the normal period of registration for the theretofore proscribed class.

The petitioner, a colored citizen of Oklahoma, who was the plaintiff below and will hereafter be referred to as
such, sued three county election officials for declining to register him on October 17, 1934. He was qualified for
registration in 1916 but did not then get on the registration list. The evidence is in conflict whether he presented
himself in that year for registration and, if so, under what circumstances registration was denied him. The fact is
that plaintiff did not get on the register in 1916. Under the terms of the statute he thereby permanently lost the
right to register and hence the right to vote. The central claim of plaintiff is that of the unconstitutionality of §
5654. ...

... The reach of the Fifteenth Amendment against contrivances by a state to thwart equality in the enjoyment of
the right to vote by citizens of the United States regardless of race or color, has been amply expounded by prior
decisions. Guinn v. United States (1915); Myers v. Anderson (1915). The Amendment nullifies sophisticated as
well as simple-minded modes of discrimination. It hits onerous procedural requirements which effectively hand-
§862 | ACCESS TO THE BALLOT

icap exercise of the franchise by the colored race although the abstract right to vote may remain unrestricted as
to race. When in Guinn v. United States (1915), the Oklahoma "grandfather clause" was found violative of the
Fifteenth Amendment, Oklahoma was confronted with the serious task of devising a new registration system
consonant with her own political ideas but also consistent with the Federal Constitution. We are compelled to
conclude, however reluctantly, that the legislation of 1916 partakes too much of the infirmity of the "grandfa-
ther clause" to be able to survive.

Section 5652 of the Oklahoma statutes makes registration a prerequisite to voting. By §§ 5654 and 5659 all cit-
izens who were qualified to vote in 1916 but had not voted in 1914 were required to register, save in the excep-
tional circumstances, between April 30 and May 11, 1916, and in default of such registration were perpetually
disenfranchised. Exemption from this onerous provision was enjoyed by all who had registered in 1914. But
this registration was held under the statute which was condemned in the Guinn case. Unfair discrimination was
thus retained by automatically granting voting privileges for life to the white citizens whom the constitutional
"grandfather clause" had sheltered while subjecting colored citizens to a new burden. The practical effect of the
1916 legislation was to accord to the members of the negro race who had been discriminated against in the out-
lawed registration system of 1914, not more than 12 days within which to reassert constitutional rights which
this Court found in the Guinn case to have been improperly taken from them. We believe that the opportunity
thus given negro voters to free themselves from the effects of discrimination to which they should never have
been subjected was too cabined and confined. ... [T]he practical difficulties, of which the record in this case gives
glimpses, inevitable in the administration of such strict registration provisions, leave no escape from the conclu-
sion that the means chosen as substitutes for the invalidated "grandfather clause" were themselves invalid under
the Fifteenth Amendment. They operated unfairly against the very class on whose behalf the protection of the
Constitution was here successfully invoked.

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.

This is an action against the Judges of Elections for refusing to permit the plaintiff to vote at a primary election
in Texas. ... The petition alleges that the plaintiff is a negro, a citizen of the United States and of Texas and a res-
ident of El Paso, and in every way qualified to vote, as set forth in detail, except that the statute to be mentioned
interferes with his right; that on July 26, 1924, a primary election was held at El Paso for the nomination of can-
§                                                                                                              ACCESS TO THE BALLOT | 863

didates for a senator and representatives in Congress and State and other offices, upon the Democratic ticket;
that the plaintiff, being a member of the Democratic party, sought to vote but was denied the right by defen-
dants; that the denial was based upon a Statute of Texas enacted in May, 1923, and designated Article 3093a, by
the words of which "in no event shall a negro be eligible to participate in a Democratic party primary election
held in the State of Texas," &c., and that this statute is contrary to the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments
to the Constitution of the United States. ...

The important question is whether the statute can be sustained. But although we state it as a question the answer
does not seem to us open to a doubt. We find it unnecessary to consider the Fifteenth Amendment, because
it seems to us hard to imagine a more direct and obvious infringement of the Fourteenth. That Amendment,
while it applies to all, was passed, as we know, with a special intent to protect the blacks from discrimination
against them. Slaughter House Cases. Strauder v. West Virginia (1880). That Amendment "not only gave citi-
zenship and the privileges of citizenship to persons of color, but it denied to any State the power to withhold
from them the equal protection of the laws. ... The statute of Texas in the teeth of the prohibitions referred to
assumes to forbid negroes to take part in a primary election the importance of which we have indicated, discrim-
inating against them by the distinction of color alone. States may do a good deal of classifying that it is difficult
to believe rational, but there are limits, and it is too clear for extended argument that color cannot be made the
basis of a statutory classification affecting the right set up in this case

    Decision: Reversed
    Majority: Cardozo, joined by Hughes, Brandeis, Stone, and Roberts

MR. JUSTICE CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.

The petitioner, a Negro, has brought this action against judges of election in Texas to recover damages for their
refusal by reason of his race or color to permit him to cast his vote at a primary election.

This is not the first time that he has found it necessary to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts in vindica-
tion of privileges secured to him by the Federal Constitution.
864 | ACCESS TO THE BALLOT

In Nixon v. Herndon (1927), decided at the October Term, 1926, this court had before it a statute of the State
of Texas whereby the legislature had said that "in no event shall a negro be eligible to participate in a democratic
party primary election [held in that State]," ... At the suit of this petitioner, the statute was adjudged void as an
infringement of his rights and liberties under the Constitution of the United States.

Promptly after the announcement of that decision, the legislature of Texas enacted a new statute repealing the
article condemned by this court; declaring that the effect of the decision was to create an emergency with a need
for immediate action; and substituting for the article so repealed another bearing the same number. By the article
thus substituted, "every political party in this State through its State Executive Committee shall have the power
to prescribe the qualifications of its own members and shall in its own way determine who shall be qualified to
vote or otherwise participate in such political party ..."

Acting under the new statute, the State Executive Committee of the Democratic party adopted a resolution
"that all white democrats who are qualified under the constitution and laws of Texas ... and none other, be
allowed to participate in the primary elections to be held July 28, 1928, and August 25, 1928," ...

On July 28, 1928, the petitioner, a citizen of the United States, and qualified to vote unless disqualified by the
foregoing resolution, presented himself at the polls and requested that he be furnished with a ballot. The respon-
dents, the judges of election, declined to furnish the ballot or to permit the vote on the ground that the peti-
tioner was a Negro and that by force of the resolution of the Executive Committee only white Democrats were
allowed to be voters at the Democratic primary. ...

Whether a political party in Texas has inherent power today without restraint by any law to determine its own
membership, we are not required at this time either to affirm or to deny. ...

A narrower base will serve for our judgment in the cause at hand. ... Whatever our conclusion might be if the
statute had remitted to the party the untrammeled power to prescribe the qualifications of its members, nothing
of the kind was done. Instead, the statute lodged the power in a committee, which excluded the petitioner and
others of his race, not by virtue of any authority delegated by the party, but by virtue of an authority originating
or supposed to originate in the mandate of the law. ...

... The pith of the matter is simply this, that when those agencies are invested with an authority independent of
the will of the association in whose name they undertake to speak, they become to that extent the organs of the
State itself, the repositories of official power. They are then the governmental instruments whereby parties are
organized and regulated to the end that government itself may be established or continued. What they do in that
relation, they must do in submission to the mandates of equality and liberty that bind officials everywhere. ...

With the problem thus laid bare and its essentials exposed to view, the case is seen to be ruled by Nixon v. Hern­
don (1927). Delegates of the State's power have discharged their official functions in such a way as to discrimi-
nate invidiously between white citizens and black. The Fourteenth Amendment, adopted as it was with special
solicitude for the equal protection of members of the Negro race, lays a duty upon the court to level by its judg-
ment these barriers of color.
§                                                                                                              ACCESS TO THE BALLOT | 865

ion.

    Vote: 9-0
    Decision: Affirmed
    Majority: Roberts, joined by Hughes, Devanter, McReynolds, Brandeis, Sutherland, Butler, Stone, and Car-
    dozo

MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.

The petitioner, by complaint filed in the Justice Court of Harris County, Texas, alleged that although he is a cit-
izen of the United States and of the State and County, and a member of and believer in the tenets of the Demo-
cratic party, the respondent, the county clerk, a state officer, having as such only public functions to perform,
refused him a ballot for a Democratic party primary election, because he is of the negro race. ... Referring to
statutes which regulate absentee voting at primary elections, the complaint states the petitioner expected to be
absent from the county on the date of the primary election, and demanded of the respondent an absentee ballot,
which was refused him in virtue of a resolution of the state Democratic convention of Texas, adopted May 24,
1932, which is:

"Be it resolved, that all white citizens of the State of Texas who are qualified to vote under the Constitution and
laws of the state shall be eligible to membership in the Democratic party and as such entitled to participate in its
deliberations."

The complaint charges that the respondent acted without legal excuse and his wrongful and unlawful acts con-
stituted a violation of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments of the Federal Constitution. ...

The charge is that respondent, a state officer, in refusing to furnish petitioner a ballot, obeyed the law of Texas,
and the consequent denial of petitioner's right to vote in the primary election because of his race and color was
state action forbidden by the Federal Constitution; and it is claimed that former decisions require us so to hold.
The cited cases are, however, not in point. In Nixon v. Herndon (1927), a statute which enacted that "in no event
shall a negro be eligible to participate in a Democratic party primary election held in the State of Texas," was
pronounced offensive to the Fourteenth Amendment. In Nixon v. Condon (1932), a statute was drawn in ques-
tion which provided that "every political party in this State through its State Executive Committee shall have the
§866 | ACCESS TO THE BALLOT

power to prescribe the qualifications of its own members and shall in its own way determine who shall be qual-
ified to vote or otherwise participate in such political party." We held this was a delegation of state power to the
state executive committee and made its determination conclusive irrespective of any expression of the party's will
by its convention, and therefore the committee's action barring negroes from the party primaries was state action
prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment. Here the qualifications of citizens to participate in party counsels
and to vote at party primaries have been declared by the representatives of the party in convention assembled,
and this action upon its face is not state action. ...

Judgment affirmed.

Mr. Justice Stone delivered the opinion of the Court:

Two counts of an indictment found in a federal district court charged that appellees, Commissioners of Elec-
tions, conducting a primary election under Louisiana law to nominate a candidate of the Democratic Party for
representative in Congress, willfully altered and falsely counted and certified the ballots of voters cast in the pri-
mary election. The questions for decision are whether the right of qualified voters to vote in the Louisiana pri-
mary and to have their ballots counted is a right "secured by the Constitution" within the meaning of § 19 and
20 of the Criminal Code, and whether the acts of appellees charged in the indictment violate those sections.

...

The Government argues that the right of a qualified voter in a Louisiana congressional primary election to have
his vote counted and cast is a right secured by Article I, §§ 2 and 4 of the Constitution, and that a conspiracy to
deprive the citizen of that right is a violation of § 19, and also that the willful action of appellees as state officials,
in falsely counting the ballots at the primary election and in falsely certifying the count, deprived qualified voters
of that right and of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment ...
                                                                                                               ACCESS TO THE BALLOT | 867

We look then to the statutes of Louisiana here involved to ascertain the nature of the right which under the con-
stitutional mandate they define and confer on the voter, and the effect upon its exercise of the acts with which
appellees are charged, all with the view to determining, first, whether the right or privilege is one secured by the
Constitution of the United States, second, whether the effect under the state statute of appellees' alleged acts is
such that they operate to injure or oppress citizens in the exercise of that right within the meaning of § 19 and
to deprive inhabitants of the state of that right within the meaning of § 20, and finally, whether §§ 19 and 20,
respectively, are in other respects applicable to the alleged acts of appellees.

...

Pursuant to the authority given by § 2 of Article I of the Constitution, and subject to the legislative power of
Congress under § 4 of Article I, and other pertinent provisions of the Constitution, the states are given, and in
fact exercise, a wide discretion in the formulation of a system for the choice by the people of representatives in
Congress. In common with many other states, Louisiana has exercised that discretion by setting up machinery
for the effective choice of party candidates for representative in Congress by primary elections, and, by its laws, it
eliminates or seriously restricts the candidacy at the general election of all those who are defeated at the primary
...

The primary is conducted by the state at public expense. Act No. 46, supra, § 35. The primary, as is the general
election, is subject to numerous statutory regulations as to the time, place and manner of conducting the elec-

Interference with the right to vote in the Congressional primary in the Second Congressional District for the
choice of Democratic candidate for Congress is thus, as a matter of law and in fact, an interference with the
effective choice of the voters at the only stage of the election procedure when their choice is of significance, since
it is at the only stage when such interference could have any practical effect on the ultimate result, the choice of
the Congressman to represent the district. The primary in Louisiana is an integral part of the procedure for the
popular choice of Congressman. The right of qualified voters to vote at the Congressional primary in Louisiana
and to have their ballots counted is thus the right to participate in that choice.

We come then to the question whether that right is one secured by the Constitution. Section 2 of Article I com-
mands that Congressmen shall be chosen by the people of the several states by electors, the qualifications of
which it prescribes. The right of the people to choose, whatever its appropriate constitutional limitations, where
in other respects it is defined, and the mode of its exercise is prescribed by state action in conformity to the Con-
stitution, is a right established and guaranteed by the Constitution, and hence is one secured by it to those citi-
zens and inhabitants of the state entitled to exercise the right.

...

Obviously included within the right to choose, secured by the Constitution is the right of qualified voters within
a state to cast their ballots and have them counted at Congressional elections. This Court has consistently held
that this is a right secured by the Constitution.
868 | ACCESS TO THE BALLOT

...

But we are now concerned with the question whether the right to choose at a primary election, a candidate for
election as representative, is embraced in the right to choose representatives secured by Article I, § 2.

... But, in determining whether a provision of the Constitution applies to a new subject matter, it is of little sig-
nificance that it is one with which the framers were not familiar. For, in setting up an enduring framework of
government, they undertook to carry out for the indefinite future, and in all the vicissitudes of the changing
affairs of men, those fundamental purposes which the instrument itself discloses. Hence, we read its words not
as we read legislative codes which are subject to continuous revision with the changing course of events, but as
the revelation of the great purposes which were intended to be achieved by the Constitution as a continuing
instrument of government. If we remember that "it is a Constitution we are expounding," we cannot rightly
prefer, of the possible meanings of its words, that which will defeat, rather than effectuate, the constitutional
purpose.

That the free choice by the people of representatives in Congress, subject only to the restrictions to be found in
§§ 2 and 4 of Article I and elsewhere in the Constitution, was one of the great purposes of our constitutional
scheme of government cannot be doubted. We cannot regard it as any the less the constitutional purpose, or its
words as any the less guarantying the integrity of that choice, when a state, exercising its privilege in the absence
of Congressional action, changes the mode of choice from a single step, a general election, to two, of which the
first is the choice at a primary of those candidates from whom, as a second step, the representative in Congress
is to be chosen at the election. Nor can we say that that choice which the Constitution protects is restricted to
the second step because § 4 of Article I, as a means of securing a free choice of representatives by the people, has
authorized Congress to regulate the manner of elections, without making any mention of primary elections. For
we think that the authority of Congress, given by § 4, includes the authority to regulate primary elections when,
as in this case, they are a step in the exercise by the people of their choice of representatives in Congress.

...

Unless the constitutional protection of the integrity of "elections" extends to primary elections, Congress is left
powerless to effect the constitutional purpose, and the popular choice of representatives is stripped of its consti-
tutional protection save only as Congress, by taking over the control of state elections, may exclude from them
the influence of the state primaries. Such an expedient would end that state autonomy with respect to elections
which the Constitution contemplated that Congress should be free to leave undisturbed, subject only to such
minimum regulation as it should find necessary to insure the freedom and integrity of the choice. Words, espe-
cially those of a constitution, are not to be read with such stultifying narrowness. The words of §§ 2 and 4 of
Article I, read in the sense which is plainly permissible and in the light of the constitutional purpose, require us
to hold that a primary election which involves a necessary step in the choice of candidates for election as repre-
sentatives in Congress, and which, in the circumstances of this case, controls that choice, is an election within
the meaning of the constitutional provision, and is subject to congressional regulation as to the manner of hold-
ing it.
                                                                                                               ACCESS TO THE BALLOT | 869

Not only does § 4 of Article I authorize Congress to regulate the manner of holding elections, but, by Article I,
§ 8, Clause 18, Congress is given authority

"to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers and all
other powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States or in any department or officer
thereof."

This provision leaves to the Congress the choice of means by which its constitutional powers are to be carried
into execution.

"Let the end be legitimate; let it be within the scope of the Constitution, and all means which are appropriate,
which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the Con-
stitution, are constitutional."

McCulloch v. Maryland (1819). That principle has been consistently adhered to and liberally applied, and
extends to the congressional power by appropriate legislation to safeguard the right of choice by the people of
representatives in Congress, secured by § 2 of Article I.

...

We think that § 20 authorizes the punishment of two different offenses. The one is willfully subjecting any
inhabitant to the deprivation of rights secured by the Constitution; the other is willfully subjecting any inhabi-
tant to different punishments on account of his alienage, color, or race than are prescribed for the punishment
of citizens. The meager legislative history of the section supports this conclusion. So interpreted, § 20 applies to
deprivation of the constitutional rights of qualified voters to choose representatives in Congress. The generality
of the section, made applicable as it is to deprivations of any constitutional right, does not obscure its meaning
or impair its force within the scope of its application, which is restricted, by its terms, to deprivations which are
willfully inflicted by those acting under color of any law, statute and the like.

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting.

Free and honest elections are the very foundation of our republican form of government. Hence, any attempt
to defile the sanctity of the ballot cannot be viewed with equanimity. As stated by Mr. Justice Miller in Ex parte
Yarbrough (1884), "the temptations to control these elections by violence and corruption" have been a constant
source of danger in the history of all republics. The acts here charged, if proven, are of a kind which carries that
threat, and are highly offensive. Since they corrupt the process of Congressional elections, they transcend mere
local concern and extend a contaminating influence into the national domain.

I think Congress has ample power to deal with them. That is to say, I disagree with Newberry v. United States
(1921) to the extent that it holds that Congress has no power to control primary elections ...

[Art I, §2, §4 & §8] are an arsenal of power ample to protect Congressional elections from any and all forms of
pollution. The fact that a particular form of pollution has only an indirect effect on the final election is immate-
rial. The fact that it occurs in a primary election or nominating convention is likewise irrelevant. The important
§870 | ACCESS TO THE BALLOT

consideration is that the Constitution should be interpreted broadly, so as to give to the representatives of a free
people abundant power to deal with all the exigencies of the electoral process. It means that the Constitution
should be read so as to give Congress an expansive implied power to place beyond the pale acts which, in their
direct or indirect effect, impair the integrity of Congressional elections. For when corruption enters, the election
is no longer free, the choice of the people is affected. To hold that Congress is powerless to control these pri-
maries would indeed be a narrow construction of the Constitution, inconsistent with the view that that instru-
ment of government was designed not only for contemporary needs, but for the vicissitudes of time.

So I agree with most of the views expressed in the opinion of the Court. And it is with diffidence that I dissent

from the result there reached.

Smith v. Allwright

321 U.S. 649 (1944)

    Vote: 7-1
    Decision: Reversed
    Majority: Reed, joined by Stone, Black, Murphy, Jackson, and Rutledge
    Concurrence: Frankfurter
    Dissent: Roberts

MR. JUSTICE REED delivered the opinion of the Court.

This writ of certiorari brings here for review a claim for damages ... on the part of petitioner, a Negro citizen of
the 48th precinct of Harris County, Texas, for the refusal of respondents, election and associate election judges
respectively of that precinct, to give petitioner a ballot or to permit him to cast a ballot in the primary election
of July 27, 1940, for the nomination of Democratic candidates for the United States Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives, and Governor and other state officers. The refusal is alleged to have been solely because of the race
and color of the proposed voter.

The actions of respondents are said to violate ... the Fourteenth, Fifteenth and Seventeenth Amendments to the
United States Constitution. The suit was filed in the District Court of the United States for the Southern Dis-
trict of Texas ...

The District Court denied the relief sought and the Circuit Court of Appeals quite properly affirmed its action
on the authority of Grovey v. Townsend (1935). We granted the petition for certiorari to resolve a claimed incon-
sistency between the decision in the Grovey case and that of United States v. Classic (1941).
                                                                                                                ACCESS TO THE BALLOT | 871

The State of Texas by its Constitution and statutes provides that every person, if certain other requirements are
met which are not here in issue, qualified by residence in the district or county "shall be deemed a qualified elec-
tor." Primary elections for United States Senators, Congressmen and state officers are provided for by Chapters
Twelve and Thirteen of the statutes. Under these chapters, the Democratic party was required to hold the pri-
mary which was the occasion of the alleged wrong to petitioner. ... These nominations are to be made by the
qualified voters of the party. ...

The Democratic party on May 24, 1932, in a state convention adopted the following resolution, which has not
since been "amended, abrogated, annulled or avoided":

"Be it resolved that all white citizens of the State of Texas who are qualified to vote under the Constitution and
laws of the State shall be eligible to membership in the Democratic party and, as such, entitled to participate in
its deliberations."

It was by virtue of this resolution that the respondents refused to permit the petitioner to vote.

Texas is free to conduct her elections and limit her electorate as she may deem wise, save only as her action may
be affected by the prohibitions of the United States Constitution or in conflict with powers delegated to and
exercised by the National Government. The Fourteenth Amendment forbids a State from making or enforcing
any law which abridges the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States and the Fifteenth Amend-
ment specifically interdicts any denial or abridgement by a State of the right of citizens to vote on account of
color. ...

The right of a Negro to vote in the Texas primary has been considered heretofore by this Court ...

In Grovey v. Townsend (1935) this Court had before it another suit for damages for the refusal in a primary of
a county clerk, a Texas officer with only public functions to perform, to furnish petitioner, a Negro, an absen-
tee ballot. The refusal was solely on the ground of race ... It was decided that the determination by the state
convention of the membership of the Democratic party made a significant change from a determination by the
Executive Committee. The former was party action, voluntary in character. The latter, as had been held in the
Condon case, was action by authority of the State. ... Consequently, there was found no ground for holding that
the county clerk's refusal of a ballot because of racial ineligibility for party membership denied the petitioner any
right under the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendment.

Since Grovey v. Townsend (1935) and prior to the present suit, no case from Texas involving primary elections has
been before this Court. We did decide, however, United States v. Classic (1941). We there held that § 4 of Article
I of the Constitution authorized Congress to regulate primary as well as general elections, "where the primary is
by law made an integral part of the election machinery." ... This decision depended, too, on the determination
that under the Louisiana statutes the primary was a part of the procedure for choice of federal officials. By this
decision the doubt as to whether or not such primaries were a part of "elections" subject to federal control ...
was erased. ... As the Louisiana statutes for holding primaries are similar to those of Texas, our ruling in Classic
as to the unitary character of the electoral process calls for a reexamination as to whether or not the exclusion of
Negroes from a Texas party primary was state action.
872 | ACCESS TO THE BALLOT

The statutes of Texas relating to primaries and the resolution of the Democratic party of Texas extending the
privileges of membership to white citizens only are the same in substance and effect today as they were when
Grovey v. Townsend (1935) was decided by a unanimous Court. The question as to whether the exclusionary
action of the party was the action of the State persists as the determinative factor. ...

It may now be taken as a postulate that the right to vote in such a primary for the nomination of candidates
without discrimination by the State, like the right to vote in a general election, is a right secured by the Consti-
tution. By the terms of the Fifteenth Amendment that right may not be abridged by any State on account of
race. Under our Constitution the great privilege of the ballot may not be denied a man by the State because of
his color.

We are thus brought to an examination of the qualifications for Democratic primary electors in Texas, to deter-
mine whether state action or private action has excluded Negroes from participation. Despite Texas' decision
that the exclusion is produced by private or party action ... federal courts must for themselves appraise the facts
leading to that conclusion. Texas requires electors in a primary to pay a poll tax. Every person who does so pay
and who has the qualifications of age and residence is an acceptable voter for the primary ... Texas requires by the
law the election of the county officers of a party. ... Precinct primary election officers are named by the county
executive committee. Statutes provide for the election by the voters of precinct delegates to the county conven-
tion of a party and the selection of delegates to the district and state conventions by the county convention. The
state convention selects the state executive committee. No convention may place in platform or resolution any
demand for specific legislation without endorsement of such legislation by the voters in a primary. Texas thus
directs the selection of all party officers.

Primary elections are conducted by the party under state statutory authority. The county executive committee
selects precinct election officials and the county, district or state executive committees, respectively, canvass the
returns. These party committees or the state convention certify the party's candidates to the appropriate officers
for inclusion on the official ballot for the general election. No name which has not been so certified may appear
upon the ballot for the general election as a candidate of a political party. No other name may be printed on the
ballot which has not been placed in nomination by qualified voters who must take oath that they did not partic-
ipate in a primary for the selection of a candidate for the office for which the nomination is made. ...

We think that this statutory system for the selection of party nominees for inclusion on the general election bal-
lot makes the party which is required to follow these legislative directions an agency of the State in so far as it
determines the participants in a primary election. The party takes its character as a state agency from the duties
imposed upon it by state statutes; the duties do not become matters of private law because they are performed
by a political party. ... When primaries become a part of the machinery for choosing officials, state and national,
as they have here, the same tests to determine the character of discrimination or abridgement should be applied
to the primary as are applied to the general election. If the State requires a certain electoral procedure, prescribes
a general election ballot made up of party nominees so chosen and limits the choice of the electorate in general
elections for state offices, practically speaking, to those whose names appear on such a ballot, it endorses, adopts
§                                                                                                              ACCESS TO THE BALLOT | 873

and enforces the discrimination against Negroes, practiced by a party entrusted by Texas law with the determina-
tion of the qualifications of participants in the primary. This is state action within the meaning of the Fifteenth
Amendment. Guinn v. United States (1915).

The United States is a constitutional democracy. Its organic law grants to all citizens a right to participate in the
choice of elected officials without restriction by any State because of race. This grant to the people of the oppor-
tunity for choice is not to be nullified by a State through casting its electoral process in a form which permits
a private organization to practice racial discrimination in the election. Constitutional rights would be of little
value if they could be thus indirectly denied. Lane v. Wilson (1939).

The privilege of membership in a party may be, as this Court said in Grovey v. Townsend (1935), no concern of a
State. But when, as here, that privilege is also the essential qualification for voting in a primary to select nominees
for a general election, the State makes the action of the party the action of the State. In reaching this conclusion
we are not unmindful of the desirability of continuity of decision in constitutional questions. However, when
convinced of former error, this Court has never felt constrained to follow precedent. In constitutional questions,
where correction depends upon amendment and not upon legislative action this Court throughout its history
has freely exercised its power to reexamine the basis of its constitutional decisions. This has long been accepted
practice, and this practice has continued to this day. This is particularly true when the decision believed erro-
neous is the application of a constitutional principle rather than an interpretation of the Constitution to extract
the principle itself. Here we are applying, contrary to the recent decision in Grovey v. Townsend (1935), the well-
established principle of the Fifteenth Amendment, forbidding the abridgement by a State of a citizen's right to
vote. Grovey v. Townsend (1935) is overruled.

Judgment reversed.

    Vote: 9-0
    Decision: Affirmed
    Majority: Douglas, joined by Warren, Black, Frankfurter, Clark, Harlan, Brennan, Whittaker, and Stewart

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.

This controversy started in a Federal District Court. Appellant, a Negro citizen of North Carolina, sued to have
the literacy test for voters prescribed by that State declared unconstitutional and void. ...
874 | ACCESS TO THE BALLOT

... Appellant applied for registration as a voter. Her registration was denied by the registrar because she refused
to submit to a literacy test as required by the North Carolina statute. She appealed to the County Board of Elec-
tions. On the de novo hearing before that Board appellant again refused to take the literacy test and she was again
denied registration for that reason. She appealed to the Superior Court which sustained the Board against the
claim that the requirement of the literacy test violated the Fourteenth, Fifteenth, and Seventeenth Amendments
of the Federal Constitution. Preserving her federal question, she appealed to the North Carolina Supreme Court
which affirmed the lower court. The case came here by appeal, and we noted probable jurisdiction. ...

We come then to the question whether a State may consistently with the Fourteenth and Seventeenth Amend-
ments apply a literacy test to all voters irrespective of race or color. ...

The States have long been held to have broad powers to determine the conditions under which the right of suf-
frage may be exercised, absent of course the discrimination which the Constitution condemns. ... So while the
right of suffrage is established and guaranteed by the Constitution it is subject to the imposition of state stan-
dards which are not discriminatory and which do not contravene any restriction that Congress, acting pursuant
to its constitutional powers, has imposed. ...

We do not suggest that any standards which a State desires to adopt may be required of voters. But there is
wide scope for exercise of its jurisdiction. Residence requirements, age, previous criminal record (Davis v. Bea­
son (1890)) are obvious examples indicating factors which a State may take into consideration in determining
the qualifications of voters. The ability to read and write likewise has some relation to standards designed to
promote intelligent use of the ballot. Literacy and illiteracy are neutral on race, creed, color, and sex, as reports
around the world show. Literacy and intelligence are obviously not synonymous. Illiterate people may be intelli-
gent voters. Yet in our society where newspapers, periodicals, books, and other printed matter canvass and debate
campaign issues, a State might conclude that only those who are literate should exercise the franchise. It was said
last century in Massachusetts that a literacy test was designed to insure an "independent and intelligent" exercise
of the right of suffrage. Stone v. Smith (Massachusetts Supreme Court). North Carolina agrees. We do not sit
in judgment on the wisdom of that policy. We cannot say, however, that it is not an allowable one measured by
constitutional standards.

Of course a literacy test, fair on its face, may be employed to perpetuate that discrimination which the Fifteenth
Amendment was designed to uproot. No such influence is charged here. On the other hand, a literacy test may
be unconstitutional on its face. In Davis v. Schnell (1949) the test was the citizen's ability to "understand and
explain" an article of the Federal Constitution. The legislative setting of that provision and the great discretion
it vested in the registrar made clear that a literacy requirement was merely a device to make racial discrimination
easy.
§                                                                                                              ACCESS TO THE BALLOT | 875

We cannot make the same inference here. The present requirement, applicable to members of all races, is that
the prospective voter "be able to read and write any section of the Constitution of North Carolina in the Eng-
lish language." That seems to us to be one fair way of determining whether a person is literate, not a calculated
scheme to lay springes for the citizen. Certainly we cannot condemn it on its face as a device unrelated to the
desire of North Carolina to raise the standards for people of all races who cast the ballot.

    Decision: Affirmed
    Majority: Black, joined by Warren, Douglas, Clark, Brennan, Stewart, White, Goldberg

MR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.

... [B]eginning with the adoption of the Louisiana Constitution of 1898, when approximately 44% of all the
registered voters in the State were Negroes, the State had put into effect a successful policy of denying Negro
citizens the right to vote because of their race. The 1898 constitution adopted what was known as a "grandfa-
ther clause," ... Such a transparent expedient for disfranchising Negroes ... was held unconstitutional in 1915 ...
Guinn v. United States (1915). Soon after that decision Louisiana, in 1921, adopted a new constitution replacing
the repudiated "grandfather clause" with what the complaint calls an "interpretation test," which required that
an applicant for registration be able to "give a reasonable interpretation" of any clause in the Louisiana Consti-
tution or the Constitution of the United States. From the adoption of the 1921 interpretation test until 1944,
the District Court's opinion stated, the percentage of registered voters in Louisiana who were Negroes never
exceeded one percent. Prior to 1944 Negro interest in voting in Louisiana had been slight, largely because the
State's white primary law kept Negroes from voting in the Democratic Party primary election, the only elec-
tion that mattered in the political climate of that State. In 1944, however, this Court invalidated the substan-
tially identical white primary law of Texas, and with the explicit statutory bar to their voting in the primary
removed and because of a generally heightened political interest, Negroes in increasing numbers began to register
in Louisiana. The white primary system had been so effective in barring Negroes from voting that the "interpre-
tation test" as a disfranchising device had been ignored over the years. Many registrars continued to ignore it after
1944, and in the next dozen years the proportion of registered voters who were Negroes rose from two-tenths of
one percent to approximately 15% by March 1956. This fact, coupled with this Court's 1954 invalidation of laws
876 | ACCESS TO THE BALLOT

requiring school segregation, prompted the State to try new devices to keep the white citizens in control. The
Louisiana Legislature created a committee which became known as the "Segregation Committee" to seek means
of accomplishing this goal. The chairman of this committee also helped to organize a semiprivate group called
the Association of Citizens Councils, which thereafter acted in close cooperation with the legislative committee
to preserve white supremacy. The legislative committee and the Citizens Councils set up programs, which parish
voting registrars were required to attend, to instruct the registrars on how to promote white political control. ...
Beginning in the middle 1950's registrars of at least 21 parishes began to apply the interpretation test. In 1960
the State Constitution was amended to require every applicant thereafter to "be able to understand" as well as
"give a reasonable interpretation" of any section of the State or Federal Constitution "when read to him by the
registrar." The State Board of Registration in cooperation with the Segregation Committee issued orders that all
parish registrars must strictly comply with the new provisions.

The interpretation test, the court found, vested in the voting registrars a virtually uncontrolled discretion as to
who should vote and who should not. Under the State's statutes and constitutional provisions the registrars,
without any objective standard to guide them, determine the manner in which the interpretation test is to be
given, whether it is to be oral or written, the length and complexity of the sections of the State or Federal Consti-
tution to be understood and interpreted, and what interpretation is to be considered correct. There was ample
evidence to support the District Court's finding that registrars in the 21 parishes where the test was found to
have been used had exercised their broad powers to deprive otherwise qualified Negro citizens of their right to
vote; and that the existence of the test as a hurdle to voter qualification has in itself deterred and will continue to
deter Negroes from attempting to register in Louisiana.

Because of the virtually unlimited discretion vested by the Louisiana laws in the registrars of voters, and because
in the 21 parishes where the interpretation test was applied that discretion had been exercised to keep Negroes
from voting because of their race, the District Court held the interpretation test invalid on its face and as applied,
as a violation of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution ...

... There can be no doubt from the evidence in this case that the District Court was amply justified in finding
that Louisiana's interpretation test, as written and as applied, was part of a successful plan to deprive Louisiana
Negroes of their right to vote. This device for accomplishing unconstitutional discrimination has been little if
any less successful than was the "grandfather clause" invalidated by this Court's decision in Guinn v. United
States, supra, 50 years ago, which when that clause was adopted in 1898 had seemed to the leaders of Louisiana
a much preferable way of assuring white political supremacy. The Governor of Louisiana stated in 1898 that
he believed that the "grandfather clause" solved the problem of keeping Negroes from voting "in a much more
upright and manly fashion" than the method adopted previously by the States of Mississippi and South Car-
olina, which left the qualification of applicants to vote "largely to the arbitrary discretion of the officers admin-
istering the law." ...

But Louisiana of a later generation did place just such arbitrary power in the hands of election officers who have
used it with phenomenal success to keep Negroes from voting in the State. The State admits that the statutes
and provisions of the state constitution establishing the interpretation test "vest discretion in the registrars of
voters to determine the qualifications of applicants for registration" while imposing "no definite and objective
§                                                                                                              ACCESS TO THE BALLOT | 877

standards upon registrars of voters for the administration of the interpretation test." ... The applicant facing a
registrar in Louisiana thus has been compelled to leave his voting fate to that official's uncontrolled power to
determine whether the applicant's understanding of the Federal or State Constitution is satisfactory. As the evi-
dence showed, colored people, even some with the most advanced education and scholarship, were declared by
voting registrars with less education to have an unsatisfactory understanding of the Constitution of Louisiana
or of the United States. This is not a test but a trap, sufficient to stop even the most brilliant man on his way to
the voting booth. The cherished right of people in a country like ours to vote cannot be obliterated by the use of
laws like this, which leave the voting fate of a citizen to the passing whim or impulse of an individual registrar.
Many of our cases have pointed out the invalidity of laws so completely devoid of standards and restraints. ... We
likewise affirm here the District Court's holding that the provisions of the Louisiana Constitution and statutes
which require voters to satisfy registrars of their ability to "understand and give a reasonable interpretation of
any section" of the Federal or Louisiana Constitution violate the Constitution. And we agree with the District
Court that it specifically conflicts with the prohibitions against discrimination in voting because of race found ...
in the Fifteenth Amendment ... to subject citizens to such an arbitrary power as Louisiana has given its registrars
under these laws.

MR. JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.

A provision of the Texas Constitution prohibits "[a]ny member of the Armed Forces of the United States" who
moves his home to Texas during the course of his military duty from ever voting in any election in that State
"so long as he or she is a member of the Armed Forces." The question presented is whether this provision, as
construed by the Supreme Court of Texas in the present case, deprives the petitioner of a right secured by the
Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court of Texas decided that it does not
and refused to issue a writ of mandamus ordering petitioner's local election officials to permit him to vote, two
Justices dissenting. We granted certiorari.

there permanently. He has purchased a house in El Paso where he lives with his wife and two children. He is
also the proprietor of a small business there. The petitioner's post of military duty is not in Texas, but at White
Sands, New Mexico. He regularly commutes from his home in El Paso to his Army job at White Sands. He pays
property taxes in Texas and has his automobile registered there. But for his uniform, the State concedes that the
petitioner would be eligible to vote in El Paso County, Texas.

Texas has unquestioned power to impose reasonable residence restrictions on the availability of the ballot. Pope
v. Williams (1904). There can be no doubt either of the historic function of the States to establish, on a nondis-
criminatory basis, and in accordance with the Constitution, other qualifications for the exercise of the franchise.
Indeed, "[t]he States have long been held to have broad powers to determine the conditions under which the
right of suffrage may be exercised." Lassiter v. Northampton Election Bd. (1959). ...

This Texas constitutional provision, however, is unique. Texas has said that no serviceman may ever acquire a
voting residence in the State so long as he remains in service. ...

It is argued that this absolute denial of the vote to servicemen like the petitioner fulfills two purposes. First, the
State says it has a legitimate interest in immunizing its elections from the concentrated balloting of military per-
sonnel, whose collective voice may overwhelm a small local civilian community. Secondly, the State says it has a
valid interest in protecting the franchise from infiltration by transients, and it can reasonably assume that those
servicemen who fall within the constitutional exclusion will be within the State for only a short period of time.

The theory underlying the State's first contention is that the Texas constitutional provision is necessary to pre-
vent the danger of a "takeover" of the civilian community resulting from concentrated voting by large num-
bers of military personnel in bases placed near Texas towns and cities. A base commander, Texas suggests, who
opposes local police administration or teaching policies in local schools, might influence his men to vote in con-
formity with his predilections. Local bond issues may fail, and property taxes stagnate at low levels because mil-
itary personnel are unwilling to invest in the future of the area. We stress--and this a theme to be reiterated
--that Texas has the right to require that all military personnel enrolled to vote be bona fide residents of the
community. But if they are in fact residents, with the intention of making Texas their home indefinitely, they,
as all other qualified residents, have a right to an equal opportunity for political representation. "Fencing out"
from the franchise a sector of the population because of the way they may vote is constitutionally impermissi-
ble."[T]he exercise of rights so vital to the maintenance of democratic institutions," Schneider v. State (1939),
cannot constitutionally be obliterated because of a fear of the political views of a particular group of bona fide
residents. Yet, that is what Texas claims to have done here.

The State's second argument is that its voting ban is justified because of the transient nature of service in the
Armed Forces. As the Supreme Court of Texas stated: "Persons in military service are subject at all times to reas-
signment, and hence to a change in their actual residence ... they do not elect to be where they are. Their reasons
for being where they are ... cannot be the same as [those of] the permanent residents." The Texas Constitution
provides that a United States citizen can become a qualified elector if he has "resided in this State one (1) year
                                                                                                               ACCESS TO THE BALLOT | 879

next preceding an election and the last six (6) months within the district or county in which such person offers
to vote." It is the integrity of this qualification of residence which Texas contends is protected by the voting ban
on members of the Armed Forces.

But only where military personnel are involved has Texas been unwilling to develop more precise tests to deter-
mine the bona fides of an individual claiming to have actually made his home in the State long enough to vote.
... By statute, Texas deals with particular categories of citizens who, like soldiers, present specialized problems
in determining residence. Students at colleges and universities in Texas, patients in hospitals and other institu-
tions within the State, and civilian employees of the United States Government may be as transient as military
personnel. But all of them are given at least an opportunity to show the election officials that they are bona fide
residents.

Indeed, Texas has been able, in other areas, to winnow successfully from the ranks of the military those whose
residence in the State is bona fide. ...

We deal here with matters close to the core of our constitutional system."The right ... to choose," United States
v. Classic (1941), that this Court has been so zealous to protect, means, at the least, that States may not casually
deprive a class of individuals of the vote because of some remote administrative benefit to the State. Oyama v.
California (1948). By forbidding a soldier ever to controvert the presumption of nonresidence, the Texas Con-
stitution imposes an invidious discrimination in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment."[T]here is no indica-
tion in the Constitution that ... occupation affords a permissible basis for distinguishing between qualified voters
within the State." Gray v. Sanders (1963).

We recognize that special problems may be involved in determining whether servicemen have actually acquired a
new domicile in a State for franchise purposes. We emphasize that Texas is free to take reasonable and adequate
steps, as have other States, to see that all applicants for the vote actually fulfill the requirements of bona fide resi-
dence. But this constitutional provision goes beyond such rules."[T]he presumption here created is ... definitely
conclusive--incapable of being overcome by proof of the most positive character." Heiner v. Donnan (1932).
All servicemen not residents of Texas before induction come within the provision's sweep. Not one of them can
ever vote in Texas, no matter how long Texas may have been his true home."[T]he uniform of our country ...
[must not] be the badge of disfranchisement for the man or woman who wears it."

JUSTICE DOUGLAS DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.

These are suits by Virginia residents to have declared unconstitutional Virginia's poll tax. ...

While the right to vote in federal elections is conferred by Art. I, §2, of the Constitution (United States v. Classic
(1941)), the right to vote in state elections is nowhere expressly mentioned. It is argued that the right to vote in
state elections is implicit, particularly by reason of the First Amendment and that it may not constitutionally
be conditioned upon the payment of a tax or fee. We do not stop to canvass the relation between voting and
political expression. For it is enough to say that once the franchise is granted to the electorate, lines may not be
drawn which are inconsistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. That is to say,
the right of suffrage "is subject to the imposition of state standards which are not discriminatory and which do
not contravene any restriction that Congress, acting pursuant to its constitutional powers, has imposed." Las­
siter v. Northampton Election Board (1959). We were speaking there of a state literacy test which we sustained,
warning that the result would be different if a literacy test, fair on its face, were used to discriminate against a
class. But the Lassiter case does not govern the result here, because, unlike a poll tax, the "ability to read and
write ... has some relation to standards designed to promote intelligent use of the ballot."

We conclude that a State violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment whenever it makes
the affluence of the voter or payment of any fee an electoral standard. Voter qualifications have no relation to
wealth nor to paying or not paying this or any other tax. Our cases demonstrate that the Equal Protection Clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment restrains the States from fixing voter qualifications which invidiously discrimi-
nate. Thus, without questioning the power of a State to impose reasonable residence restrictions on the avail-
ability of the ballot, we held in Carrington v. Rash (1965), that a State may not deny the opportunity to vote to
a bona fide resident merely because he is a member of the armed services."By forbidding a soldier ever to contro-
vert the presumption of non-residence, the Texas Constitution imposes an invidious discrimination in violation
of the Fourteenth Amendment. ... We think the same must be true of requirements of wealth or affluence or
payment of a fee.

Long ago, in Yick Wo v. Hopkins (1886), the Court referred to "the political franchise of voting" as a "fundamen-
tal political right, because preservative of all rights." Recently in Reynolds v. Sims (1964), we said, "Undoubtedly,
the right of suffrage is a fundamental matter in a free and democratic society. Especially since the right to exercise
the franchise in a free and unimpaired manner is preservative of other basic civil and political rights, any alleged
                                                                                                                ACCESS TO THE BALLOT | 881

infringement of the right of citizens to vote must be carefully and meticulously scrutinized." There we were con-
sidering charges that voters in one part of the State had greater representation per person in the State Legislature
than voters in another part of the State. We concluded:

"A citizen, a qualified voter, is no more nor no less so because he lives in the city or on the farm. This is the clear
and strong command of our Constitution's Equal Protection Clause. This is an essential part of the concept of
a government of laws and not men. This is at the heart of Lincoln's vision of `government of the people, by the
people, [and] for the people.' The Equal Protection Clause demands no less than substantially equal state leg-
islative representation for all citizens, of all places as well as of all races."

We say the same whether the citizen, otherwise qualified to vote, has $1.50 in his pocket or nothing at all, pays
the fee or fails to pay it. The principle that denies the State the right to dilute a citizen's vote on account of his
economic status or other such factors by analogy bars a system which excludes those unable to pay a fee to vote
or who fail to pay.

It is argued that a State may exact fees from citizens for many different kinds of licenses; that if it can demand
from all an equal fee for a driver's license, it can demand from all an equal poll tax for voting. But we must
remember that the interest of the State, when it comes to voting, is limited to the power to fix qualifications.
Wealth, like race, creed, or color, is not germane to one's ability to participate intelligently in the electoral
process. Lines drawn on the basis of wealth or property, like those of race are traditionally disfavored. To intro-
duce wealth or payment of a fee as a measure of a voter's qualifications is to introduce a capricious or irrelevant
factor. The degree of the discrimination is irrelevant. In this context - that is, as a condition of obtaining a bal-
lot - the requirement of fee paying causes an "invidious" discrimination that runs afoul of the Equal Protection
Clause. ...

We agree, of course, with Mr. Justice Holmes that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment "does
not enact Mr. Herbert Spencer's Social Statics" Lochner v. New York (1905). Likewise, the Equal Protection
Clause is not shackled to the political theory of a particular era. In determining what lines are unconstitutionally
discriminatory, we have never been confined to historic notions of equality, any more than we have restricted due
process to a fixed catalogue of what was at a given time deemed to be the limits of fundamental rights. Notions
of what constitutes equal treatment for purposes of the Equal Protection Clause do change. This Court in 1896
held that laws providing for separate public facilities for white and Negro citizens did not deprive the latter of
the equal protection and treatment that the Fourteenth Amendment commands. Plessy v. Ferguson. Seven of
the eight Justices then sitting subscribed to the Court's opinion, thus joining in expressions of what consti-
tuted unequal and discriminatory treatment that sound strange to a contemporary ear. When, in 1954 - more
than a half-century later - we repudiated the "separate-but-equal" doctrine of Plessy as respects public educa-
tion we stated: "In approaching this problem, we cannot turn the clock back to 1868 when the Amendment was
adopted, or even to 1896 when Plessy v. Ferguson was written." Brown v. Board of Education (1954).

In a recent searching re-examination of the Equal Protection Clause, we held, as already noted, that "the oppor-
tunity for equal participation by all voters in the election of state legislators" is required. Reynolds v. Sims (1964).
882 | ACCESS TO THE BALLOT

We decline to qualify that principle by sustaining this poll tax. Our conclusion, like that in Reynolds v. Sims
(1964), is founded not on what we think governmental policy should be, but on what the Equal Protection
Clause requires.

We have long been mindful that where fundamental rights and liberties are asserted under the Equal Protection
Clause, classifications which might invade or restrain them must be closely scrutinized and carefully confined.

Those principles apply here. For to repeat, wealth or fee paying has, in our view, no relation to voting qualifica-
tions; the right to vote is too precious, too fundamental to be so burdened or conditioned.

Reversed.

MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE STEWART joins, dissenting.

The final demise of state poll taxes, already totally proscribed by the Twenty-Fourth Amendment with respect
to federal elections and abolished by the States themselves in all but four States with respect to state elections,
is perhaps in itself not of great moment. But the fact that the coup de grace has been administered by this Court
instead of being left to the affected States or to the federal political process should be a matter of continuing con-
cern to all interested in maintaining the proper role of this tribunal under our scheme of government.

...

... In substance the Court's analysis of the equal protection issue goes no further than to say that the electoral
franchise is "precious" and "fundamental," and to conclude that "[t]o introduce wealth or payment of a fee as
a measure of a voter's qualifications is to introduce a capricious or irrelevant factor[.]" These are of course cap-
tivating phrases, but they are wholly inadequate to satisfy the standard governing adjudication of the equal pro-
tection issue: Is there a rational basis for Virginia's poll tax as a voting qualification? I think the answer to that
question is undoubtedly "yes."

... it is certainly a rational argument that payment of some minimal poll tax promotes civic responsibility, weed-
ing out those who do not care enough about public affairs to pay $1.50 or thereabouts a year for the exercise of
the franchise. It is also arguable, indeed it was probably accepted as sound political theory by a large percentage
of Americans through most of our history, that people with some property have a deeper stake in community
affairs, and are consequently more responsible, more educated, more knowledgeable, more worthy of confi-
dence, than those without means, and that the community and Nation would be better managed if the franchise
were restricted to such citizens. Nondiscriminatory and fairly applied literacy tests, upheld by this Court in Las­
siter v. Northampton Election Board (1959), find justification on very similar grounds.

These viewpoints, to be sure, ring hollow on most contemporary ears. Their lack of acceptance today is evi-
denced by the fact that nearly all of the States, left to their own devices, have eliminated property or poll-tax
qualifications; by the cognate fact that Congress and three-quarters of the States quickly ratified the Twenty-
Fourth Amendment; and by the fact that rules such as the "pauper exclusion" in Virginia law, have never been
enforced.
§                                                                                                              ACCESS TO THE BALLOT | 883

Property and poll-tax qualifications, very simply, are not in accord with current egalitarian notions of how a
modern democracy should be organized. It is of course entirely fitting that legislatures should modify the law to
reflect such changes in popular attitudes. However, it is all wrong, in my view, for the Court to adopt the polit-
ical doctrines popularly accepted at a particular moment of our history and to declare all others to be irrational
and invidious, barring them from the range of choice by reasonably minded people acting through the political
process. ...

I would affirm the decision of the District Court.

Kramer v. Union Free Sch. Dist. No. 15

395 U.S. 621 (1969)

    Decision: Reversed
    Majority: Warren, joined by Douglas, Brennan, White, and Marshall
    Dissent: Stewart, joined by Black, and Harlan

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.

In this case we are called on to determine whether § 2012 of the New York Education Law is constitutional. The
legislation provides that in certain New York school districts residents who are otherwise eligible to vote in state
and federal elections may vote in the school district election only if they (1) own (or lease) taxable real property
within the district, or (2) are parents (or have custody of) children enrolled in the local public schools. Appel-
lant, a bachelor who neither owns nor leases taxable real property, filed suit in federal court claiming that § 2012
denied him equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. With one judge dissenting,
a three-judge District Court dismissed appellant's complaint. Finding that § 2012 does violate the Equal Protec-
tion Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, we reverse.

New York law provides basically three methods of school board selection. In some large city districts, the school
board is appointed by the mayor or city council. On the other hand, in some cities, primarily those with less
than 125,000 residents, the school board is elected at general or municipal elections in which all qualified city
voters may participate. Finally, in other districts such as the one involved in this case, which are primarily rural
and suburban, the school board is elected at an annual meeting of qualified school district voters.
884 | ACCESS TO THE BALLOT

The challenged statute is applicable only in the districts which hold annual meetings. To be eligible to vote at an
annual district meeting, an otherwise qualified district resident must either (1) be the owner or lessee of taxable
real property located in the district, (2) be the spouse of one who owns or leases qualifying property, or (3) be
the parent or guardian of a child enrolled for a specified time during the preceding year in a local district school.

... Appellant is a 31-year-old college-educated stock-broker who lives in his parents' home in the Union Free
School District No. 15, a district to which § 2012 applies. He is a citizen of the United States and has voted in
federal and state elections since 1959. However, since he has no children and neither owns nor leases taxable real
property, appellant's attempts to register for and vote in the local school district elections have been unsuccess-
ful. After the school district rejected his 1965 application, appellant instituted the present class action challeng-
ing the constitutionality of the voter eligibility requirements. ...

... The sole issue in this case is whether the additional requirements of § 2012--requirements which prohibit
some district residents who are otherwise qualified by age and citizenship from participating in district meetings
and school board elections--violate the Fourteenth Amendment's command that no State shall deny persons
equal protection of the laws.

"In determining whether or not a state law violates the Equal Protection Clause, we must consider the facts and
circumstances behind the law, the interests which the State claims to be protecting, and the interests of those
who are disadvantaged by the classification." Williams v. Rhodes (1968). And, in this case, we must give the
statute a close and exacting examination."[S]ince the right to exercise the franchise in a free and unimpaired
manner is preservative of other basic civil and political rights, any alleged infringement of the right of citizens
to vote must be carefully and meticulously scrutinized." Reynolds v. Sims (1964). This careful examination is
necessary because statutes distributing the franchise constitute the foundation of our representative society. Any
unjustified discrimination in determining who may participate in political affairs or in the selection of public
officials undermines the legitimacy of representative government.

... Statutes granting the franchise to residents on a selective basis always pose the danger of denying some citizens
any effective voice in the governmental affairs which substantially affect their lives. Therefore, if a challenged
state statute grants the right to vote to some bona fide residents of requisite age and citizenship and denies the
franchise to others, the Court must determine whether the exclusions are necessary to promote a compelling
state interest.

And, for these reasons, the deference usually given to the judgment of legislators does not extend to decisions
concerning which resident citizens may participate in the election of legislators and other public officials. Those
decisions must be carefully scrutinized by the Court to determine whether each resident citizen has, as far as
is possible, an equal voice in the selections. Accordingly, when we are reviewing statutes which deny some res-
idents the right to vote, the general presumption of constitutionality afforded state statutes and the traditional
approval given state classifications if the Court can conceive of a "rational basis" for the distinctions made are
not applicable. The presumption of constitutionality and the approval given "rational" classifications in other
types of enactments are based on an assumption that the institutions of state government are structured so as
to represent fairly all the people. However, when the challenge to the statute is in effect a challenge of this basic
                                                                                                               ACCESS TO THE BALLOT | 885

assumption, the assumption can no longer serve as the basis for presuming constitutionality. And, the assump-
tion is no less under attack because the legislature which decides who may participate at the various levels of
political choice is fairly elected. Legislation which delegates decision making to bodies elected by only a portion
of those eligible to vote for the legislature can cause unfair representation. Such legislation can exclude a minor-
ity of voters from any voice in the decisions just as effectively as if the decisions were made by legislators the
minority had no voice in selecting.

... We turn therefore to question whether the exclusion is necessary to promote a compelling state interest. First,
appellees argue that the State has a legitimate interest in limiting the franchise in school district elections to
"members of the community of interest"--those "primarily interested in such elections." Second, appellees urge
that the State may reasonably and permissibly conclude that "property taxpayers" (including lessees of taxable
property who share the tax burden through rent payments) and parents of the children enrolled in the district's
schools are those "primarily interested" in school affairs.

We do not understand appellees to argue that the State is attempting to limit the franchise to those "subjectively
concerned" about school matters. Rather, they appear to argue that the State's legitimate interest is in restricting
a voice in school matters to those "directly affected" by such decisions. The State apparently reasons that since
the schools are financed in part by local property taxes, persons whose out-of-pocket expenses are "directly"
affected by property tax changes should be allowed to vote. Similarly, parents of children in school are thought
to have a "direct" stake in school affairs and are given a vote.

Appellees argue that it is necessary to limit the franchise to those "primarily interested" in school affairs because
"the ever increasing complexity of the many interacting phases of the school system and structure make it
extremely difficult for the electorate fully to understand the whys and wherefores of the detailed operations of
the school system." Appellees say that many communications of school boards and school administrations are
sent home to the parents through the district pupils and are "not broadcast to the general public"; thus, nonpar-
ents will be less informed than parents. Further, appellees argue, those who are assessed for local property taxes
(either directly or indirectly through rent) will have enough of an interest "through the burden on their pocket-
books, to acquire such information as they may need."

We need express no opinion as to whether the State in some circumstances might limit the exercise of the fran-
chise to those "primarily interested" or "primarily affected." Of course, we therefore do not reach the issue
of whether these particular elections are of the type in which the franchise may be so limited. For, assuming,
arguendo, that New York legitimately might limit the franchise in these school district elections to those "pri-
marily interested in school affairs," close scrutiny of the § 2012 classifications demonstrates that they do not
accomplish this purpose with sufficient precision to justify denying appellant the franchise.

Whether classifications allegedly limiting the franchise to those resident citizens "primarily interested" deny
those excluded equal protection of the laws depends, inter alia, on whether all those excluded are in fact sub-
stantially less interested or affected than those the statute includes. In other words, the classifications must be
tailored so that the exclusion of appellant and members of his class is necessary to achieve the articulated state
goal. Section 2012 does not meet the exacting standard of precision we require of statutes which selectively dis-
§886 | ACCESS TO THE BALLOT

tribute the franchise. The classifications in § 2012 permit inclusion of many persons who have, at best, a remote
and indirect interest in school affairs and, on the other hand, exclude others who have a distinct and direct inter-
est in the school meeting decisions.

Nor do appellees offer any justification for the exclusion of seemingly interested and informed residents--other
than to argue that the § 2012 classifications include those "whom the State could understandably deem to be
the most intimately interested in actions taken by the school board," and urge that "the task of ... balancing the
interest of the community in the maintenance of orderly school district elections against the interest of any indi-
vidual in voting in such elections should clearly remain with the Legislature." But the issue is not whether the
legislative judgments are rational. A more exacting standard obtains. The issue is whether the § 2012 require-
ments do in fact sufficiently further a compelling state interest to justify denying the franchise to appellant and
members of his class. The requirements of § 2012 are not sufficiently tailored to limiting the franchise to those
"primarily interested" in school affairs to justify the denial of the franchise to appellant and members of his class.

The judgment of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York is therefore reversed.
The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

    Majority: Rehnquist, joined by Burger, Stewart, White, Blackmun, Powell

MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.

The three individual respondents in this case were convicted of felonies and have completed the service of their
respective sentences and paroles. They filed a petition for a writ of mandate in the Supreme Court of Califor-
nia to compel California county election officials to register them as voters. They claimed, on behalf of them-
selves and others similarly situated, that application to them of the provisions of the California Constitution and
implementing statutes which disenfranchised persons convicted of an "infamous crime" denied them the right
to equal protection of the laws under the Federal Constitution. The Supreme Court of California held that "as
applied to all ex-felons whose terms of incarceration and parole have expired, the provisions of article II and arti-
                                                                                                               ACCESS TO THE BALLOT | 887

cle XX, section 11, of the California Constitution denying the right of suffrage to persons convicted of crime,
together with the several sections of the Elections Code implementing that disqualification ... violate the equal
protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment." We granted certiorari.

Each of the individual respondents was convicted of one or more felonies, and served some time in jail or prison
followed by a successfully terminated parole. Respondent Ramirez was convicted in Texas; respondents Lee and
Gill were convicted in California. When Ramirez applied to register to vote in San Luis Obispo County, the
County Clerk refused to allow him to register. The Monterey County Clerk refused registration to respondent
Lee, and the Stanislaus County Registrar of Voters (hereafter also included in references to clerks) refused regis-
tration to respondent Gill. All three respondents were refused registration because of their felony convictions.

In May 1972 respondents filed a petition for a writ of mandate in the Supreme Court of California. ... [I]t was
contended that California's denial of the franchise to the class of ex-felons could no longer withstand scrutiny
under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Relying on the Court's recent voting-rights
cases, respondents argued that a compelling state interest must be found to justify exclusion of a class from the
franchise, and that California could assert no such interest with respect to ex-felons. ...

Unlike most claims under the Equal Protection Clause, for the decision of which we have only the language of
the Clause itself as it is embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment, respondents' claim implicates not merely the
language of the Equal Protection Clause of §1 of the Fourteenth Amendment, but also the provisions of the less
familiar §2 of the Amendment:

Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting
the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. But when the right to vote at any elec-
tion for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States, Representatives in Congress,
the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the
male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, or in any way
abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in
the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-
one years of age in such State. (Emphasis supplied.)

Petitioner contends that the italicized language of §2 expressly exempts from the sanction of that section dis-
enfranchisement grounded on prior conviction of a felony. She goes on to argue that those who framed and
adopted the Fourteenth Amendment could not have intended to prohibit outright in §1 of that Amendment
that which was expressly exempted from the lesser sanction of reduced representation imposed by §2 of the
Amendment. This argument seems to us a persuasive one unless it can be shown that the language of §2, "except
for participation in rebellion, or other crime," was intended to have a different meaning than would appear from
its face.

The problem of interpreting the "intention" of a constitutional provision is, as countless cases of this Court
recognize, a difficult one. Not only are there deliberations of congressional committees and floor debates in the
House and Senate, but an amendment must thereafter be ratified by the necessary number of States. The legisla-
tive history bearing on the meaning of the relevant language of §2 is scant indeed; the framers of the Amendment
888 | ACCESS TO THE BALLOT

were primarily concerned with the effect of reduced representation upon the States, rather than with the two
forms of disenfranchisement which were exempted from that consequence by the language with which we are
concerned here. Nonetheless, what legislative history there is indicates that this language was intended by Con-
gress to mean what it says. ...

Further light is shed on the understanding of those who framed and ratified the Fourteenth Amendment, and
thus on the meaning of §2, by the fact that at the time of the adoption of the Amendment, 29 States had provi-
sions in their constitutions which prohibited, or authorized the legislature to prohibit, exercise of the franchise
by persons convicted of felonies or infamous crimes.

More impressive than the mere existence of the state constitutional provisions disenfranchising felons at the
time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment is the congressional treatment of States readmitted to the
Union following the Civil War. For every State thus readmitted, affirmative congressional action in the form of
an enabling act was taken, and as a part of the readmission process the State seeking readmission was required
to submit for the approval of the Congress its proposed state constitution. In March 1867, before any State was
readmitted, Congress passed "An act to provide for the more efficient Government of the Rebel States," the so-
called Reconstruction Act. Section 5 of the Reconstruction Act established conditions on which the former
Confederate States would be readmitted to representation in Congress. It provided:

"That when the people of any one of said rebel States shall have formed a constitution of government in confor-
mity with the Constitution of the United States in all respects, framed by a convention of delegates elected by
the male citizens of said State, twenty-one years old and upward, of whatever race, color, or previous condition,
who have been resident in said State for one year previous to the day of such election, except such as may be dis­
franchised for participation in the rebellion or for felony at common law, and when such constitution shall provide
that the elective franchise shall be enjoyed by all such persons as have the qualifications herein stated for electors
of delegates, and when such constitution shall be ratified by a majority of the persons voting on the question of
ratification who are qualified as electors for delegates, and when such constitution shall have been submitted to
Congress ... said State shall be declared entitled to representation in Congress, and senators and representatives
shall be admitted therefrom on their taking the oath prescribed by law ..." (Emphasis supplied.) ...

This convincing evidence of the historical understanding of the Fourteenth Amendment is confirmed by
the decisions of this Court which have discussed the constitutionality of provisions disenfranchising felons.
Although the Court has never given plenary consideration to the precise question of whether a State may con-
stitutionally exclude some or all convicted felons from the franchise, we have indicated approval of such exclu-
sions on a number of occasions. In two cases decided toward the end of the last century, the Court approved
exclusions of bigamists and polygamists from the franchise under territorial laws of Utah and Idaho. Murphy v.
Ramsey (1885); Davis v. Beason (1890). Much more recently we have strongly suggested in dicta that exclusion
of convicted felons from the franchise violates no constitutional provision. In Lassiter v. Northampton County
Board of Elections (1959), where we upheld North Carolina's imposition of a literacy requirement for voting,
the Court said:
                                                                                                               ACCESS TO THE BALLOT | 889

"Residence requirements, age, previous criminal record (Davis v. Beason) are obvious examples indicating fac-
tors which a State may take into consideration in determining the qualifications of voters."

... Despite this settled historical and judicial understanding of the Fourteenth Amendment's effect on state laws
disenfranchising convicted felons, respondents argue that our recent decisions invalidating other state-imposed
restrictions on the franchise as violative of the Equal Protection Clause require us to invalidate the disenfran-
chisement of felons as well. They rely on such cases to support the conclusions of the Supreme Court of Califor-
nia that a State must show a "compelling state interest" to justify exclusion of ex-felons from the franchise and
that California has not done so here.

As we have seen, however, the exclusion of felons from the vote has an affirmative sanction in §2 of the Four-
teenth Amendment, a sanction which was not present in the case of the other restrictions on the franchise which
were invalidated in the cases on which respondents rely. We hold that the understanding of those who adopted
the Fourteenth Amendment, as reflected in the express language of §2 and in the historical and judicial inter-
pretation of the Amendment's applicability to state laws disenfranchising felons, is of controlling significance in
distinguishing such laws from those other state limitations on the franchise which have been held invalid under
the Equal Protection Clause by this Court. ... §1 in dealing with voting rights as it does, could not have been
meant to bar outright a form of disenfranchisement which was expressly exempted from the less drastic sanction
of reduced representation which §2 imposed for other forms of disenfranchisement. ...

Pressed upon us by the respondents, and by amici curiae, are contentions that these notions are outmoded, and
that the more modern view is that it is essential to the process of rehabilitating the ex-felon that he be returned
to his role in society as a fully participating citizen when he has completed the serving of his term. We would by
no means discount these arguments if addressed to the legislative forum which may properly weigh and balance
them against those advanced in support of California's present constitutional provisions. But it is not for us to
choose one set of values over the other. If respondents are correct, and the view which they advocate is indeed
the more enlightened and sensible one, presumably the people of the State of California will ultimately come
around to that view. And if they do not do so, their failure is some evidence, at least, of the fact that there are
two sides to the argument.

We therefore hold that the Supreme Court of California erred in concluding that California may no longer,
consistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, exclude from the franchise con-
victed felons who have completed their sentences and paroles. The California court did not reach respondents'
alternative contention that there was such a total lack of uniformity in county election officials' enforcement of
the challenged state laws as to work a separate denial of equal protection, and we believe that it should have an
opportunity to consider the claim before we address ourselves to it. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for fur-
ther proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, WITH WHOM MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN JOINS, DISSENTING.
890 | ACCESS TO THE BALLOT

The Court today holds that a State may strip ex-felons who have fully paid their debt to society of their funda-
mental right to vote without running afoul of the Fourteenth Amendment. This result is, in my view, based on
an unsound historical analysis which already has been rejected by this Court. In straining to reach that result, I
believe that the Court has also disregarded important limitations on its jurisdiction. For these reasons, I respect-
fully dissent.

... The Court construes §2 of the Fourteenth Amendment as an express authorization for the States to disenfran-
chise former felons. Section 2 does except disenfranchisement for "participation in rebellion, or other crime"
from the operation of its penalty provision. As the Court notes, however, there is little independent legislative
history as to the crucial words "or other crime"; the proposed §2 went to a joint committee containing only
the phrase "participation in rebellion" and emerged with "or other crime" inexplicably tacked on. In its exhaus-
tive review of the lengthy legislative history of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Court has come upon only one
explanatory reference for the "other crimes" provision - a reference which is unilluminating at best.

The historical purpose for §2 itself is, however, relatively clear and in my view, dispositive of this case. The
Republicans who controlled the 39th Congress were concerned that the additional congressional representation
of the Southern States which would result from the abolition of slavery might weaken their own political dom-
inance. There were two alternatives available - either to limit southern representation, which was unacceptable
on a long-term basis, or to insure that southern Negroes, sympathetic to the Republican cause, would be enfran-
chised; but an explicit grant of suffrage to Negroes was thought politically unpalatable at the time. Section 2
of the Fourteenth Amendment was the resultant compromise. It put Southern States to a choice - enfranchise
Negro voters or lose congressional representation. ...

It is clear that §2 was not intended and should not be construed to be a limitation on the other sections of the
Fourteenth Amendment. Section 2 provides a special remedy - reduced representation - to cure a particular
form of electoral abuse - the disenfranchisement of Negroes. There is no indication that the framers of the pro-
visions intended that special penalty to be the exclusive remedy for all forms of electoral discrimination. This
Court has repeatedly rejected that rationale.

Rather, a discrimination to which the penalty provision of §2 is inapplicable must still be judged against the
Equal Protection Clause of §1 to determine whether judicial or congressional remedies should be invoked. ...

The Court's references to congressional enactments contemporaneous to the adoption of the Fourteenth
Amendment, such as the Reconstruction Act and the readmission statutes, are inapposite. They do not explain
the purpose for the adoption of §2 of the Fourteenth Amendment. They merely indicate that disenfranchise-
ment for participation in crime was not uncommon in the States at the time of the adoption of the Amend-
ment. Hence, not surprisingly, that form of disenfranchisement was excepted from the application of the special
penalty provision of §2. But because Congress chose to exempt one form of electoral discrimination from the
reduction-of-representation remedy provided by §2 does not necessarily imply congressional approval of this
disenfranchisement. By providing a special remedy for disenfranchisement of a particular class of voters in §2,
Congress did not approve all election discriminations to which the §2 remedy was inapplicable, and such dis-
criminations thus are not forever immunized from evolving standards of equal protection scrutiny. ...
                                                                                                                ACCESS TO THE BALLOT | 891

Disenfranchisement for participation in crime ... was common at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth
Amendment. But "constitutional concepts of equal protection are not immutably frozen like insects trapped in
Devonian amber." We have repeatedly observed:

[T]he Equal Protection Clause is not shackled to the political theory of a particular era. In determining what
lines are unconstitutionally discriminatory, we have never been confined to historic notions of equality, any more
than we have restricted due process to a fixed catalogue of what was at a given time deemed to be the limits of
fundamental rights. Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections (1966).

Accordingly, neither the fact that several States had ex-felon disenfranchisement laws at the time of the adoption
of the Fourteenth Amendment, nor that such disenfranchisement was specifically excepted from the special
remedy of §2, can serve to insulate such disenfranchisement from equal protection scrutiny.

In my view, the disenfranchisement of ex-felons must be measured against the requirements of the Equal Pro-
tection Clause of §1 of the Fourteenth Amendment. That analysis properly begins with the observation that
because the right to vote "is of the essence of a democratic society, and any restrictions on that right strike at
the heart of representative government," Reynolds v. Sims, voting is a "fundamental" right. ..."[I]f a challenged
statute grants the right to vote to some citizens and denies the franchise to others, `the Court must determine
whether the exclusions are necessary to promote a compelling state interest.'" ...

I think it clear that the State has not met its burden of justifying the blanket disenfranchisement of former felons
presented by this case. There is certainly no basis for asserting that ex-felons have any less interest in the demo-
cratic process than any other citizen. Like everyone else, their daily lives are deeply affected and changed by the
decisions of government. As the Secretary of State of California observed in his memorandum to the Court in
support of respondents in this case:

"It is doubtful ... whether the state can demonstrate either a compelling or rational policy interest in denying
former felons the right to vote. The individuals involved in the present case are persons who have fully paid their
debt to society. They are as much affected by the actions of government as any other citizens, and have as much
of a right to participate in governmental decision-making. Furthermore, the denial of the right to vote to such
persons is a hindrance to the efforts of society to rehabilitate former felons and convert them into law-abiding
and productive citizens."

It is argued that disenfranchisement is necessary to prevent vote frauds. Although the State has a legitimate
and, in fact, compelling interest in preventing election fraud, the challenged provision is not sustainable on that
ground. First, the disenfranchisement provisions are patently both overinclusive and underinclusive. The pro-
vision is not limited to those who have demonstrated a marked propensity for abusing the ballot by violating
election laws. Rather, it encompasses all former felons and there has been no showing that ex-felons generally are
any more likely to abuse the ballot than the remainder of the population. In contrast, many of those convicted
of violating election laws are treated as misdemeanants and are not barred from voting at all. It seems clear that
the classification here is not tailored to achieve its articulated goal, since it crudely excludes large numbers of oth-
erwise qualified voters.
892 | ACCESS TO THE BALLOT

Moreover, there are means available for the State to prevent voting fraud which are far less burdensome on the
constitutionally protected right to vote. ...

Another asserted purpose is to keep former felons from voting because their likely voting pattern might be sub-
versive of the interests of an orderly society ...

To the extent [previous cases] approve the doctrine that citizens can be barred from the ballot box because they
would vote to change the existing criminal law, those decisions are surely of minimal continuing precedential
value. We have since explicitly held that such "differences of opinion cannot justify excluding [any] group from
... `the franchise':

"[I]f they are ... residents, ... they, as all other qualified residents, have a right to an equal opportunity for political
representation. ... `Fencing out' from the franchise a sector of the population because of the way they may vote
is constitutionally impermissible."

Although, in the last century, this Court may have justified the exclusion of voters from the electoral process for
fear that they would vote to change laws considered important by a temporal majority, I have little doubt that
we would not countenance such a purpose today. The process of democracy is one of change. Our laws are not
frozen into immutable form, they are constantly in the process of revision in response to the needs of a changing
society. The public interest, as conceived by a majority of the voting public, is constantly undergoing reexam-
ination. This Court's holding in [previous cases] that a State may disenfranchise a class of voters to "withdraw
all political influence from those who are practically hostile" to the existing order, strikes at the very heart of
the democratic process. A temporal majority could use such a power to preserve inviolate its view of the social
order simply by disenfranchising those with different views. Voters who opposed the repeal of prohibition could
have disenfranchised those who advocated repeal "to prevent persons from being enabled by their votes to defeat
the criminal laws of the country." Today, presumably those who support the legalization of marihuana could be
barred from the ballot box for much the same reason. The ballot is the democratic system's coin of the realm. To
condition its exercise on support of the established order is to debase that currency beyond recognition. Rather
than resurrect [those precedents], I would expressly disavow any continued adherence to the dangerous notions
therein expressed. ...

The disenfranchisement of ex-felons had "its origin in the fogs and fictions of feudal jurisprudence and doubt-
less has been brought forward into modern statutes without fully realizing either the effect of its literal signifi-
cance or the extent of its infringement upon the spirit of our system of government." Byers v. Sun Savings Bank
(Oklahoma 1914).
§                                                                                                              ACCESS TO THE BALLOT | 893

I think it clear that measured against the standards of this Court's modern equal protection jurisprudence, the
blanket disenfranchisement of ex-felons cannot stand.

I respectfully dissent.

Hunter v. Underwood

471 U.S. 222 (1985)

    Vote: 8-0
    Decision: Affirmed
    Majority: Rehnquist, joined by Burger, Brennan, White, Marshall, Blackmun, Stevens, O'Connor
    Not participating: Powell

JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.

We are required in this case to decide the constitutionality of Art. VIII, § 182, of the Alabama Constitution of
1901, which provides for the disenfranchisement of persons convicted of, among other offenses, "any crime ...
involving moral turpitude." Appellees Carmen Edwards, a black, and Victor Underwood, a white, have been
blocked from the voter rolls pursuant to § 182 by the Boards of Registrars for Montgomery and Jefferson Coun-
ties, respectively, because they each have been convicted of presenting a worthless check. ...

The predecessor to § 182 was Art. VIII, § 3, of the Alabama Constitution of 1875, which denied persons "con-
victed of treason, embezzlement of public funds, malfeasance in office, larceny, bribery, or other crime punish-
able by imprisonment in the penitentiary" the right to register, vote or hold public office. These offenses were
largely, if not entirely, felonies. The drafters of § 182, which was adopted by the 1901 convention, expanded the
list of enumerated crimes substantially to include the following:

"treason, murder, arson, embezzlement, malfeasance in office, larceny, receiving stolen property, obtaining
property or money under false pretenses, perjury, subornation of perjury, robbery, assault with intent to rob,
burglary, forgery, bribery, assault and battery on the wife, bigamy, living in adultery, sodomy, incest, rape, misce-
genation, [and] crime against nature."

The drafters retained the general felony provision -- "any crime punishable by imprisonment in the peniten-
tiary" -- but also added a new catchall provision covering "any ... crime involving moral turpitude." This latter
phrase is not defined, but it was subsequently interpreted by the Alabama Supreme Court to mean an act that is
" `immoral in itself, regardless of the fact whether it is punishable by law. ...
894 | ACCESS TO THE BALLOT

... Various minor nonfelony offenses such as presenting a worthless check and petty larceny fall within the sweep
of § 182, while more serious nonfelony offenses such as second-degree manslaughter, assault on a police officer,
mailing pornography, and aiding the escape of a misdemeanant do not because they are neither enumerated in
§ 182 nor considered crimes involving moral turpitude. It is alleged, and the Court of Appeals found, that the
crimes selected for inclusion in § 182 were believed by the delegates to be more frequently committed by blacks.

Section 182 on its face is racially neutral, applying equally to anyone convicted of one of the enumerated crimes
or a crime falling within one of the catchall provisions. Appellee Edwards nonetheless claims that the provision
has had a racially discriminatory impact. The District Court made no finding on this claim, but the Court of
Appeals implicitly found the evidence of discriminatory impact indisputable:

"The registrars' expert estimated that by January 1903 section 182 had disfranchised approximately ten times as
many blacks as whites. This disparate effect persists today. In Jefferson and Montgomery Counties blacks are by
even the most modest estimates at least 1.7 times as likely as whites to suffer disfranchisement under section 182
for the commission of nonprison offenses."

... Presented with a neutral state law that produces disproportionate effects along racial lines, the Court of
Appeals was correct in applying the approach of Arlington Heights to determine whether the law violates the
Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment:

"[O]fficial action will not be held unconstitutional solely because it results in a racially disproportionate impact.
... Proof of racially discriminatory intent or purpose is required to show a violation of the Equal Protection
Clause." Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp. (1977). See Washington v.
Davis (1976).

Once racial discrimination is shown to have been a "substantial" or "motivating" factor behind enactment of
the law, the burden shifts to the law's defenders to demonstrate that the law would have been enacted without
this factor.

... Although understandably no "eyewitnesses" to the 1901 proceedings testified, testimony and opinions of his-
torians were offered and received without objection. These showed that the Alabama Constitutional Conven-
tion of 1901 was part of a movement that swept the post-Reconstruction South to disenfranchise blacks. The
delegates to the all-white convention were not secretive about their purpose. John B. Knox, president of the con-
vention, stated in his opening address:

"And what is it that we want to do? Why it is within the limits imposed by the Federal Constitution, to establish
white supremacy in this State."

Indeed, neither the District Court nor appellants seriously dispute the claim that this zeal for white supremacy
ran rampant at the convention.

... The evidence of legislative intent available to the courts below consisted of the proceedings of the convention,
several historical studies, and the testimony of two expert historians. Having reviewed this evidence, we are per-
suaded that the Court of Appeals was correct in its assessment. That court's opinion presents a thorough analy-
                                                                                                               ACCESS TO THE BALLOT | 895

sis of the evidence and demonstrates conclusively that § 182 was enacted with the intent of disenfranchising
blacks. We see little purpose in repeating that factual analysis here. At oral argument in this Court appellants'
counsel essentially conceded this point, stating: "I would be very blind and naive [to] try to come up and stand
before this Court and say that race was not a factor in the enactment of Section 182; that race did not play a part
in the decisions of those people who were at the constitutional convention of 1901 and I won't do that."

In their brief to this Court, appellants maintain on the basis of their expert's testimony that the real purpose
behind § 182 was to disenfranchise poor whites as well as blacks. The Southern Democrats, in their view, sought
in this way to stem the resurgence of Populism which threatened their power ...

Even were we to accept this explanation as correct, it hardly saves § 182 from invalidity. The explanation concedes
both that discrimination against blacks, as well as against poor whites, was a motivating factor for the provi-
sion and that § 182 certainly would not have been adopted by the convention or ratified by the electorate in the
absence of the racially discriminatory motivation. ...

Appellants contend that the State has a legitimate interest in denying the franchise to those convicted of crimes
involving moral turpitude, and that § 182 should be sustained on that ground. The Court of Appeals convinc-
ingly demonstrated that such a purpose simply was not a motivating factor of the 1901 convention. ...

At oral argument in this Court, appellants' counsel suggested that, regardless of the original purpose of § 182,
events occurring in the succeeding 80 years had legitimated the provision. Some of the more blatantly discrim-
inatory selections, such as assault and battery on the wife and miscegenation, have been struck down by the
courts, and appellants contend that the remaining crimes -- felonies and moral turpitude misdemeanors -- are
acceptable bases for denying the franchise. Without deciding whether § 182 would be valid if enacted today with-
out any impermissible motivation, we simply observe that its original enactment was motivated by a desire to
discriminate against blacks on account of race and the section continues to this day to have that effect. As such,
it violates equal protection under [precedent].

... The single remaining question is whether § 182 is excepted from the operation of the Equal Protection Clause
of § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment by the "other crime" provision of § 2 of that Amendment. Without again
considering the implicit authorization of § 2 to deny the vote to citizens "for participation in rebellion, or other
crime," see Richardson v. Ramirez (1974), we are confident that § 2 was not designed to permit the purposeful
racial discrimination attending the enactment and operation of § 182 which otherwise violates § 1 of the Four-
teenth Amendment. Nothing in our opinion in Richardson v. Ramirez, supra, suggests the contrary.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Affirmed.

Justice Kennedy, delivered the opinion of the Court.

A citizen of Hawaii comes before us claiming that an explicit, race-based voting qualification has barred him
from voting in a statewide election. The Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States ... con-
trols the case. ...

Not long after the creation of the new Territory, Congress became concerned with the condition of the native
Hawaiian people. Reciting its purpose to rehabilitate the native Hawaiian population, Congress enacted the
Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, which set aside about 200,000 acres of the ceded public lands and created a
program of loans and long-term leases for the benefit of native Hawaiians. ...

Hawaii was admitted as the 50th State of the Union in 1959. With admission, the new State agreed to adopt the
Hawaiian Homes Commission Act as part of its own Constitution. ...

In the first decades following admission, the State apparently continued to administer the lands that had been
set aside under the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act for the benefit of native Hawaiians. ...

In 1978 Hawaii amended its Constitution to establish the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, which has as its mission
"[t]he betterment of conditions of native Hawaiians ... [and] Hawaiians[.]" Members of the 1978 constitutional
convention, at which the new amendments were drafted and proposed, set forth the purpose of the proposed
agency:

"Members [of the Committee of the Whole] were impressed by the concept of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs
which establishes a public trust entity for the benefit of the people of Hawaiian ancestry. Members foresaw that
it will provide Hawaiians the right to determine the priorities which will effectuate the betterment of their con-
dition and welfare. ..."

OHA is overseen by a nine-member board of trustees, the members of which ... shall be "elected by qualified
voters who are Hawaiians, as provided by law." The term "Hawaiian" is defined by statute:

"`Hawaiian' means any descendant of the aboriginal peoples inhabiting the Hawaiian Islands which exercised
sovereignty and subsisted in the Hawaiian Islands in 1778, and which peoples thereafter have continued to reside
in Hawaii."
                                                   ACCESS TO THE BALLOT | 897

The statute defines "native Hawaiian" as follows:

"`Native Hawaiian' means any descendant of not less than one-half part of the races inhabiting the Hawaiian
Islands previous to 1778, as defined by the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920, as amended; provided that
the term identically refers to the descendants of such blood quantum of such aboriginal peoples which exercised
sovereignty and subsisted in the Hawaiian Islands in 1778 and which peoples thereafter continued to reside in
Hawaii."

Petitioner Harold Rice is a citizen of Hawaii and a descendant of preannexation residents of the islands. He is
not, as we have noted, a descendant of pre-1778 natives, and so he is neither "native Hawaiian" nor "Hawaiian"
as defined by the statute. Rice applied in March 1996 to vote in the elections for OHA trustees. To register to
vote for the office of trustee he was required to attest: "I am also Hawaiian and desire to register to vote in OHA
elections." Rice marked through the words "am also Hawaiian and," then checked the form "yes." The State
denied his application.

Rice sued Benjamin Cayetano, the Governor of Hawaii, in the United States District Court for the District of
Hawaii. ...

... Finding that the electoral scheme was "rationally related to the State's responsibility under the Admission Act
to utilize a portion of the proceeds from the § 5(b) lands for the betterment of Native Hawaiians," the District
Court held that the voting restriction did not violate the Constitution's ban on racial classifications.

The Court of Appeals affirmed ... [T]he court held that Hawaii "may rationally conclude that Hawaiians, being
the group to whom trust obligations run and to whom OHA trustees owe a duty of loyalty, should be the group
to decide who the trustees ought to be." The court so held notwithstanding its clear holding that the Hawaii
Constitution and implementing statutes "contain a racial classification on their face."

We granted certiorari, and now reverse.

The purpose and command of the Fifteenth Amendment are set forth in language both explicit and compre-
hensive. The National Government and the States may not violate a fundamental principle: They may not deny
or abridge the right to vote on account of race. ...

The design of the Amendment is to reaffirm the equality of races at the most basic level of the democratic
process, the exercise of the voting franchise. A resolve so absolute required language as simple in command as
it was comprehensive in reach. Fundamental in purpose and effect ... the Amendment prohibits all provisions
denying or abridging the voting franchise of any citizen or class of citizens on the basis of race. ...

Unlike [previous] cases, the voting structure now before us is neither subtle nor indirect. It is specific in granting
the vote to persons of defined ancestry and to no others. The State maintains this is not a racial category at all but
instead a classification limited to those whose ancestors were in Hawaii at a particular time, regardless of their
race. ... We reject this line of argument.
898 | ACCESS TO THE BALLOT

Ancestry can be a proxy for race. It is that proxy here. ... The very object of the statutory definition in question
and of its earlier congressional counterpart in the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act is to treat the early Hawai-
ians as a distinct people, commanding their own recognition and respect. The State, in enacting the legislation
before us, has used ancestry as a racial definition and for a racial purpose.

... The ancestral inquiry mandated by the State implicates the same grave concerns as a classification specifying a
particular race by name. One of the principal reasons race is treated as a forbidden classification is that it demeans
the dignity and worth of a person to be judged by ancestry instead of by his or her own merit and essential qual-
ities. An inquiry into ancestral lines is not consistent with respect based on the unique personality each of us
possesses, a respect the Constitution itself secures in its concern for persons and citizens.

The ancestral inquiry mandated by the State is forbidden by the Fifteenth Amendment for the further reason
that the use of racial classifications is corruptive of the whole legal order democratic elections seek to preserve.
... Ancestral tracing of this sort achieves its purpose by creating a legal category which employs the same mech-
anisms, and causes the same injuries, as laws or statutes that use race by name. The State's electoral restriction
enacts a race-based voting qualification.

The State offers three principal defenses of its voting law, any of which, it contends, allows it to prevail even if the
classification is a racial one under the Fifteenth Amendment. We examine, and reject, each of these arguments.

The most far reaching of the State's arguments is that exclusion of non-Hawaiians from voting is permitted
under our cases allowing the differential treatment of certain members of Indian tribes. ... In reliance on that
theory the Court has sustained a federal provision giving employment preferences to persons of tribal ancestry.
The Mancari case, and the theory upon which it rests, are invoked by the State to defend its decision to restrict
voting for the OHA trustees, who are charged so directly with protecting the interests of native Hawaiians.

... Even were we to take the substantial step of finding authority in Congress, delegated to the State, to treat
Hawaiians or native Hawaiians as tribes, Congress may not authorize a State to create a voting scheme of this
sort.

... To extend Mancari to this context would be to permit a State, by racial classification, to fence out whole
classes of its citizens from decisionmaking in critical state affairs. The Fifteenth Amendment forbids this result.

Hawaii further contends that the limited voting franchise is sustainable under a series of cases holding that the
rule of one person, one vote does not pertain to certain special purpose districts such as water or irrigation dis-
tricts. ...

We would not find those cases dispositive in any event, however. ... Our special purpose district cases have not
suggested that compliance with the one-person, one-vote rule of the Fourteenth Amendment somehow excuses
compliance with the Fifteenth Amendment. We reject that argument here. ...

Hawaii's final argument is that the voting restriction does no more than ensure an alignment of interests
between the fiduciaries and the beneficiaries of a trust. Thus, the contention goes, the restriction is based on
beneficiary status rather than race.
                                                                                                               ACCESS TO THE BALLOT | 899

As an initial matter, the contention founders on its own terms, for it is not clear that the voting classification
is symmetric with the beneficiaries of the programs OHA administers. Although the bulk of the funds for
which OHA is responsible appears to be earmarked for the benefit of "native Hawaiians," the State permits both
"native Hawaiians" and "Hawaiians" to vote for the office of trustee. The classification thus appears to create,
not eliminate, a differential alignment between the identity of OHA trustees and what the State calls beneficia-
ries.

Hawaii's argument fails on more essential grounds. The State's position rests, in the end, on the demeaning
premise that citizens of a particular race are somehow more qualified than others to vote on certain matters. That
reasoning attacks the central meaning of the Fifteenth Amendment. ... Race cannot qualify some and disqual-
ify others from full participation in our democracy. All citizens, regardless of race, have an interest in selecting
officials who make policies on their behalf, even if those policies will affect some groups more than others. ...
Hawaii may not assume, based on race, that petitioner or any other of its citizens will not cast a principled vote.
To accept the position advanced by the State would give rise to the same indignities, and the same resulting ten-
sions and animosities, the Amendment was designed to eliminate. ...

...

When the culture and way of life of a people are all but engulfed by a history beyond their control, their sense
of loss may extend down through generations; and their dismay may be shared by many members of the larger
community. As the State of Hawaii attempts to address these realities, it must, as always, seek the political con-
sensus that begins with a sense of shared purpose. One of the necessary beginning points is this principle: The
Constitution of the United States, too, has become the heritage of all the citizens of Hawaii.

In this case the Fifteenth Amendment invalidates the electoral qualification based on ancestry. The judgment of
the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed.

It is so ordered.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins as to Part II, dissenting.

... As the majority itself must tacitly admit, the terms of the [Fifteenth] Amendment itself do not here apply.
The OHA voter qualification speaks in terms of ancestry and current residence, not of race or color. ...

Presumably recognizing this distinction, the majority relies on the fact that "[a]ncestry can be a proxy for race."
That is, of course, true, but it by no means follows that ancestry is always a proxy for race. Cases in which ances-
try served as such a proxy are dramatically different from this one. ... [T]he voting laws held invalid under the
Fifteenth Amendment in all of the cases cited by the majority were fairly and properly viewed through a spe-
cialized lens -- a lens honed in specific detail to reveal the realities of time, place, and history behind the voting
restrictions being tested.
900 | ACCESS TO THE BALLOT

That lens not only fails to clarify, it fully obscures the realities of this case, virtually the polar opposite of the
Fifteenth Amendment cases on which the Court relies. ... Cases such as these that "strike down these voting sys-
tems ... designed to exclude one racial class (at least) from voting, "have no application to a system designed to
empower politically the remaining members of a class of once sovereign, indigenous people.

Ancestry surely can be a proxy for race, or a pretext for invidious racial discrimination. But it is simply neither
proxy nor pretext here. All of the persons who are eligible to vote for the trustees of OHA share two qualifi-
cations that no other person old enough to vote possesses: They are beneficiaries of the public trust created by
the State and administered by OHA, and they have at least one ancestor who was a resident of Hawaii in 1778.
A trust whose terms provide that the trustees shall be elected by a class including beneficiaries is hardly a novel
concept. The Committee that drafted the voting qualification explained that the trustees here should be elected
by the beneficiaries because "people to whom assets belong should have control over them ..." ...

In this light, it is easy to understand why the classification here is not "demeaning" at all, for it is simply not
based on the "premise that citizens of a particular race are somehow more qualified than others to vote on certain
matters," It is based on the permissible assumption in this context that families with "any" ancestor who lived
in Hawaii in 1778, and whose ancestors thereafter continued to live in Hawaii, have a claim to compensation
and selfdetermination that others do not. For the multiracial majority of the citizens of the State of Hawaii to
recognize that deep reality is not to demean their own interests but to honor those of others. ...

The Court today ignores the overwhelming differences between the Fifteenth Amendment case law on which it
relies and the unique history of the State of Hawaii. The former recalls an age of abject discrimination against
an insular minority in the old South; the latter at long last yielded the "political consensus" the majority claims
it seeks -- a consensus determined to recognize the special claim to self-determination of the indigenous peoples
of Hawaii. ...

Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.

Crawford v. Marion County Election Board et al

553 U.S. 181 (2008)

    Vote: 6-3
    Decision: Affirmed

    Dissent: Souter, joined by Ginsburg
    Dissent: Breyer

Justice STEVENS announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which THE CHIEF JUS-
TICE and Justice KENNEDY join.

At issue in these cases is the constitutionality of an Indiana statute requiring citizens voting in person on election
day, or casting a ballot in person at the office of the circuit court clerk prior to election day, to present photo
identification issued by the government.

Referred to as either the "Voter ID Law" or "SEA 483," the statute applies to in-person voting at both primary
and general elections. The requirement does not apply to absentee ballots submitted by mail, and the statute
contains an exception for persons living and voting in a state-licensed facility such as a nursing home. A voter
who is indigent or has a religious objection to being photographed may cast a provisional ballot that will be
counted only if she executes an appropriate affidavit before the circuit court clerk within 10 days following the
election. A voter who has photo identification but is unable to present that identification on election day may
file a provisional ballot that will be counted if she brings her photo identification to the circuit court clerk's office
within 10 days. No photo identification is required in order to register to vote, and the State offers free photo
identification to qualified voters able to establish their residence and identity. ...

The complaints in the consolidated cases allege that the new law substantially burdens the right to vote in vio-
lation of the Fourteenth Amendment; that it is neither a necessary nor appropriate method of avoiding election
fraud; and that it will arbitrarily disfranchise qualified voters who do not possess the required identification and
will place an unjustified burden on those who cannot readily obtain such identification. ...

In Harper v. Virginia Bd. of Elections (1966), the Court held that Virginia could not condition the right to vote
in a state election on the payment of a poll tax of $1.50. We rejected the dissenters' argument that the interest
in promoting civic responsibility by weeding out those voters who did not care enough about public affairs to
pay a small sum for the privilege of voting provided a rational basis for the tax. Applying a stricter standard, we
concluded that a State "violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment whenever it makes
the affluence of the voter or payment of any fee an electoral standard." ... Although the State's justification for
the tax was rational, it was invidious because it was irrelevant to the voter's qualifications.
902 | ACCESS TO THE BALLOT

Thus, under the standard applied in Harper, even rational restrictions on the right to vote are invidious if they
are unrelated to voter qualifications. In Anderson v. Celebrezze (1983), however, we confirmed the general rule
that "evenhanded restrictions that protect the integrity and reliability of the electoral process itself" are not
invidious and satisfy the standard set forth in Harper. Rather than applying any "litmus test" that would neatly
separate valid from invalid restrictions, we concluded that a court must identify and evaluate the interests put
forward by the State as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule, and then make the "hard judgment"
that our adversary system demands.

... However slight that burden may appear, as Harper demonstrates, it must be justified by relevant and legiti-
mate state interests "sufficiently weighty to justify the limitation." Norman v. Reed (1992). We therefore begin
our analysis of the constitutionality of Indiana's statute by focusing on those interests.

The State has identified several state interests that arguably justify the burdens that SEA 483 imposes on voters
and potential voters. ... Each is unquestionably relevant to the State's interest in protecting the integrity and reli-
ability of the electoral process.

The first is the interest in deterring and detecting voter fraud. The State has a valid interest in participating in
a nationwide effort to improve and modernize election procedures that have been criticized as antiquated and
inefficient. The State also argues that it has a particular interest in preventing voter fraud in response to a prob-
lem that is in part the product of its own maladministration -- namely, that Indiana's voter registration rolls
include a large number of names of persons who are either deceased or no longer live in Indiana. Finally, the
State relies on its interest in safeguarding voter confidence. Each of these interests merits separate comment.

Election Modernization

Two recently enacted federal statutes have made it necessary for States to reexamine their election procedures.
Both contain provisions consistent with a State's choice to use government-issued photo identification as a rele-
vant source of information concerning a citizen's eligibility to vote.

In the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA), Congress established procedures that would both
increase the number of registered voters and protect the integrity of the electoral process. ...

In HAVA [Help America Vote Act], Congress required every State to create and maintain a computerized
statewide list of all registered voters. ...

HAVA also imposes new identification requirements for individuals registering to vote for the first time who
submit their applications by mail. If the voter is casting his ballot in person, he must present local election offi-
cials with written identification, which may be either "a current and valid photo identification" or another form
of documentation such as a bank statement or paycheck. If the voter is voting by mail, he must include a copy of
the identification with his ballot. ...

Of course, neither HAVA nor NVRA required Indiana to enact SEA 483, but they do indicate that Congress
believes that photo identification is one effective method of establishing a voter's qualification to vote and that
                                                                                                               ACCESS TO THE BALLOT | 903

the integrity of elections is enhanced through improved technology. That conclusion is also supported by a
report issued shortly after the enactment of SEA 483 by the Commission on Federal Election Reform chaired
by former President Jimmy Carter and former Secretary of State James A. Baker III ...

Voter Fraud

The only kind of voter fraud that SEA 483 addresses is in-person voter impersonation at polling places. The
record contains no evidence of any such fraud actually occurring in Indiana at any time in its history. Moreover,
petitioners argue that provisions of the Indiana Criminal Code punishing such conduct as a felony provide ade-
quate protection against the risk that such conduct will occur in the future. It remains true, however, that fla-
grant examples of such fraud in other parts of the country have been documented throughout this Nation's
history by respected historians and journalists, that occasional examples have surfaced in recent years, and that
Indiana's own experience with fraudulent voting in the 2003 Democratic primary for East Chicago Mayor --
though perpetrated using absentee ballots and not in-person fraud -- demonstrate that not only is the risk of
voter fraud real but that it could affect the outcome of a close election.

There is no question about the legitimacy or importance of the State's interest in counting only the votes of
eligible voters. ... While the most effective method of preventing election fraud may well be debatable, the pro-
priety of doing so is perfectly clear.

In its brief, the State argues that the inflation of its voter rolls provides further support for its enactment of SEA
483. ... Even though Indiana's own negligence may have contributed to the serious inflation of its registration
lists when SEA 483 was enacted, the fact of inflated voter rolls does provide a neutral and nondiscriminatory
reason supporting the State's decision to require photo identification.

Safeguarding Voter Confidence

Finally, the State contends that it has an interest in protecting public confidence "in the integrity and legitimacy
of representative government." While that interest is closely related to the State's interest in preventing voter
fraud, public confidence in the integrity of the electoral process has independent significance, because it encour-
ages citizen participation in the democratic process. As the Carter-Baker Report observed, the "`electoral system
cannot inspire public confidence if no safeguards exist to deter or detect fraud or to confirm the identity of vot-
ers.'"

States employ different methods of identifying eligible voters at the polls. ... A photo identification requirement
imposes some burdens on voters that other methods of identification do not share. ...

The burdens that are relevant to the issue before us are those imposed on persons who are eligible to vote but do
not possess a current photo identification that complies with the requirements of SEA 483. The fact that most
voters already possess a valid driver's license, or some other form of acceptable identification, would not save the
statute under our reasoning in Harper, if the State required voters to pay a tax or a fee to obtain a new photo
identification. But just as other States provide free voter registration cards, the photo identification cards issued
by Indiana's BMV [Bureau of Motor Vehicles] are also free. For most voters who need them, the inconvenience
904 | ACCESS TO THE BALLOT

of making a trip to the BMV, gathering the required documents, and posing for a photograph surely does not
qualify as a substantial burden on the right to vote, or even represent a significant increase over the usual bur-
dens of voting.

Both evidence in the record and facts of which we may take judicial notice, however, indicate that a somewhat
heavier burden may be placed on a limited number of persons. They include elderly persons born out of State,
who may have difficulty obtaining a birth certificate; persons who because of economic or other personal limita-
tions may find it difficult either to secure a copy of their birth certificate or to assemble the other required doc-
umentation to obtain a state-issued identification; homeless persons; and persons with a religious objection to
being photographed. If we assume, as the evidence suggests, that some members of these classes were registered
voters when SEA 483 was enacted, the new identification requirement may have imposed a special burden on
their right to vote.

The severity of that burden is, of course, mitigated by the fact that, if eligible, voters without photo identification
may cast provisional ballots that will ultimately be counted. To do so, however, they must travel to the circuit
court clerk's office within 10 days to execute the required affidavit. It is unlikely that such a requirement would
pose a constitutional problem unless it is wholly unjustified. And even assuming that the burden may not be
justified as to a few voters, that conclusion is by no means sufficient to establish petitioners' right to the relief
they seek in this litigation.

Given the fact that petitioners have advanced a broad attack on the constitutionality of SEA 483, seeking relief
that would invalidate the statute in all its applications, they bear a heavy burden of persuasion. ...

Petitioners ask this Court, in effect, to perform a unique balancing analysis that looks specifically at a small num-
ber of voters who may experience a special burden under the statute and weighs their burdens against the State's
broad interests in protecting election integrity. ... But on the basis of the evidence in the record it is not possi-
ble to quantify either the magnitude of the burden on this narrow class of voters or the portion of the burden
imposed on them that is fully justified.

First, the evidence in the record does not provide us with the number of registered voters without photo iden-
tification ... Much of the argument about the numbers of such voters comes from extrarecord, postjudgment
studies, the accuracy of which has not been tested in the trial court.

Further, the deposition evidence presented in the District Court does not provide any concrete evidence of the
burden imposed on voters who currently lack photo identification ...

The record says virtually nothing about the difficulties faced by either indigent voters or voters with religious
objections to being photographed. ... From this limited evidence we do not know the magnitude of the impact
SEA 483 will have on indigent voters in Indiana. ...

In sum, on the basis of the record that has been made in this litigation, we cannot conclude that the statute
imposes "excessively burdensome requirements" on any class of voters. ... When we consider only the statute's
                                                                                                               ACCESS TO THE BALLOT | 905

broad application to all Indiana voters we conclude that it "imposes only a limited burden on voters' rights."
Burdick (1992). The "`precise interests'" advanced by the State are therefore sufficient to defeat petitioners' facial
challenge to SEA 483. ...

In their briefs, petitioners stress the fact that all of the Republicans in the General Assembly voted in favor of
SEA 483 and the Democrats were unanimous in opposing it. ... It is fair to infer that partisan considerations may
have played a significant role in the decision to enact SEA 483. If such considerations had provided the only jus-
tification for a photo identification requirement, we may also assume that SEA 483 would suffer the same fate as
the poll tax at issue in Harper.

But if a nondiscriminatory law is supported by valid neutral justifications, those justifications should not be dis-
regarded simply because partisan interests may have provided one motivation for the votes of individual legisla-
tors. The state interests identified as justifications for SEA 483 are both neutral and sufficiently strong to require
us to reject petitioners' facial attack on the statute. The application of the statute to the vast majority of Indiana
voters is amply justified by the valid interest in protecting "the integrity and reliability of the electoral process."
Anderson v. Celebrezze (1983).

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

Justice SCALIA, with whom Justice THOMAS and Justice ALITO join, concurring in the judgment.

... To evaluate a law respecting the right to vote -- whether it governs voter qualifications, candidate selection,
or the voting process -- we use the approach set out in Burdick v. Takushi, (1992). This calls for application of
a deferential "important regulatory interests" standard for nonsevere, nondiscriminatory restrictions, reserving
strict scrutiny for laws that severely restrict the right to vote. ... Thus, the first step is to decide whether a chal-
lenged law severely burdens the right to vote. Ordinary and widespread burdens, such as those requiring "nom-
inal effort" of everyone, are not severe. Burdens are severe if they go beyond the merely inconvenient.

Of course, we have to identify a burden before we can weigh it. The Indiana law affects different voters dif-
ferently, but what petitioners view as the law's several light and heavy burdens are no more than the different
impacts of the single burden that the law uniformly imposes on all voters. To vote in person in Indiana, everyone
must have and present a photo identification that can be obtained for free. The State draws no classifications,
let alone discriminatory ones, except to establish optional absentee and provisional balloting for certain poor,
elderly, and institutionalized voters and for religious objectors. ...

The Indiana photo-identification law is a generally applicable, nondiscriminatory voting regulation, and our
precedents refute the view that individual impacts are relevant to determining the severity of the burden it
imposes.

...

The universally applicable requirements of Indiana's voter-identification law are eminently reasonable. The bur-
den of acquiring, possessing, and showing a free photo identification is simply not severe, because it does not
"even represent a significant increase over the usual burdens of voting." And the State's interests, are sufficient
906 | ACCESS TO THE BALLOT

to sustain that minimal burden. That should end the matter. That the State accommodates some voters by per-
mitting (not requiring) the casting of absentee or provisional ballots, is an indulgence -- not a constitutional
imperative that falls short of what is required.

Justice SOUTER, with whom Justice GINSBURG joins, dissenting.

Indiana's "Voter ID Law" threatens to impose nontrivial burdens on the voting right of tens of thousands of the
State's citizens and a significant percentage of those individuals are likely to be deterred from voting. The statute
is unconstitutional under the balancing standard of Burdick v. Takushi (1992): a State may not burden the right
to vote merely by invoking abstract interests, be they legitimate, or even compelling, but must make a particular,
factual showing that threats to its interests outweigh the particular impediments it has imposed. The State has
made no such justification here, and as to some aspects of its law, it has hardly even tried. ...

Under Burdick, "the rigorousness of our inquiry into the propriety of a state election law depends upon the
extent to which a challenged regulation burdens First and Fourteenth Amendment rights," Burdick v. Takushi
(1992), upon an assessment of the "`character and magnitude of the asserted [threatened] injury,'" and an esti-
mate of the number of voters likely to be affected.

The first set of burdens shown in these cases is the travel costs and fees necessary to get one of the limited variety
of federal or state photo identifications needed to cast a regular ballot under the Voter ID Law. The travel is
required for the personal visit to a license branch of the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV), which is
demanded of anyone applying for a driver's license or nondriver photo identification. See Indiana Democractic
Party v. Rokita (2006) The need to travel to a BMV branch will affect voters according to their circumstances,
with the average person probably viewing it as nothing more than an inconvenience. Poor, old, and disabled vot-
ers who do not drive a car, however, may find the trip prohibitive ...

The burden of traveling to a more distant BMV office rather than a conveniently located polling place is proba-
bly serious for many of the individuals who lack photo identification. They almost certainly will not own cars,
and public transportation in Indiana is fairly limited. ...

For those voters who can afford the round trip, a second financial hurdle appears: in order to get photo identifi-
cation for the first time, they need to present "a birth certificate, certificate of naturalization, U.S. veterans photo
identification, U.S. military photo identification, or a U.S. passport. ... So most voters must pay at least one fee
to get the ID necessary to cast a regular ballot. As with the travel costs, these fees are far from shocking on their
face, but in the Burdick analysis it matters that both the travel costs and the fees are disproportionately heavy for,
and thus disproportionately likely to deter, the poor, the old, and the immobile. ...

To be sure, Indiana has a provisional-ballot exception to the ID requirement for individuals the State considers
"indigent" as well as those with religious objections to being photographed, and this sort of exception could in
theory provide a way around the costs of procuring an ID. But Indiana's chosen exception does not amount to
much relief.
                                                                                                               ACCESS TO THE BALLOT | 907

The law allows these voters who lack the necessary ID to sign the pollbook and cast a provisional ballot. As the
lead opinion recognizes, though, that is only the first step; to have the provisional ballot counted, a voter must
then appear in person before the circuit court clerk or county election board within 10 days of the election, to
sign an affidavit attesting to indigency or religious objection to being photographed (or to present an ID at that
point). ... Forcing these people to travel to the county seat every time they try to vote is particularly onerous for
the reason noted already, that most counties in Indiana either lack public transportation or offer only limited
coverage. ...

Indiana's Voter ID Law thus threatens to impose serious burdens on the voting right, even if not "severe" ones,
and the next question under Burdick is whether the number of individuals likely to be affected is significant as
well. Record evidence and facts open to judicial notice answer yes.

... Tens of thousands of voting-age residents lack the necessary photo identification. A large proportion of them
are likely to be in bad shape economically. The Voter ID Law places hurdles in the way of either getting an ID
or of voting provisionally, and they translate into nontrivial economic costs. There is accordingly no reason to
doubt that a significant number of state residents will be discouraged or disabled from voting.

Because the lead opinion finds only "limited" burdens on the right to vote, it avoids a hard look at the State's
claimed interests. But having found the Voter ID Law burdens far from trivial, I have to make a rigorous assess-
ment of "`the precise interests put forward by the State as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule,' [and]
`the extent to which those interests make it necessary to burden the plaintiff's rights.'" ...

There is no denying the abstract importance, the compelling nature, of combating voter fraud. But it takes sev-
eral steps to get beyond the level of abstraction here.

To begin with, requiring a voter to show photo identification before casting a regular ballot addresses only one
form of voter fraud: in-person voter impersonation. The photo identification requirement leaves untouched the
problems of absentee-ballot fraud, which (unlike in-person voter impersonation) is a documented problem in
Indiana ...

And even the State's interest in deterring a voter from showing up at the polls and claiming to be someone he
is not must, in turn, be discounted for the fact that the State has not come across a single instance of in-person
voter impersonation fraud in all of Indiana's history. Neither the District Court nor the Indiana General Assem-
bly that passed the Voter ID Law was given any evidence whatsoever of in-person voter impersonation fraud in
the State ... [The absence of evidence] is also consistent with the dearth of evidence of in-person voter imperson-
ation in any other part of the country. ...

The antifraud rationale is open to skepticism on one further ground, what Burdick spoke of as an assessment of
the degree of necessity for the State's particular course of action. ... [T]he State has not even tried to justify its
decision to implement the photo identification requirement immediately on passage of the new law. A phase-in
period would have given the State time to distribute its newly designed licenses, and to make a genuine effort to
get them to individuals in need, and a period for transition is exactly what the Commission on Federal Election
Reform, headed by former President Carter and former Secretary of State Baker, recommended in its report. ...
908 | ACCESS TO THE BALLOT

Although Indiana claims to have adopted its ID requirement relying partly on the Carter-Baker Report, the
State conspicuously rejected the Carter-Baker Report's phase-in recommendation aimed at reducing the bur-
dens on the right to vote, and just as conspicuously fails even to try to explain why. ...

... The State's final justification, its interest in safeguarding voter confidence, similarly collapses. The problem
with claiming this interest lies in its connection to the bloated voter rolls; the State has come up with nothing to
suggest that its citizens doubt the integrity of the State's electoral process, except its own failure to maintain its
rolls. The answer to this problem is not to burden the right to vote, but to end the official negligence. ...

Without a shred of evidence that in-person voter impersonation is a problem in the State, much less a crisis,
Indiana has adopted one of the most restrictive photo identification requirements in the country. The State rec-
ognizes that tens of thousands of qualified voters lack the necessary federally issued or state-issued identification,
but it insists on implementing the requirement immediately, without allowing a transition period for targeted
efforts to distribute the required identification to individuals who need it. The State hardly even tries to explain
its decision to force indigents or religious objectors to travel all the way to their county seats every time they
wish to vote, and if there is any waning of confidence in the administration of elections it probably owes more to
the State's violation of federal election law than to any imposters at the polling places. It is impossible to say, on
this record, that the State's interest in adopting its signally inhibiting photo identification requirement has been
shown to outweigh the serious burdens it imposes on the right to vote.

If more were needed to condemn this law, our own precedent would provide it, for the calculation revealed in
the Indiana statute crosses a line when it targets the poor and the weak. If the Court's decision in Harper v. Vir­
ginia Bd. of Elections (1966), stands for anything, it is that being poor has nothing to do with being qualified to
vote. Harper made clear that "[t]o introduce wealth or payment of a fee as a measure of a voter's qualifications is
to introduce a capricious or irrelevant factor."

...

The Indiana Voter ID Law is thus unconstitutional: the state interests fail to justify the practical limitations
placed on the right to vote, and the law imposes an unreasonable and irrelevant burden on voters who are poor
and old. I would vacate the judgment of the Seventh Circuit, and remand for further proceedings.

Justice BREYER, dissenting.

Indiana's statute requires registered voters to present photo identification at the polls. It imposes a burden upon
some voters, but it does so in order to prevent fraud, to build confidence in the voting system, and thereby to
maintain the integrity of the voting process. In determining whether this statute violates the Federal Constitu-
tion, I would balance the voting-related interests that the statute affects, asking "whether the statute burdens
any one such interest in a manner out of proportion to the statute's salutary effects upon the others (perhaps,
but not necessarily, because of the existence of a clearly superior, less restrictive alternative)." Nixon v. Shrink
Missouri Government PAC (2000). Applying this standard, I believe the statute is unconstitutional because it
imposes a disproportionate burden upon those eligible voters who lack a driver's license or other statutorily valid
form of photo ID. ...

For one thing, an Indiana nondriver, most likely to be poor, elderly, or disabled, will find it difficult and expen-
sive to travel to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles, particularly if he or she resides in one of the many Indiana coun-
ties lacking a public transportation system. For another, many of these individuals may be uncertain about how
to obtain the underlying documentation, usually a passport or a birth certificate, upon which the statute insists.
And some may find the costs associated with these documents unduly burdensome (up to $12 for a copy of
a birth certificate; up to $100 for a passport). By way of comparison, this Court previously found unconstitu-
tionally burdensome a poll tax of $1.50 (less than $10 today, inflation adjusted). See Harper v. Virginia Bd. of
Elections (1966). Further, Indiana's exception for voters who cannot afford this cost imposes its own burden: a
postelection trip to the county clerk or county election board to sign an indigency affidavit after each election. ...

By way of contrast, two other States -- Florida and Georgia -- have put into practice photo ID requirements
significantly less restrictive than Indiana's. Under the Florida law, the range of permissible forms of photo ID is
substantially greater than in Indiana. Moreover, a Florida voter who lacks photo ID may cast a provisional ballot
at the polling place that will be counted if the State determines that his signature matches the one on his voter
registration form.

Georgia restricts voters to a more limited list of acceptable photo IDs than does Florida, but accepts in addition
to proof of voter registration a broader range of underlying documentation than does Indiana. ... While Indiana
allows only certain groups such as the elderly and disabled to vote by absentee ballot, in Georgia any voter may
vote absentee without providing any excuse, and (except where required by federal law) need not present a photo
ID in order to do so. Finally, neither Georgia nor Florida insists, as Indiana does, that indigent voters travel each
election cycle to potentially distant places for the purposes of signing an indigency affidavit.

The record nowhere provides a convincing reason why Indiana's photo ID requirement must impose greater
burdens than those of other States, or than the Carter-Baker Commission recommended nationwide. Nor is
there any reason to think that there are proportionately fewer such voters in Indiana than elsewhere in the coun-
try ...

... [W]hile the Constitution does not in general prohibit Indiana from enacting a photo ID requirement, this
statute imposes a disproportionate burden upon those without valid photo IDs. For these reasons, I dissent.

Rights

South Carolina v. Katzenbach

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.

... The Voting Rights Act was designed by Congress to banish the blight of racial discrimination in voting, which
has infected the electoral process in parts of our country for nearly a century. The Act creates stringent new
remedies for voting discrimination where it persists on a pervasive scale, and in addition the statute strengthens
existing remedies for pockets of voting discrimination elsewhere in the country. Congress assumed the power to
prescribe these remedies from § 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment, which authorizes the National Legislature to
effectuate by "appropriate" measures the constitutional prohibition against racial discrimination in voting. We
hold that the sections of the Act which are properly before us are an appropriate means for carrying out Con-
gress' constitutional responsibilities and are consonant with all other provisions of the Constitution. We there-
fore deny South Carolina's request that enforcement of these sections of the Act be enjoined.

The constitutional propriety of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 must be judged with reference to the historical
experience which it reflects. Before enacting the measure, Congress explored with great care the problem of racial
discrimination in voting. ...

Two points emerge vividly from the voluminous legislative history of the Act contained in the committee hear-
ings and floor debates. First: Congress felt itself confronted by an insidious and pervasive evil which had been
perpetuated in certain parts of our country through unremitting and ingenious defiance of the Constitution.
Second: Congress concluded that the unsuccessful remedies which it had prescribed in the past would have to be
replaced by sterner and more elaborate measures in order to satisfy the clear commands of the Fifteenth Amend-
ment. ...

In recent years, Congress has repeatedly tried to cope with the problem by facilitating case-by-case litigation
against voting discrimination. ...

Despite the earnest efforts of the Justice Department and of many federal judges, these new laws have done little
to cure the problem of voting discrimination. ... [R]egistration of voting-age Negroes in Alabama rose only from
                                                                                                              PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS | 911

14.2% to 19.4% between 1958 and 1964; in Louisiana it barely inched ahead from 31.7% to 31.8% between 1956
and 1965; and in Mississippi it increased only from 4.4% to 6.4% between 1954 and 1964. In each instance, reg-
istration of voting-age whites ran roughly 50 percentage points or more ahead of Negro registration.

The previous legislation has proved ineffective for a number of reasons. Voting suits are unusually onerous
to prepare, sometimes requiring as many as 6,000 man-hours spent combing through registration records in
preparation for trial. Litigation has been exceedingly slow, in part because of the ample opportunities for delay
afforded voting officials and others involved in the proceedings. Even when favorable decisions have finally been
obtained, some of the States affected have merely switched to discriminatory devices not covered by the federal
decrees or have enacted difficult new tests designed to prolong the existing disparity between white and Negro
registration. ...

During the hearings and debates on the Act, Selma, Alabama, was repeatedly referred to as the pre-eminent
example of the ineffectiveness of existing legislation. In Dallas County, of which Selma is the seat, there were
four years of litigation by the Justice Department and two findings by the federal courts of widespread voting
discrimination. Yet in those four years, Negro registration rose only from 156 to 383, although there are approx-
imately 15,000 Negroes of voting age in the county. Any possibility that these figures were attributable to polit-
ical apathy was dispelled by the protest demonstrations in Selma in the early months of 1965. ...

The Voting Rights Act of 1965 reflects Congress' firm intention to rid the country of racial discrimination in
voting. The heart of the Act is a complex scheme of stringent remedies aimed at areas where voting discrimina-
tion has been most flagrant. Section 4 (a)-(d) lays down a formula defining the States and political subdivisions
to which these new remedies apply. The first of the remedies, contained in § 4 (a), is the suspension of literacy
tests and similar voting qualifications for a period of five years from the last occurrence of substantial voting dis-
crimination. Section 5 prescribes a second remedy, the suspension of all new voting regulations pending review
by federal authorities to determine whether their use would perpetuate voting discrimination. The third rem-
edy, covered in §§ 6 (b), 7, 9, and 13 (a), is the assignment of federal examiners on certification by the Attorney
General to list qualified applicants who are thereafter entitled to vote in all elections. ...

... The remedial sections of the Act assailed by South Carolina automatically apply to any State, or to any separate
political subdivision such as a county or parish, for which two findings have been made: (1) the Attorney Gen-
eral has determined that on November 1, 1964, it maintained a "test or device," and (2) the Director of the Cen-
sus has determined that less than 50% of its voting-age residents were registered on November 1, 1964, or voted
in the presidential election of November 1964. ... As used throughout the Act, the phrase "test or device" means
any requirement that a registrant or voter must "(1) demonstrate the ability to read, write, understand, or inter-
pret any matter, (2) demonstrate any educational achievement or his knowledge of any particular subject, (3)
possess good moral character, or (4) prove his qualifications by the voucher of registered voters or members of
any other class."

... In a State or political subdivision covered by § 4 (b) of the Act, no person may be denied the right to vote
in any election because of his failure to comply with a voting qualification or procedure different from those in
force on November 1, 1964. This suspension of new rules is terminated, however, under either of the follow-
912 | PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS

ing circumstances: (1) if the area has submitted the rules to the Attorney General, and he has not interposed an
objection within 60 days, or (2) if the area has obtained a declaratory judgment from the District Court for the
District of Columbia, determining that the rules will not abridge the franchise on racial grounds. ...

These provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 are challenged on the fundamental ground that they exceed
the powers of Congress and encroach on an area reserved to the States by the Constitution. ...

The ground rules for resolving this question are clear. The language and purpose of the Fifteenth Amendment,
the prior decisions construing its several provisions, and the general doctrines of constitutional interpretation,
all point to one fundamental principle. As against the reserved powers of the States, Congress may use any ratio-
nal means to effectuate the constitutional prohibition of racial discrimination in voting ... We turn now to a
more detailed description of the standards which govern our review of the Act.

Section 1 of the Fifteenth Amendment declares that "[t]he right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not
be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of
servitude." This declaration has always been treated as self-executing and has repeatedly been construed, without
further legislative specification, to invalidate state voting qualifications or procedures which are discriminatory
on their face or in practice. ...

South Carolina contends that the cases cited above are precedents only for the authority of the judiciary to strike
down state statutes and procedures--that to allow an exercise of this authority by Congress would be to rob the
courts of their rightful constitutional role. On the contrary, § 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment expressly declares
that "Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation." By adding this authorization,
the Framers indicated that Congress was to be chiefly responsible for implementing the rights created in § 1. ...
Accordingly, in addition to the courts, Congress has full remedial powers to effectuate the constitutional prohi-
bition against racial discrimination in voting. ...

The basic test to be applied in a case involving § 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment is the same as in all cases con-
cerning the express powers of Congress with relation to the reserved powers of the States. Chief Justice Marshall
laid down the classic formulation, 50 years before the Fifteenth Amendment was ratified:

"Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate,
which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the con-
stitution, are constitutional." McCulloch v. Maryland (1819)

The Court has subsequently echoed his language in describing each of the Civil War Amendments:

"Whatever legislation is appropriate, that is, adapted to carry out the objects the amendments have in view, what-
ever tends to enforce submission to the prohibitions they contain, and to secure to all persons the enjoyment of
perfect equality of civil rights and the equal protection of the laws against State denial or invasion, if not prohib-
ited, is brought within the domain of congressional power." Ex parte Virginia (1879).
                                                                                                              PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS | 913

... We therefore reject South Carolina's argument that Congress may appropriately do no more than to forbid
violations of the Fifteenth Amendment in general terms-- that the task of fashioning specific remedies or of
applying them to particular localities must necessarily be left entirely to the courts. Congress is not circum-
scribed by any such artificial rules under § 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment. ...

Congress exercised its authority under the Fifteenth Amendment in an inventive manner when it enacted the
Voting Rights Act of 1965. First: The measure prescribes remedies for voting discrimination which go into effect
without any need for prior adjudication. This was clearly a legitimate response to the problem, for which there
is ample precedent under other constitutional provisions. See Katzenbach v McClung (1964); United States v.
Darby (1941). Congress had found that case-by-case litigation was inadequate to combat widespread and per-
sistent discrimination in voting, because of the inordinate amount of time and energy required to overcome
the obstructionist tactics invariably encountered in these lawsuits. After enduring nearly a century of systematic
resistance to the Fifteenth Amendment, Congress might well decide to shift the advantage of time and inertia
from the perpetrators of the evil to its victims. ...

Second: The Act intentionally confines these remedies to a small number of States and political subdivisions
which in most instances were familiar to Congress by name. This, too, was a permissible method of dealing with
the problem. Congress had learned that substantial voting discrimination presently occurs in certain sections of
the country, and it knew no way of accurately forecasting whether the evil might spread elsewhere in the future.
In acceptable legislative fashion, Congress chose to limit its attention to the geographic areas where immediate
action seemed necessary. See McGowan v. Maryland (1961); Salsburg v. Maryland (1954). The doctrine of the
equality of States, invoked by South Carolina, does not bar this approach, for that doctrine applies only to the
terms upon which States are admitted to the Union, and not to the remedies for local evils which have subse-
quently appeared. See Coyle v. Smith (1911)

Coverage formula.

We now consider the related question of whether the specific States and political subdivisions within § 4 (b) of
the Act were an appropriate target for the new remedies. ... Congress began work with reliable evidence of actual
voting discrimination in a great majority of the States and political subdivisions affected by the new remedies of
the Act. The formula eventually evolved to describe these areas was relevant to the problem of voting discrimi-
nation, and Congress was therefore entitled to infer a significant danger of the evil in the few remaining States
and political subdivisions covered by § 4 (b) of the Act. No more was required to justify the application to these
areas of Congress' express powers under the Fifteenth Amendment. ...

Review of new rules.

The Act suspends new voting regulations pending scrutiny by federal authorities to determine whether their use
would violate the Fifteenth Amendment. This may have been an uncommon exercise of congressional power, as
South Carolina contends, but the Court has recognized that exceptional conditions can justify legislative mea-
sures not otherwise appropriate. See Home Bldg. & Loan Assn. V. Blaisdell(1934); Wilson v. New (1917). Con-
gress knew that some of the States covered by § 4 (b) of the Act had resorted to the extraordinary stratagem of
contriving new rules of various kinds for the sole purpose of perpetuating voting discrimination in the face of
914 | PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS

adverse federal court decrees. Congress had reason to suppose that these States might try similar maneuvers in
the future in order to evade the remedies for voting discrimination contained in the Act itself. Under the com-
pulsion of these unique circumstances, Congress responded in a permissibly decisive manner. ...

After enduring nearly a century of widespread resistance to the Fifteenth Amendment, Congress has marshalled
an array of potent weapons against the evil, with authority in the Attorney General to employ them effectively.
Many of the areas directly affected by this development have indicated their willingness to abide by any restraints
legitimately imposed upon them. We here hold that the portions of the Voting Rights Act properly before us are
a valid means for carrying out the commands of the Fifteenth Amendment. Hopefully, millions of non-white
Americans will not be able to participate for the first time on an equal basis in the government under which they
live. We may finally look forward to the day when truly "[t]he right of citizens of the United States to vote shall
not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition
of servitude."

The bill of complaint is

Dismissed.

MR. JUSTICE BLACK, concurring and dissenting.

Though, as I have said, I agree with most of the Court's conclusions, I dissent from its holding that every part
of § 5 of the Act is constitutional. Section 4 (a), to which § 5 is linked, suspends for five years all literacy tests
and similar devices in those States coming within the formula of § 4 (b). Section 5 goes on to provide that a State
covered by § 4 (b) can in no way amend its constitution or laws relating to voting without first trying to persuade
the Attorney General of the United States or the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia that the
new proposed laws do not have the purpose and will not have the effect of denying the right to vote to citizens
on account of their race or color.

... Section 5, by providing that some of the States cannot pass state laws or adopt state constitutional amend-
ments without first being compelled to beg federal authorities to approve their policies, so distorts our con-
stitutional structure of government as to render any distinction drawn in the Constitution between state and
federal power almost meaningless. One of the most basic premises upon which our structure of government was
founded was that the Federal Government was to have certain specific and limited powers and no others, and all
other power was to be reserved either "to the States respectively, or to the people." Certainly if all the provisions
of our Constitution which limit the power of the Federal Government and reserve other power to the States are
to mean anything, they mean at least that the States have power to pass laws and amend their constitutions with-
out first sending their officials hundreds of miles away to beg federal authorities to approve them. Moreover, it
seems to me that § 5 which gives federal officials power to veto state laws they do not like is in direct conflict with
the clear command of our Constitution that "The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a
Republican Form of Government." I cannot help but believe that the inevitable effect of any such law which
forces any one of the States to entreat federal authorities in far-away places for approval of local laws before they
can become effective is to create the impression that the State or States treated in this way are little more than
conquered provinces. And if one law concerning voting can make the States plead for this approval by a distant
§                                                                                                             PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS | 915

federal court or the United States Attorney General, other laws on different subjects can force the States to seek
the advance approval not only of the Attorney General but of the President himself or any other chosen mem-
bers of his staff. It is inconceivable to me that such a radical degradation of state power was intended in any of
the provisions of our Constitution or its Amendments. Of course I do not mean to cast any doubt whatever
upon the indisputable power of the Federal Government to invalidate a state law once enacted and operative
on the ground that it intrudes into the area of supreme federal power. But the Federal Government has hereto-
fore always been content to exercise this power to protect federal supremacy by authorizing its agents to bring
lawsuits against state officials once an operative state law has created an actual case and controversy. A federal
law which assumes the power to compel the States to submit in advance any proposed legislation they have for
approval by federal agents approaches dangerously near to wiping the States out as useful and effective units in
the government of our country. I cannot agree to any constitutional interpretation that leads inevitably to such
a result.

... In this and other prior Acts Congress has quite properly vested the Attorney General with extremely broad
power to protect voting rights of citizens against discrimination on account of race or color. Section 5 viewed in
this context is of very minor importance and in my judgment is likely to serve more as an irritant to the States
than as an aid to the enforcement of the Act. I would hold § 5 invalid for the reasons stated above with full con-
fidence that the Attorney General has ample power to give vigorous, expeditious and effective protection to the
voting rights of all citizens.

    Concurrence: Thomas

Chief Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.

The Voting Rights Act of 1965 employed extraordinary measures to address an extraordinary problem. Section
5 of the Act required States to obtain federal permission before enacting any law related to voting -- a drastic
departure from basic principles of federalism. And § 4 of the Act applied that requirement only to some States
-- an equally dramatic departure from the principle that all States enjoy equal sovereignty. This was strong medi-
cine, but Congress determined it was needed to address entrenched racial discrimination in voting, "an insidious
and pervasive evil which had been perpetuated in certain parts of our country through unremitting and inge-
916 | PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS

nious defiance of the Constitution." South Carolina v. Katzenbach (1966). As we explained in upholding the
law, "exceptional conditions can justify legislative measures not otherwise appropriate." Reflecting the unprece-
dented nature of these measures, they were scheduled to expire after five years.

Nearly 50 years later, they are still in effect; indeed, they have been made more stringent, and are now scheduled
to last until 2031. There is no denying, however, that the conditions that originally justified these measures
no longer characterize voting in the covered jurisdictions. By 2009, "the racial gap in voter registration and
turnout [was] lower in the States originally covered by § 5 than it [was] nationwide." Northwest Austin Munic­
ipal Util. Dist. No. One v. Holder (2009). Since that time, Census Bureau data indicate that African-American
voter turnout has come to exceed white voter turnout in five of the six States originally covered by § 5, with a gap
in the sixth State of less than one half of one percent.

At the same time, voting discrimination still exists; no one doubts that. The question is whether the Act's extra-
ordinary measures, including its disparate treatment of the States, continue to satisfy constitutional require-
ments. ...

In Northwest Austin (2009), we stated that "the Act imposes current burdens and must be justified by current
needs.". And we concluded that "a departure from the fundamental principle of equal sovereignty requires a
showing that a statute's disparate geographic coverage is sufficiently related to the problem that it targets." These
basic principles guide our review of the question before us.

The Constitution and laws of the United States are "the supreme Law of the Land." State legislation may not
contravene federal law. The Federal Government does not, however, have a general right to review and veto state
enactments before they go into effect. A proposal to grant such authority to "negative" state laws was considered
at the Constitutional Convention, but rejected in favor of allowing state laws to take effect, subject to later chal-
lenge under the Supremacy Clause.

Outside the strictures of the Supremacy Clause, States retain broad autonomy in structuring their governments
and pursuing legislative objectives. Indeed, the Constitution provides that all powers not specifically granted to
the Federal Government are reserved to the States or citizens. This "allocation of powers in our federal system
preserves the integrity, dignity, and residual sovereignty of the States." Bond v. United States (2011). But the fed-
eral balance "is not just an end in itself: Rather, federalism secures to citizens the liberties that derive from the
diffusion of sovereign power." ...

Not only do States retain sovereignty under the Constitution, there is also a "fundamental principle of equal
sovereignty" among the States. Over a hundred years ago, this Court explained that our Nation "was and is a
union of States, equal in power, dignity and authority." Coyle v. Smith, 221 U.S. (1911). Indeed, "the constitu-
tional equality of the States is essential to the harmonious operation of the scheme upon which the Republic
was organized." Coyle concerned the admission of new States, and Katzenbach rejected the notion that the prin-
ciple operated as a bar on differential treatment outside that context. South Carolina v. Katzenbach (1966). At
the same time, as we made clear in Northwest Austin, the fundamental principle of equal sovereignty remains
highly pertinent in assessing subsequent disparate treatment of States.
                                                                                                              PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS | 917

The Voting Rights Act sharply departs from these basic principles. It suspends "all changes to state election law
-- however innocuous -- until they have been precleared by federal authorities in Washington, D.C." States
must beseech the Federal Government for permission to implement laws that they would otherwise have the
right to enact and execute on their own, subject of course to any injunction in a § 2 action. The Attorney Gen-
eral has 60 days to object to a preclearance request, longer if he requests more information. If a State seeks pre-
clearance from a three-judge court, the process can take years.

And despite the tradition of equal sovereignty, the Act applies to only nine States (and several additional coun-
ties). While one State waits months or years and expends funds to implement a validly enacted law, its neighbor
can typically put the same law into effect immediately, through the normal legislative process. Even if a noncov-
ered jurisdiction is sued, there are important differences between those proceedings and preclearance proceed-
ings; the preclearance proceeding "not only switches the burden of proof to the supplicant jurisdiction, but also
applies substantive standards quite different from those governing the rest of the nation." ...

In 1966, we found these departures from the basic features of our system of government justified. The "blight
of racial discrimination in voting" had "infected the electoral process in parts of our country for nearly a cen-
tury." Katzenbach (1966). Several States had enacted a variety of requirements and tests "specifically designed to
prevent" African-Americans from voting. Case-by-case litigation had proved inadequate to prevent such racial
discrimination in voting, in part because States "merely switched to discriminatory devices not covered by the
federal decrees," "enacted difficult new tests," or simply "defied and evaded court orders." Shortly before enact-
ment of the Voting Rights Act, only 19.4 percent of African-Americans of voting age were registered to vote
in Alabama, only 31.8 percent in Louisiana, and only 6.4 percent in Mississippi. Those figures were roughly 50
percentage points or more below the figures for whites. ...

At the time, the coverage formula -- the means of linking the exercise of the unprecedented authority with the
problem that warranted it -- made sense. ... It accurately reflected those jurisdictions uniquely characterized by
voting discrimination "on a pervasive scale," linking coverage to the devices used to effectuate discrimination
and to the resulting disenfranchisement. The formula ensured that the "stringent remedies [were] aimed at areas
where voting discrimination ha[d] been most flagrant."

Nearly 50 years later, things have changed dramatically. Shelby County contends that the preclearance require-
ment, even without regard to its disparate coverage, is now unconstitutional. Its arguments have a good deal of
force. In the covered jurisdictions, "[v]oter turnout and registration rates now approach parity. Blatantly dis-
criminatory evasions of federal decrees are rare. And minority candidates hold office at unprecedented levels."
Northwest Austin (2009). The tests and devices that blocked access to the ballot have been forbidden nationwide
for over 40 years.

Those conclusions are not ours alone. Congress said the same when it reauthorized the Act in 2006, writing
that "[s]ignificant progress has been made in eliminating first generation barriers experienced by minority voters,
including increased numbers of registered minority voters, minority voter turnout, and minority representa-
tion in Congress, State legislatures, and local elected offices." The House Report elaborated that "the number
of African-Americans who are registered and who turn out to cast ballots has increased significantly over the
918 | PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS

last 40 years, particularly since 1982," and noted that "[i]n some circumstances, minorities register to vote and
cast ballots at levels that surpass those of white voters." That Report also explained that there have been "signif-
icant increases in the number of African-Americans serving in elected offices"; more specifically, there has been
approximately a 1,000 percent increase since 1965 in the number of African-American elected officials in the six
States originally covered by the Voting Rights Act.

... The following chart, compiled from the Senate and House Reports, compares voter registration numbers
from 1965 to those from 2004 in the six originally covered States. These are the numbers that were before Con-
gress when it reauthorized the Act in 2006:

Virginia        61.1  38.3   22.8 68.2  57.4  10.8

... There is no doubt that these improvements are in large part because of the Voting Rights Act. The Act has
proved immensely successful at redressing racial discrimination and integrating the voting process. ... Problems
remain in these States and others, but there is no denying that, due to the Voting Rights Act, our Nation has
made great strides.

Yet the Act has not eased the restrictions in § 5 or narrowed the scope of the coverage formula in § 4(b) along the
way. Those extraordinary and unprecedented features were reauthorized -- as if nothing had changed. In fact,
the Act's unusual remedies have grown even stronger. ...

Respondents do not deny that there have been improvements on the ground, but argue that much of this can be
attributed to the deterrent effect of § 5, which dissuades covered jurisdictions from engaging in discrimination
that they would resume should § 5 be struck down. Under this theory, however, § 5 would be effectively immune
from scrutiny; no matter how "clean" the record of covered jurisdictions, the argument could always be made
that it was deterrence that accounted for the good behavior.

The provisions of § 5 apply only to those jurisdictions singled out by § 4. We now consider whether that coverage
formula is constitutional s of current conditions.
                                                                                                              PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS | 919

When upholding the constitutionality of the coverage formula in 1966, we concluded that it was "rational in
both practice and theory." Katzenbach (1966). The formula looked to cause (discriminatory tests) and effect
(low voter registration and turnout), and tailored the remedy (preclearance) to those jurisdictions exhibiting
both.

By 2009, however, we concluded that the "coverage formula raise[d] serious constitutional questions." North­
west Austin (2009). As we explained, a statute's "current burdens" must be justified by "current needs," and any
"disparate geographic coverage" must be "sufficiently related to the problem that it targets." The coverage for-
mula met that test in 1965, but no longer does so.

Coverage today is based on decades-old data and eradicated practices. The formula captures States by reference
to literacy tests and low voter registration and turnout in the 1960s and early 1970s ... Racial disparity in those
numbers was compelling evidence justifying the preclearance remedy and the coverage formula. See Katzenbach
(1966). There is no longer such a disparity.

In 1965, the States could be divided into two groups: those with a recent history of voting tests and low voter
registration and turnout, and those without those characteristics. Congress based its coverage formula on that
distinction. Today the Nation is no longer divided along those lines, yet the Voting Rights Act continues to treat
it as if it were.

... The Government falls back to the argument that because the formula was relevant in 1965, its continued use
is permissible so long as any discrimination remains in the States Congress identified back then -- regardless
of how that discrimination compares to discrimination in States unburdened by coverage. This argument does
not look to "current political conditions," but instead relies on a comparison between the States in 1965. That
comparison reflected the different histories of the North and South. It was in the South that slavery was upheld
by law until uprooted by the Civil War, that the reign of Jim Crow denied African-Americans the most basic
freedoms, and that state and local governments worked tirelessly to disenfranchise citizens on the basis of race.
The Court invoked that history -- rightly so -- in sustaining the disparate coverage of the Voting Rights Act in
1966. See Katzenbach (1966).

But history did not end in 1965. By the time the Act was reauthorized in 2006, there had been 40 more years
of it. In assessing the "current need[]" for a preclearance system that treats States differently from one another
today, that history cannot be ignored. During that time, largely because of the Voting Rights Act, voting tests
were abolished, disparities in voter registration and turnout due to race were erased, and African-Americans
attained political office in record numbers. And yet the coverage formula that Congress reauthorized in 2006
ignores these developments, keeping the focus on decades-old data relevant to decades-old problems, rather than
current data reflecting current needs. ...

In defending the coverage formula, the Government, the intervenors, and the dissent also rely heavily on data
from the record that they claim justify disparate coverage. ... Regardless of how to look at the record, however,
no one can fairly say that it shows anything approaching the "pervasive," "flagrant," "widespread," and "ram-
pant" discrimination that faced Congress in 1965, and that clearly distinguished the covered jurisdictions from
the rest of the Nation at that time.
920 | PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS

But a more fundamental problem remains: Congress did not use the record it compiled to shape a coverage for-
mula grounded in current conditions. It instead reenacted a formula based on 40-year-old facts having no logical
relation to the present day. The dissent relies on "second-generation barriers," which are not impediments to the
casting of ballots, but rather electoral arrangements that affect the weight of minority votes. That does not cure
the problem. Viewing the preclearance requirements as targeting such efforts simply highlights the irrational-
ity of continued reliance on the § 4 coverage formula, which is based on voting tests and access to the ballot,
not vote dilution. We cannot pretend that we are reviewing an updated statute, or try our hand at updating the
statute ourselves, based on the new record compiled by Congress. Contrary to the dissent's contention, we are
not ignoring the record; we are simply recognizing that it played no role in shaping the statutory formula before
us today.

... There is no valid reason to insulate the coverage formula from review merely because it was previously enacted
40 years ago. If Congress had started from scratch in 2006, it plainly could not have enacted the present coverage
formula. It would have been irrational for Congress to distinguish between States in such a fundamental way
based on 40-year-old data, when today's statistics tell an entirely different story. And it would have been irra-
tional to base coverage on the use of voting tests 40 years ago, when such tests have been illegal since that time.
But that is exactly what Congress has done.

* * *

Striking down an Act of Congress "is the gravest and most delicate duty that this Court is called on to perform."
Blodgett v. Holden (1927). We do not do so lightly. That is why, in 2009, we took care to avoid ruling on the
constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act when asked to do so, and instead resolved the case then before us on
statutory grounds. But in issuing that decision, we expressed our broader concerns about the constitutionality
of the Act. Congress could have updated the coverage formula at that time, but did not do so. Its failure to act
leaves us today with no choice but to declare § 4(b) unconstitutional. The formula in that section can no longer
be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to preclearance. ...

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.

It is so ordered.

Justice GINSBURG, with whom Justice BREYER, Justice SOTOMAYOR, and Justice KAGAN join, dissent-
ing.

In the Court's view, the very success of § 5 of the Voting Rights Act demands its dormancy. Congress was of
another mind. Recognizing that large progress has been made, Congress determined, based on a voluminous
record, that the scourge of discrimination was not yet extirpated. The question this case presents is who decides
whether, as currently operative, § 5 remains justifiable, this Court, or a Congress charged with the obligation
to enforce the post-Civil War Amendments "by appropriate legislation." With overwhelming support in both
Houses, Congress concluded that, for two prime reasons, § 5 should continue in force, unabated. First, con-
                                                                                                              PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS | 921

tinuance would facilitate completion of the impressive gains thus far made; and second, continuance would
guard against backsliding. Those assessments were well within Congress' province to make and should elicit this
Court's unstinting approbation.

"[V]oting discrimination still exists; no one doubts that." But the Court today terminates the remedy that
proved to be best suited to block that discrimination. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA) has worked to
combat voting discrimination where other remedies had been tried and failed. Particularly effective is the VRA's
requirement of federal preclearance for all changes to voting laws in the regions of the country with the most
aggravated records of rank discrimination against minority voting rights. ...

Although the VRA wrought dramatic changes in the realization of minority voting rights, the Act, to date,
surely has not eliminated all vestiges of discrimination against the exercise of the franchise by minority citizens.
Jurisdictions covered by the preclearance requirement continued to submit, in large numbers, proposed changes
to voting laws that the Attorney General declined to approve, auguring that barriers to minority voting would
quickly resurface were the preclearance remedy eliminated. City of Rome v. United States (1980). Congress also
found that as "registration and voting of minority citizens increas[ed], other measures may be resorted to which
would dilute increasing minority voting strength." See also Shaw v. Reno (1993). Efforts to reduce the impact of
minority votes, in contrast to direct attempts to block access to the ballot, are aptly described as "second-genera-
tion barriers" to minority voting.

Second-generation barriers come in various forms. One of the blockages is racial gerrymandering, the redrawing
of legislative districts in an "effort to segregate the races for purposes of voting." Another is adoption of a system
of at-large voting in lieu of district-by-district voting in a city with a sizable black minority. By switching to at-
large voting, the overall majority could control the election of each city council member, effectively eliminat-
ing the potency of the minority's votes. A similar effect could be achieved if the city engaged in discriminatory
annexation by incorporating majority-white areas into city limits, thereby decreasing the effect of VRA-occa-
sioned increases in black voting. Whatever the device employed, this Court has long recognized that vote dilu-
tion, when adopted with a discriminatory purpose, cuts down the right to vote as certainly as denial of access to
the ballot. ...

After considering the full legislative record, Congress made the following findings: The VRA has directly caused
significant progress in eliminating first-generation barriers to ballot access, leading to a marked increase in minor-
ity voter registration and turnout and the number of minority elected officials. But despite this progress, "sec-
ond generation barriers constructed to prevent minority voters from fully participating in the electoral process"
continued to exist, as well as racially polarized voting in the covered jurisdictions, which increased the political
vulnerability of racial and language minorities in those jurisdictions. Extensive "[e]vidence of continued discrim-
ination," Congress concluded, "clearly show[ed] the continued need for Federal oversight" in covered jurisdic-
tions. The overall record demonstrated to the federal lawmakers that, "without the continuation of the Voting
Rights Act of 1965 protections, racial and language minority citizens will be deprived of the opportunity to
exercise their right to vote, or will have their votes diluted, undermining the significant gains made by minorities
in the last 40 years."
922 | PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS

Based on these findings, Congress reauthorized preclearance for another 25 years, while also undertaking to
reconsider the extension after 15 years to ensure that the provision was still necessary and effective. The question
before the Court is whether Congress had the authority under the Constitution to act as it did.

In answering this question, the Court does not write on a clean slate. It is well established that Congress' judg-
ment regarding exercise of its power to enforce the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments warrants substantial
deference. The VRA addresses the combination of race discrimination and the right to vote, which is "preserva-
tive of all rights." Yick Wo v. Hopkins (1886). When confronting the most constitutionally invidious form of dis-
crimination, and the most fundamental right in our democratic system, Congress' power to act is at its height.

The basis for this deference is firmly rooted in both constitutional text and precedent. The Fifteenth Amend-
ment, which targets precisely and only racial discrimination in voting rights, states that, in this domain, "Con-
gress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation." In choosing this language, the
Amendment's framers invoked Chief Justice Marshall's formulation of the scope of Congress' powers under the
Necessary and Proper Clause:

"Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate,
which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the con-
stitution, are constitutional." McCulloch v. Maryland (1819) (emphasis added).

It cannot tenably be maintained that the VRA, an Act of Congress adopted to shield the right to vote from
racial discrimination, is inconsistent with the letter or spirit of the Fifteenth Amendment, or any provision of the
Constitution read in light of the Civil War Amendments. Nowhere in today's opinion, or in Northwest Austin,
is there clear recognition of the transformative effect the Fifteenth Amendment aimed to achieve.

... [T]he Constitution vests broad power in Congress to protect the right to vote, and in particular to combat
racial discrimination in voting. This Court has repeatedly reaffirmed Congress' prerogative to use any rational
means in exercise of its power in this area. And both precedent and logic dictate that the rational-means test
should be easier to satisfy, and the burden on the statute's challenger should be higher, when what is at issue is
the reauthorization of a remedy that the Court has previously affirmed, and that Congress found, from contem-
porary evidence, to be working to advance the legislature's legitimate objective.

The 2006 reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act fully satisfies the standard stated in McCulloch (1819): Con-
gress may choose any means "appropriate" and "plainly adapted to" a legitimate constitutional end. As we shall
see, it is implausible to suggest otherwise. ...

Congress approached the 2006 reauthorization of the VRA with great care and seriousness. The same cannot be
said of the Court's opinion today. The Court makes no genuine attempt to engage with the massive legislative
record that Congress assembled. Instead, it relies on increases in voter registration and turnout as if that were
the whole story. Without even identifying a standard of review, the Court dismissively brushes off arguments
based on "data from the record," and declines to enter the "debat[e about] what [the] record shows." One would
expect more from an opinion striking at the heart of the Nation's signal piece of civil-rights legislation.
                                                                                                              PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS | 923

I note the most disturbing lapses. First, by what right, given its usual restraint, does the Court even address
Shelby County's facial challenge to the VRA? Second, the Court veers away from controlling precedent regard-
ing the "equal sovereignty" doctrine without even acknowledging that it is doing so. Third, hardly showing the
respect ordinarily paid when Congress acts to implement the Civil War Amendments, and as just stressed, the
Court does not even deign to grapple with the legislative record. ...

The Court stops any application of § 5 by holding that § 4(b)'s coverage formula is unconstitutional. It pins this
result, in large measure, to "the fundamental principle of equal sovereignty." In Katzenbach, however, the Court
held, in no uncertain terms, that the principle "applies only to the terms upon which States are admitted to the
Union, and not to the remedies for local evils which have subsequently appeared." Katzenbach (1966)(emphasis
added).

Katzenbach, the Court acknowledges, "rejected the notion that the [equal sovereignty] principle operate[s] as a
bar on differential treatment outside [the] context [of the admission of new States]." But the Court clouds that
once clear understanding by citing dictum from Northwest Austin to convey that the principle of equal sover-
eignty "remains highly pertinent in assessing subsequent disparate treatment of States." If the Court is suggest-
ing that dictum in Northwest Austin silently overruled Katzenbach`s limitation of the equal sovereignty doctrine
to "the admission of new States," the suggestion is untenable. Northwest Austin cited Katzenbach`s holding in
the course of declining to decide whether the VRA was constitutional or even what standard of review applied
to the question. Northwest Austin (2009). In today's decision, the Court ratchets up what was pure dictum in
Northwest Austin, attributing breadth to the equal sovereignty principle in flat contradiction of Katzenbach. The
Court does so with nary an explanation of why it finds Katzenbach wrong, let alone any discussion of whether
stare decisis nonetheless counsels adherence to Katzenbach`s ruling on the limited "significance" of the equal sov-
ereignty principle.

... In the Court's conception, it appears, defenders of the VRA could not prevail upon showing what the record
overwhelmingly bears out, i.e., that there is a need for continuing the preclearance regime in covered States. In
addition, the defenders would have to disprove the existence of a comparable need elsewhere. I am aware of no
precedent for imposing such a double burden on defenders of legislation.

The Court has time and again declined to upset legislation of this genre unless there was no or almost no evi-
dence of unconstitutional action by States. No such claim can be made about the congressional record for the
2006 VRA reauthorization. Given a record replete with examples of denial or abridgment of a paramount fed-
eral right, the Court should have left the matter where it belongs: in Congress' bailiwick.

Instead, the Court strikes § 4(b)'s coverage provision because, in its view, the provision is not based on "current
conditions." It discounts, however, that one such condition was the preclearance remedy in place in the covered
jurisdictions, a remedy Congress designed both to catch discrimination before it causes harm, and to guard
against return to old ways. Volumes of evidence supported Congress' determination that the prospect of retro-
gression was real. Throwing out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discrimina-
tory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.
924 | PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS

But, the Court insists, the coverage formula is no good; it is based on "decades-old data and eradicated practices."
Even if the legislative record shows, as engaging with it would reveal, that the formula accurately identifies the
jurisdictions with the worst conditions of voting discrimination, that is of no moment, as the Court sees it. Con-
gress, the Court decrees, must "star[t] from scratch." I do not see why that should be so. ...

The sad irony of today's decision lies in its utter failure to grasp why the VRA has proven effective. The Court
appears to believe that the VRA's success in eliminating the specific devices extant in 1965 means that preclear-
ance is no longer needed. With that belief, and the argument derived from it, history repeats itself. The same
assumption -- that the problem could be solved when particular methods of voting discrimination are identi-
fied and eliminated -- was indulged and proved wrong repeatedly prior to the VRA's enactment. Unlike prior
statutes, which singled out particular tests or devices, the VRA is grounded in Congress' recognition of the
"variety and persistence" of measures designed to impair minority voting rights. Katzenbach (1966). In truth,
the evolution of voting discrimination into more subtle second-generation barriers is powerful evidence that a
remedy as effective as preclearance remains vital to protect minority voting rights and prevent backsliding.

Beyond question, the VRA is no ordinary legislation. It is extraordinary because Congress embarked on a mis-
sion long delayed and of extraordinary importance: to realize the purpose and promise of the Fifteenth Amend-
ment. For a half century, a concerted effort has been made to end racial discrimination in voting. Thanks to the
Voting Rights Act, progress once the subject of a dream has been achieved and continues to be made.

The record supporting the 2006 reauthorization of the VRA is also extraordinary. It was described by the Chair-
man of the House Judiciary Committee as "one of the most extensive considerations of any piece of legislation
that the United States Congress has dealt with in the 27 & half; years" he had served in the House. After exhaus-
tive evidence-gathering and deliberative process, Congress reauthorized the VRA, including the coverage pro-
vision, with overwhelming bipartisan support. It was the judgment of Congress that "40 years has not been a
sufficient amount of time to eliminate the vestiges of discrimination following nearly 100 years of disregard for
the dictates of the 15th amendment and to ensure that the right of all citizens to vote is protected as guaranteed
by the Constitution." That determination of the body empowered to enforce the Civil War Amendments "by
appropriate legislation" merits this Court's utmost respect. In my judgment, the Court errs egregiously by over-
riding Congress' decision.

For the reasons stated, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee

594 U.S. ___ (2021)

    Vote: 6-3
    Decision: Reversed
    Majority: Alito, joined by Thomas, Kavanaugh, Barrett, Roberts, and Gorsuch
    Dissent: Kagan, joined by Sotomayor, and Breyer

JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.

In these cases, we are called upon for the first time to apply §2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to regulations
that govern how ballots are collected and counted. Arizona law generally makes it very easy to vote. All voters
may vote by mail or in person for nearly a month before election day, but Arizona imposes two restrictions that
are claimed to be unlawful. First, in some counties, voters who choose to cast a ballot in person on election day
must vote in their own precincts or else their ballots will not be counted. Second, mail-in ballots cannot be col-
lected by anyone other than an election official, a mail carrier, or a voter's family member, household member,
or caregiver.

...

Congress enacted the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965, 79 Stat. 437, as amended, 52 U. S. C. §10301 et seq.,
in an effort to achieve at long last what the Fifteenth Amendment had sought to bring about 95 years earlier: an
end to the denial of the right to vote based on race. Ratified in 1870, the Fifteenth Amendment provides in §1
that "[t]he right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or
by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude." Section 2 of the Amendment then
grants Congress the "power to enforce [the Amendment] by appropriate legislation."

Despite the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment, the right of African-Americans to vote was heavily sup-
pressed for nearly a century. States employed a variety of notorious methods, including poll taxes, literacy tests,
property qualifications, "`white primar[ies],'" and "`grandfather clause[s].'"1 Challenges to some blatant efforts
reached this Court and were held to violate the Fifteenth Amendment ...

Unlike other provisions of the VRA, §2 attracted relatively little attention during the congressional debates and
was "little-used" for more than a decade after its passage. But during the same period, this Court considered sev-
eral cases involving "vote-dilution" claims asserted under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amend-
ment ...

What is now §2(b) was added, and that provision sets out what must be shown to prove a §2 violation. It requires
consideration of "the totality of circumstances" in each case and demands proof that "the political processes
leading to nomination or election in the State or political subdivision are not equally open to participation" by
members of a protected class "in that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to
participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice." ...
926 | PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS

This Court first construed the amended §2 in Thornburg v. Gingles (1986)--another vote-dilution case. Justice
Brennan's opinion for the Court set out three threshold requirements for proving a §2 vote-dilution claim
..."The essence of a §2 claim," the Court said, "is that a certain electoral law, practice, or structure interacts with
social and historical conditions to cause an inequality in the opportunities" of minority and non-minority voters
to elect their preferred representatives. Id., at 47.

...

The present dispute concerns two features of Arizona voting law, which generally makes it quite easy for resi-
dents to vote. All Arizonans may vote by mail for 27 days before an election using an "early ballot." ... No special
excuse is needed ... and any voter may ask to be sent an early ballot automatically in future elections, §16-544(A)
(2015). In addition, during the 27 days before an election, Arizonans may vote in person at an early voting loca-
tion in each county ... And they may also vote in person on election day ...

Each county is free to conduct election-day voting either by using the traditional precinct model or by setting
up "voting centers." Voting centers are equipped to provide all voters in a county with the appropriate ballot for
the precinct in which they are registered ...

... Voters who choose to vote in person on election day in a county that uses the precinct system must vote in
their assigned precinct ... If a voter goes to the wrong polling place, poll workers are trained to direct the voter to
the right location. If a voter finds that his or her name does not appear on the register at what the voter believes is
the right precinct, the voter ordinarily may cast a provisional ballot. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §16-584 (Cum. Supp.
2020). That ballot is later counted if the voter's address is determined to be within the precinct. See ibid. But if
it turns out that the voter cast a ballot at the wrong precinct, that vote is not counted. See §16-584(E); App.
37-41 ...

For those who choose to vote early by mail, Arizona has long required that "[o]nly the elector may be in posses-
sion of that elector's unvoted early ballot." §16-542(D). In 2016, the state legislature enacted House Bill 2023
(HB 2023), which makes it a crime for any person other than a postal worker, an elections official, or a voter's
caregiver, family member, or household member to knowingly collect an early ballot--either before or after it
has been completed. §§16-1005(H)-(I).

In 2016, the Democratic National Committee and certain affiliates brought this suit and named as defendants
(among others) the Arizona attorney general and secretary of state in their official capacities. Among other
things, the plaintiffs claimed that both the State's refusal to count ballots cast in the wrong precinct and its
ballot-collection restriction "adversely and disparately affect Arizona's American Indian, Hispanic, and African
American citizens," in violation of §2 of the VRA. Democratic Nat. Comm. v. Hobbs (CA9 2020) (en banc). In
addition, they alleged that the ballot-collection restriction was "enacted with discriminatory intent" and thus
violated both §2 of the VRA and the Fifteenth Amendment. Ibid.

... the District Court made extensive findings of fact and rejected all the plaintiffs' claims, id., at 838-883. The
court first found that the out-of-precinct policy "has no meaningfully disparate impact on the opportunities of
minority voters to elect" representatives of their choice ...
                                                                                                              PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS | 927

The District Court similarly found that the ballot collection restriction is unlikely to "cause a meaningful
inequality in the electoral opportunities of minorities." Rather, the court noted, the restriction applies equally
to all voters and "does not impose burdens beyond those traditionally associated with voting." ... Finally, the
court found that the ballot-collection law had not been enacted with discriminatory intent ...

A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed, but an en banc court reversed ...

We begin with two preliminary matters. Secretary of State Hobbs contends that no petitioner has Article III
standing to appeal the decision below as to the out-of-precinct policy, but we reject that argument. All that is
needed to entertain an appeal of that issue is one party with standing, see Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter and
Paul Home v. Pennsylvania (2020) (slip op., at 13, n. 6), and we are satisfied that Attorney General Brnovich fits
the bill ... [T]he attorney general is authorized to represent the State in any action in federal court.

Second, we think it prudent to make clear at the beginning that we decline in these cases to announce a test to
govern all VRA §2 claims involving rules, like those at issue here, that specify the time, place, or manner for cast-
ing ballots. Each of the parties advocated a different test, as did many amici and the courts below ... All told, no
fewer than 10 tests have been proposed. But as this is our first foray into the area, we think it sufficient for pre-
sent purposes to identify certain guideposts that lead us to our decision in these cases.

... [B]ecause this is our first §2 time, place, or manner case, a fresh look at the statutory text is appropriate. Today,
our statutory interpretation cases almost always start with a careful consideration of the text, and there is no rea-
son to do otherwise here.

... §2(b), which was added to win Senate approval, explains what must be shown to establish a §2 violation. Sec-
tion 2(b) states that §2 is violated only where "the political processes leading to nomination or election" are not
"equally open to participation" by members of the relevant protected group "in that its members have less oppor­
tunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of
their choice." (Emphasis added.)

The key requirement is that the political processes leading to nomination and election (here, the process of vot-
ing) must be "equally open" to minority and non-minority groups alike, and the most relevant definition of the
term "open," as used in §2(b), is "without restrictions as to who may participate," Random House Dictionary of
the English Language 1008 (J. Stein ed. 1966), or "requiring no special status, identification, or permit for entry
or participation," Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1579 (1976).

What §2(b) means by voting that is not "equally open" is further explained by this language: "in that its members
have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect
representatives of their choice."

Putting these terms together, it appears that the core of §2(b) is the requirement that voting be "equally open."
The statute's reference to equal "opportunity" may stretch that concept to some degree to include consideration
of a person's ability to use the means that are equally open. But equal openness remains the touchstone.
928 | PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS

... The provision [ §2(b)] requires consideration of "the totality of circumstances." Thus, any circumstance that
has a logical bearing on whether voting is "equally open" and affords equal "opportunity" may be considered.
We will not attempt to compile an exhaustive list, but several important circumstances should be mentioned.

1. First, the size of the burden imposed by a challenged voting rule is highly relevant. The concepts of
"open[ness]" and "opportunity" connote the absence of obstacles and burdens that block or seriously hinder
voting, and therefore the size of the burden imposed by a voting rule is important. After all, every voting rule
imposes a burden of some sort ... But because voting necessarily requires some effort and compliance with some
rules, the concept of a voting system that is "equally open" and that furnishes an equal "opportunity" to cast a
ballot must tolerate the "usual burdens of voting." ...

2. For similar reasons, the degree to which a voting rule departs from what was standard practice when §2 was
amended in 1982 is a relevant consideration. Because every voting rule imposes a burden of some sort, it is useful
to have benchmarks with which the burdens imposed by a challenged rule can be compared. The burdens associ-
ated with the rules in widespread use when §2 was adopted are therefore useful in gauging whether the burdens
imposed by a challenged rule are sufficient to prevent voting from being equally "open" or furnishing an equal
"opportunity" to vote in the sense meant by §2. Therefore, it is relevant that in 1982 States typically required
nearly all voters to cast their ballots in person on election day and allowed only narrow and tightly defined cate-
gories of voters to cast absentee ballots ... We doubt that Congress intended to uproot facially neutral time, place,
and manner regulations that have a long pedigree or are in widespread use in the United States. We have no need
to decide whether adherence to, or a return to, a 1982 framework is necessarily lawful under §2, but the degree
to which a challenged rule has a long pedigree or is in widespread use in the United States is a circumstance that
must be taken into account.

3. The size of any disparities in a rule's impact on members of different racial or ethnic groups is also an impor-
tant factor to consider. Small disparities are less likely than large ones to indicate that a system is not equally
open. To the extent that minority and non-minority groups differ with respect to employment, wealth, and edu-
cation, even neutral regulations, no matter how crafted, may well result in some predictable disparities in rates
of voting and noncompliance with voting rules. But the mere fact there is some disparity in impact does not nec-
essarily mean that a system is not equally open or that it does not give everyone an equal opportunity to vote.
The size of any disparity matters. And in assessing the size of any disparity, a meaningful comparison is essential.
What are at bottom very small differences should not be artificially magnified.

4. Next, courts must consider the opportunities provided by a State's entire system of voting when assessing the
burden imposed by a challenged provision. This follows from §2(b)'s reference to the collective concept of a
State's "political processes" and its "political process" as a whole. Thus, where a State provides multiple ways to
vote, any burden imposed on voters who choose one of the available options cannot be evaluated without also
taking into account the other available means.
                                                                                                             PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS | 929

5. Finally, the strength of the state interests served by a challenged voting rule is also an important factor that
must be taken into account. As noted, every voting rule imposes a burden of some sort, and therefore, in deter-
mining "based on the totality of circumstances" whether a rule goes too far, it is important to consider the reason
for the rule. Rules that are supported by strong state interests are less likely to violate §2.

One strong and entirely legitimate state interest is the prevention of fraud. Fraud can affect the outcome of a
close election, and fraudulent votes dilute the right of citizens to cast ballots that carry appropriate weight. Fraud
can also undermine public confidence in the fairness of elections and the perceived legitimacy of the announced
outcome. Ensuring that every vote is cast freely, without intimidation or undue influence, is also a valid and
important state interest. This interest helped to spur the adoption of what soon became standard practice in this
country and in other democratic nations the world round: the use of private voting booths ...

The interpretation set out above follows directly from what §2 commands: consideration of "the totality of cir-
cumstances" that have a bearing on whether a State makes voting "equally open" to all and gives everyone an
equal "opportunity" to vote. The dissent, by contrast, would rewrite the text of §2 and make it turn almost
entirely on just one circumstance--disparate impact.

That is a radical project, and the dissent strains mightily to obscure its objective ...

Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act provides vital protection against discriminatory voting rules, and no one sug-
gests that discrimination in voting has been extirpated or that the threat has been eliminated. But §2 does not
deprive the States of their authority to establish non-discriminatory voting rules, and that is precisely what the
dissent's radical interpretation would mean in practice. The dissent is correct that the Voting Rights Act exem-
plifies our country's commitment to democracy, but there is nothing democratic about the dissent's attempt to
bring about a wholesale transfer of the authority to set voting rules from the States to the federal courts.

In light of the principles set out above, neither Arizona's out-of-precinct rule nor its ballot-collection law violates
§2 of the VRA. Arizona's out-of-precinct rule enforces the requirement that voters who choose to vote in person
on election day must do so in their assigned precincts. Having to identify one's own polling place and then travel
there to vote does not exceed the "usual burdens of voting." ... On the contrary, these tasks are quintessential
examples of the usual burdens of voting.

Not only are these unremarkable burdens, but the District Court's uncontested findings show that the State
made extensive efforts to reduce their impact on the number of valid votes ultimately cast. The State makes accu-
rate precinct information available to all voters. When precincts or polling places are altered between elections,
each registered voter is sent a notice showing the voter's new polling place. ... Arizona law also mandates that
election officials send a sample ballot to each household that includes a registered voter who has not opted to
be placed on the permanent early voter list ... and this mailing also identifies the voter's proper polling location,
... In addition, the Arizona secretary of state's office sends voters pamphlets that include information (in both
English and Spanish) about how to identify their assigned precinct ...

The burdens of identifying and traveling to one's assigned precinct are also modest when considering Arizona's
"political processes" as a whole. The Court of Appeals noted that Arizona leads other States in the rate of votes
930 | PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS

rejected on the ground that they were cast in the wrong precinct, and the court attributed this to frequent
changes in polling locations, confusing placement of polling places, and high levels of residential mobility. 948
F. 3d, at 1000-1004. But even if it is marginally harder for Arizona voters to find their assigned polling places,
the State offers other easy ways to vote. Any voter can request an early ballot without excuse. Any voter can ask
to be placed on the permanent early voter list so that an early ballot will be mailed automatically. Voters may
drop off their early ballots at any polling place, even one to which they are not assigned. And for nearly a month
before election day, any voter can vote in person at an early voting location in his or her county. The availability
of those options likely explains why out-of-precinct votes on election day make up such a small and apparently
diminishing portion of overall ballots cast--0.47% of all ballots in the 2012 general election and just 0.15% in
2016.

Next, the racial disparity in burdens allegedly caused by the out-of-precinct policy is small in absolute terms. The
District Court accepted the plaintiffs' evidence that, of the Arizona counties that reported out-of-precinct bal-
lots in the 2016 general election, a little over 1% of Hispanic voters, 1% of African-American voters, and 1% of
Native American voters who voted on election day cast an out-of-precinct ballot. For non-minority voters, the
rate was around 0.5%. ... A policy that appears to work for 98% or more of voters to whom it applies--minority
and non-minority alike--is unlikely to render a system unequally open ...

Section 2 does not require a State to show that its chosen policy is absolutely necessary or that a less restrictive
means would not adequately serve the State's objectives. And the Court of Appeals' preferred alternative would
have obvious disadvantages. Partially counting out-of-precinct ballots would complicate the process of tabula-
tion and could lead to disputes and delay. In addition, as one of the en banc dissenters noted, it would tend to
encourage voters who are primarily interested in only national or state-wide elections to vote in whichever place
is most convenient even if they know that it is not their assigned polling place ...

In light of the modest burdens allegedly imposed by Arizona's out-of-precinct policy, the small size of its dis-
parate impact, and the State's justifications, we conclude the rule does not violate §2 of the VRA.18.

HB 2023 likewise passes muster under the results test of §2. Arizonans who receive early ballots can submit them
by going to a mailbox, a post office, an early ballot drop box, or an authorized election official's office within the
27-day early voting period. They can also drop off their ballots at any polling place or voting center on election
day, and in order to do so, they can skip the line of voters waiting to vote in person. 329 F. Supp. 3d, at 839
(citing ECF Doc. 361, ¶57). Making any of these trips--much like traveling to an assigned polling place--falls
squarely within the heartland of the "usual burdens of voting." Crawford, 553 U. S., at 198 (opinion of Stevens,
J.). And voters can also ask a statutorily authorized proxy--a family member, a household member, or a care-
giver--to mail a ballot or drop it off at any time within 27 days of an election.

...

The plaintiffs were unable to provide statistical evidence showing that HB 2023 had a disparate impact on
minority voters ...
                                                                                                              PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS | 931

Even if the plaintiffs had shown a disparate burden caused by HB 2023, the State's justifications would suffice
to avoid §2 liability. "A State indisputably has a compelling interest in preserving the integrity of its election
process." Purcell v. Gonzalez (2006). Limiting the classes of persons who may handle early ballots to those less
likely to have ulterior motives deters potential fraud and improves voter confidence ...

As with the out-of-precinct policy, the modest evidence of racially disparate burdens caused by HB 2023, in light
of the State's justifications, leads us to the conclusion that the law does not violate §2 of the VRA.

We also granted certiorari to review whether the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that HB 2023 was
enacted with a discriminatory purpose. The District Court found that it was not, 329 F. Supp. 3d, at 882, and
appellate review of that conclusion is for clear error, Pullman-Standard v. Swint (1982). If the district court's
view of the evidence is plausible in light of the entire record, an appellate court may not reverse even if it is
convinced that it would have weighed the evidence differently in the first instance. Anderson v. Bessemer City
(1985)."Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder's choice between them cannot be
clearly erroneous." Anderson v. Bessemer City (1985).

The District Court's finding on the question of discriminatory intent had ample support in the record ...

...

We are more than satisfied that the District Court's interpretation of the evidence is permissible. The spark for
the debate over mail-in voting may well have been provided by one Senator's enflamed partisanship, but partisan
motives are not the same as racial motives. See Cooper v. Harris (2017).

The Court of Appeals did not dispute the District Court's assessment of the sincerity of HB 2023's proponents.
It even agreed that some members of the legislature had a "sincere, though mistaken, non-race-based belief that
there had been fraud in third-party ballot collection, and that the problem needed to be addressed." The Court
of Appeals nevertheless concluded that the District Court committed clear error by failing to apply a "`cat's
paw'" theory sometimes used in employment discrimination cases ...

A "cat's paw" is a "dupe" who is "used by another to accomplish his purposes." ... A plaintiff in a "cat's paw"
case typically seeks to hold the plaintiff 's employer liable for "the animus of a supervisor who was not charged
with making the ultimate [adverse] employment decision." ... The "cat's paw" theory has no application to leg-
islative bodies. The theory rests on the agency relationship that exists between an employer and a supervisor, but
the legislators who vote to adopt a bill are not the agents of the bill's sponsor or proponents. Under our form of
government, legislators have a duty to exercise their judgment and to represent their constituents. It is insulting
to suggest that they are mere dupes or tools.

* * *

Arizona's out-of-precinct policy and HB 2023 do not violate §2 of the VRA, and HB 2023 was not enacted with
a racially discriminatory purpose. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the cases are remanded
for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
932 | PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS

It is so ordered.

Justice Kagan, with whom Justice Breyer and Justice Sotomayor join, dissenting.

If a single statute represents the best of America, it is the Voting Rights Act. It marries two great ideals: democ-
racy and racial equality. And it dedicates our country to carrying them out. Section 2, the provision at issue here,
guarantees that members of every racial group will have equal voting opportunities. Citizens of every race will
have the same shot to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice. They will all
own our democracy together--no one more and no one less than any other.

If a single statute reminds us of the worst of America, it is the Voting Rights Act. Because it was--and
remains--so necessary. Because a century after the Civil War was fought, at the time of the Act's passage, the
promise of political equality remained a distant dream for African American citizens. Because States and local-
ities continually "contriv[ed] new rules," mostly neutral on their face but discriminatory in operation, to keep
minority voters from the polls. South Carolina v. Katzenbach (1966). Because "Congress had reason to suppose"
that States would "try similar maneuvers in the future"--"pour[ing] old poison into new bottles" to suppress
minority votes. Ibid.; Reno v. Bossier Parish School Bd. (2000) (Souter, J., concurring in part and dissenting in
part). Because Congress has been proved right.

The Voting Rights Act is ambitious, in both goal and scope. When President Lyndon Johnson sent the bill to
Congress, ten days after John Lewis led marchers across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, he explained that it was
"carefully drafted to meet its objective--the end of discrimination in voting in America." H. R. Doc. No. 120,
89th Cong., 1st Sess., 1-2 (1965). He was right about how the Act's drafting reflected its aim.

"The end of discrimination in voting" is a far-reaching goal. And the Voting Rights Act's text is just as far-
reaching. A later amendment, adding the provision at issue here, became necessary when this Court construed
the statute too narrowly. And in the last decade, this Court assailed the Act again, undoing its vital Section 5.
See Shelby County v. Holder (2013). But Section 2 of the Act remains, as written, as expansive as ever--demand-
ing that every citizen of this country possess a right at once grand and obvious: the right to an equal opportunity
to vote.

Today, the Court undermines Section 2 and the right it provides. The majority fears that the statute Congress
wrote is too "radical"--that it will invalidate too many state voting laws. See ante, at 21, 25. So the majority
writes its own set of rules, limiting Section 2 from multiple directions. See ante, at 16-19. Wherever it can, the
majority gives a cramped reading to broad language. And then it uses that reading to uphold two election laws
from Arizona that discriminate against minority voters. I could say--and will in the following pages--that this
is not how the Court is supposed to interpret and apply statutes. But that ordinary critique woefully undersells
the problem. What is tragic here is that the Court has (yet again) rewritten--in order to weaken--a statute that
stands as a monument to America's greatness, and protects against its basest impulses. What is tragic is that the
Court has damaged a statute designed to bring about "the end of discrimination in voting." I respectfully dis-
sent.

(omitted; describes the history and electoral practices that brought about the VRA.)
                                                                                                              PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS | 933

Yet efforts to suppress the minority vote continue. No one would know this from reading the majority opinion.
It hails the "good news" that legislative efforts had mostly shifted by the 1980s from vote denial to vote dilu-
tion. Ante, at 7. And then it moves on to other matters, as though the Voting Rights Act no longer has a problem
to address--as though once literacy tests and poll taxes disappeared, so too did efforts to curb minority voting.
But as this Court recognized about a decade ago, "racial discrimination and racially polarized voting are not
ancient history." Bartlett v. Strickland (2009). Indeed, the problem of voting discrimination has become worse
since that time--in part because of what this Court did in Shelby County. Weaken the Voting Rights Act, and
predictable consequences follow: yet a further generation of voter suppression laws.

Much of the Voting Rights Act's success lay in its capacity to meet ever-new forms of discrimination ... In that
way, the Act would prevent the use of new, more nuanced methods to restrict the voting opportunities of non-
white citizens.

And for decades, Section 5 operated as intended. Between 1965 and 2006, the Department stopped almost 1200
voting laws in covered areas from taking effect. See Shelby County (2013) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) ... In review-
ing mountains of such evidence in 2006, Congress saw a continuing need for Section 5. Although "discrimina-
tion today is more subtle than the visible methods used in 1965," Congress found, it still produces "the same
[effects], namely a diminishing of the minority community's ability to fully participate in the electoral process."
H. R. Rep. No. 109-478, p. 6 (2006). Congress thus reauthorized the preclearance scheme for 25 years.

But this Court took a different view. Finding that "[o]ur country has changed," the Court saw only limited
instances of voting discrimination--and so no further need for preclearance. Shelby County (2013). Displacing
Congress's contrary judgment, the Court struck down the coverage formula essential to the statute's operation
... But how did the majority know there was nothing more for Section 5 to do--that the (undoubted) changes in
the country went so far as to make the provision unnecessary? It didn't, as Justice Ginsburg explained in dissent.
The majority's faith that discrimination was almost gone derived, at least in part, from the success of Section
5--from its record of blocking discriminatory voting schemes. Discarding Section 5 because those schemes had
diminished was "like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet." Bostock v.
Clayton County (2020).

The rashness of the act soon became evident. Once Section 5's strictures came off, States and localities put in
place new restrictive voting laws, with foreseeably adverse effects on minority voters ...

... In recent months, State after State has taken up or enacted legislation erecting new barriers to voting ... Those
laws shorten the time polls are open, both on Election Day and before. They impose new prerequisites to voting
by mail, and shorten the windows to apply for and return mail ballots. They make it harder to register to vote,
and easier to purge voters from the rolls. Two laws even ban handing out food or water to voters standing in line.
Some of those restrictions may be lawful under the Voting Rights Act. But chances are that some have the kind
of impact the Act was designed to prevent--that they make the political process less open to minority voters
than to others.

So the Court decides this Voting Rights Act case at a perilous moment for the Nation's commitment to equal
citizenship ... Congress never meant for Section 2 to bear all of the weight of the Act's commitments. That pro-
934 | PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS

vision looks to courts, not to the Executive Branch, to restrain discriminatory voting practices. And litigation is
an after-the-fact remedy, incapable of providing relief until an election--usually, more than one election--has
come and gone. See id., at 572 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). So Section 2 was supposed to be a back-up, for all its
sweep and power. But after Shelby County, the vitality of Section 2--a "permanent, nationwide ban on racial
discrimination in voting"--matters more than ever. Shelby (2013) (majority opinion). For after Shelby County,
Section 2 is what voters have left.

Section 2, as drafted, is well-equipped to meet the challenge. Congress meant to eliminate all "discriminatory
election systems or practices which operate, designedly or otherwise, to minimize or cancel out the voting
strength and political effectiveness of minority groups." S. Rep. No. 97-417, p. 28 (1982) (S. Rep.). And that
broad intent is manifest in the provision's broad text.

Section 2, as relevant here, has two interlocking parts ...

Those provisions have a great many words ... But their essential import is plain: Courts are to strike down voting
rules that contribute to a racial disparity in the opportunity to vote, taking all the relevant circumstances into
account.

...

But when to conclude--looking to effects, not purposes--that a denial or abridgment has occurred? Again,
answering that question is subsection (b)'s function. See supra, at 12-13. It teaches that a violation is established
when, "based on the totality of circumstances," a State's electoral system is "not equally open" to members of a
racial group. And then the subsection tells us what that means. A system is not equally open if members of one
race have "less opportunity" than others to cast votes, to participate in politics, or to elect representatives. The
key demand, then, is for equal political opportunity across races.

That equal "opportunity" is absent when a law or practice makes it harder for members of one racial group,
than for others, to cast ballots. When Congress amended Section 2, the word "opportunity" meant what it also
does today: "a favorable or advantageous combination of circumstances" for some action. See American Her-
itage Dictionary, at 922. In using that word, Congress made clear that the Voting Rights Act does not demand
equal outcomes. If members of different races have the same opportunity to vote, but go to the ballot box at
different rates, then so be it--that is their preference, and Section 2 has nothing to say. But if a law produces dif-
ferent voting opportunities across races--if it establishes rules and conditions of political participation that are
less favorable (or advantageous) for one racial group than for others--then Section 2 kicks in. It applies, in short,
whenever the law makes it harder for citizens of one race than of others to cast a vote.

And that is so even if (as is usually true) the law does not single out any race, but instead is facially neutral ...
Those laws, Congress thought, would violate Section 2, though they were not facially discriminatory, because
they gave voters of different races unequal access to the political process.

Congress also made plain, in calling for a totality-of- circumstances inquiry, that equal voting opportunity is a
function of both law and background conditions--in other words, that a voting rule's validity depends on how
                                                                                                              PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS | 935

the rule operates in conjunction with facts on the ground ... But sometimes government officials enact facially
neutral laws that leverage--and become discriminatory by dint of--pre-existing social and economic conditions.
The classic historical cases are literacy tests and poll taxes. A more modern example is the one Justice Scalia
gave, of limited registration hours. Congress knew how those laws worked: It saw that "inferior education, poor
employment opportunities, and low incomes"--all conditions often correlated with race--could turn even an
ordinary-seeming election rule into an effective barrier to minority voting in certain circumstances.

...

The majority's opinion mostly inhabits a law-free zone. It congratulates itself in advance for giving Section 2's
text "careful consideration." Ante, at 14. And then it leaves that language almost wholly behind ...

The majority instead founds its decision on a list of mostly made-up factors, at odds with Section 2 itself. To
excuse this unusual free-form exercise, the majority notes that Section 2 authorizes courts to conduct a "total-
ity of circumstances" analysis. Ante, at 16. But as described above, Congress mainly added that language so that
Section 2 could protect against "the demonstrated ingenuity of state and local governments in hobbling minor-
ity voting power." De Grandy (1994). The totality inquiry requires courts to explore how ordinary-seeming
laws can interact with local conditions--economic, social, historical--to produce race-based voting inequalities.
That inquiry hardly gives a court the license to devise whatever limitations on Section 2's reach it would have
liked Congress to enact. But that is the license the majority takes ...

Start with the majority's first idea: a "[m]ere inconvenience[ ]" exception to Section 2. Ante, at 16. Voting, the
majority says, imposes a set of "usual burdens": Some time, some travel, some rule compliance. Ibid. And all of
that is beneath the notice of Section 2--even if those burdens fall highly unequally on members of different
races. See ibid. But that categorical exclusion, for seemingly small (or "[un]usual" or "[un]serious") burdens, is
nowhere in the provision's text. To the contrary (and as this Court has recognized before), Section 2 allows no
"safe harbor[s]" for election rules resulting in disparate voting opportunities. De Grandy (1994). The section
applies to any discriminatory "voting qualification," "prerequisite to voting," or "standard, practice, or proce-
dure"--even the kind creating only (what the majority thinks of as) an ordinary burden ...

And what is a "mere inconvenience" or "usual burden" anyway? The drafters of the Voting Rights Act under-
stood that "social and historical conditions," including disparities in education, wealth, and employment, often
affect opportunities to vote. Gingles (1986). What does not prevent one citizen from casting a vote might pre-
vent another. How is a judge supposed to draw an "inconvenience" line in some reasonable place, taking those
differences into account? Consider a law banning the handing out of water to voters. No more than--or not
even--an inconvenience when lines are short; but what of when they are, as in some neighborhoods, hours-
long? The point here is that judges lack an objective way to decide which voting obstacles are "mere" and which
are not, for all voters at all times. And so Section 2 does not ask the question.

The majority's "multiple ways to vote" factor is similarly flawed. Ante, at 18. True enough, a State with three
ways to vote (say, on Election Day; early in person; or by mail) may be more "open" than a State with only one
(on Election Day). And some other statute might care about that. But Section 2 does not. What it cares about is
936 | PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS

that a State's "political processes" are "equally open" to voters of all races. And a State's electoral process is not
equally open if, for example, the State "only" makes Election Day voting by members of one race peculiarly dif-
ficult.

...

The majority's approach, which would ask only whether a discriminatory law "reasonably pursue[s] important
state interests," gives election officials too easy an escape from Section 2. Ante, at 25 (emphasis added). Of course
preventing voter intimidation is an important state interest. And of course preventing election fraud is the same.
But those interests are also easy to assert groundlessly or pretextually in voting discrimination cases. Congress
knew that when it passed Section 2 ...

Just look at Arizona. Two of that State's policies disproportionately affect minority citizens' opportunity to vote.
The first--the out-of-precinct policy--results in Hispanic and African American voters' ballots being thrown
out at a statistically higher rate than those of whites. And whatever the majority might say about the ordi-
nariness of such a rule, Arizona applies it in extra-ordinary fashion: Arizona is the national outlier in dealing
with out-of-precinct votes, with the next-worst offender nowhere in sight. The second rule--the ballot-collec-
tion ban--makes voting meaningfully more difficult for Native American citizens than for others. And nothing
about how that ban is applied is "usual" either--this time because of how many of the State's Native American
citizens need to travel long distances to use the mail. Both policies violate Section 2, on a straightforward appli-
cation of its text. Considering the "totality of circumstances," both "result in" members of some races having
"less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect a rep-
resentative of their choice." §10301(b). The majority reaches the opposite conclusion because it closes its eyes to
the facts on the ground.

...

... The majority is wrong to assert that those statistics are "highly misleading." Ante, at 28. In the majority's view,
they can be dismissed because the great mass of voters are unaffected by the out-of-precinct policy. See ibid. But
Section 2 is less interested in "absolute terms" (as the majority calls them) than in relative ones. Ante, at 27;
see supra, at 14-15. Arizona's policy creates a statistically significant disparity between minority and white vot-
ers: Because of the policy, members of different racial groups do not in fact have an equal likelihood of having
their ballots counted.

...

Arizona's law mostly banning third-party ballot collection also results in a significant race-based disparity in vot-
ing opportunities. The problem with that law again lies in facts nearly unique to Arizona--here, the presence of
rural Native American communities that lack ready access to mail service. Given that circumstance, the Arizona
statute discriminates in just the way Section 2 proscribes. The majority once more comes to a different conclu-
sion only by ignoring the local conditions with which Arizona's law interacts.
                                                                                                              PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS | 937

The critical facts for evaluating the ballot-collection rule have to do with mail service. Most Arizonans vote
by mail. But many rural Native American voters lack access to mail service, to a degree hard for most of us to
fathom. Only 18% of Native voters in rural counties receive home mail delivery, compared to 86% of white voters
living in those counties. See 329 F. Supp. 3d, at 836. And for many or most, there is no nearby post office. Native
Americans in rural Arizona "often must travel 45 minutes to 2 hours just to get to a mailbox ..." And between
a quarter to a half of households in these Native communities do not have a car. See ibid. So getting ballots by
mail and sending them back poses a serious challenge for Arizona's rural Native Americans.

For that reason, an unusually high rate of Native Americans used to "return their early ballots with the assistance
of third parties." Id., at 870 ...

Still, Arizona enacted--with full knowledge of the likely discriminatory consequences--the near-blanket ballot-
collection ban challenged here.

...

Congress enacted the Voting Rights Act to address a deep fault of our democracy--the historical and continuing
attempt to withhold from a race of citizens their fair share of influence on the political process. For a century,
African Americans had struggled and sacrificed to wrest their voting rights from a resistant Nation. The statute
they and their allies at long last attained made a promise to all Americans. From then on, Congress demanded,
the political process would be equally open to every citizen, regardless of race.

...

This Court has no right to remake Section 2. Maybe some think that vote suppression is a relic of history--and
so the need for a potent Section 2 has come and gone ... But Congress gets to make that call. Because it has not
done so, this Court's duty is to apply the law as it is written. The law that confronted one of this country's most
enduring wrongs; pledged to give every American, of every race, an equal chance to participate in our democ-
racy; and now stands as the crucial tool to achieve that goal. That law, of all laws, deserves the sweep and power
Congress gave it. That law, of all laws, should not be diminished by this Court.

MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER announced the judgment of the Court and an opinion in which MR. JUS-
TICE REED and MR. JUSTICE BURTON concur.

... These are three qualified voters in Illinois districts which have much larger populations than other Illinois
Congressional districts. They brought this suit against the Governor, the Secretary of State, and the Auditor of
the State of Illinois ... to restrain them, in effect, from taking proceedings for an election in November 1946,
under the provisions of Illinois law governing Congressional districts. Formally, the appellants asked for a decree
... declaring these provisions to be invalid because they violated various provisions of the United States Consti-
tution ... in that by reason of subsequent changes in population the Congressional districts for the election of
Representatives in the Congress created by the Illinois Laws of 1901 lacked compactness of territory and approx-
imate equality of population. ...

We are of opinion that the appellants ask of this Court what is beyond its competence to grant. ... It must be
resolved by considerations on the basis of which this Court, from time to time, has refused to intervene in con-
troversies. It has refused to do so because due regard for the effective working of our Government revealed this
issue to be of a peculiarly political nature and therefore not meet for judicial determination.

The appellants urge with great zeal that the conditions of which they complain are grave evils and offend public
morality. The Constitution of the United States gives ample power to provide against these evils. But due regard
for the Constitution as a viable system precludes judicial correction. Authority for dealing with such problems
resides elsewhere. ... The short of it is that the Constitution has conferred upon Congress exclusive authority
to secure fair representation by the States in the popular House and left to that House determination whether
States have fulfilled their responsibility. If Congress failed in exercising its powers, whereby standards of fairness
are offended, the remedy ultimately lies with the people. ...

To sustain this action would cut very deep into the very being of Congress. Courts ought not to enter this polit-
ical thicket. ... The Constitution has many commands that are not enforceable by courts because they clearly fall
outside the conditions and purposes that circumscribe judicial action. ...

Dismissal of the complaint is affirmed.

MR. JUSTICE RUTLEDGE.

... [W]e have but recently been admonished again that it is the very essence of our duty to avoid decision upon
grave constitutional questions, especially when this may bring our function into clash with the political depart-
ments of the Government, if any tenable alternative ground for disposition of the controversy is presented.

There is one, however, in this case. And I think the gravity of the constitutional questions raised so great,
together with the possibilities for collision above mentioned, that the admonition is appropriate to be followed
here. Other reasons support this view ...

... The shortness of the time remaining makes it doubtful whether action could, or would, be taken in time to
secure for petitioners the effective relief they seek. ...

... I think, therefore, the case is one in which the Court may properly, and should, decline to exercise its jurisdic-
tion. Accordingly, the judgment should be affirmed and I join in that disposition of the cause.

Mr. Justice Black, dissenting.

The complaint alleges the following facts essential to the position I take: appellants, citizens and voters of Illi-
nois, live in congressional election districts, the respective populations of which range from 612,000 to 914,000.
Twenty other congressional election districts have populations that range from 112,116 to 385,207. In seven of
these districts the population is below 200,000. The Illinois Legislature established these districts in 1901 on the
basis of the Census of 1900. The Federal Census of 1910, of 1920, of 1930, and of 1940, each showed a growth
of population in Illinois and a substantial shift in the distribution of population among the districts established
in 1901. But up to date, attempts to have the State Legislature reapportion congressional election districts so as
more nearly to equalize their population have been unsuccessful ... The implication is that the issues of state and
congressional apportionment are thus so interdependent that it is to the interest of state legislators to perpetu-
ate the inequitable apportionment of both state and congressional election districts. Prior to this proceeding, a
series of suits had been brought in the state courts challenging the State's local and federal apportionment sys-
tem. In all these cases, the Supreme Court of the State had denied effective relief.

In the present suit, the complaint attacked the 1901 State Apportionment Act on the ground that it, among
other things, violates Article I and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution. Appellants claim that, since
they live in the heavily populated districts, their vote is much less effective than the vote of those living in a dis-
trict which, under the 1901 Act, is also allowed to choose one Congressman, though its population is sometimes
only one-ninth that of the heavily populated districts. Appellants contend that this reduction of the effective-
ness of their vote is the result of a willful legislative discrimination against them, and thus amounts to a denial of
the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment ... These allegations have not been
denied. Under these circumstances, and since there is no adequate legal remedy for depriving a citizen of his right
to vote, equity can and should grant relief.

It is difficult for me to see why the 1901 State Apportionment Act does not deny appellants equal protection of
the laws.
§940 | PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS

...

The only type of case in which this Court has held that a federal district court should, in its discretion, stay its
hand any more than a state court is where the question is one which state courts or administrative agencies have
special competence to decide. This is not that type of question. What is involved here is the right to vote guar-
anteed by the Federal Constitution. It has always been the rule that, where a federally protected right has been
invaded, the federal courts will provide the remedy to rectify the wrong done ...

Nor is there any more difficulty in enforcing a decree in this case than there was in the Smiley case. It is true that
declaration of invalidity of the State Act and the enjoining of state officials would result in prohibiting the State
from electing Congressmen under the system of the old congressional districts. But it would leave the State free
to elect them from the State at large, which, as we held in the Smiley case, is a manner authorized by the Con-
stitution. It is said that it would be inconvenient for the State to conduct the election in this manner. But it has
an element of virtue that the more convenient method does not have -- namely, it does not discriminate against
some groups to favor others, it gives all the people an equally effective voice in electing their representatives, as is
essential under a free government, and it is constitutional.

MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.

... The complaint, alleging that by means of a 1901 statute of Tennessee apportioning the members of the Gen-
eral Assembly among the State's 95 counties, "these plaintiffs and others similarly situated, are denied the equal
protection of the laws accorded them by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States
                                                                                                              PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS | 941

by virtue of the debasement of their votes," was dismissed by a three-judge court ... We hold that the dismissal
was error, and remand the cause to the District Court for trial and further proceedings consistent with this opin-
ion.

... Tennessee's standard for allocating legislative representation among her counties is the total number of qual-
ified voters resident in the respective counties, subject only to minor qualifications. Decennial reapportionment
in compliance with the constitutional scheme was effected by the General Assembly each decade from 1871 to
1901. ... In the more than 60 years since that action, all proposals in both Houses of the General Assembly for
reapportionment have failed to pass.

Between 1901 and 1961, Tennessee has experienced substantial growth and redistribution of her population. In
1901 the population was 2,020,616, of whom 487,380 were eligible to vote. The 1960 Federal Census reports
the State's population at 3,567,089, of whom 2,092,891 are eligible to vote. The relative standings of the coun-
ties in terms of qualified voters have changed significantly. It is primarily the continued application of the 1901
Apportionment Act to this shifted and enlarged voting population which gives rise to the present controversy.
...

JUSTICIABILITY

In holding that the subject matter of this suit was not justiciable, the District Court relied on Colegrove v. Green,
and subsequent per curiam cases. The court stated: "From a review of these decisions there can be no doubt
that the federal rule ... is that the federal courts ... will not intervene in cases of this type to compel legislative
reapportionment." We understand the District Court to have read the cited cases as compelling the conclusion
that since the appellants sought to have a legislative apportionment held unconstitutional, their suit presented a
"political question" and was therefore nonjusticiable. We hold that this challenge to an apportionment presents
no nonjusticiable "political question." The cited cases do not hold the contrary.

Of course, the mere fact that the suit seeks protection of a political right does not mean it presents a political
question. Such an objection "is little more than a play upon words." Nixon v. Herndon (1927). Rather, it is
argued that apportionment cases, whatever the actual wording of the complaint, can involve no federal constitu-
tional right except one resting on the guaranty of a republican form of government, and that complaints based
on that clause have been held to present political questions which are nonjusticiable.

We hold that the claim pleaded here neither rests upon nor implicates the Guaranty Clause and that its justicia-
bility is therefore not foreclosed by our decisions of cases involving that clause ... Appellants' claim that they are
being denied equal protection is justiciable, and if "discrimination is sufficiently shown, the right to relief under
the equal protection clause is not diminished by the fact that the discrimination relates to political rights." ... But
because there appears to be some uncertainty as to why those cases did present political questions, and specifi-
cally as to whether this apportionment case is like those cases, we deem it necessary first to consider the contours
of the "political question" doctrine.

... The nonjusticiability of a political question is primarily a function of the separation of powers. Much con-
fusion results from the capacity of the "political question" label to obscure the need for case-by-case inquiry.
942 | PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS

Deciding whether a matter has in any measure been committed by the Constitution to another branch of gov-
ernment, or whether the action of that branch exceeds whatever authority has been committed, is itself a delicate
exercise in constitutional interpretation, and is a responsibility of this Court as ultimate interpreter of the Con-
stitution. ...

... Prominent on the surface of any case held to involve a political question is found a textually demonstrable con-
stitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or a lack of judicially discoverable and
manageable standards for resolving it; or the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination
of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion; or the impossibility of a court's undertaking independent resolution
without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government; or an unusual need for unques-
tioning adherence to a political decision already made; or the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious
pronouncements by various departments on one question.

Unless one of these formulations is inextricable from the case at bar, there should be no dismissal for nonjus-
ticiability on the ground of a political question's presence. The doctrine of which we treat is one of "political
questions," not one of "political cases." The courts cannot reject as "no law suit" a bona fide controversy as to
whether some action denominated "political" exceeds constitutional authority. ...

We come, finally, to the ultimate inquiry whether our precedents as to what constitutes a nonjusticiable "polit-
ical question" bring the case before us under the umbrella of that doctrine. A natural beginning is to note
whether any of the common characteristics which we have been able to identify and label descriptively are pre-
sent. We find none: The question here is the consistency of state action with the Federal Constitution. We have
no question decided, or to be decided, by a political branch of government coequal with this Court. Nor do we
risk embarrassment of our government abroad, or grave disturbance at home if we take issue with Tennessee as
to the constitutionality of her action here challenged. Nor need the appellants, in order to succeed in this action,
ask the Court to enter upon policy determinations for which judicially manageable standards are lacking. Judi-
cial standards under the Equal Protection Clause are well developed and familiar, and it has been open to courts
since the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment to determine, if on the particular facts they must, that a dis-
crimination reflects no policy, but simply arbitrary and capricious action.

... We conclude that the complaint's allegations of a denial of equal protection present a justiciable constitutional
cause of action upon which appellants are entitled to a trial and a decision. The right asserted is within the reach
of judicial protection under the Fourteenth Amendment.

The judgment of the District Court is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion.

Reversed and remanded.

MR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.

Appellants are citizens and qualified voters of Fulton County, Georgia, and as such are entitled to vote in con-
gressional elections in Georgia's Fifth Congressional District. That district, one of ten created by a 1931 Georgia
statute, includes Fulton, Dekalb, and Rockdale Counties and has a population according to the 1960 census
of 823,680. The average population of the ten districts is 394,312, less than half that of the Fifth. One district,
the Ninth, has only 272,154 people, less than one-third as many as the Fifth. Since there is only one Congress-
man for each district, this inequality of population means that the Fifth District's Congressman has to represent
from two to three times as many people as do Congressmen from some of the other Georgia districts.

Claiming that these population disparities deprived them and voters similarly situated of a right under the Fed-
eral Constitution to have their votes for Congressmen given the same weight as the votes of other Georgians, the
appellants brought this action ...

We agree with the District Court that the 1931 Georgia apportionment grossly discriminates against voters in
the Fifth Congressional District. A single Congressman represents from two to three times as many Fifth Dis-
trict voters as are represented by each of the Congressmen from the other Georgia congressional districts. The
apportionment statute thus contracts the value of some votes and expands that of others. If the Federal Consti-
tution intends that when qualified voters elect members of Congress each vote be given as much weight as any
other vote, then this statute cannot stand.

We hold that, construed in its historical context, the command of Art. I, § 2, that Representatives be chosen "by
the People of the several States" means that as nearly as is practicable one man's vote in a congressional election is
to be worth as much as another's. This rule is followed automatically, of course, when Representatives are cho-
sen as a group on a statewide basis, as was a widespread practice in the first 50 years of our Nation's history. It
would be extraordinary to suggest that in such statewide elections the votes of inhabitants of some parts of a
State, for example, Georgia's thinly populated Ninth District, could be weighted at two or three times the value
of the votes of people living in more populous parts of the State, for example, the Fifth District around Atlanta.
We do not believe that the Framers of the Constitution intended to permit the same vote-diluting discrimina-
tion to be accomplished through the device of districts containing widely varied numbers of inhabitants. To say
that a vote is worth more in one district than in another would not only run counter to our fundamental ideas
of democratic government, it would cast aside the principle of a House of Representatives elected "by the Peo-
ple," a principle tenaciously fought for and established at the Constitutional Convention. The history of the
944 | PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS

Constitution, particularly that part of it relating to the adoption of Art. I, § 2, reveals that those who framed the
Constitution meant that, no matter what the mechanics of an election, whether statewide or by districts, it was
population which was to be the basis of the House of Representatives.

During the Revolutionary War the rebelling colonies were loosely allied in the Continental Congress, a body
with authority to do little more than pass resolutions and issue requests for men and supplies. Before the war
ended the Congress had proposed and secured the ratification by the States of a somewhat closer association
under the Articles of Confederation. ... Farsighted men felt that a closer union was necessary if the States were
to be saved from foreign and domestic dangers.

The result was the Constitutional Convention of 1787, called for "the sole and express purpose of revising the
Articles of Confederation. ..." When the Convention met in May, this modest purpose was soon abandoned for
the greater challenge of creating a new and closer form of government than was possible under the Confedera-
tion. ...

The question of how the legislature should be constituted precipitated the most bitter controversy of the Con-
vention. ...

The dispute came near ending the Convention without a Constitution. Both sides seemed for a time to be hope-
lessly obstinate. Some delegations threatened to withdraw from the Convention if they did not get their way. ...
The deadlock was finally broken when a majority of the States agreed to what has been called the Great Com-
promise, based on a proposal which had been repeatedly advanced by Roger Sherman and other delegates from
Connecticut. It provided on the one hand that each State, including little Delaware and Rhode Island, was to
have two Senators. ... The other side of the compromise was that, as provided in Art. I, § 2, members of the
House of Representatives should be chosen "by the People of the several States" and should be "apportioned
among the several States ... according to their respective Numbers." While those who wanted both houses to
represent the people had yielded on the Senate, they had not yielded on the House of Representatives. William
Samuel Johnson of Connecticut had summed it up well: "in one branch the people, ought to be represented; in
the other, the States."

The debates at the Convention make at least one fact abundantly clear: that when the delegates agreed that
the House should represent "people" they intended that in allocating Congressmen the number assigned to
each State should be determined solely by the number of the State's inhabitants. The Constitution embodied
Edmund Randolph's proposal for a periodic census to ensure "fair representation of the people," an idea
endorsed by Mason as assuring that "numbers of inhabitants" should always be the measure of representation
in the House of Representatives. ...

It would defeat the principle solemnly embodied in the Great Compromise--equal representation in the House
for equal numbers of people--for us to hold that, within the States, legislatures may draw the lines of congres-
sional districts in such a way as to give some voters a greater voice in choosing a Congressman than others. The
House of Representatives, the Convention agreed, was to represent the people as individuals, and on a basis of
complete equality for each voter. ...
§                                                                                                             PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS | 945

It is in the light of such history that we must construe Art. I, § 2, of the Constitution, which, carrying out the
ideas of Madison and those of like views, provides that Representatives shall be chosen "by the People of the
several States" and shall be "apportioned among the several States ... according to their respective Numbers." It
is not surprising that our Court has held that this Article gives persons qualified to vote a constitutional right
to vote and to have their votes counted. Not only can this right to vote not be denied outright, it cannot, con-
sistently with Article I, be destroyed by alteration of ballots, or diluted by stuffing of the ballot box. No right
is more precious in a free country than that of having a voice in the election of those who make the laws under
which, as good citizens, we must live. Other rights, even the most basic, are illusory if the right to vote is under-
mined. Our Constitution leaves no room for classification of people in a way that unnecessarily abridges this
right. In urging the people to adopt the Constitution, Madison said in No. 57 of The Federalist:

"Who are to be the electors of the Federal Representatives? Not the rich more than the poor; not the learned
more than the ignorant; not the haughty heirs of distinguished names, more than the humble sons of obscure
and unpropitious fortune. The electors are to be the great body of the people of the United States. ..."

Readers surely could have fairly taken this to mean, "one person, one vote."

While it may not be possible to draw congressional districts with mathematical precision, that is no excuse for
ignoring our Constitution's plain objective of making equal representation for equal numbers of people the fun-
damental goal for the House of Representatives. That is the high standard of justice and common sense which
the Founders set for us.

Reversed and remanded.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT.

Involved in these cases are an appeal and two cross-appeals from a decision of the Federal District Court for the
Middle District of Alabama holding invalid, under the Equal Protection Clause of the Federal Constitution, the
946 | PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS

existing and two legislatively proposed plans for the apportionment of seats in the two houses of the Alabama
Legislature, and ordering into effect a temporary reapportionment plan comprised of parts of the proposed but
judicially disapproved measures.

... The complaint alleged a deprivation of rights under the Alabama Constitution and under the Equal Protec-
tion Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment ...

Plaintiffs below alleged that the last apportionment of the Alabama Legislature was based on the 1900 federal
census, despite the requirement of the State Constitution that the legislature be reapportioned decennially. They
asserted that, since the population growth in the State from 1900 to 1960 had been uneven, Jefferson and other
counties were now victims of serious discrimination with respect to the allocation of legislative representation.
As a result of the failure of the legislature to reapportion itself, plaintiffs asserted, they were denied "equal suf-
frage in free and equal elections ... and the equal protection of the laws" in violation of the Alabama Consti-
tution and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution. The complaint asserted that plaintiffs had
no other adequate remedy, and that they had exhausted all forms of relief other than that available through the
federal courts. They alleged that the Alabama Legislature had established a pattern of prolonged inaction from
1911 to the present which "clearly demonstrates that no reapportionment ... shall be effected"; that representa-
tion at any future constitutional convention would be established by the legislature, making it unlikely that the
membership of any such convention would be fairly representative ...

On July 21, 1962, the District Court held that the inequality of the existing representation in the Alabama Leg-
islature violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, a finding which the Court noted
had been "generally conceded" by the parties to the litigation, since population growth and shifts had converted
the 1901 scheme, as perpetuated some 60 years later, into an invidiously discriminatory plan completely lacking
in rationality. Under the existing provisions, applying 1960 census figures, only 25.1% of the State's total popula-
tion resided in districts represented by a majority of the members of the Senate, and only 25.7% lived in counties
which could elect a majority of the members of the House of Representatives. Population-variance ratios of up
to about 41-to-1 existed in the Senate, and up to about 16-to-1 in the House ...

No effective political remedy to obtain relief against the alleged malapportionment of the Alabama Legislature
appears to have been available. No initiative procedure exists under Alabama law. Amendment of the State Con-
stitution can be achieved only after a proposal is adopted by three-fifths of the members of both houses of the
legislature and is approved by a majority of the people, or as a result of a constitutional convention convened
after approval by the people of a convention call initiated by a majority of both houses of the Alabama Legisla-
ture. ...

Undeniably the Constitution of the United States protects the right of all qualified citizens to vote, in state as
well as in federal elections. A consistent line of decisions by this Court in cases involving attempts to deny or
restrict the right of suffrage has made this indelibly clear. It has been repeatedly recognized that all qualified vot-
ers have a constitutionally protected right to vote. Ex parte Yarbrough (1884) ... In Mosley (1915), the Court
stated that it is "as equally unquestionable that the right to have one's vote counted is as open to protection ... as
the right to put a ballot in a box." The right to vote can neither be denied outright, nor destroyed by alteration of
                                                                                                              PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS | 947

ballots, nor diluted by ballot-box stuffing. As the Court stated in Classic (1941), "Obviously included within the
right to choose, secured by the Constitution, is the right of qualified voters within a state to cast their ballots and
have them counted . ..." Racially based gerrymandering, Gomillion v. Lightfoot (1960) and the conducting of
white primaries, Nixon v. Herndon (1927), both of which result in denying to some citizens their right to vote,
have been held to be constitutionally impermissible. And history has seen a continuing expansion of the scope
of the right of suffrage in this country. The right to vote freely for the candidate of one's choice is of the essence
of a democratic society, and any restrictions on that right strike at the heart of representative government. And
the right of suffrage can be denied by a debasement or dilution of the weight of a citizen's vote just as effectively
as by wholly prohibiting the free exercise of the franchise. ...

... the fundamental principle of representative government in this country is one of equal representation for
equal numbers of people, without regard to race, sex, economic status, or place of residence within a State. Our
problem, then, is to ascertain, in the instant cases, whether there are any constitutionally cognizable principles
which would justify departures from the basic standard of equality among voters in the apportionment of seats
in state legislatures.

A predominant consideration in determining whether a State's legislative apportionment scheme constitutes an
invidious discrimination violative of rights asserted under the Equal Protection Clause is that the rights allegedly
impaired are individual and personal in nature ... While the result of a court decision in a state legislative appor-
tionment controversy may be to require the restructuring of the geographical distribution of seats in a state leg-
islature, the judicial focus must be concentrated upon ascertaining whether there has been any discrimination
against certain of the State's citizens which constitutes an impermissible impairment of their constitutionally
protected right to vote. Like Skinner v. Oklahoma (1942), such a case "touches a sensitive and important area
of human rights," and "involves one of the basic civil rights of man," presenting questions of alleged "invidious
discriminations ... against groups or types of individuals in violation of the constitutional guaranty of just and
equal laws." Undoubtedly, the right of suffrage is a fundamental matter in a free and democratic society. Espe-
cially since the right to exercise the franchise in a free and unimpaired manner is preservative of other basic civil
and political rights, any alleged infringement of the right of citizens to vote must be carefully and meticulously
scrutinized. Almost a century ago, in Yick Wo v. Hopkins (1886),the Court referred to "the political franchise of
voting" as "a fundamental political right, because preservative of all rights."

Legislators represent people, not trees or acres. Legislators are elected by voters, not farms or cities or economic
interests. As long as ours is a representative form of government, and our legislatures are those instruments of
government elected directly by and directly representative of the people, the right to elect legislators in a free and
unimpaired fashion is a bedrock of our political system. It could hardly be gainsaid that a constitutional claim
had been asserted by an allegation that certain otherwise qualified voters had been entirely prohibited from vot-
ing for members of their state legislature. And, if a State should provide that the votes of citizens in one part of
the State should be given two times, or five times, or 10 times the weight of votes of citizens in another part of
the State, it could hardly be contended that the right to vote of those residing in the disfavored areas had not
been effectively diluted. It would appear extraordinary to suggest that a State could be constitutionally permit-
ted to enact a law providing that certain of the State's voters could vote two, five, or 10 times for their legislative
representatives, while voters living elsewhere could vote only once. And it is inconceivable that a state law to the
948 | PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS

effect that, in counting votes for legislators, the votes of citizens in one part of the State would be multiplied by
two, five, or 10, while the votes of persons in another area would be counted only at face value, could be consti-
tutionally sustainable. Of course, the effect of state legislative districting schemes which give the same number
of representatives to unequal numbers of constituents is identical. Overweighting and overvaluation of the votes
of those living here has the certain effect of dilution and undervaluation of the votes of those living there. The
resulting discrimination against those individual voters living in disfavored areas is easily demonstrable mathe-
matically. Their right to vote is simply not the same right to vote as that of those living in a favored part of the
State. Two, five, or 10 of them must vote before the effect of their voting is equivalent to that of their favored
neighbor. Weighting the votes of citizens differently, by any method or means, merely because of where they
happen to reside, hardly seems justifiable. One must be ever aware that the Constitution forbids "sophisticated
as well as simple-minded modes of discrimination." ...

... [R]epresentative government is in essence self-government through the medium of elected representatives of
the people, and each and every citizen has an inalienable right to full and effective participation in the political
processes of his State's legislative bodies. Most citizens can achieve this participation only as qualified voters
through the election of legislators to represent them. Full and effective participation by all citizens in state gov-
ernment requires, therefore, that each citizen have an equally effective voice in the election of members of his
state legislature. Modern and viable state government needs, and the Constitution demands, no less.

Logically, in a society ostensibly grounded on representative government, it would seem reasonable that a major-
ity of the people of a State could elect a majority of that State's legislators. To conclude differently, and to sanc-
tion minority control of state legislative bodies, would appear to deny majority rights in a way that far surpasses
any possible denial of minority rights that might otherwise be thought to result. Since legislatures are responsible
for enacting laws by which all citizens are to be governed, they should be bodies which are collectively respon-
sive to the popular will. And the concept of equal protection has been traditionally viewed as requiring the uni-
form treatment of persons standing in the same relation to the governmental action questioned or challenged.
With respect to the allocation of legislative representation, all voters, as citizens of a State, stand in the same
relation regardless of where they live. Any suggested criteria for the differentiation of citizens are insufficient to
justify any discrimination, as to the weight of their votes, unless relevant to the permissible purposes of legisla-
tive apportionment. Since the achieving of fair and effective representation for all citizens is concededly the basic
aim of legislative apportionment, we conclude that the Equal Protection Clause guarantees the opportunity for
equal participation by all voters in the election of state legislators. Diluting the weight of votes because of place
of residence impairs basic constitutional rights under the Fourteenth Amendment just as much as invidious dis-
criminations based upon factors such as race, Brown v. Board of Education (1954), or economic status, Griffin
v. Illinois (1956), Douglas v. California (1963). Our constitutional system amply provides for the protection of
minorities by means other than giving them majority control of state legislatures. And the democratic ideals of
equality and majority rule, which have served this Nation so well in the past, are hardly of any less significance
for the present and the future.

We are told that the matter of apportioning representation in a state legislature is a complex and many-faceted
one. We are advised that States can rationally consider factors other than population in apportioning legislative
representation. We are admonished not to restrict the power of the States to impose differing views as to political
                                                                                                             PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS | 949

philosophy on their citizens. We are cautioned about the dangers of entering into political thickets and mathe-
matical quagmires. Our answer is this: a denial of constitutionally protected rights demands judicial protection;
our oath and our office require no less of us. ...

To the extent that a citizen's right to vote is debased, he is that much less a citizen. The fact that an individual
lives here or there is not a legitimate reason for overweighting or diluting the efficacy of his vote. The complex-
ions of societies and civilizations change, often with amazing rapidity. A nation once primarily rural in character
becomes predominantly urban. Representation schemes once fair and equitable become archaic and outdated.
But the basic principle of representative government remains, and must remain, unchanged--the weight of a
citizen's vote cannot be made to depend on where he lives. Population is, of necessity, the starting point for
consideration and the controlling criterion for judgment in legislative apportionment controversies. A citizen, a
qualified voter, is no more nor no less so because he lives in the city or on the farm. This is the clear and strong
command of our Constitution's Equal Protection Clause. This is an essential part of the concept of a govern-
ment of laws and not men. This is at the heart of Lincoln's vision of "government of the people, by the people,
[and] for the people." The Equal Protection Clause demands no less than substantially equal state legislative rep-
resentation for all citizens, of all places as well as of all races.

We hold that, as a basic constitutional standard, the Equal Protection Clause requires that the seats in both
houses of a bicameral state legislature must be apportioned on a population basis. Simply stated, an individual's
right to vote for state legislators is unconstitutionally impaired when its weight is in a substantial fashion diluted
when compared with votes of citizens living in other parts of the State. Since, under neither the existing appor-
tionment provisions nor either of the proposed plans was either of the houses of the Alabama Legislature
apportioned on a population basis, the District Court correctly held that all three of these schemes were consti-
tutionally invalid. ...

Since neither of the houses of the Alabama Legislature, under any of the three plans considered by the District
Court, was apportioned on a population basis, we would be justified in proceeding no further. However, one
of the proposed plans, that contained in the so-called 67-Senator Amendment, at least superficially resembles
the scheme of legislative representation followed in the Federal Congress. Under this plan, each of Alabama's 67
counties is allotted one senator, and no counties are given more than one Senate seat. Arguably, this is analogous
to the allocation of two Senate seats, in the Federal Congress, to each of the 50 States, regardless of population.
Seats in the Alabama House, under the proposed constitutional amendment, are distributed by giving each of
the 67 counties at least one, with the remaining 39 seats being allotted among the more populous counties on a
population basis. This scheme, at least at first glance, appears to resemble that prescribed for the Federal House
of Representatives, where the 435 seats are distributed among the States on a population basis, although each
State, regardless of its population, is given at least one Congressman. Thus, although there are substantial differ-
ences in underlying rationale and result, the 67-Senator Amendment, as proposed by the Alabama Legislature,
at least arguably presents for consideration a scheme analogous to that used for apportioning seats in Congress.

950 | PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS

... Much has been written ... about the applicability of the so-called federal analogy to state legislative apportion-
ment arrangements. ...

The system of representation in the two Houses of the Federal Congress is one ingrained in our Constitution, as
part of the law of the land. It is one conceived out of compromise and concession indispensable to the establish-
ment of our federal republic. Arising from unique historical circumstances, it is based on the consideration that
in establishing our type of federalism a group of formerly independent States bound themselves together under
one national government. ... But at the heart of our constitutional system remains the concept of separate and
distinct governmental entities which have delegated some, but not all, of their formerly held powers to the single
national government. ...

Political subdivisions of States - counties, cities, or whatever - never were and never have been considered as
sovereign entities. Rather, they have been traditionally regarded as subordinate governmental instrumentalities
created by the State to assist in the carrying out of state governmental functions. ... The relationship of the States
to the Federal Government could hardly be less analogous.

Thus, we conclude that the plan contained in the 67-Senator Amendment for apportioning seats in the Alabama
Legislature cannot be sustained by recourse to the so-called federal analogy. Nor can any other inequitable state
legislative apportionment scheme be justified on such an asserted basis. ...

Since we find the so-called federal analogy inapposite to a consideration of the constitutional validity of state
legislative apportionment schemes, we necessarily hold that the Equal Protection Clause requires both houses
of a state legislature to be apportioned on a population basis. The right of a citizen to equal representation and
to have his vote weighted equally with those of all other citizens in the election of members of one house of a
bicameral state legislature would amount to little if States could effectively submerge the equal-population prin-
ciple in the apportionment of seats in the other house. ...

We find, therefore, that the action taken by the District Court in this case, in ordering into effect a reappor-
tionment of both houses of the Alabama Legislature for purposes of the 1962 primary and general elections, by
using the best parts of the two proposed plans which it had found, as a whole, to be invalid, was an appropriate
and well-considered exercise of judicial power ...

... [W]e affirm the judgment below and remand the cases for further proceedings consistent with the views stated
in this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Voting Districts or Redistricting and Race

Gomillion v. Lightfoot

364 U.S. 339 (1960)

    Vote: 9-0
    Decision: Reversed
    Majority: Frankfurter, joined by Warren, Black, Douglas, Clark, Harlan, Brennan, and Stewart
    Concurrence: Whittaker

MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.

This litigation challenges the validity, under the United States Constitution, of Local Act No. 140, passed by the
Legislature of Alabama in 1957, redefining the boundaries of the City of Tuskegee. Petitioners, Negro citizens
of Alabama who were, at the time of this redistricting measure, residents of the City of Tuskegee, brought an
action in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama for a declaratory judgment that
Act 140 is unconstitutional, and for an injunction to restrain the Mayor and officers of Tuskegee and the offi-
cials of Macon County, Alabama, from enforcing the Act against them and other Negroes similarly situated.
Petitioners' claim is that enforcement of the statute, which alters the shape of Tuskegee from a square to an
uncouth twenty-eight-sided figure, will constitute a discrimination against them in violation of the Due Process
and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution and will deny them the right
to vote in defiance of the Fifteenth Amendment.

The respondents moved for dismissal of the action for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted
and for lack of jurisdiction of the District Court. The court granted the motion, stating,

"This Court has no control over, no supervision over, and no power to change any boundaries of municipal cor-
porations fixed by a duly convened and elected legislative body, acting for the people in the State of Alabama."

On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, affirmed ... We brought the case here since serious ques-
tions were raised concerning the power of a State over its municipalities in relation to the Fourteenth and Fif-
teenth Amendments.

At this stage of the litigation, we are not concerned with the truth of the allegations, that is, the ability of peti-
tioners to sustain their allegations by proof. The sole question is whether the allegations entitle them to make
good on their claim that they are being denied rights under the United States Constitution. The complaint,
charging that Act 140 is a device to disenfranchise Negro citizens, alleges the following facts: Prior to Act 140
the City of Tuskegee was square in shape; the Act transformed it into a strangely irregular twenty-eight-sided
figure.
952 | REDISTRICTING AND RACE

                            The entire area of the square comprised the City prior to Act 140.
                            The irregular black-bordered figure within the square represents
                            the post-enactment city

The essential inevitable effect of this redefinition of Tuskegee's boundaries is to remove from the city all save
only four or five of its 400 Negro voters while not removing a single white voter or resident. The result of the
Act is to deprive the Negro petitioners discriminatorily of the benefits of residence in Tuskegee, including, inter
alia, the right to vote in municipal elections.
These allegations, if proven, would abundantly establish that Act 140 was not an ordinary geographic redis-
tricting measure even within familiar abuses of gerrymandering. If these allegations upon a trial remained
uncontradicted or unqualified, the conclusion would be irresistible, tantamount for all practical purposes to a
mathematical demonstration, that the legislation is solely concerned with segregating white and colored voters
by fencing Negro citizens out of town so as to deprive them of their pre-existing municipal vote.
It is difficult to appreciate what stands in the way of adjudging a statute having this inevitable effect invalid in
light of the principles by which this Court must judge, and uniformly has judged, statutes that, howsoever spe-
ciously defined, obviously discriminate against colored citizens. "The [Fifteenth] Amendment nullifies sophisti-
cated as well as simple-minded modes of discrimination." Lane v. Wilson (1939).
The complaint amply alleges a claim of racial discrimination. Against this claim the respondents have never
suggested, either in their brief or in oral argument, any countervailing municipal function which Act 140 is
designed to serve. The respondents invoke generalities expressing the State's unrestricted power--unlimited,
that is, by the United States Constitution--to establish, destroy, or reorganize by contraction or expansion its
political subdivisions, to wit, cities, counties, and other local units. ...
                                                                                                             REDISTRICTING AND RACE | 953

... The Court has never acknowledged that the States have power to do as they will with municipal corporations
regardless of consequences. ...

... [S]uch power, extensive though it is, is met and overcome by the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution
of the United States, which forbids a State from passing any law which deprives a citizen of his vote because of
his race. The opposite conclusion, urged upon us by respondents, would sanction the achievement by a State
of any impairment of voting rights whatever so long as it was cloaked in the grab of the realignment of political
subdivisions. "It is inconceivable that guaranties embedded in the Constitution of the United States may thus
be manipulated out of existence." Frost & Frost Trucking Co. v. Railroad Commission of California (1926).

... A statute which is alleged to have worked unconstitutional deprivations of petitioners' rights is not immune
to attack simply because the mechanism employed by the legislature is a redefinition of municipal boundaries.
According to the allegations here made, the Alabama Legislature has not merely redrawn the Tuskegee city limits
with incidental inconvenience to the petitioners; it is more accurate to say that it has deprived the petitioners of
the municipal franchise and consequent rights and to that end it has incidentally changed the city's boundaries.
While in form this is merely an act redefining metes and bounds, if the allegations are established, the inescapable
human effect of this essay in geometry and geography is to despoil colored citizens, and only colored citizens, of
their theretofore enjoyed voting rights

For these reasons, the principal conclusions of the District Court and the Court of Appeals are clearly erroneous
and the decision below must be

Reversed.

MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER, concurring.

I concur in the Court's judgment, but not in the whole of its opinion. It seems to me that the decision should be
rested not on the Fifteenth Amendment, but rather on the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amend-
ment to the Constitution. I am doubtful that the averments of the complaint, taken for present purposes to
be true, show a purpose by Act No. 140 to abridge petitioners' "right ... to vote" in the Fifteenth Amendment
sense. It seems to me that the "right ... to vote" that is guaranteed by the Fifteenth Amendment is but the same
right to vote as is enjoyed by all others within the same election precinct, ward or other political division. And,
inasmuch as no one has the right to vote in a political division, or in a local election concerning only an area in
which he does not reside, it would seem to follow that one's right to vote in Division A is not abridged by a redis-
tricting that places his residence in Division B if he there enjoys the same voting privileges as all others in that
Division, even though the redistricting was done by the State for the purpose of placing a racial group of citizens
in Division B ...
§954 | REDISTRICTING AND RACE

But it does seem clear to me that accomplishment of a State's purpose -- to use the Court's phrase -- of "fencing
Negro citizens out of" Division A and into Division B is an unlawful segregation of races of citizens, in violation
of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Brown v. Board of Education (1954), Cooper v.
Aaron (1958), and, as stated, I would think the decision should be rested on that ground -- which, incidentally,
clearly would not involve, just as the cited cases did not involve, the Colegrove problem.

JUSTICE BRENNAN announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion of the Court with
respect to Parts I, II, III-A, III-B, IV-A, and V, an opinion with respect to Part III-C, in which JUSTICE MAR-
SHALL, JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and JUSTICE STEVENS join, and an opinion with respect to Part IV-B, in
which JUSTICE WHITE joins.

This case requires that we construe for the first time § 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended June 29,
1982. 42 U.S.C. § 1973. The specific question to be decided is whether the three-judge District Court, convened
in the Eastern District of North Carolina pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2284(a) and 42 U.S.C. § 1973c, correctly held
that the use in a legislative redistricting plan of multimember districts in five North Carolina legislative districts
violated § 2 by impairing the opportunity of black voters "to participate in the political process and to elect rep-
resentatives of their choice." § 2(b), 96 Stat. 134.

...

Preliminarily, the [District] court found that black citizens constituted a distinct population and registered-voter
minority in each challenged district. The court noted that, at the time the multimember districts were created,
there were concentrations of black citizens within the boundaries of each that were sufficiently large and con-
tiguous to constitute effective voting majorities in single-member districts lying wholly within the boundaries
of the multimember districts. With respect to the challenged single-member district, Senate District No. 2, the
                                                                                                            REDISTRICTING AND RACE | 955

court also found that there existed a concentration of black citizens within its boundaries and within those of
adjoining Senate District No. 6 that was sufficient in numbers and in contiguity to constitute an effective voting
majority in a single-member district. The District Court then proceeded to find that the following circumstances
combined with the multimember districting scheme to result in the dilution of black citizens' votes.

Based on these findings, the court declared the contested portions of the 1982 redistricting plan violative of § 2,
and enjoined appellants from conducting elections pursuant to those portions of the plan ... We noted probable
jurisdiction, 471 U.S. 1064 (1985), and now affirm with respect to all of the districts except House District 23.
With regard to District 23, the judgment of the District Court is reversed.

...

Because loss of political power through vote dilution is distinct from the mere inability to win a particular elec-
tion, Whitcomb (1971), a pattern of racial bloc voting that extends over a period of time is more probative of a
claim that a district experiences legally significant polarization than are the results of a single election ...

...

Summary

In sum, we would hold that the legal concept of racially polarized voting, as it relates to claims of vote dilution,
refers only to the existence of a correlation between the race of voters and the selection of certain candidates.
Plaintiffs need not prove causation or intent in order to prove a prima facie case of racial bloc voting, and defen-
dants may not rebut that case with evidence of causation or intent.

...

The District Court in this case carefully considered the totality of the circumstances and found that, in each
district, racially polarized voting; the legacy of official discrimination in voting matters, education, housing,
employment, and health services; and the persistence of campaign appeals to racial prejudice acted in concert
with the multimember districting scheme to impair the ability of geographically insular and politically cohesive
groups of black voters to participate equally in the political process and to elect candidates of their choice. It
found that the success a few black candidates have enjoyed in these districts is too recent, too limited, and, with
regard to the 1982 elections, perhaps too aberrational, to disprove its conclusion. Excepting House District 23,
with respect to which the District Court committed legal error, see supra, at Thornburg v. Gingles (1986), we
affirm the District Court's judgment. We cannot say that the District Court, composed of local judges who are
well acquainted with the political realities of the State, clearly erred in concluding that use of a multimember
electoral structure has caused black voters in the districts other than House District 23 to have less opportunity
than white voters to elect representatives of their choice.

Shaw v. Reno

509 U.S. 630 (1993)

    Decision: Reversed
    Majority: O'Connor, joined by Rehnquist, Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas
    Dissent: White, joined by Blackmun, Stevens, and Souter

O'Connor, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

This case involves two of the most complex and sensitive issues this Court has faced in recent years: the meaning
of the constitutional "right" to vote, and the propriety of racebased state legislation designed to benefit mem-
bers of historically disadvantaged racial minority groups. As a result of the 1990 census, North Carolina became
entitled to a 12th seat in the United States House of Representatives. The General Assembly enacted a reappor-
tionment plan that included one majority-black congressional district. After the Attorney General of the United
States objected to the plan pursuant to § 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 79 Stat. 439, as amended, 42 U.
S. C. § 1973c, the General Assembly passed new legislation creating a second majority-black district. Appellants
allege that the revised plan, which contains district boundary lines of dramatically irregular shape, constitutes
an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The question before us is whether appellants have stated a cognizable
claim.

The voting age population of North Carolina is approximately 78% white, 20% black, and 1% Native American;
the remaining 1% is predominantly Asian. App. to Brief for Federal Appellees 16a. The black population is rela-
tively dispersed; blacks constitute a majority of the general population in only 5 of the State's 100 counties. Brief
for Appellants 57. Geographically, the State divides into three regions: the eastern Coastal Plain, the central Pied-
mont Plateau, and the western mountains. H. Lefler & A. Newsom, The History of a Southern State: North
Carolina 18-22 (3d ed. 1973). The largest concentrations of black citizens live in the Coastal Plain, primarily in
the northern part. O. Gade & H. Stillwell, North Carolina: People and Environments 65-68 (1986).

Forty of North Carolina's one hundred counties are covered by § 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U. S. C.
§ 1973c, which prohibits a jurisdiction subject to its provisions from implementing changes in a "standard, prac-
                                                                                                             REDISTRICTING AND RACE | 957

tice, or procedure with respect to voting" without federal authorization, ibid. ... Because the General Assembly's
reapportionment plan affected the covered counties, the parties agree that § 5 applied. Tr. of Oral Arg. 14, 27-29.
The State chose to submit its plan to the Attorney General for preclearance.

The Attorney General, acting through the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division, interposed
a formal objection to the General Assembly's plan. The Attorney General specifically objected to the configu-
ration of boundary lines drawn in the south-central to southeastern region of the State. In the Attorney Gen-
eral's view, the General Assembly could have created a second majorityminority district "to give effect to black
and Native American voting strength in this area" by using boundary lines "no more irregular than [those]
found elsewhere in the proposed plan," but failed to do so for "pretextual reasons." See App. to Brief for Federal
Appellees lOa-lla.

... Instead, the General Assembly enacted a revised redistricting plan, 1991 N. C. Extra Sess. Laws, ch. 7, that
included a second majority-black district. The General Assembly located the second district not in the south-
central to southeastern part of the State, but in the north-central region along Interstate 85.

The first of the two majority-black districts contained in the revised plan, District 1, is somewhat hook shaped.
Centered in the northeast portion of the State, it moves southward until it tapers to a narrow band; then, with
finger-like extensions, it reaches far into the southernmost part of the State near the South Carolina border. Dis-
trict 1 has been compared to a "Rorschach ink-blot test," Shaw v. Barr (1992) (Voorhees, C. J., concurring in
part and dissenting in part), and a "bug splattered on a windshield," Wall Street Journal, Feb. 4, 1992, p. A14.

The second majority-black district, District 12, is even more unusually shaped. It is approximately 160 miles
long and, for much of its length, no wider than the 1-85 corridor. It winds in snakelike fashion through tobacco
country, financial centers, and manufacturing areas "until it gobbles in enough enclaves of black neighbor-
hoods." 808 F. Supp., at 476-477 (Voorhees, C. J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Northbound and
southbound drivers on 1-85 sometimes find themselves in separate districts in one county, only to "trade" dis-
tricts when they enter the next county. Of the 10 counties through which District 12 passes, 5 are cut into 3
different districts; even towns are divided. At one point the district remains contiguous only because it intersects
at a single point with two other districts before crossing over them. See Brief for Republican National Commit-
tee as Amicus Curiae 14-15 ...

The Attorney General did not object to the General Assembly's revised plan. But numerous North Carolinians
did ... alleging that the plan constituted an unconstitutional political gerrymander under Davis v. Bandemer
(1986). That claim was dismissed, see Pope v. Blue (1992), and this Court summarily affirmed

Shortly after the complaint in Pope v. Blue was filed, appellants instituted the present action in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. Appellants alleged not that the revised plan con-
stituted a political gerrymander, nor that it violated the "one person, one vote" principle, see Reynolds v. Sims
(1964), but that the State had created an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.

...
958 | REDISTRICTING AND RACE

Appellants contended that the General Assembly's revised reapportionment plan violated several provisions of
the United States Constitution, including the Fourteenth Amendment. They alleged that the General Assembly
deliberately "create[d] two Congressional Districts in which a majority of black voters was concentrated arbitrar-
ily-without regard to any other considerations, such as compactness, contiguousness, geographical boundaries,
or political subdivisions" with the purpose "to create Congressional Districts along racial lines" and to assure the
election of two black representatives to Congress. App. to Juris. Statement 102a.

...

By a 2-to-1 vote, the District Court also dismissed the complaint against the state appellees. The majority found
no support for appellants' contentions that race-based districting is prohibited by Article I, § 4, or Article I, § 2,
of the Constitution, or by the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

...

We noted probable jurisdiction. 506 U. S. 1019 (1992).

"The right to vote freely for the candidate of one's choice is of the essence of a democratic society.
..." Reynolds v. Sims (1964). For much of our Nation's history, that right sadly has been denied to many because
of race. The Fifteenth Amendment, ratified in 1870 after a bloody Civil War, promised unequivocally that "[t]he
right of citizens of the United States to vote" no longer would be "denied or abridged ... by any State on account
of race, color, or previous condition of servitude." U. S. Const., Amdt. 15, § 1.

But "[a] number of states ... refused to take no for an answer and continued to circumvent the fifteenth amend-
ment's prohibition through the use of both subtle and blunt instruments, perpetuating ugly patterns of perva-
sive racial discrimination." Blumstein, Defining and Proving Race Discrimination: Perspectives on the Purpose
V s. Results Approach from the Voting Rights Act, 69 Va. L. Rev. 633, 637 (1983) ...

Another of the weapons in the States' arsenal was the racial gerrymander-"the deliberate and arbitrary distortion
of district boundaries ... for [racial] purposes." Bandemer (1986) (Powell, J., concurring in part and dissenting
in part) ...

But it soon became apparent that guaranteeing equal access to the polls would not suffice to root out other
racially discriminatory voting practices. Drawing on the "one person, one vote" principle, this Court recognized
that "[t]he right to vote can be affected by a dilution of voting power as well as by an absolute prohibition on
casting a ballot." ... Accordingly, the Court held that such schemes violate the Fourteenth Amendment when
they are adopted with a discriminatory purpose and have the effect of diluting minority voting strength. Con-
gress, too, responded to the problem of vote dilution. In 1982, it amended § 2 of the Voting Rights Act to pro-
hibit legislation that results in the dilution of a minority group's voting strength, regardless of the legislature's
intent. 42 U. S. C. § 1973; see Thornburg v. Gingles (1986) (applying amended § 2 to vote-dilution claim involv-
ing multimember districts); see also Voinovich v. Quilter (1993) (single-member districts).

It is against this background that we confront the questions presented here. In our view, the District Court
properly dismissed appellants' claims against the federal appellees. Our focus is on appellants' claim that the
State engaged in unconstitutional racial gerrymandering. That argument strikes a powerful historical chord: It
is unsettling how closely the North Carolina plan resembles the most egregious racial gerrymanders of the past.

An understanding of the nature of appellants' claim is critical to our resolution of the case. In their complaint,
appellants did not claim that the General Assembly's reapportionment plan unconstitutionally "diluted" white
voting strength. They did not even claim to be white. Rather, appellants' complaint alleged that the deliberate
segregation of voters into separate districts on the basis of race violated their constitutional right to participate
in a "color-blind" electoral process.

Despite their invocation of the ideal of a "color-blind" Constitution, see Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) (Harlan, J.,
dissenting), appellants appear to concede that race-conscious redistricting is not always unconstitutional. See Tr.
of Oral Arg. 16-19. That concession is wise: This Court never has held that race-conscious state decisionmaking
is impermissible in all circumstances. What appellants object to is redistricting legislation that is so extremely
irregular on its face that it rationally can be viewed only as an effort to segregate the races for purposes of voting,
without regard for traditional districting principles and without sufficiently compelling justification. For the
reasons that follow, we conclude that appellants have stated a claim upon which relief can be granted under the
Equal Protection Clause.

The Equal Protection Clause provides that "[n]o State shall ... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the
equal protection of the laws." U. S. Const., Arndt. 14, § 1. Its central purpose is to prevent the States from pur-
posefully discriminating between individuals on the basis of race ...

Classifications of citizens solely on the basis of race "are by their very nature odious to a free people whose insti-
tutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality." ... Accordingly, we have held that the Fourteenth Amend-
ment requires state legislation that expressly distinguishes among citizens because of their race to be narrowly
tailored to further a compelling governmental interest.

Appellants contend that redistricting legislation that is so bizarre on its face that it is "unexplainable on grounds
other than race," Arlington Heights, supra, at 266, demands the same close scrutiny that we give other state laws
that classify citizens by race. Our voting rights precedents support that conclusion.

...

... Gomillion thus supports appellants' contention that district lines obviously drawn for the purpose of sepa-
rating voters by race require careful scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause regardless of the motivations
underlying their adoption.

...

Put differently, we believe that reapportionment is one area in which appearances do matter. A reapportionment
plan that includes in one district individuals who belong to the same race, but who are otherwise widely sep-
arated by geographical and political boundaries, and who may have little in common with one another but
960 | REDISTRICTING AND RACE

the color of their skin, bears an uncomfortable resemblance to political apartheid. It reinforces the perception
that members of the same racial group-regardless of their age, education, economic status, or the community
in which they live-think alike, share the same political interests, and will prefer the same candidates at the polls.
We have rejected such perceptions elsewhere as impermissible racial stereotypes ... By perpetuating such notions,
a racial gerrymander may exacerbate the very patterns of racial bloc voting that majority-minority districting is
sometimes said to counteract.

The message that such districting sends to elected representatives is equally pernicious. When a district obvi-
ously is created solely to effectuate the perceived common interests of one racial group, elected officials are more
likely to believe that their primary obligation is to represent only the members of that group, rather than their
constituency as a whole. This is altogether antithetical to our system of representative democracy ...

For these reasons, we conclude that a plaintiff challenging a reapportionment statute under the Equal Protection
Clause may state a claim by alleging that the legislation, though race neutral on its face, rationally cannot be
understood as anything other than an effort to separate voters into different districts on the basis of race, and that
the separation lacks sufficient justification. It is unnecessary for us to decide whether or how a reapportionment
plan that, on its face, can be explained in nonracial terms successfully could be challenged. Thus, we express no
view as to whether "the intentional creation of majority-minority districts, without more," always gives rise to an
equal protection claim. Post, at 668 (WHITE, J., dissenting). We hold only that, on the facts of this case, appel-
lants have stated a claim sufficient to defeat the state appellees' motion to dismiss.

...

Racial classifications of any sort pose the risk of lasting harm to our society. They reinforce the belief, held by
too many for too much of our history, that individuals should be judged by the color of their skin. Racial classifi-
cations with respect to voting carry particular dangers. Racial gerrymandering, even for remedial purposes, may
balkanize us into competing racial factions; it threatens to carry us further from the goal of a political system in
which race no longer matters-a goal that the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments embody, and to which the
Nation continues to aspire. It is for these reasons that race-based districting by our state legislatures demands
close judicial scrutiny.

In this case, the Attorney General suggested that North Carolina could have created a reasonably compact sec-
ond majority-minority district in the south-central to southeastern part of the State. We express no view as to
whether appellants successfully could have challenged such a district under the Fourteenth Amendment. We
also do not decide whether appellants' complaint stated a claim under constitutional provisions other than the
Fourteenth Amendment. Today we hold only that appellants have stated a claim under the Equal Protection
Clause by alleging that the North Carolina General Assembly adopted a reapportionment scheme so irrational
on its face that it can be understood only as an effort to segregate voters into separate voting districts because of
their race, and that the separation lacks sufficient justification. If the allegation of racial gerrymandering remains
uncontradicted, the District Court further must determine whether the North Carolina plan is narrowly tai-
lored to further a compelling governmental interest.

Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the District Court and remand the case for further proceedings consis-
tent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Miller v. Johnson

515 U.S. 900 (1995)

JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.

The constitutionality of Georgia's congressional redistricting plan is at issue here. In Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S.
630 (1993), we held that a plaintiff states a claim under the Equal Protection Clause by alleging that a state redis-
tricting plan, on its face, has no rational explanation save as an effort to separate voters on the basis of race. The
question we now decide is whether Georgia's new Eleventh District gives rise to a valid equal protection claim
under the principles announced in Shaw, and, if so, whether it can be sustained nonetheless as narrowly tailored
to serve a compelling governmental interest.

The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that no State shall "deny to any person
within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." U.S. Const., Amdt. 14, 1. Its central mandate is racial
neutrality in governmental decisionmaking. The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment pro-
vides that no State shall "deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." U.S. Const.,
Amdt. 14, 1. Its central mandate is racial neutrality in governmental decisionmaking ... The Equal Protection
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that no State shall "deny to any person within its jurisdiction the
equal protection of the laws." U.S. Const., Amdt. 14, 1. Its central mandate is racial neutrality in governmental
decisionmaking.

In Shaw v. Reno, we recognized that these equal protection principles govern a State's drawing of congressional
districts, though, as our cautious approach there discloses, application of these principles to electoral districting
is a most delicate task ...
962 | REDISTRICTING AND RACE

This litigation requires us to apply the principles articulated in Shaw to the most recent congressional redistrict-
ing plan enacted by the State of Georgia ...

In 1965, the Attorney General designated Georgia a covered jurisdiction under § 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act
(Act) ... In consequence, § 5 of the Act requires Georgia to obtain either administrative preclearance by the
Attorney General or approval by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia of any change
in a "standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting" made after November 1, 1964 ... The preclearance
mechanism applies to congressional redistricting plans, and requires that the proposed change "not have the pur-
pose and will not have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color." ..."[T]he
purpose of § 5 has always been to insure that no voting-procedure changes would be made that would lead to a
retrogression in the position of racial minorities with respect to their effective exercise of the electoral franchise."
...

... Citing much evidence of the legislature's purpose and intent in creating the final plan, as well as the irregular
shape of the district (in particular several appendages drawn for the obvious purpose of putting black popula-
tions into the district), the court found that race was the overriding and predominant force in the districting
determination. The [District] court proceeded to apply strict scrutiny. Though rejecting proportional represen-
tation as a compelling interest, it was willing to assume that compliance with the Act would be a compelling
interest ... [T]he court found that the Act did not require three majority-black districts, and that Georgia's plan
for that reason was not narrowly tailored to the goal of complying with the Act ...

Finding that the "evidence of the General Assembly's intent to racially gerrymander the Eleventh District is over-
whelming, and practically stipulated by the parties involved," the District Court held that race was the predom-
inant, overriding factor in drawing the Eleventh District ...

Appellants do not take issue with the court's factual finding of this racial motivation. Rather, they contend that
evidence of a legislature's deliberate classification of voters on the basis of race cannot alone suffice to state a
claim under Shaw. They argue that, regardless of the legislature's purposes, a plaintiff must demonstrate that a
district's shape is so bizarre that it is unexplainable other than on the basis of race, and that appellees failed to
make that showing here. Appellants' conception of the constitutional violation misapprehends our holding in
Shaw and the equal protection precedent upon which Shaw relied ...

Our circumspect approach and narrow holding in Shaw did not erect an artificial rule barring accepted equal
protection analysis in other redistricting cases. Shape is relevant not because bizarreness is a necessary element of
the constitutional wrong or a threshold requirement of proof, but because it may be persuasive circumstantial
evidence that race for its own sake, and not other districting principles, was the legislature's dominant and con-
trolling rationale in drawing its district lines. The logical implication, as courts applying Shaw have recognized,
is that parties may rely on evidence other than bizarreness to establish race-based districting ...

In sum, we make clear that parties alleging that a State has assigned voters on the basis of race are neither confined
in their proof to evidence regarding the district's geometry and makeup nor required to make a threshold show-
ing of bizarreness. Today's litigation requires us further to consider the requirements of the proof necessary to
sustain this equal protection challenge ...
                                                                                                            REDISTRICTING AND RACE | 963

The courts, in assessing the sufficiency of a challenge to a districting plan, must be sensitive to the complex inter-
play of forces that enter a legislature's redistricting calculus. Redistricting legislatures will, for example, almost
always be aware of racial demographics; but it does not follow that race predominates in the redistricting process
...

The distinction between being aware of racial considerations and being motivated by them may be difficult to
make. This evidentiary difficulty, together with the sensitive nature of redistricting and the presumption of good
faith that must be accorded legislative enactments, requires courts to exercise extraordinary caution in adjudi-
cating claims that a State has drawn district lines on the basis of race. The plaintiff's burden is to show, either
through circumstantial evidence of a district's shape and demographics or more direct evidence going to leg-
islative purpose, that race was the predominant factor motivating the legislature's decision to place a significant
number of voters within or without a particular district. To make this showing, a plaintiff must prove that the
legislature subordinated traditional race-neutral districting principles, including but not limited to compactness,
contiguity, and respect for political subdivisions or communities defined by actual shared interests, to racial con-
siderations. Where these or other race-neutral considerations are the basis for redistricting legislation, and are
not subordinated to race, a State can "defeat a claim that a district has been gerrymandered on racial lines." ...

In our view, the District Court applied the correct analysis, and its finding that race was the predominant factor
motivating the drawing of the Eleventh District was not clearly erroneous. The court found it was "exceedingly
obvious" from the shape of the Eleventh District, together with the relevant racial demographics, that the draw-
ing of narrow land bridges to incorporate within the district outlying appendages containing nearly 80% of the
district's total black population was a deliberate attempt to bring black populations into the district ...

To satisfy strict scrutiny, the State must demonstrate that its districting legislation is narrowly tailored to achieve
a compelling interest ... We do not accept the contention that the State has a compelling interest in complying
with whatever preclearance mandates the Justice Department issues. When a state governmental entity seeks to
justify race-based remedies to cure the effects of past discrimination, we do not accept the government's mere
assertion that the remedial action is required. Rather, we insist on a strong basis in evidence of the harm being
remedied ...

Instead of grounding its objections on evidence of a discriminatory purpose, it would appear the Government
was driven by its policy of maximizing majority-black districts. Although the Government now disavows having
had policy ... and seems to concede its impropriety, the District Court's well-documented factual finding was
that the Department did adopt a maximization policy and followed it in objecting to Georgia's first two plans ...

The Act, and its grant of authority to the federal courts to uncover official efforts to abridge minorities' right to
vote, has been of vital importance in eradicating invidious discrimination from the electoral process and enhanc-
ing the legitimacy of our political institutions. Only if our political system and our society cleanse themselves
of that discrimination will all members of the polity share an equal opportunity to gain public office regardless
of race. As a Nation we share both the obligation and the aspiration of working toward this end. The end is
§964 | REDISTRICTING AND RACE

neither assured nor well served, however, by carving electorates into racial blocs."If our society is to continue to
progress as a multiracial democracy, it must recognize that the automatic invocation of race stereotypes retards
that progress and causes continued hurt and injury." ...

It takes a shortsighted and unauthorized view of the Voting Rights Act to invoke that statute, which has played
a decisive role in redressing some of our worst forms of discrimination, to demand the very racial stereotyping
the Fourteenth Amendment forbids.

The judgment of the District Court is affirmed, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent
with this decision.

It is so ordered.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which THE
CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE KENNEDY join.

This is the latest in a series of appeals involving racial gerrymandering challenges to state redistricting efforts in
the wake of the 1990 census ... That census revealed a population increase, largely in urban minority popula-
tions, that entitled Texas to three additional congressional seats. In response, and with a view to complying with
the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA), 79 Stat. 437, as amended, 42 U. S. C. § 1973 et seq., the Texas Legislature
promulgated a redistricting plan that, among other things, created District 30, a new majority-African-Ameri-
can district in Dallas County; created District 29, a new majority-Hispanic district in and around Houston in
Harris County; and reconfigured District 18, which is adjacent to District 29, to make it a majority- African-
American district. The Department of Justice precleared that plan under VRA § 5 in 1991, and it was used in
the 1992 congressional elections ...
                                                                                                            REDISTRICTING AND RACE | 965

The plaintiffs, six Texas voters, challenged the plan, alleging that 24 of Texas' 30 congressional districts constitute
racial gerrymanders in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The three-judge United States District Court
for the Southern District of Texas held Districts 18, 29, and 30 unconstitutional ...

We must now determine whether those districts are subject to strict scrutiny. Our precedents have used a variety
of formulations to describe the threshold for the application of strict scrutiny. Strict scrutiny applies where
"redistricting legislation ... is so extremely irregular on its face that it rationally can be viewed only as an effort to
segregate the races for purposes of voting, without regard for traditional districting principles," Shaw I, ...

Strict scrutiny does not apply merely because redistricting is performed with consciousness of race. Nor does
it apply to all cases of intentional creation of majority-minority districts ... For strict scrutiny to apply, the
plaintiffs must prove that other, legitimate districting principles were "subordinated" to race. Miller (1995).
By that, we mean that race must be "the predominant factor motivating the legislature's [redistricting] deci-
sion." Ibid. (emphasis added) ...

The present suit is a mixed motive suit. The appellants concede that one of Texas' goals in creating the three dis-
tricts at issue was to produce majority-minority districts, but they also cite evidence that other goals, particularly
incumbency protection also played a role in the drawing of the district lines ... A careful review is, therefore, nec-
essary to determine whether these districts are subject to strict scrutiny ...

We begin with general findings and evidence regarding the redistricting plan's respect for traditional districting
principles, the legislators' expressed motivations, and the methods used in the redistricting process ...

These findings-that the State substantially neglected traditional districting criteria such as compactness, that it
was committed from the outset to creating majority-minority districts, and that it manipulated district lines to
exploit unprecedentedly detailed racial data-together weigh in favor of the application of strict scrutiny. We do
not hold that any one of these factors is independently sufficient to require strict scrutiny. The Constitution
does not mandate regularity of district shape, see Shaw I (1993), and the neglect of traditional districting crite-
ria is merely necessary, not sufficient. For strict scrutiny to apply, traditional districting criteria must be subordi­
nated to race. Miller (1995). Nor, as we have emphasized, is the decision to create a majority-minority district
objectionable in and of itself.

...

Strict scrutiny would not be appropriate if race-neutral, traditional districting considerations predominated over
racial ones. We have not subjected political gerrymandering to strict scrutiny ... And we have recognized incum-
bency protection, at least in the limited form of "avoiding contests between incumbent[s]," as a legitimate state
goal ... Because it is clear that race was not the only factor that motivated the legislature to draw irregular district
lines, we must scrutinize each challenged district to determine whether the District Court's conclusion that race
predominated over legitimate districting considerations, including incumbency, can be sustained.

[The Court determines that strict scrutiny applies for Districts 18, 29 and 30.]
966 | REDISTRICTING AND RACE

Having concluded that strict scrutiny applies, we must determine whether the racial classifications embodied in
any of the three districts are narrowly tailored to further a compelling state interest. Appellants point to three
compelling interests: the interest in avoiding liability under the "results" test of VRA § 2(b), the interest in rem-
edying past and present racial discrimination, and the "non retrogression" principle of VRA § 5 (for District 18
only) ...

A State's interest in remedying discrimination is compelling when two conditions are satisfied. First, the discrim-
ination that the State seeks to remedy must be specific, "identified discrimination"; second, the State "must have
had a `strong basis in evidence' to conclude that remedial action was necessary, `before it embarks on an affirma-
tive action program.'" Shaw II, ante, at 910 (citations omitted). Here, the only current problem that appellants
cite as in need of remediation is alleged vote dilution as a consequence of racial bloc voting, the same concern that
underlies their VRA § 2 compliance defense, which we have assumed to be valid for purposes of this opinion.
We have indicated that such problems will not justify race-based districting unless "the State employ[s] sound
districting principles, and.., the affected racial group's residential patterns afford the opportunity of creating dis-
tricts in which they will be in the majority." Shaw I (1993), (internal quotation marks omitted). Once that stan-
dard is applied, our agreement with the District Court's finding that these districts are not narrowly tailored to
comply with § 2 forecloses this line of defense ...

Our legitimacy requires, above all, that we adhere to stare decisis, especially in such sensitive political contexts as
the present, where partisan controversy abounds. Legislators and district courts nationwide have modified their
practices-or, rather, reembraced the traditional districting practices that were almost universally followed before
the 1990 census-in response to Shaw I. Those practices and our precedents, which acknowledge voters as more
than mere racial statistics, play an important role in defining the political identity of the American voter. Our
Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence evinces a commitment to eliminate unnecessary and excessive govern-
mental use and reinforcement of racial stereotypes ...

We decline to retreat from that commitment today.

The judgment of the District Court is

Affirmed.

JUSTICE KAGAN delivered the opinion of the Court.

The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment limits racial gerrymanders in legislative districting
plans. It prevents a State, in the absence of "sufficient justification," from "separating its citizens into different
voting districts on the basis of race." ...

When a voter sues state officials for drawing such race-based lines, our decisions call for a two-step analysis ...

First, the plaintiff must prove that "race was the predominant factor motivating the legislature's decision to place
a significant number of voters within or without a particular district." Miller v. Johnson (1995). That entails
demonstrating that the legislature "subordinated" other factors--compactness, respect for political subdivi-
sions, partisan advantage, what have you--to "racial considerations." Ibid. The plaintiff may make the required
showing through "direct evidence" of legislative intent, "circumstantial evidence of a district's shape and demo-
graphics," or a mix of both ...

Second, if racial considerations predominated over others, the design of the district must withstand strict
scrutiny. See Bethune-Hill (2017). The burden thus shifts to the State to prove that its race-based sorting of vot-
ers serves a "compelling interest" and is "narrowly tailored" to that end. Ibid. This Court has long assumed that
one compelling interest is complying with operative provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA or Act)
...

This case concerns North Carolina's most recent redrawing of two congressional districts, both of which have
long included substantial populations of black voters. In its current incarnation, District 1 is anchored in the
northeastern part of the State, with appendages stretching both south and west (the latter into Durham). Dis-
trict 12 begins in the south-central part of the State (where it takes in a large part of Charlotte) and then travels
northeast, zig-zagging much of the way to the State's northern border ...

With that out of the way, we turn to the merits of this case, beginning (appropriately enough) with District 1.
As noted above, the court below found that race furnished the predominant rationale for that district's redesign.
See supra, at 6-7. And it held that the State's interest in complying with the VRA could not justify that consid-
eration of race. See supra, at 7. We uphold both conclusions.
Uncontested evidence in the record shows that the State's mapmakers, in considering District 1, purposefully
established a racial target: African-Americans should make up no less than a majority of the voting-age pop-
ulation. Senator Rucho and Representative Lewis were not coy in expressing that goal. They repeatedly told
their colleagues that District 1 had to be majority-minority, so as to comply with the VRA. During a Senate
debate, for example, Rucho explained that District 1 "must include a sufficient number of African-Americans"
to make it "a majority black district." Similarly, Lewis informed the House and Senate redistricting committees
that the district must have "a majority black voting age population." And that objective was communicated in
no uncertain terms to the legislators' consultant. Dr. Hofeller testified multiple times at trial that Rucho and
Lewis instructed him "to draw [District 1] with a [BVAP] in excess of 50 percent." ...
970 | REDISTRICTING AND RACE

Faced with this body of evidence--showing an announced racial target that subordinated other districting crite-
ria and produced boundaries amplifying divisions between blacks and whites--the District Court did not clearly
err in finding that race predominated in drawing District 1. Indeed, as all three judges recognized, the court could
hardly have concluded anything but ...

The more substantial question is whether District 1 can survive the strict scrutiny applied to racial gerrymanders.
As noted earlier, we have long assumed that complying with the VRA is a compelling interest. And we have held
that race-based districting is narrowly tailored to that objective if a State had "good reasons" for thinking that
the Act demanded such steps.

North Carolina argues that District 1 passes muster under that standard: The General Assembly (so says the
State) had "good reasons to believe it needed to draw [District 1] as a majority-minority district to avoid Section
2 liability" for vote dilution. We now turn to that defense ...

In sum: Although States enjoy leeway to take race-based actions reasonably judged necessary under a proper
interpretation of the VRA, that latitude cannot rescue District 1. We by no means "insist that a state legislature,
when redistricting, determine precisely what percent minority population [§2 of the VRA] demands." Ibid. But
neither will we approve a racial gerrymander whose necessity is supported by no evidence and whose raison d'être
is a legal mistake. Accordingly, we uphold the District Court's conclusion that North Carolina's use of race as
the predominant factor in designing District 1 does not withstand strict scrutiny.

We now look west to District 12, making its fifth (!) appearance before this Court. This time, the district's legal-
ity turns, and turns solely, on which of two possible reasons predominantly explains its most recent reconfigu-
ration. The plaintiffs contended at trial that the General Assembly chose voters for District 12, as for District 1,
because of their race; more particularly, they urged that the Assembly intentionally increased District 12's BVAP
in the name of ensuring preclearance under the VRA's §5. But North Carolina declined to mount any defense
(similar to the one we have just considered for District 1) that §5's requirements in fact justified race-based
changes to District 12--perhaps because §5 could not reasonably be understood to have done so ... Instead,
the State altogether denied that racial considerations accounted for (or, indeed, played the slightest role in) Dis-
trict 12's redesign. According to the State's version of events, Senator Rucho, Representative Lewis, and Dr.
Hofeller moved voters in and out of the district as part of a "strictly" political gerrymander, without regard to
race. 6 Record 1011. The mapmakers drew their lines, in other words, to "pack" District 12 with Democrats,
not African-Americans. After hearing evidence supporting both parties' accounts, the District Court accepted
the plaintiffs ...

Getting to the bottom of a dispute like this one poses special challenges for a trial court. In the more usual case
alleging a racial gerrymander--where no one has raised a partisanship defense--the court can make real headway
by exploring the challenged district's conformity to traditional districting principles, such as compactness and
respect for county lines. In Shaw II, for example, this Court emphasized the "highly irregular" shape of then-
District 12 in concluding that race predominated in its design. But such evidence loses much of its value when
the State asserts partisanship as a defense, because a bizarre shape--as of the new District 12--can arise from
a "political motivation" as well as a racial one. And crucially, political and racial reasons are capable of yielding

similar oddities in a district's boundaries. That is because, of course, "racial identification is highly correlated
with political affiliation." As a result of those redistricting realities, a trial court has a formidable task: It must
make "a sensitive inquiry" into all "circumstantial and direct evidence of intent" to assess whether the plaintiffs
have managed to disentangle race from politics and prove that the former drove a district's lines ...

Our job is different--and generally easier. As described earlier, we review a district court's finding as to racial
predominance only for clear error, except when the court made a legal mistake. Under that standard of review,
we affirm the court's finding so long as it is "plausible"; we reverse only when "left with the definite and firm
conviction that a mistake has been committed." And in deciding which side of that line to come down on, we
give singular deference to a trial court's judgments about the credibility of witnesses. That is proper, we have
explained, because the various cues that "bear so heavily on the listener's understanding of and belief in what is
said" are lost on an appellate court later sifting through a paper record ...

In light of those principles, we uphold the District Court's finding of racial predominance respecting District
12. The evidence offered at trial, including live witness testimony subject to credibility determinations, ade-
quately supports the conclusion that race, not politics, accounted for the district's reconfiguration. And no error
of law infected that judgment: Contrary to North Carolina's view, the District Court had no call to dismiss this
challenge just because the plaintiffs did not proffer an alternative design for District 12 as circumstantial evi-
dence of the legislature's intent ...

The State mounts a final, legal rather than factual, attack on the District Court's finding of racial predominance.
When race and politics are competing explanations of a district's lines, argues North Carolina, the party chal-
lenging the district must introduce a particular kind of circumstantial evidence: "an alternative [map] that
achieves the legislature's political objectives while improving racial balance." Brief for Appellants 31 (emphasis
deleted). That is true, the State says, irrespective of what other evidence is in the case--so even if the plaintiff
offers powerful direct proof that the legislature adopted the map it did for racial reasons. Because the plaintiffs
here (as all agree) did not present such a counter-map, North Carolina concludes that they cannot prevail. The
dissent echoes that argument ...

We have no doubt that an alternative districting plan, of the kind North Carolina describes, can serve as key
evidence in a race-versus-politics dispute. One, often highly persuasive way to disprove a State's contention that
politics drove a district's lines is to show that the legislature had the capacity to accomplish all its partisan goals
without moving so many members of a minority group into the district. If you were really sorting by politi-
cal behavior instead of skin color (so the argument goes) you would have done--or, at least, could just as well
have done--this. Such would-have, could-have, and (to round out the set) should-have arguments are a familiar
means of undermining a claim that an action was based on a permissible, rather than a prohibited, ground ...

But they are hardly the only means. Suppose that the plaintiff in a dispute like this one introduced scores of
leaked emails from state officials instructing their mapmaker to pack as many black voters as possible into a dis-
trict, or telling him to make sure its BVAP hit 75%. Based on such evidence, a court could find that racial rather
than political factors predominated in a district's design, with or without an alternative map. And so too in
cases lacking that kind of smoking gun, as long as the evidence offered satisfies the plaintiff 's burden of proof.
972 | REDISTRICTING AND RACE

In Bush v. Vera, for example, this Court upheld a finding of racial predominance based on "substantial direct
evidence of the legislature's racial motivations"--including credible testimony from political figures and state-
ments made in a §5 preclearance submission--plus circumstantial evidence that redistricters had access to racial,
but not political, data at the "block-by-block level" needed to explain their "intricate" designs. See 517 U. S.,
at 960-963 (plurality opinion). Not a single Member of the Court thought that the absence of a counter-map
made any difference. Similarly, it does not matter in this case, where the plaintiffs' introduction of mostly direct
and some circumstantial evidence--documents issued in the redistricting process, testimony of government offi-
cials, expert analysis of demographic patterns--gave the District Court a sufficient basis, sans any map, to resolve
the race-or-politics question ...

North Carolina insists, however, that we have already said to the contrary--more particularly, that our decision
in Cromartie II imposed a non-negotiable "alternative-map requirement."

According to North Carolina, that passage [in Cromartie II] alone settles this case, because it makes an alterna-
tive map "essential" to a finding that District 12 (a majority-minority district in which race and partisanship are
correlated) was a racial gerrymander. Reply Brief 11. Once again, the dissent says the same.

But the reasoning of Cromartie II belies that reading. The Court's opinion nowhere attempts to explicate or
justify the categorical rule that the State claims to find there. (Certainly, the dissent's current defense of that
rule was nowhere in evidence.) And given the strangeness of that rule--which would treat a mere form of evi-
dence as the very substance of a constitutional claim--we cannot think that the Court adopted it without any
explanation. Still more, the entire thrust of the Cromartie II opinion runs counter to an inflexible counter-map
requirement. If the Court had adopted that rule, it would have had no need to weigh each piece of evidence in
the case and determine whether, taken together, they were "adequate" to show "the predominance of race in
the legislature's line-drawing process." 532 U. S., at 243-244. But that is exactly what Cromartie II did, over a
span of 20 pages and in exhaustive detail. Item by item, the Court discussed and dismantled the supposed proof,
both direct and circumstantial, of race-based redistricting. All that careful analysis would have been superflu-
ous--that dogged effort wasted--if the Court viewed the absence or inadequacy of a single form of evidence as
necessarily dooming a gerrymandering claim ...

In a case like Cromartie II--that is, one in which the plaintiffs had meager direct evidence of a racial gerrymander
and needed to rely on evidence of forgone alternatives--only maps of that kind could carry the day. But this
case is most unlike Cromartie II, even though it involves the same electoral district some twenty years on. This
case turned not on the possibility of creating more optimally constructed districts, but on direct evidence of the
General Assembly's intent in creating the actual District 12, including many hours of trial testimony subject to
credibility determinations. That evidence, the District Court plausibly found, itself satisfied the plaintiffs' bur-
den of debunking North Carolina's "it was really politics" defense; there was no need for an alternative map to
do the same job. And we pay our precedents no respect when we extend them far beyond the circumstances for
which they were designed ...

Applying a clear error standard, we uphold the District Court's conclusions that racial considerations predom-
inated in designing both District 1 and District 12. For District 12, that is all we must do, because North Car-
                                                                                                             REDISTRICTING AND RACE | 973

olina has made no attempt to justify race-based districting there. For District 1, we further uphold the District
Court's decision that §2 of the VRA gave North Carolina no good reason to reshuffle voters because of their
race. We accordingly affirm the judgment of the District Court.

It is so ordered.

Voting Districts and Partisan Gerrymandering

Rucho v. Common Cause

588 U.S. ___ (2019)

    Vote: 5-4
    Decision: Reversed
    Majority: Roberts, joined by Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh
    Dissent: Kagan, joined by Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor

Chief Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.

Voters and other plaintiffs in North Carolina and Maryland challenged their States' congressional districting
maps as unconstitutional partisan gerrymanders. The North Carolina plaintiffs complained that the State's dis-
tricting plan discriminated against Democrats; the Maryland plaintiffs complained that their State's plan dis-
criminated against Republicans. ...

These cases require us to consider once again whether claims of excessive partisanship in districting are "justicia-
ble" --that is, properly suited for resolution by the federal courts. This Court has not previously struck down
a districting plan as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander, and has struggled without success over the past
several decades to discern judicially manageable standards for deciding such claims. The districting plans at issue
here are highly partisan, by any measure. The question is whether the courts below appropriately exercised judi-
cial power when they found them unconstitutional as well.

The first case involves a challenge to the congressional redistricting plan enacted by the Republican-controlled
North Carolina General Assembly in 2016. The Republican legislators leading the redistricting effort instructed
their mapmaker to use political data to draw a map that would produce a congressional delegation of ten Repub-
licans and three Democrats. As one of the two Republicans chairing the redistricting committee stated, "I think
electing Republicans is better than electing Democrats. So I drew this map to help foster what I think is bet-
ter for the country." He further explained that the map was drawn with the aim of electing ten Republicans
and three Democrats because he did "not believe it [would be] possible to draw a map with 11 Republicans
and 2 Democrats." One Democratic state senator objected that entrenching the 10-3 advantage for Republicans
was not "fair, reasonable, [or] balanced" because, as recently as 2012, "Democratic congressional candidates had
received more votes on a statewide basis than Republican candidates." The General Assembly was not swayed
by that objection and approved the 2016 Plan by a party-line vote.

The plaintiffs challenged the 2016 Plan on multiple constitutional grounds. First, they alleged that the Plan vio-
lated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by intentionally diluting the electoral strength
of Democratic voters. Second, they claimed that the Plan violated their First Amendment rights by retaliat-
                                                                                                       PARTISAN GERRYMANDERING | 975

ing against supporters of Democratic candidates on the basis of their political beliefs. Third, they asserted that
the Plan usurped the right of "the People" to elect their preferred candidates for Congress, in violation of the
requirement in Article I, §2, of the Constitution that Members of the House of Representatives be chosen "by
the People of the several States." Finally, they alleged that the Plan violated the Elections Clause by exceeding the
State's delegated authority to prescribe the "Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections" for Members of
Congress.

After a four-day trial, the three-judge District Court unanimously concluded that the 2016 Plan violated the
Equal Protection Clause and Article I of the Constitution. The court further held, with Judge Osteen dis-
senting, that the Plan violated the First Amendment. Common Cause v. Rucho (2018). The defendants appealed
directly to this Court under 28 U. S. C. §1253.

While that appeal was pending, we decided Gill v. Whitford (2018), a partisan gerrymandering case out of Wis-
consin. In that case, we held that a plaintiff asserting a partisan gerrymandering claim based on a theory of vote
dilution must establish standing by showing he lives in an allegedly "cracked" or "packed" district. Id., at ___
(slip op., at 17). A "cracked" district is one in which a party's supporters are divided among multiple districts, so
that they fall short of a majority in each; a "packed" district is one in which a party's supporters are highly con-
centrated, so they win that district by a large margin, "wasting" many votes that would improve their chances in
others.

... On the merits, the court found that "the General Assembly's predominant intent was to discriminate against
voters who supported or were likely to support non-Republican candidates," and to "entrench Republican can-
didates" through widespread cracking and packing of Democratic voters. The court rejected the defendants'
arguments that the distribution of Republican and Democratic voters throughout North Carolina and the
interest in protecting incumbents neutrally explained the 2016 Plan's discriminatory effects. In the end, the Dis-
trict Court held that 12 of the 13 districts constituted partisan gerrymanders that violated the Equal Protection
Clause. ...

The second case before us is Lamone v. Benisek, In 2011, the Maryland Legislature --dominated by Democ-
rats--undertook to redraw the lines of that State's eight congressional districts. The Governor at the time,
Democrat Martin O'Malley, led the process. He appointed a redistricting committee to help redraw the map,
and asked Congressman Steny Hoyer, who has described himself as a "serial gerrymanderer," to advise the com-
mittee. The Governor later testified that his aim was to "use the redistricting process to change the overall com-
position of Maryland's congressional delegation to 7 Democrats and 1 Republican by flipping" one district."[A]
decision was made to go for the Sixth," which had been held by a Republican for nearly two decades. To achieve
the required equal population among districts, only about 10,000 residents needed to be removed from that dis-
trict. The 2011 Plan accomplished that by moving roughly 360,000 voters out of the Sixth District and moving
350,000 new voters in. Overall, the Plan reduced the number of registered Republicans in the Sixth District by
about 66,000 and increased the number of registered Democrats by about 24,000. The map was adopted by a
party-line vote. It was used in the 2012 election and succeeded in flipping the Sixth District. A Democrat has
held the seat ever since.
976 | PARTISAN GERRYMANDERING

In November 2013, three Maryland voters filed this lawsuit. They alleged that the 2011 Plan violated the First
Amendment, the Elections Clause, and Article I, §2, of the Constitution. After considerable procedural skir-
mishing and litigation over preliminary relief, the District Court entered summary judgment for the plaintiffs.
348 F. Supp. 3d 493 ...

... Chief Justice Marshall famously wrote that it is "the province and duty of the judicial department to say
what the law is." Marbury v. Madison (1803). Sometimes, however, "the law is that the judicial department has
no business entertaining the claim of unlawfulness--because the question is entrusted to one of the political
branches or involves no judicially enforceable rights." Vieth v. Jubelirer (2004) (plurality opinion). In such a case
the claim is said to present a "political question" and to be nonjusticiable--outside the courts' competence and
therefore beyond the courts' jurisdiction. Baker v. Carr (1962). Among the political question cases the Court
has identified are those that lack "judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving [them]."

... The question here is whether there is an "appropriate role for the Federal Judiciary" in remedying the problem
of partisan gerrymandering-- whether such claims are claims of legal right, resolvable according to legal princi-
ples, or political questions that must find their resolution elsewhere.

In the leading case of Baker v. Carr (1962), voters in Tennessee complained that the State's districting plan for
state representatives "debase[d]" their votes, because the plan was predicated on a 60-year-old census that no
longer reflected the distribution of population in the State. ... [This Court] identified various considerations rel-
evant to determining whether a claim is a nonjusticiable political question, including whether there is "a lack of
judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it." Baker v. Carr (1962). The Court concluded
that the claim of population inequality among districts did not fall into that category, because such a claim could
be decided under basic equal protection principles. ...

Another line of challenges to districting plans has focused on race. Laws that explicitly discriminate on the basis
of race, as well as those that are race neutral on their face but are unexplainable on grounds other than race,
are of course presumptively invalid. The Court applied those principles to electoral boundaries in Gomillion v.
Lightfoot (1960), concluding that a challenge to an "uncouth twenty-eight sided" municipal boundary line that
excluded black voters from city elections stated a constitutional claim. Gomillion v. Lightfoot (1960) ...

Partisan gerrymandering claims have proved far more difficult to adjudicate. The basic reason is that, while it is
illegal for a jurisdiction to depart from the one-person, one-vote rule, or to engage in racial discrimination in dis-
tricting, "a jurisdiction may engage in constitutional political gerrymandering."

To hold that legislators cannot take partisan interests into account when drawing district lines would essentially
countermand the Framers' decision to entrust districting to political entities. The "central problem" is not deter-
mining whether a jurisdiction has engaged in partisan gerrymandering. It is "determining when political gerry-
mandering has gone too far." Vieth (2004).

In considering whether partisan gerrymandering claims are justiciable, we are mindful of Justice Kennedy's
counsel in Vieth: Any standard for resolving such claims must be grounded in a "limited and precise rationale"
and be "clear, manageable, and politically neutral." Vieth (2004). An important reason for those careful con-
                                                                                                       PARTISAN GERRYMANDERING | 977

straints is that, as a Justice with extensive experience in state and local politics put it, "[t]he opportunity to
control the drawing of electoral boundaries through the legislative process of apportionment is a critical and
traditional part of politics in the United States." Bandemer (1986). An expansive standard requiring "the cor-
rection of all election district lines drawn for partisan reasons would commit federal and state courts to unprece-
dented intervention in the American political process," Vieth (2004).

As noted, the question is one of degree: How to "provid[e] a standard for deciding how much partisan dom-
inance is too much." LULAC (2006). And it is vital in such circumstances that the Court act only in accord
with especially clear standards: "With uncertain limits, intervening courts--even when proceeding with best
intentions--would risk assuming political, not legal, responsibility for a process that often produces ill will and
distrust." Vieth (2004). If federal courts are to "inject [themselves] into the most heated partisan issues" by adju-
dicating partisan gerrymandering claims, Bandemer (1986), they must be armed with a standard that can reliably
differentiate unconstitutional from "constitutional political gerrymandering." Cromartie (1999).

Partisan gerrymandering claims rest on an instinct that groups with a certain level of political support should
enjoy a commensurate level of political power and influence. Explicitly or implicitly, a districting map is alleged
to be unconstitutional because it makes it too difficult for one party to translate statewide support into seats in
the legislature. But such a claim is based on a "norm that does not exist" in our electoral system--"statewide
elections for representatives along party lines." Bandemer (1986).

Partisan gerrymandering claims invariably sound in a desire for proportional representation. As Justice O'Con-
nor put it, such claims are based on "a conviction that the greater the departure from proportionality, the more
suspect an apportionment plan becomes." "Our cases, however, clearly foreclose any claim that the Constitu-
tion requires proportional representation or that legislatures in reapportioning must draw district lines to come
as near as possible to allocating seats to the contending parties in proportion to what their anticipated statewide
vote will be." ...

Unable to claim that the Constitution requires proportional representation out-right, plaintiffs inevitably ask
the courts to make their own political judgment about how much representation particular political parties
deserve--based on the votes of their supporters--and to rearrange the challenged districts to achieve that end.
But federal courts are not equipped to apportion political power as a matter of fairness, nor is there any basis for
concluding that they were authorized to do so. ...

The initial difficulty in settling on a "clear, manageable and politically neutral" test for fairness is that it is not
even clear what fairness looks like in this context. There is a large measure of "unfairness" in any winner-take-
all system. Fairness may mean a greater number of competitive districts. Such a claim seeks to undo packing
and cracking so that supporters of the disadvantaged party have a better shot at electing their preferred candi-
dates. But making as many districts as possible more competitive could be a recipe for disaster for the disadvan-
taged party. As Justice White has pointed out, "[i]f all or most of the districts are competitive ... even a narrow
statewide preference for either party would produce an overwhelming majority for the winning party in the state
legislature." Bandemer (1986).
978 | PARTISAN GERRYMANDERING

On the other hand, perhaps the ultimate objective of a "fairer" share of seats in the congressional delegation is
most readily achieved by yielding to the gravitational pull of proportionality and engaging in cracking and pack-
ing, to ensure each party its "appropriate" share of "safe" seats. Such an approach, however, comes at the expense
of competitive districts and of individuals in districts allocated to the opposing party.

Or perhaps fairness should be measured by adherence to "traditional" districting criteria, such as maintaining
political subdivisions, keeping communities of interest together, and protecting incumbents. But protecting
incumbents, for example, enshrines a particular partisan distribution. And the "natural political geography" of a
State--such as the fact that urban electoral districts are often dominated by one political party--can itself lead to
inherently packed districts. As Justice Kennedy has explained, traditional criteria such as compactness and con-
tiguity "cannot promise political neutrality when used as the basis for relief. Instead, it seems, a decision under
these standards would unavoidably have significant political effect, whether intended or not." Vieth (2004).

Deciding among just these different visions of fairness (you can imagine many others) poses basic questions that
are political, not legal. There are no legal standards discernible in the Constitution for making such judgments,
let alone limited and precise standards that are clear, manageable, and politically neutral. ...

And it is only after determining how to define fairness that you can even begin to answer the determinative
question: "How much is too much?" At what point does permissible partisanship become unconstitutional? If
compliance with traditional districting criteria is the fairness touchstone, for example, how much deviation from
those criteria is constitutionally acceptable and how should map drawers prioritize competing criteria? Should a
court "reverse gerrymander" other parts of a State to counteract "natural" gerrymandering caused, for example,
by the urban concentration of one party? If a districting plan protected half of the incumbents but redistricted
the rest into head to head races, would that be constitutional? A court would have to rank the relative impor-
tance of those traditional criteria and weigh how much deviation from each to allow. ...

If a court instead focused on the respective number of seats in the legislature, it would have to decide the ideal
number of seats for each party and determine at what point deviation from that balance went too far. If a 5-3
allocation corresponds most closely to statewide vote totals, is a 6-2 allocation permissible, given that legislatures
have the authority to engage in a certain degree of partisan gerrymandering? Which seats should be packed and
which cracked? Or if the goal is as many competitive districts as possible, how close does the split need to be
for the district to be considered competitive? Presumably not all districts could qualify, so how to choose? Even
assuming the court knew which version of fairness to be looking for, there are no discernible and manageable
standards for deciding whether there has been a violation. The questions are "unguided and ill suited to the
development of judicial standards," Vieth (2004), and "results from one gerrymandering case to the next would
likely be disparate and inconsistent," (opinion of Kennedy, J.). ...

Excessive partisanship in districting leads to results that reasonably seem unjust. But the fact that such gerryman-
dering is "incompatible with democratic principles," Arizona State Legislature (2015), does not mean that the
solution lies with the federal judiciary. We conclude that partisan gerrymandering claims present political ques-
tions beyond the reach of the federal courts. Federal judges have no license to reallocate political power between
the two major political parties, with no plausible grant of authority in the Constitution, and no legal standards
                                                                                                       PARTISAN GERRYMANDERING | 979

to limit and direct their decisions."[J]udicial action must be governed by standard, by rule," and must be "prin-
cipled, rational, and based upon reasoned distinctions" found in the Constitution or laws. Vieth (2004). Judicial
review of partisan gerrymandering does not meet those basic requirements.

... What the appellees and dissent seek is an unprecedented expansion of judicial power. We have never struck
down a partisan gerrymander as unconstitutional--despite various requests over the past 45 years. The expan-
sion of judicial authority would not be into just any area of controversy, but into one of the most intensely par-
tisan aspects of American political life. That intervention would be unlimited in scope and duration--it would
recur over and over again around the country with each new round of districting, for state as well as federal rep-
resentatives. Consideration of the impact of today's ruling on democratic principles cannot ignore the effect of
the unelected and politically unaccountable branch of the Federal Government assuming such an extraordinary
and unprecedented role.

* * *

No one can accuse this Court of having a crabbed view of the reach of its competence. But we have no com-
mission to allocate political power and influence in the absence of a constitutional directive or legal standards to
guide us in the exercise of such authority."It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to
say what the law is." Marbury v. Madison (1803). In this rare circumstance, that means our duty is to say "this
is not law."

The judgments of the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina and the United
States District Court for the District of Maryland are vacated, and the cases are remanded with instructions to
dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.

Justice KAGAN, with whom Justice GINSBURG, Justice BREYER, and Justice SOTOMAYOR join, dissent-
ing.

For the first time ever, this Court refuses to remedy a constitutional violation because it thinks the task beyond
judicial capabilities.

And not just any constitutional violation. The partisan gerrymanders in these cases deprived citizens of the most
fundamental of their constitutional rights: the rights to participate equally in the political process, to join with
others to advance political beliefs, and to choose their political representatives. In so doing, the partisan ger-
rymanders here debased and dishonored our democracy, turning upside-down the core American idea that all
governmental power derives from the people. These gerrymanders enabled politicians to entrench themselves
in office as against voters' preferences. They promoted partisanship above respect for the popular will. They
encouraged a politics of polarization and dysfunction. If left unchecked, gerrymanders like the ones here may
irreparably damage our system of government.

And checking them is not beyond the courts. The majority's abdication comes just when courts across the coun-
try, including those below, have coalesced around manageable judicial standards to resolve partisan gerryman-
dering claims. Those standards satisfy the majority's own benchmarks. They do not require--indeed, they do
980 | PARTISAN GERRYMANDERING

not permit--courts to rely on their own ideas of electoral fairness, whether proportional representation or any
other. And they limit courts to correcting only egregious gerrymanders, so judges do not become omnipresent
players in the political process. But yes, the standards used here do allow--as well they should--judicial inter-
vention in the worst-of-the-worst cases of democratic subversion, causing blatant constitutional harms. In other
words, they allow courts to undo partisan gerrymanders of the kind we face today from North Carolina and
Maryland. In giving such gerrymanders a pass from judicial review, the majority goes tragically wrong.

... If there is a single idea that made our Nation (and that our Nation commended to the world), it is this one:
The people are sovereign. The "power," James Madison wrote, "is in the people over the Government, and not
in the Government over the people."

Free and fair and periodic elections are the key to that vision. The people get to choose their representatives. And
then they get to decide, at regular intervals, whether to keep them. ... Election day--next year, and two years
later, and two years after that--is what links the people to their representatives, and gives the people their sover-
eign power. That day is the foundation of democratic governance.

And partisan gerrymandering can make it meaningless. At its most extreme--as in North Carolina and Mary-
land--the practice amounts to "rigging elections." Vieth v. Jubelirer (2004) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judg-
ment). By drawing districts to maximize the power of some voters and minimize the power of others, a party in
office at the right time can entrench itself there for a decade or more, no matter what the voters would prefer.
Just ask the people of North Carolina and Maryland. The "core principle of republican government," this Court
has recognized, is "that the voters should choose their representatives, not the other way around." (omitted cita-
tion). Partisan gerrymandering turns it the other way around. By that mechanism, politicians can cherry-pick
voters to ensure their reelection. And the power becomes, as Madison put it, "in the Government over the peo-
ple."

The majority disputes none of this. I think it important to underscore that fact: The majority disputes none
of what I have said (or will say) about how gerrymanders undermine democracy. Indeed, the majority concedes
(really, how could it not?) that gerrymandering is "incompatible with democratic principles." And therefore
what? That recognition would seem to demand a response. The majority offers two ideas that might qualify as
such. One is that the political process can deal with the problem--a proposition so dubious on its face that I feel
secure in delaying my answer for some time. The other is that political gerrymanders have always been with us.
...

That complacency has no cause. Yes, partisan gerrymandering goes back to the Republic's earliest days. (As
does vociferous opposition to it.) But big data and modern technology--of just the kind that the mapmakers
in North Carolina and Maryland used--make today's gerrymandering altogether different from the crude line-
drawing of the past. Old-time efforts, based on little more than guesses, sometimes led to so-called dummyman-
ders-- gerrymanders that went spectacularly wrong. Not likely in today's world. Mapmakers now have access to
more granular data about party preference and voting behavior than ever before. County-level voting data has
given way to precinct-level or city-block-level data; and increasingly, mapmakers avail themselves of data sets pro-
viding wide-ranging information about even individual voters. Just as important, advancements in computing
                                                                                                        PARTISAN GERRYMANDERING | 981

technology have enabled mapmakers to put that information to use with unprecedented efficiency and preci-
sion. While bygone mapmakers may have drafted three or four alternative districting plans, today's mapmakers
can generate thousands of possibilities at the touch of a key--and then choose the one giving their party max-
imum advantage (usually while still meeting traditional districting requirements). The effect is to make gerry-
manders far more effective and durable than before, insulating politicians against all but the most titanic shifts
in the political tides. These are not your grandfather's --let alone the Framers'--gerrymanders.

... What was possible with paper and pen--or even with Windows 95--doesn't hold a candle (or an LED bulb?)
to what will become possible with developments like machine learning. And someplace along this road, "we the
people" become sovereign no longer.

Partisan gerrymandering of the kind before us not only subverts democracy (as if that weren't bad enough). It
violates individuals' constitutional rights as well. That statement is not the lonesome cry of a dissenting Justice.
This Court has recognized extreme partisan gerrymandering as such a violation for many years.

Partisan gerrymandering operates through vote dilution--the devaluation of one citizen's vote as compared to
others. A mapmaker draws district lines to "pack" and "crack" voters likely to support the disfavored party.
He packs supermajorities of those voters into a relatively few districts, in numbers far greater than needed for
their preferred candidates to prevail. Then he cracks the rest across many more districts, spreading them so
thin that their candidates will not be able to win. Whether the person is packed or cracked, his vote carries less
weight--has less consequence-- than it would under a neutrally drawn (non-partisan) map. In short, the map-
maker has made some votes count for less, because they are likely to go for the other party.

That practice implicates the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. The Fourteenth Amendment,
we long ago recognized, "guarantees the opportunity for equal participation by all voters in the election" of legis-
lators. Reynolds v. Sims (1964). And that opportunity "can be denied by a debasement or dilution of the weight
of a citizen's vote just as effectively as by wholly prohibiting the free exercise of the franchise." Based on that
principle, this Court in its one-person-one-vote decisions prohibited creating districts with significantly different
populations. A State could not, we explained, thus "dilut[e] the weight of votes because of place of residence."
The constitutional injury in a partisan gerrymandering case is much the same, except that the dilution is based
on party affiliation. In such a case, too, the districters have set out to reduce the weight of certain citizens' votes,
and thereby deprive them of their capacity to "full[y] and effective[ly] participat[e] in the political process[ ]."
As Justice Kennedy (in a controlling opinion) once hypothesized: If districters declared that they were drawing
a map "so as most to burden [the votes of] Party X's" supporters, it would violate the Equal Protection Clause.
Vieth (2004). For (in the language of the one-person-one-vote decisions) it would infringe those voters' rights to
"equal [electoral] participation." Reynolds (1964).

Though different Justices have described the constitutional harm in diverse ways, nearly all have agreed on this
much: Extreme partisan gerrymandering (as happened in North Carolina and Maryland) violates the Constitu-
tion. ... Once again, the majority never disagrees; it appears to accept the "principle that each person must have
982 | PARTISAN GERRYMANDERING

an equal say in the election of representatives." And indeed, without this settled and shared understanding that
cases like these inflict constitutional injury, the question of whether there are judicially manageable standards for
resolving them would never come up.

So the only way to understand the majority's opinion is as follows: In the face of grievous harm to democratic
governance and flagrant infringements on individuals' rights--in the face of escalating partisan manipulation
whose compatibility with this Nation's values and law no one defends-- the majority declines to provide any
remedy. For the first time in this Nation's history, the majority declares that it can do nothing about an acknowl-
edged constitutional violation because it has searched high and low and cannot find a workable legal standard to
apply. ...

But in throwing up its hands, the majority misses something under its nose: What it says can't be done has
been done. Over the past several years, federal courts across the country--including, but not exclusively, in the
decisions below--have largely converged on a standard for adjudicating partisan gerrymandering claims (strik-
ing down both Democratic and Republican districting plans in the process). And that standard does what the
majority says is impossible. The standard does not use any judge-made conception of electoral fairness--either
proportional representation or any other; instead, it takes as its baseline a State's own criteria of fairness, apart
from partisan gain. And by requiring plaintiffs to make difficult showings relating to both purpose and effects,
the standard invalidates the most extreme, but only the most extreme, partisan gerrymanders. ...

The majority's broadest claim, as I've noted, is that this is a price we must pay because judicial oversight of par-
tisan gerrymandering cannot be "politically neutral" or "manageable." ... Courts, the majority argues, will have
to choose among contested notions of electoral fairness. ... And even once courts have chosen, the majority con-
tinues, they will have to decide "[h]ow much is too much?"--that is, how much deviation from the chosen
"touchstone" to allow? ... In answering that question, the majority surmises, they will likely go far too far. So
the whole thing is impossible, the majority concludes. But it never tries to analyze the serious question presented
here--whether the kind of standard developed below falls prey to those objections, or instead allows for neutral
and manageable oversight. The answer, as you've already heard enough to know, is the latter. That kind of over-
sight is not only possible; it's been done.

Consider neutrality first. Contrary to the majority's suggestion, the District Courts did not have to--and in fact
did not--choose among competing visions of electoral fairness. That is because they did not try to compare the
State's actual map to an "ideally fair" one (whether based on proportional representation or some other crite-
rion). Instead, they looked at the difference between what the State did and what the State would have done if
politicians hadn't been intent on partisan gain. Or put differently, the comparator (or baseline or touchstone) is
the result not of a judge's philosophizing but of the State's own characteristics and judgments. The effects evi-
dence in these cases accepted as a given the State's physical geography (e.g., where does the Chesapeake run?) and
political geography (e.g., where do the Democrats live on top of each other?). So the courts did not, in the major-
ity's words, try to "counteract `natural' gerrymandering caused, for example, by the urban concentration of one
party." Still more, the courts' analyses used the State's own criteria for electoral fairness-- except for naked par-
                                                                                                       PARTISAN GERRYMANDERING | 983

tisan gain. Under their approach, in other words, the State selected its own fairness baseline in the form of its
other districting criteria. All the courts did was determine how far the State had gone off that track because of its
politicians' effort to entrench themselves in office. ...

The majority's "how much is too much" critique fares no better than its neutrality argument. How about the
following for a first-cut answer: This much is too much. By any measure, a map that produces a greater partisan
skew than any of 3,000 randomly generated maps (all with the State's political geography and districting crite-
ria built in) reflects "too much" partisanship. Think about what I just said: The absolute worst of 3,001 possi-
ble maps. The only one that could produce a 10-3 partisan split even as Republicans got a bare majority of the
statewide vote. And again: How much is too much? This much is too much: A map that without any evident
non-partisan districting reason (to the contrary) shifted the composition of a district from 47% Republicans and
36% Democrats to 33% Republicans and 42% Democrats. A map that in 2011 was responsible for the largest par-
tisan swing of a congressional district in the country. Even the majority acknowledges that "[t]hese cases involve
blatant examples of partisanship driving districting decisions." If the majority had done nothing else, it could
have set the line here. How much is too much? At the least, any gerrymanders as bad as these. ...

This Court has long understood that it has a special responsibility to remedy violations of constitutional rights
resulting from politicians' districting decisions. Over 50 years ago, we committed to providing judicial review in
that sphere, recognizing as we established the one-person-one-vote rule that "our oath and our office require no
less." Reynolds (1964). Of course, our oath and our office require us to vindicate all constitutional rights. But
the need for judicial review is at its most urgent in cases like these. "For here, politicians' incentives conflict with
voters' interests, leaving citizens without any political remedy for their constitutional harms." Gill v. Whitford
(2018). Those harms arise because politicians want to stay in office. No one can look to them for effective relief.

... The gerrymanders here--and they are typical of many--violated the constitutional rights of many hundreds
of thousands of American citizens. Those voters (Republicans in the one case, Democrats in the other) did not
have an equal opportunity to participate in the political process. Their votes counted for far less than they should
have because of their partisan affiliation. When faced with such constitutional wrongs, courts must intervene:
"It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is." Marbury v. Madi­
son (1803). That is what the courts below did. ... They used neutral and manageable and strict standards. They
had not a shred of politics about them. Contra the majority, this was law.

That is not to deny, of course, that these cases have great political consequence. They do. Among the amicus
briefs here is one from a bipartisan group of current and former Members of the House of Representatives. They
describe all the ways partisan gerrymandering harms our political system--what they call "a cascade of negative
results." These artificially drawn districts shift influence from swing voters to party-base voters who participate
in primaries; make bipartisanship and pragmatic compromise politically difficult or impossible; and drive voters
away from an ever more dysfunctional political process. Last year, we heard much the same from current and
former state legislators. In their view, partisan gerrymandering has "sounded the death-knell of bipartisanship,"
creating a legislative environment that is "toxic" and "tribal." Gerrymandering, in short, helps create the polar-
ized political system so many Americans loathe.
984 | PARTISAN GERRYMANDERING

And gerrymandering is, as so many Justices have emphasized before, anti-democratic in the most profound
sense. In our government, "all political power flows from the people." Arizona State Legislature (2015). And
that means, as Alexander Hamilton once said, "that the people should choose whom they please to govern
them." But in Maryland and North Carolina they cannot do so. In Maryland, election in and election out, there
are 7 Democrats and 1 Republican in the congressional delegation. In North Carolina, however the political
winds blow, there are 10 Republicans and 3 Democrats. Is it conceivable that someday voters will be able to
break out of that prefabricated box? Sure. But everything possible has been done to make that hard. To create a
world in which power does not flow from the people because they do not choose their governors.

Of all times to abandon the Court's duty to declare the law, this was not the one. The practices challenged in
these cases imperil our system of government. Part of the Court's role in that system is to defend its foundations.
None is more important than free and fair elections. With respect but deep sadness, I dissent.
